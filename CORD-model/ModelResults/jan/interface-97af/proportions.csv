Traveling is a natural need of a human to fulfill their basic activities and needs of daily life (Lopez, 2003) . The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic is a global concern after its first outbreak in Wuhan city of China and the largest by its coverage and death as compared to 2012, the first epidemic in Saudi Arabia (Mahase, 2020) .The virus continues to spread and was declared as an emergency health condition by the World Health Organization. Currently globally, there are 30,367,850 confirmed cases, 950,821 deaths, and 22,052,941 recoveries, and in Ethiopia, there are 1060 deaths (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) .The virus is too contagious and transmits to humans through respiratory droplets, physical contact, and surface contact, and patients were both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The incubation period of the virus was a 1-week (2-14 days) period, which was a base for the quarantine period of duration for suspected cases and confirmed cases (WHO, 2020; Rehman, 2020) .Ethiopian Ministry of Health works on controlling the spreading virus at transport services, such as decreasing the number of passengers at each transport type to the extent of 50% of the previous number of passengers and legal punishment among those who were not using a face mask. Another important measure was the use of sanitizer during the entry to bus and daily disinfecting the seats of each passenger (Shigute, 2020) .Social distancing is the principal way of prevention method to control the transmission from human to human, including a 1-m distance of talk and staying away from people. However, these measures have a significant impact on passengers using different types of public transport for achieving their day-to-day activities ( Beam and Kim, 2020; Culp, 2020) As per my knowledge, there are no published studies done in low-and middle-level countries about public transport user's level of anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of general anxiety disorder and its associated factor among public transport users in relation to the new COVID-19 pandemic. This study result might be used as a reference for future studies and also for generating appropriate mental health crisis management among communities using public transport in response to the pandemic.This community based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 15-25, 2020, at Addis Ababa city, the capital city of Ethiopia, and most cases were confirmed. In the city, there are 300 buses were giving service for the one-third population of the city (2 million people).Inclusion Criteria: All peoples age 18 + and living in the city.Exclusion Criteria: Respondents who were not able to respond to the interview (unable to hear and respond with the asked language, hearing problem, acutely or severely ill).To calculate the sample size, we used a single proportion formula of a cross-sectional study design. The proportion value (P) from the previous study done in China on the same epidemic (53.8%) (Wang, 2020) was taken for the calculation. P = 0.54%, q = 1 − p, 0.46. where n = required sample size, n = Z (α/2) 2 pq/d2, p = 0. A stratified sampling technique was used to select the bus from the three types of bus (Anebessa bus, Sheger bus, and Higer bus). ""Anebessa"" bus was serving for 100 people and travel up to 6 km, ""Sheger bus"" was serving 50 people and travel up to 4 km, and ""Higer bus"" was serving for 40 people and travel up to 2 km. Proportionate stratification formula, nh = (Nh/N) × n (nh = required sample, Nh = total sample size of each stratum, N = total population size, n = total sample size), was used to select the required number of the sample from each selected bus. Finally, simple random sampling with a lottery method was used to select each respondent from each selected bus. The ticket number was used as the sampling frame for the study. n (Anebessa bus) = N (Anebessa bus total population stratum)/total population size × sample size = (300/570) × 420 = 221 n (Sheger bus) = N (Sheger bus total population the stratum)/total population size × sample size = (150/570) × 420 = 111 n (Higer bus) = N (Higer bus total population the stratum)/total population size × sample size = (120/570) × 420 = 88 (Fig. 1 ).All questionnaires were translated into Amharic and then to English, and finally, the Amharic version of the questioner was used for data collection.General Anxiety Disorder: The first part of the questioner was GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scale to assess the subject's anxiety symptoms. The GAD-7 assessment tool was validated and used in previous Ethiopia studies. It has seven items used to assess the frequency of anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (nearly every day) and ranging from 0 to 21, and score > 9 scores defined as had general anxiety disorder (Maideen et al., 2015) .Current Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) About the Coronavirus. It was a 12-item questioner used to measure the knowledge, attitude, and practice of respondents towards COVID-19. During pretest, the Cronbach's alpha for this tool was 0.83 (Zhong et al., 2020) .Dependent Variable: General anxiety disorder.Independent Variables: Age, sex, educational status, occupational status, family size, having a child less than five years, and knowledge, attitude, and practice about the coronavirus.The carefully prepared questioner and training manual was used for data collection and training for data collectors about the aims of the study, formats the questionnaire, how to interview, and gather data from the respondents. The issues of privacy and confidentiality were discussed during the training manual. The structured interviews were administered for each respondent and collected all the required information.Data was entered into the Epi-Data 3.4 software package and exported to the Statistical Package for Social Science version 22. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) and cross-tabulation calculated to see the distribution of study variables among study participants. The logistic regression analysis (5%CI, p < 0.05) was used for determining the predictors of the outcome variable.The mean age onset of the respondents was 32 years of age, and half of respondents had more than three family sizes; the average monthly income was 1000 ETB (Table 1) .More than two thirds of the respondents were not using face mask to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic transmission (Table 2) . Out of all respondents enrolled in the study, 128 (30.7%) of them developed clinically significant generalized anxiety disorder (scored > 9/21) as a result of the current pandemic (COVID-19).Variables associated with the outcome variable during multivariant logistic regression at 95% CI were female gender, daily labor, no face mask use, and more than three family sizes (Table 3) .This study aimed to measure the magnitude of general anxiety disorder among public transport users during the initial phase of the pandemic, and 128 (30.7%) of them developed generalized anxiety disorder in response to the new COVID-19. This study finding was lower than the community studies done in China, 53.8% (Wang, 2020) . It might be due to the difference in literacy about coronavirus, income for using personal protective equipment, and the tool used to measure current mental status .This study result was higher than the studies conducted among health professionals in India (25.3%) (Wilson et al., 2020) and Saudi-Arabia (7.3%). The public transport users had a chance of being worried and stressed due to the susceptibility for physical contact and inadequate access to personal protective materials, including sanitizers and handwashing facilities, which all result in fear of contracting the disease.According to this study finding, being female had 3.68 (2.43, 5.57) times more likely to experience a general anxiety disorder, which was similar to the study done in Spain (Gómez-Salgado et al., 2020) and India (Ahmad et al., 2020) . Females have frequent traveling history and responsibility for achieving the day-to-day activities outside the home and contribute to the risk of contracting infection due contact with different people by bus.This study identified that those with daily labor occupation had 3.78 (1.78-8.06) times more likely to develop GAD as compared with other groups of jobs and evidenced in Russia (Kartseva and Kuznetsova, 2020) . Daily laborers have a high susceptibility contacting infection due to their job situation of close contact with co-workers. Besides, they were not able to buy face masks and other safety preventive measures for the prevention of self and their family.The current family size of respondents has an impact on the development of general anxiety disorder, and those with more than three family sizes had 3.34 (1.65-6.75) times more likely to develop GAD, which was supported by the study done in India (Ahmad et al., 2020) . As the number of family size increases, their chance of contact with different people also increases, which contributes to getting infected due to its contagious nature, and their worry becomes very significant for fear of contracting the infection.The last determinant variable for GAD was current face mask use, and those who did not use a face mask for prevention had 4.47 times (2.87-6.95) more likely to develop a general anxiety disorder, which was similar to the study done in China (Ying et al., 2020) . The use of a face mask enhances awareness, knowledge, and information about prevention measures, which contribute to the feeling of psychological preparedness to prevent themselves and their families.The current study found that one thirds of the respondents had general anxiety disorder. The predictors for the outcome variable were being female, daily labor, more than three family sizes, and no face mask use. Therefore, public transport users' needs immediate mental health intervention from responsible government and private health sector organizations to reassure the passenger's psychological health. The government should provide supportive preventive materials such as face mask, glove soap, and alcohol for public transport users, especially for those with more than three family size and daily labor. The public transport service providers should prepare a relaxing, comfortable, and allocate enough number of the bus for the passengers to serve effectively through keeping safety measures of the prevention. The mental health professional should teach via accessible social media about how to cope with the current pandemic and lifestyle measures, which are helpful to increase immunity, including exercise, diet, and regular sleep.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-04",1

The Egyptian protocol includes doing a non-contrast CT chest for patients with suspicious respiratory symptoms. However, many patients with worsened symptoms especially during the second week of disease showed symptoms of thrombotic events of pulmonary arteries, and that is why CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) became recommended by multiple reports [1] .Association with elevated levels of D-dimer has been found in many patients with pulmonary embolism especially severely ill patients in intensive care units (ICU). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for those patients with worsened symptoms and elevated laboratory indicators of coagulopathy [2] .Many reports emerged in the literature showing an increased incidence of a pulmonary embolism (PE) at segmental and subsegmental levels. The percentage was 30% in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 1% in critically ill patients without COVID-19 disease [3] .Another study showed that 23% of CTPA performed at their institution were positive for PE. Those were diagnosed on average 12 days after onset of symptoms and most of them required ICU admission [4] .Most studies showed that patients with high body mass index (BMI) are more prone to embolic events. Those studies were trying to link thrombotic events to the severity of the disease, elevated D-dimer, and patient weight and associated diseases rather than a complication of hospitalization [5] .CT pulmonary angiography not only can assess the presence of pulmonary embolus but also can assess the severity of the embolus as well as heart function and strain on the right ventricle. Thus, we can predict the need for ICU admission and patient outcome [6] .This study aimed to assess the presence of PE in patients with COVID-19 infection with severe respiratory symptoms and to evaluate the relation to disease severity on CT as well as laboratory indicators as D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and lymphocyte count. This is may help in more understanding, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19 infection.This was a retrospective study that was approved in our institutional ethical review board with the written consent waived. The authors had access to the data with no conflict of interest to declare. The study was conducted from March 1 till July 31.The study was conducted on 96 patients at one of the University Hospitals in Cairo, Egypt.All patients with COVID-19 infection proved by positive PCR who underwent CT pulmonary angiography. No age or sex predilection. Available patients' complaints and laboratory data at the time of CTPA scanning.We excluded patients with unavailable PCR results, as well as patients with no data about the clinical condition and unavailable laboratory results.Patients' preparation: Patients were required to fast for 4 h, and normal kidney function was needed using serum creatinine as a reference. Adequate hydration was instructed before and after the procedure. An 18-20-gauge cannula was inserted into the antecubital vein. CT machine: 80-slice CT machine (Prime Aquilion, Toshiba, USA) and Dual-source CT (Somatom Definition, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany). The infection control parameters were applied under the guidance of the hospital infection control unit. The patients were scanned in a supine position with the arm above the head. A breath-hold was requested from the patients trying to avoid respiratory motion artifact. A region over interest was drawn on the main pulmonary artery. Bolus IV injection of nonionic contrast medium (Ultravist 370) 1.2 ml/kg was used at rate 4 ml/s using injector pump (Medrad injector) followed by 40 ml saline at rate 4 ml/s. CT parameters: The scan area extended from diaphragm to lung apex with scan time used = 10 s. The tube voltage was 140/80 KVP and tube current: 51/213 mAs. Rotation time was 0.33 s, 0.75 mm thickness, 0.7 reconstruction increment (mm), and 0.7 Pitch. Image processing and interpretation: The images were transferred to the workstation where the axial cuts and multi-planar reformation were reviewed by two radiologists experienced in chest imaging with at least 5 years of experience. They were blinded to the aim of the study and the clinical condition of the patients or the laboratory results. The following items were fulfilled: -Presence or absence of pulmonary embolism. If positive pulmonary embolism, site if unilateral or bilateral and extent if segmental, lobar, or main arterial. -CT probability of COVD-19 infection according to RSNA recommendations [7] . -CT severity score for COVID-19 infection: The lung was divided into five lobes and was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5. Score 0 if no CT evidence of pulmonary involvement; score 1 if the pulmonary involvement was less than 5%; score 2 if 5-25%; score 3 if 26-49%; score 4 if 50-75%; and score 5 if more than 75%. The highest total CT score was 25. -Presence or absence of CT progression comparing the CTPA with the last available study regarding the parenchymal involvement.The patients were divided according to the CTPA results into two groups: a group with positive PE and a group with negative PE.The clinical and laboratory data included the following:-The timing of the CTPA after the onset of the symptoms. -The main complaint at the time of CTPA scanning.-The laboratory results including the WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer level, ferritin, and CRP levels. All laboratory results included must be within 24 h from the time of CTPA.Using PASS 11 program for sample size calculation, confidence level 95%, and a margin of error ± 0.1 and by reviewing previous study results by Grillet et al. [4] showed the rate of pulmonary embolism among COVID-19-positive patients (23%); based on that, the required sample size will be 76 patients with COVID-19 to be sufficient to estimate the rate of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients.All the data were collected, compared, and analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics (V. 26.0, IBM Corp., USA, 2019) for data analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± SD for quantitative parametric measures in addition to median and percentiles for quantitative nonparametric measures and both number and percentage for categorized data. The following tests were done:1. Comparison between two independent groups for non-parametric data using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 2. Chi-square test to study the association between every 2 variables or comparison between 2 independent groups as regards the categorized data. The probability of error at 0.05 was considered significant, while at 0.01 and 0.001 are highly significant.The female patients. No significant difference was found between the incidence of pulmonary embolism and the patients' age and sex. The main complaint at the time of CTPA was progressive dyspnea detected in 64 patients (66.7%). Although progressive dyspnea was the highest in incidence regarding the complaint at the time of CTPA scanning, yet it showed no significant relationship with the incidence of PE. However, oxygen desaturation, chest pain, and hemoptysis showed a statistically significant relationship with the incidence of PE being significantly higher between patients with positive PE (Table 1) .Patients with positive PE showed higher D-dimer and CRP levels and lower lymphocytic counts compared to the patients with negative PE. However, no significant relation was found between the level of the D-dimer, ferritin, CRP, WBC count, neutrophil, and lymphocyte count and the incidence of PE (Table 2) . However, a highly significant correlation was found between the incidence of PE and the rising in the D-dimer level ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ).The median time for CTPA was 9 days for patients with negative PE and 12 days for patients with positive PE with no statistically significant relationship found between the timing of CTPA and incidence of PE (Table 2) . CT with typical criteria for COVID-19 infection was the highest in the two groups yet with no significant relationship found between the COVID-19 probability as reported in CT guided by the RSNA criteria and the incidence of PE (Table 1 ). The median CT severity score of the COVID-19 was statistically insignificant lower between patients with positive PE (Table 2) . However, Progressive CT findings compared to the previous CT showed a highly significant correlation with the incidence of PE (Table 1, Fig. 1 ).Twenty-eight patients representing 70% showed unilateral PE while the rest 12 (30%) of the patients showed bilateral PE. Also, 30 patients (75%) showed PE involving the segmental branches while the rest 10 (25%) showed lobar and segmental branches involvement. Positive RV strain was noted only in 3 cases (7.5%) (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5 ).The current study focused on highlighting the relationship between the incidence of pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 disease severity either laboratory or by the CT severity score trying to help in early anticipation, diagnosis, and treatment of complicated COVID-19 infection cases. The study included 96 patients with COVID-19 infection and suspected to have PE, out of which 40 were positive; meaning 41.7% of patients with suspected PE. The most common symptom was worsening dyspnea with an incidence of 66.7% in this study population. However, it was not statistically significant. The statistically significant symptoms were oxygen desaturation, chest pain, and hemoptysis. A similar study by Kaminetzky et al. [8] showed a PE incidence of 37% which is close to our study. This was higher than Poyiadji et al. [5] who found a 22% incidence of PE between their study group, yet they are also similar to our study which concluded no significant difference in age and gender regarding the incidence of PE.In this article, we studied the relationship between the D-dimer, ferritin, CRP, WBC count, neutrophil, and lymphocyte count and the incidence of PE which was found insignificant although patients with positive PE Fig. 1 The incidence of rising D-dimer level and the progressive CT findings between the patients with positive and negative pulmonary embolism (PE) according to CTPA interpretation showed higher levels of D-dimer and CRP compared to the patients with negative PE. Also, the rising D-dimer was found to be highly significant. This mandates incorporation of the follow-up of D-dimer in the management of patients. This could explain the result demonstrated by Kamunetzky et al. [8] that concluded that only a significant indicator was the D-dimer closest to the incidence of PE. Another study by Garcia-Olivé et al. [9] demonstrated that patients with high levels of D-dimer have a higher probability of developing PE. Poyiadji et al. [5] concluded an increase in the D-dimer level of 6 μg/ml had an odds ratio of 2.7 for developing a PE. However, in controversy to our study, they found a significant difference not only with D-dimer but also with CRP. The patients with high D-dimer and high CRP were more susceptible to develop PE. All these inflammatory markers are alarming the use of anticoagulants as advised by many authors [10] [11] [12] .The median time to develop PE was found to be 12 days; however, that was statistically insignificant. The duration of illness in our opinion could raise a flag to continuous follow-up of other alarming symptoms and serial measures of D-dimer. The duration in the study done by Garcia-Olivé et al. [9] was 9.7 which is in keeping with our results. This is also similar to Grillet et al. [4] who diagnosed PE at a mean of 12 days from the onset of the symptoms.The severity of infection detected by CT severity score calculation was found to be not significant with the incidence of PE which is similar to the results concluded by Bompard et al. [1] . However, the progression of the disease was found to be highly significant with the incidence of PE and this was against Bompard et al. [1] who found the higher incidence of CT progression among patients with negative PE. Again, the follow-up of critically ill patients is considered the key to early diagnosis and life-saving for those critically ill patients.The incidence of segmental PE was higher among our study population with only 3 cases representing 7.5% of the positive cases developed RV strain. This is almost close to the results found by Poyiadji et al. [5] who found more incidence of segmental PE (51% of cases) and the RV strain occurred in 11% of the patients under study.Our study had few limitations; first, a retrospective study was done in one center, and larger multicentric studies are needed to further understand the nature of this novel complex illness and better manage the second wave. We did not include anticoagulation in our study which will be done in future studies.We conclude from our study that for PE to occur during COVID-19 infection, several factors are associated which include disease progression with worsening symptoms as hemoptysis, oxygen desaturation, and chest pain. Rising D-dimer during the second week of disease which all are alert to do CT pulmonary angiography to exclude or confirm PE. This also raises the utmost need for anticoagulation prophylactically.

By genome sequencing, the virus was recognized [1] . From Wuhan City, the virus spread globally. The pandemic situation is declared by the World Health Organization [2] . In Egypt, the first case was detected on 14 February 2020, for a foreigner. After nearly 2 weeks, the Egyptian cases were detected [3] .COVID-19 clarified as a highly transmissible disease. The clinical features varied with disease severity. Most COVID-19 patients have non-severe manifestations and show a good prognosis. However, patients with severe disease may progress to pulmonary dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction, and death [4] . COVID-19 related to a considerable mortality rate in older patients and cases had other morbidities [5] .In other coronaviruses, studies suggested that the inflammatory storm is a common finding [6] . Similarly, increases in the inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were described in COVID-19 [7] . Albumin levels decreased in the inflammatory conditions; reduced levels were confirmed in severe COVID-19 patients [8] . Hypoalbuminemia and high CRP/albumin ratio were previously linked to the mortality of various clinical conditions as critically ill patients [9] .To avoid the unnecessary or inappropriate utilization of the healthcare resources, early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 will be helpful. Severity prediction will also improve the prognosis by reducing the mortality rate [10] . Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the role of inflammatory markers in estimating the severity and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. This study hypothesized that elevated values of IL-6, CRP, and CRP/ albumin ratio at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.In June 2020, a cohort study was carried out on patients from Zagazig University Hospitals. The subjects' participation was confirmed by signing the consent form either by the patient or the first degree relatives. The protocol of this study was affirmed by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Human Medicine, Zagazig University (approval number: 6250). The patients were evaluated by full history and clinical examinations. The disease severity was assessed. At the time of diagnosis, measured and calculated laboratory tests were done. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality.The Epi Info program 6 (Atlanta, Ga, USA) was the utilized program for sample size estimation. The percentage of exposure and the outcome of either exposed or non-exposed groups were calculated following the study of Liu et al. [11] with 95% statistical power and 95% confidence limit. A total of 116 consecutive confirmed patients were included. The diagnosis and severity classification criteria were performed as stated by the management protocol of COVID-19 released by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population (2020). All included patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive ones based on the presence of viral nucleic acid in the nasopharyngeal swab. By disease severity, patients were subgrouped. The patient considered as severe one if at least a single criterion of these criteria was present [increased respiration rate/minute > 30 or reduced oxygen saturation at room air < 92% or decreased partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300 mmHg or a chest lesion > 50% or a rapid advancement of chest damage within 24-48 h]. The critically ill patients were considered if their respiration rate/minute is > 30 or have reduced oxygen saturation < 92% or have decreased partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 200 mmHg; despite oxygen therapy. Both severe and critically ill cases were included in the severe group. The patients were divided into two groups, including 99 patients in the non-severe group and 17 cases in the severe one (Fig. 1) .In BD® Plus Plastic Serum vacutainer, blood samples were obtained. The plain vacutainers were allowed to clot for 30 min after collection. After this period, samples were centrifuged at 1200×g for 10 min to separate serum. The analysis of CRP and albumin was performed immediately. The remaining serum was transferred in 1.5-mL sterile microcentrifuge tubes and stored at −80°C until IL-6 analysis.CRP and albumin were quantified using the CRP and albumin LR kits, respectively (Gesan Production Kit, Campobello di Mazara, Trapani, Italy). These biochemical tests were performed according to the manufacturer's steps on the Microlab 300 (ELITech Group, France). IL-6 was quantified by Human IL-6 ELISA Kit (Bioassay Technology Laboratory, Shanghai, China) [Catalog No.: E0090Hu]. The assay steps were done according to the manufacturer's procedure. The readings were done using the BioTek ELx800 Absorbance Microplate Readers (Bio-Tek Instruments, USA). The IL-6 levels were expressed in pg/mL. The precision coefficients of this IL-6 kit were an intra-assay CV of less than 10% and an inter-assay CV of less than 12%.The calculated ratio was estimated using the following equation: ""CRP/Albumin ratio = CRP level/Albumin level.""Data were checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test, a nonparametrically distribution was found. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used for two groups' comparison. The performance of the laboratory test was evaluated by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The optimal cutoff point was established by the highest Youden's index. The Logistic Regression Analysis was utilized to clarify the predictors by measuring the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The outcome evaluation was performed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank tests, and the Coxregression analysis. The accepted statistically significant value was a P value of less than 0.05. SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized.A total of 116 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Patients were assigned to the severe (14.7%) and non-severe (85.3%) groups. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients according to severity were presented in Table 1 . The severe group had significantly higher values of patients' age and smoking percent than the non-severe group. The most prevalent symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and bone ache. The severe patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea and chest tightness than that of non-severe patients. Severe patients were more likely to have co-morbidities in comparison with non-severe patients. In this cohort, eight patients (6.9%) died in the hospital. No mortality was detected among those with the non-severe disease.The laboratory findings of the studied patients at the time of diagnosis are presented in Table 2 ; the patients were sub-grouped according to the COVID-19 severity. Severe patients had higher levels of IL-6, CRP, and CRP/ albumin ratio. On the other hand, the levels of albumin were decreased in severe ones.The role of laboratory tests in discriminating the severity of COVID-19 was evaluated. The ROC curve analysis was utilized. Non-severe patients were considered negative and severe patients as positive. The area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) was assessed (Fig. 2) . IL-6 is the most sensitive predictor of COVID-19 severity. The performance criteria of the laboratory markers were presented in Table 2 .Further evaluation of the association between IL-6 and COVID-19 severity was performed by Logistic Regression Analysis (Table 3 ). IL-6 had OR of 87.7 (95% CI = 18.9-408.2) (P < 0.0001). Three models of adjustment were proposed. Model-1 adjustment utilizes the other significant laboratory tests includes CRP, CRP-albumin ratio, and albumin. In model 2, IL-6 had an adjusted OR of 79.1 (95% CI = 10.6-588.1). Model 2 was the adjustment for demographic and clinical data includes age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chest diseases, thyroid diseases, cardiac diseases, dyspnea, chest tightness, and ansomia. IL-6 had an adjusted OR of 38.9 (95% CI = 2.6-589). Model-3 adjustment included all variables used in model 1 and model 2, and IL-6 had an adjusted OR of 30.8 (95% CI = 1.1-728.3) (P = 0.046). So, IL-6 can be an independent predictor of COVID-19 severity.During the follow-up period, eight patients died (6.9%). The follow-up period for the mortality data was varied between 1 and 30 days, with a median of 14 days. The overall survival of all patients was 93.1%. Regarding patient's age, non-survivors had significant higher values than survivor (63.5 [31-88] and 37 respectively; P = 0.003). Also, the prevalence of co-morbidities in non-survivors was significantly higher than survivors (87.5% and 31.5%, respectively; P = 0.001).The importance of laboratory tests in detecting the COVID-19 mortality was assessed by ROC curve analysis. The laboratory tests had the highest ROC-AUC were CRP/albumin ratio, CRP, and IL-6. The ROC-AUC values were 0.955, 0.939, and 0.923, respectively. CRP/albumin ratio is the sensitive predictor of COVID-19 mortality (Fig. 3a) . At CRP/albumin ratio value of 11.4 (the highest Youden's index = 0.8), CRP/albumin ratio can predict mortality outcome. The COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups according to their serum CRP/ albumin ratio values levels (low ratio group ≤ 11.4 and high ratio group > 11.4). The 30-day mortality rates were 0.99% and 46.7% in a group of low ratios and high ones, respectively. The overall survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig. 3b) , it showed lower survival in patients with elevated CRP/albumin ratios (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). The Cox Regression Analysis showed that a high CRP/albumin ratio of > 11.4 was associated with COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio = 59.9, 95% CI = 7.4-488.3, and P < 0.0001). High CRP/albumin ratio had an adjusted hazard ratio of 26.5 (95% CI = 2.6-270.7, P = 0.006) after adjustment of age and presence of comorbidities. So, the CRP/albumin ratio could be a significant independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 mortality.This study provided the baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients. About 14.7% of the studied cohort fulfills the criteria of severe cases. The percentage of severe cases was comparable to the published risk of severity percentage [12] . The current study found that severe and non-survivor patients were elderly. The age of the patients is associated with worse disease progress and a higher mortality rate [13] . The smoking percentage was higher in severe cases. In the same line, Guo [14] revealed by a meta-analysis that smoking was associated with COVID-19 severity. Co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and chest diseases were prevalent in severe and non-survivor cases. This finding is in agreement with that of Yang et al. [15] . In this study, the most prevalent symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and bone ache. Dyspnea, chest tightness, and anosmia were the clinically significant discriminator between the non-severe and severe groups. The main symptom among COVID-19 cases was fever. Fever was presented in nearly eighty percent of the cases [16] . The second prevalent symptom was coughing [17] . The severe patient had a higher prevalence of dyspnea. Dyspnea seems to be a marker of severity [18] . Other detected symptoms include headache, fatigue, sore throat, and gastrointestinal symptoms were varying in prevalence [19] .The mortality rate in 30-day follow up was 6.9%. High mortality was significant in older age cases and the presence of co-morbidities. This mortality rate does not reflect the real population mortality rate due to the absence of population screening that underestimates the total number of patients [20] .This study aimed to evaluate the role of laboratory markers at the time of diagnosis in estimating the severity and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. As far as the researcher knows, this study is the first to evaluate the role of CRP/albumin ratio in COVID-19 mortality prediction. This study showed that severe patients had significantly higher values of CRP, CRP/albumin ratio, and IL-6. On the other hand, the albumin levels decreased in the severe ones. ROC curve analysis revealed that the best discriminator of disease severity was IL-6 while CRP/albumin ratio was the best predictor of adverse outcome.CRP is considered a sensitive biomarker of infection, inflammation, and tissue damage. During the acute inflammatory responses, the CRP level increases rapidly [21] . CRP suggested as an efficient marker in assessing COVID-19 severity [22] . This study revealed that CRP was associated with disease severity and clinical outcome. But IL-6 and CRP/albumin ratio performed better than CRP in predicting disease severity and adverse outcome.The inflammatory reaction plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The proinflammatory cytokine increased in the peripheral blood of the patients [23] . The National Health Commission of China (trial 7th version) approves that peripheral blood IL-6 level increased during COVID-19 infection [24] . IL-6 was defined as an acute-phase inflammatory cytokine; its serum level reflects the degree of lung inflammation [25] . The current study assessed the IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients. The patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of IL-6 in comparison with non-severe patients. Regards IL-6 diagnostic performance criteria, IL-6 seems to be a useful marker for early recognition of severe disease. IL-6 showed significantly predictive power even after adjustment to different models that include clinical and laboratory significant parameters. So, IL-6 can be considered as an independent predictor of COVID-19 severity. A meta-analysis was performed on nine studies to evaluate the role of IL-6 in assessing the COVID-19 severity. A significantly higher serum IL-6 levels were confirmed in patients with severe COVID-19 in comparison to non-severe ones [26] . These findings support that viral infection mediates lung injury via cytokines effects [27] .In this study, CRP levels alone can predict the mortality in patients with COVID-19. Significant hypoalbuminemia is detected in non-survivors COVID-19 patients. Reduced serum albumin level was associated with an increased mortality rate [28] . The CRP/albumin ratio was studied previously as a prognostic marker in critically ill patients with infections and malignancy [29] . This study showed lower survival in patients had high CRP/albumin ratios. However, albumin and CRP levels alternation may be due to the associated chronic illness [30] . Cox Regression Analysis showed that a high CRP/albumin ratio was associated with COVID-19 mortality even after adjustment to age and presence of co-morbidities. So, the CRP/albumin ratio could be a significant independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 mortality.The current study had some limitations. First, this study was a single-center study, so further studies are required to include multiple centers with a much number of participants. Second, this study design was a cohort that lacks a control group. Lastly, the changes in the levels of the markers over time were not part of this study design, so further studies are recommended to assess their dynamic change. Future studies are suggested to confirm this study's results.IL-6 level could effectively discriminate COVID-19 severity. CRP/albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. IL-6 and CRP/albumin ratio seem to be valuable biomarkers in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19, respectively. High levels of the biomarkers require more attention that will enable better management. ","Egypt","first author","2021-01-14",1

Many of these studies have used assessment tools, such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) [7, 8, 9] , to assess the efficacy of these changes, where such drastic changes have been regarded over many years of studies. As such, with the FCI now considered as a de facto standard for assessing the conceptual basis of Newtonian mechanics, and a gain when comparing these test results both before and after an introductory mechanics course of approximately 25% [10, 11] as a benchmark for standard performance in a course's approach, we can now ask the question of what happens when the pedagogical approach is forcibly changed during the semester, with no forewarning to either the lecturers or the students.Whilst this study has been conducted for only one year worth of data, where as mentioned above, usual analyses of such changes in pedagogy are conducted over years, during the 2020 lockdown experienced in South Africa as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were presented with a unique opportunity to test the resilience of this assessment tool, as well as the effects such sudden changes could have on the usual gains in a first year mechanics course. As such, our study was conducted with a very diverse group of first year students enrolled in the University of Johannesburg (UJ), Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment (FEBE), whose demographics (average 2015 -2019) range as follows: African 92.8%; White 3.8%; Indian 2.3%; Coloured 1.1% [12] . Yet for such a diverse background, the gains appear to have remained comparable to the bench-marked studies of the last three decades.Given the necessary switch to online platforms, such as Blackboard [13] , we are also able to study the engagement of students within this online learning environment (through their attendance and marks on continuous assessments). This also includes the time taken to complete various assessment tasks.It may be considered somewhat surprising that even with the above-mentioned change in pedagogy, we found no appreciable change in the FCI gain across this course (see later comments). In seeking to break this down we shall look at a number of factors, including the previously studied Gender Gap [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] , where there has been a resulting gender difference in favour of males in the student performance on standardised assessments, such as the FCI in previous studies. However, our results indicate this does not seem to be the case here. Another aspect at play here could be the increased peer scaffolding (along the lines of Mazur's peer evaluation [21] ) as there had been an increased reliance on discussion groups with peers, due to the COVID lockdown. This persisted into the second semester, as was highlighted by the perspectives of the mechanics lecturers, where a range of discussion boards, interactive tutorials, and WhatsApp groups were still used. As presented in Table 1 , it can be seen that the scores for the average semester 2 mark for both 2019 and 2020, which includes a combination of coursework, practicals and exams, were not appreciably different. The only noticeable difference was in the number of students who passed after the November exam, or the course throughput, where explained in the table caption, in 2020 a slightly lower semester mark was used to gain entrance to the final exam.Given these motivations our paper shall be presented as follows: In section 2 we shall detail the methodology of our study, followed by the analysis tools and techniques used in this study in section 3, along with supporting appendices, and finally we shall conclude in section 4. The subjects for our testing were the 2020 first year cohort of engineering students at the University of Johannesburg. The class consisted of approximately 400 students.The course was initially taught as a traditional lecture based course, with a weekly online assessment, fortnightly tutorials and fortnightly practicals (these being done in person in groups of approximately 30 students with graduate students acting as tutors and demonstrators of the practicals). The academic year had begun in early February of 2020, where the pre-mechanics course FCI test was conducted in late February on N = 256 students. † The end result of the FCI is defined by the normalised gain G [10] : where %S f and %S i are the final and initial scores respectively. We found that for this cohort (for paired data) N = 48 the average gain was at 24%. We will comment further on these results in Sec. 3.1.First we should note that South Africa was placed in a hard lockdown in mid-March 2020, and teaching was switched within the period of a few weeks to a purely online format. Lectures were replaced with recorded video content, and online platforms for engagement with students were employed (such as consultations using BlackBoard Collaborate Ultra, and WhatsApp discussion groups). As the easing of the lockdown occurred towards the end of the mechanics course, a post-FCI test was possible to administer to a smaller voluntary group of students, of which N = 48 had done the pre-test.Note that online teaching in a similar manner continued into the second semester (where the physics syllabus covers electromagnetism and optics), where one of the authors was a lecturer for this course. As such, continued performance could also be assessed for these students over the entirety of their first year physics studies, as well as conducting an online survey with these students for their perspectives of the course and their feelings of success or failure. It should also be noted that the authors of this study are actively taking part in the running, teaching and tutoring of the students. Hence, we can also provide the perspectives of the lecturers of this course, and those of the tutors involved, including the stresses of changing the teaching format mid-semester.The methodology employed to unpack this collected data relied primarily on standard statistical parameters, including the mean, standard deviation, percent differences, p-values for the t-test difference of means, and correlations through R [22, 23] and a spreadsheet. ‡ Using our data from this cohort in Sec. 3 we shall investigate:(i) student performance from pre-test to post-test, including an analysis of their performance in the pre-and post-tests via a question breakdown, see Sec. 3.1, (ii) the existence of a polarisation effect in 6 particular questions [25] , see Sec. 3.2, (iii) a possible gender difference in the FCI for paired data, see Sec. 3.3,(iv) and a discussion of student and staff surveys, where as is usual we used a Likert scale [26] , see Sec. 3.4.In this section we first present some analyses of the distribution of the scores for students in the pre-and post-tests (N = 256), starting in the left panel of Fig. 1 (where the right ‡ Interested readers who wish to familiarise themselves with the basics of statistical analysis, including the t-test, correlation, ANOVA, and measures of variation (e.g. standard deviation and standard error of the mean), among others, may want to consult Refs. [22, 24] . Table 2 : Mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum % marks as displayed in Fig. 1 . The paired data consisted of a subset (N = 48) of the N = 256 who sat either the pre-or post test.panel is for the paired data, N = 48). The difference in distributions (pre-compared to post-test) have well defined shifts indicating a gain, particularly for the paired data. In Table 2 the results for the pre-and post-test scores can be seen. The gain of G = 0.24 was calculated from the paired data and is the expected gain for a standard physics course [10] . The difference in mean scores was checked via the paired samples t-test (N = 48) and was not due to random fluctuations at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.000002614, two-tailed), implying we found a statistically significant difference in the means (pre-and post-test). § § The means for the pre-or post-tests groups used an independent samples t-test and was found to be not due to random fluctuations at the 95% confidence level; p-value = 0.00001182, two-tailed. This relationship between pre-and post-test scores can also be seen in Fig. 2 , where the correlation in was found to be moderate and positive. It should be noted that the gain from the pre-test mean, as compared to the post-test mean, is not used to determine the gains [10] , although we have performed a question by question breakdown. In terms of numbers, Pearson's correlation coefficient, in Fig. 2 , gives a moderate positive correlation of r = 0.504 with p-value = 0.000261 < α at the 95% significance level (α < 0.05).As student ideas may not be clearly understood, nor how much they have learnt according to their own perspectives or from interviews, we can identify them through analyses of question by question responses. Fig. 3 indicates the percentages of students who correctly answered each question in the pre-and post-tests, with the differences also shown (diagonal hatching/blue). A similar schematic is shown for the paired data (see bottom panel Fig. 3 ) for comparison. We note here the presence of negative gains for certain questions, which are indicative of poorer performance in the post-test. This ""loss"" is especially pronounced in Fig. 3, top panel, for questions 14, 20, 22, and 24; this also arises in the paired data of Fig. 3 for question 12, bottom panel; the negligible gains in question 21 for the former and questions 14 and 24 for the latter are also worth mentioning. The concepts assessed by these questions are standard topics such as projectile motion (questions 12 and 14), as well as kinematics and Newton's second law (questions 20-24). However, these questions possibly exploit scenarios with which students are unlikely to have had personal experience with (i.e. objects fired from cannons and motion in deep space) and visual tools like ticker-tapes and displacementtime graphs. In doing so, they ensure that students respond based on intuition gained from their mechanics course rather than empirical evidence gathered from daily life. Finally, poorer post-test performance in these more conceptual questions may demonstrate that students are not confident in their ability to apply their knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios. This may be a consequence of superficial learning or dependence on preconceived ideas rather than physics. The presence or development of misconceptions may also have come into play. Additionally, we note that these questions might indicate an issue with language ability, a concern shared by other studies conducted in regions where English is not the first language of most students [25, 27] .Another way to investigate individual questions has recently been performed in Refs. [20, 25, 28] , where a breakdown of the type of response to individual questions can lead to a polarisation of a correct answer and one predominantly incorrect answer. ¶ In Figs. 4 and 5 we can see the effect of the polarising questions: 5, 11, 13, 18, 29 and 30 in the FCI, e.g., see Ref. [25] . A similar pattern emerges for the cohort at UJ, where there clearly appears to be a subset where asides from the correct answer there is another polarising choice, and apart from Q18 in the ""paired"" data, Fig. 5 , we find the same dominant incorrect (polarised) response [25] .It may be that certain misconceptions drive this polarisation. For example, consider question 5, where the dominant answer of C can be read from the pre-test data of Figs. 4 and 5. This answer claims that the motion of a ball is driven by gravity as well as ""a force in the direction of motion"", which indicates the common misconception that motion requires an active force. The presence of a force in the direction of motion is favoured also in answers 11C, 13C, and 18D, as well as implied in 30E. Though there is a general decrease from pre-to post-test in the selection of these erroneous answers, the post-test data of Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that these misconceptions can be difficult to alleviate, as we have found at UJ.Such observations connect well to the work of Bani-Salameh [30] and others; we shall interrogate these ideas in greater depth in a future work, see Sec. 4. It can certainly be inferred that there are subsets of incorrect answers where misconceptions in students' understanding consistently leads to the same kind of wrong answer [25] . In this section we now analyse the differences between the male and female participants who sat for both pre-and post-tests (paired). In Table 3 the means for female and male participants are presented and it clearly appears that female participants have performed better in the FCI as compared to male participants. Interestingly, and it has ¶ See Refs. [29, 27, 30, 31] for a discussion of other ways to analyse and interpret individual question responses in the FCI. been found by Alinea & Naylor [20] , the table shows that although male participants did better in the pre-test, female participants had a higher average in the post-test.To further try and verify these results, where due to the average number of participants in each group being 24, we have in Appendix A performed multiple statistical tests to confirm if this difference in means is statistically significant. From this we have found that at the 95% significance level we can neglect the null hypothesis. We emphasize that besides parametric tests for normal distributions we have also performed a non-parametric Wilcoxon test that led to a statistical difference in the medians, see App. A.In comparison to Fig. 2 , in Fig. 6 the correlation for female and male groups was found to be mild and positive with: r F = 0.417; p-value = 0.05418 and r M = 0.662; p-value= 0.00001816, respectively. Clearly, there is a more reliable correlation for the male cohort with p-value < 0.05. Finally, this can be compared to the combined correlation (independent of gender, N = 48) where r = 0.504; p-value= 0.02757 in Fig. 2 .The reason for the apparently higher gain for the female part of the cohort might be due to, as found by Sadler and Tai [32] (also see Adams et al [33] ), professor-to-gender matching to student gender was second only to the quality of high-school physics course in predicting students' performance in college physics. It may be worth mentioning that at UJ, during the 2020 academic year, a female instructor was the senior academic for the mechanics course. As we discuss in Sec. 4, we will leave these preliminary results for a follow-up work.Does transitioning to online classes mid-semester affect conceptual understanding? 11In this section we briefly remark on student and staff surveys conducted at UJ in 2020 after the sitting of the FCI post-test. In this survey we used a Likert scale [26] for most of the data collection. From Adams et al. [33] -interviews revealed that the use of a five-point scale in the survey -as opposed to a three-point scale -was important. Students expressed that agree vs strongly agree (and disagree vs strongly disagree) was an important distinction and that without the two levels of agree and disagree they would have chosen neutral more often.One month after the FCI post-test was administered, students were asked to complete a feedback form detailing their experience with the FCI assessment tool. This survey was primarily designed to gauge student perspectives compared with the FCI test mark obtained (student numbers served as the only identifier to preserve anonymity). As the survey was not compulsory (and this was during a hard lockdown) a rather small sample (22) of the 256 students opted to take the survey. Of these student respondents, only 8 had taken either the pre-or post-test, while the other 14 had written both. Already a pattern could be seen in terms of students that sat both tests, ""paired"", compared with those who sat only the pre-or post-test.If we look at the average mark obtained by the students who sat both tests, which was 10.80 for the pre-test and 12.57 for the post-test (out of 30), then when asked to rate their performance, most chose 3 (x = 2.67) and 2 (x = 2.14) on the Likert scale for the pre-and post-tests, respectively. Only one response exceeded 3: a student who had received 40% for the pre-test ranked their performance as 4. These results suggest that, for the most part, students are aware of their shortfalls and do not overestimate their ability.Three survey questions directly inquired about the students' experience regarding the shift to online learning. The first, asking if students felt they engaged with lecturers/tutors/classmates more through digital platforms than through standard classes, was met with a mixed response: most selected 3 (x = 2.91), but of these, ∼ 18% chose ""strongly agree"" while ∼ 23% chose ""strongly disagree"". Similarly, ∼ 18% claimed they ""strongly agreed"" that their performance was better thanks to online learning, although the average response was ""disagree"". However, the final such question offered the most clarity: the average response to whether working from home challenged academic performance was 3.59; most answered ""agree"", while ∼ 18% selected ""strongly agree"". Given the South African context in general, and the UJ context specifically (where typically one third of the enrolled students are from Quintiles 1 and 2 schools , see page 76 in Ref. [35] , indicating a diffuse level of poverty), and that data is among the most expensive in the world [36] , the difficulties of online learning can be especially pronounced.Public schools in South Africa are classified in so-called Quintiles, from 1 to 5. Quintile 1 schools include the poorest 20% schools, while Quintile 2 schools are the next poorest 20% of schools, and so on. Government funding is dispensed to public schools according to their Quintile classification, with the aim of redressing poverty and inequality in education, see Ref. [34] .In this article we have used the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to look at the conceptual understanding of a large cohort of physics/engineering students at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) during the 2020 academic year. Mid-semester UJ went into lockdown and students then switched from a traditional lecture format to online platforms, yet this led to the very informative scenario where we have found no overall drop in gains (G = 0.24). This is reminiscent of what happened with regards to the Christchurch Earthquakes (2010-2011) which led to the closure of various high schools, where although a minority had negatives impacts there were were many positives [37] . * * This was further established through the comparison of 2019 and 2020 semester marks at UJ (see Table 1 ) where we found no appreciable drop in marks.In Sec. 3.2 we looked at a subset of questions where a polarisation of choices occurred, in that either the correct answer or one main incorrect answer dominated the post-test responses [25] . We found similar patterns for the students at UJ, which followed a very similar pattern to the data found in Refs. [25, 20, 28] . The importance of these questions relates to the fact that they ask the student to be able to understand certain particular concepts in physics, such as circular motion and motion requiring a force.In Sec. 3.3 we looked at a possible out-performance of female students on the overall gain in the FCI. As was also found by Alinea & Naylor [20] , although the male group started with a higher average pre-test score, their gain was less. As mentioned earlier, the main course lecturer was female, which may lead to professor gender matching in this cohort [32] . Although we rigorously checked that the difference in means was statistically significant (at the 95% confidence level, see App. A) we will report on a larger cohort inclusive of 2021 in a forthcoming work.The article has raised some questions, such as why the general performance for the group of paired students was higher than those who took either of the pre-or post-tests. This is often due to the fact that students who are diligent are more likely to take both pre-and post-tests, and this can be seen from the fact that this group of students was also more likely to take the survey as well. Usually, overall gains are taken only from paired data, which is then used to compare to other cohorts and institutions. However, the question of using ""unpaired"" pre-and/or post-test data sets in some form has not really been investigated in the literature (see however, Ref. [27] ) and we intend to comment more on this issue in future work.As for other possible directions to investigate, besides extending the FCI to further years, which also appears to be disrupted by more COVID lock-downs, we intend to look at matriculation results in order to establish correlations between the FCI and high school exit grades in physics, maths and English scores. In the case of UJ, the first language of the students enrolled in the UJ FEBE (average 2015-2019): English 14.3%; Isixhosa 5.9%; African 1.5%; Other 78.3% [12] . This relates to comments by Bani-Salameh [27] , and also work performed by Alinea & Naylor [25] , in relation to performance on the English version of the FCI, where English is not the student's first language necessarily. It might also be interesting to look at correlations between the FCI and cognitive reflective tests [28] .EC and ASC are supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF).

Alinea (University of the Philippines) for his useful comments.In this appendix we look at the differences in gender means for paired data (N = 48, comprising of 16 female participants and 32 male participants). We found that the mean of the gains for female participants (µ F G = 0.38) was greater than the mean for male participants (µ M G = 0.17). However, to clarify if the difference is purely a random fluctuation, we performed the following tests, using R [23] , at the 95% significance level (α < 0.05):(a) The t-test for independent samples (and unequal variances) had a p-value: 0.02757 < α for a single tail (directional difference µ F G − µ M G > 0). (b) A two-way ANOVA with replication led to an F -statistic: 4.5107 and p-value: 0.03909 < α.(c) A linear regression analysis also led to an F -statistic: 4.511 and p-value: 0.03909 < α.(d) A non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon test led to medians of 0.2496296 and 0.1602564 for female participants and male participants, respectively, with a Wstatistic of W = 341 and p-value = 0.03223 < α.It may be worth mentioning that two-way ANOVA with replication was unbalanced, as the two group sizes were different (16 and 32, respectively). However, we were able to double-check the results obtained by converting gender to a dichotomous variable (Female= 1, Male= 0) and used a linear regression. At the 95% significance level (or α < 0.05) we can reject the null-hypothesis whenever the p-value < 0.05.In conjunction with the t-test, a two-way ANOVA and a linear regression analysis both agree at the 95% significance level, and suggest that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of female participants and male participants. This was further confirmed in item (d), where we performed a non-parametric test (using medians) and found the critical value to be p = 0.03223 < α. These findings indicate a real difference in gender (for this group) with female participants having better gains than male participants, even though male participants started with a higher average pre-test score.","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-25",1

The COVID-19 disease mainly affects the respiratory tract, digestive symptoms are often associated with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea .... Acute pancreatitis of infectious origin can be caused by different viruses such as mumps, measles, coxsackie, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A virus, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and influenza A (H1N1) but currently no study has concluded that COVID-19 is directly responsible for acute pancreatitis. we report the case of a COVID-19 patient admitted to the emergency room in a state of respiratory distress associated with stage E pancreatitis according to the balthazar classification, whose surgical exploration found total necrosis of the stomach .this article is respecting the SCARE Checklist guidelines (1)This is a 60-year-old female patient with a BMI of 24 kg/m2 without any particular pathological history admitted to the surgical emergency room in a respiratory distress with diffuse abdominal pain associated with hematemesis and melaenas and in whom the clinical examination found a conscious patient, BP: 09/04 mmhg , HR : 109 bpm , T° : 39 , respiratory rate : 24 cycles per minute , free oxygen saturation 89% , the abdominal examination finds generalized abdominal tenderness . The abdominal thoraco abdominal CT scan had shown multiple round and oval ground-glass opacities in both lungs, with a crazy-paving pattern The biological checkup showed hyperleukocytosis at 23,0000/mm3 , anemia with hemoglobin 9g/dl and platelet count at 150,000/mm3 , Lipase 627 U/liter, COVID-19 PCR was positive, Procalcitonin 30 ng/ml and C-reactive protein at 80 mg/liter. After monitoring and conditioning, surgical exploration by median laparotomy showed total gastric necrosis ( Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas with an estimated incidence of 30 per 100,000 in men and 20 per 100,000 in women(1) There are two forms: benign acute pancreatitis, known as edematous, and acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The incidence of acute pancreatitis of viral origin is so far unknown (2) The viruses that are known to cause pancreatitis are mumps, measles, coxsackie, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A virus, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and influenza A (H1N1). The pandemic situation of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) leads us to look for a relationship between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis since abdominal pain is part of the symptoms of both diseases. In a retrospective cohort study analyzing 11,883 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 12 hospitals in the United States, there were 32 cases of acute pancreatitis, giving a prevalence of 0.27%, of which 69% are idiopathic (3) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, uses Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells and TMPRSS2 to ""prime""(4). Both proteins are expressed in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the virus is isolated in the feces. Pancreatic duct cells, acinar cells and pancreatic islet cells also express ACE2 , making infection of the gland plausible as the virus spreads from duodenal epithelium to the pancreatic duct and then to acinar and islet cells (5) . SARS CoV-2 has been isolated from samples from a pancreatic pseudocyst from a patient with acute pancreatitis (6) . SARS CoV-2 is particularly capable of causing severe diffuse endothelitis of submucosal vessels in several anatomical sites, and these changes that cause diffuse ischemia of certain organs (7) but to date the direct association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis is not based on evidence . During acute pancreatitis the pancreas will undergo alterations in its microcirculation in the form of vasoconstriction and progressive exclusion of capillaries resulting in a decrease in local vascularization promoting the appearance of necrosis which may be systemic due to the significant release of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1A and phospholipase A2 which induce global endothelial dysfunction and increase vascular permeability (9) . Necrosis of the stomach is rare and usually due to the presence of thrombosis and stenosis of gastric vessels (10) . During acute necrotizing pancreatitis, Acute Necrotic Collections contain varying amounts of fluid and necrotic debris from the pancreatic parenchyma (11). Thoraco-abdominal CT scan should be requested in this pandemic context for signs related to COVID-19 and for signs of severity and complications of acute pancreatitis. Surgical management in infected necrotic casts is an open necrosectomy to remove infected necrotic tissue. Several drains are left in place to allow continuous irrigation and lavage of the abdominal cavity; The mortality rate is more than 50% in case of early surgery (< 72 hours), Trans gastric drainage by endoscopy is an efficient alternative but requires a multidisciplinary consultation (11), in our case the surgical approach was necessary due to gastric necrosis and hemodynamic and respiratory instability. this case should teach us to check the Lipase in front of every abdominal pain in situation of COVID-19 and check the pancreas state by an abdominal CT scan .No scientific evidence has confirmed the direct association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis, hence the importance of measuring lipase in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection, particularly in cases of acute abdominal pain, our case was a woman with COVID-19 admitted for stage E pancreatitis with intraoperative discovery of total gastric necrosis.This work was carried out in collaboration among all authors.

[1] The ""curve"" refers to the projected number of people who will contract the virus over a period of time. The faster the infection curve rises, the quicker the local health care system gets overloaded beyond its capacity to treat people. As the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Kenya begins to rise, the number of severe and critical COVID-19 patients has the potential to quickly overload the local healthcare system. [2] A baseline review of the system's ability to care for these patients is important to identify the priority actions for increasing surge capacity and the resources needed to care for the sickest patients with COVID-19.In a cohort of COVID-19 patients in China, 15% of the cases were considered severe, and 5% were considered critical. [3] In Italy, 24.9% and 5.0% were considered severe and critical respectively. [4] While both countries are highly ranked as having well-developed public health care systems, the burden of these patients has been overwhelming due to the insufficiency in the provision of medical supplies and equipment leading to significant morbidity and mortality in both countries. [5] Some of the challenges in African health systems include poor coordination, management and leadership, inadequate human resources, and inadequate budget allocations for health. [6] A recent study conducted in 2018 evaluated the calibre of country pandemic preparedness plans within the WHO African region and revealed preparedness in South Africa was high at 79%, while Kenya managed about 60%. [6] Kenya reported its first case on the 13 th of March 2020. Since then, the number of confirmed cases have been steadily increasing and modelling estimates predict that about 952,000 people in Kenya could end up being infected with COVID-19 and develop symptoms (symptomatic infected). [7] The purpose of this study was thus to gather information about the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services and to identify priority actions for use by policymakers and other stakeholders as a roadmap toward strengthening the COVID-19 response in the country.The Republic of Kenya, located in eastern Africa, consists of 47 semiautonomous counties . [8] It has a population of 47.6 million people, with nearly 68.9% of the population living in rural areas. [9] Based on Ministry of Health data, there are 6,608 (60.6%) public and 4,293 (39.4%) private health care facilities in Kenya. [10] Of the public health care facilities, 5,175 (78.3%) facilities are managed by county governments, 1,004 (15.2%) by faith-based organisations (FBOs), 327 (5.0%) by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and 100 (1.5%) are listed as other public institutions e.g. military hospitals.Kenya's healthcare system is structured in a hierarchical manner beginning with primary healthcare, with the lowest unit being the community (level 1) and primary health care facilities (levels 2 and 3) consisting of dispensaries and health centres, graduating to primaryThis was a comprehensive review of the published literature on the emergency and critical care services within the Kenyan healthcare system. Controlled vocabulary terms and synonymous free text words and phrases that capture the concepts of emergency care (emergency medicine, acute care, emergency services, emergency department), and critical care (intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU)), were used. PubMed and other electronic resources that curate English-language medical literature (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collections, Africa-Wide Information and CINAHL) were searched for articles on emergency and critical care services in Kenya published from April 2017 to April 2020. In addition, a search of the grey literature was performed of reports from both the Ministry of Health and other Non-Governmental Organisations, Google, Custom Search Engines, and Greylit.org. In the second phase, partial bibliographies compiled by earlier researchers were used and articles cited in the search results, that met the search criteria were included. Screening of articles was conducted independently by the authors and the final decision for inclusion was made collaboratively.A summary of the papers and documents included in the review is shown in Table 1 . The availability of pulse oximetry and oxygen therapy was 58% and 78% (n=411) respectively. [13] Only 39% (n=411) of the facilities could perform endotracheal intubation necessary for invasive mechanical ventilation.A recent national survey identified 537 ICU beds and 256 ventilators in Kenya. [19] The survey did not assess the ability of the facilities to effectively care for critically ill patients.Our findings identified significant gaps in the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Due to the lack of an integrated EMS system, most acutely ill and injured patients selfpresent to the hospitals in Kenya using private cars and taxis. [20, 21] Restrictions in movement in Kenya that followed the COVID-19 pandemic meant that most patients were unable to access emergency medical care in time and this led to incidences of patients succumbing to their illnesses and injuries. [12, 22] The current WHO operational considerations for case management of COVID-19 in health facility and community recommends that severely ill patients with concerns about having COVID-19 should call the prehospital care service and a basic COVID-19 ambulance sent to transport the patient to the appropriate level of emergency care. [23] The recommended ratio of one ambulance unit for every 50,000 people has previously been suggested which would result in response times as low as four to seven minutes. [24, 25] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f response time in cities with poor infrastructure. With a country population size of 47.6 million, Kenya would need at least 952 ambulances. [9] Organizing simple low-cost prehospital systems has been associated with a dramatic decrease in patients' risk of death by up to 25%. [26, 27] As the cases of COVID-19 in Kenya increase, there is an urgent need to strengthen the prehospital emergency care system by establishing a single national toll-free emergency access number and developing an integrated EMS system to respond to severe and critical COVID-19 cases in the community and other emergency cases, especially with the imposed travel restrictions.Majority of the primary (level 4), secondary (level 5) and tertiary (level 6) hospitals in Kenya lack a dedicated 24-hour emergency department as prescribed by the WHA Resolution 72. 16 . Emergency departments serve as the first point of contact for many people around the world especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where there are logistical or financial barriers to healthcare access and people present for care only when symptomatic with acute illness or injury. [28, 29] They are specifically designed to provide timely recognition of time-sensitive conditions, resuscitation and referral for severely ill patients, and the delivery of definitive care for many others. Due to the large number of COVID-19 cases expected to present to hospitals across Kenya within the next couple of months, there is a need to establish 24-hour EDs in all the level 4, 5 and 6 hospitals. This will ensure patients presenting to these hospitals receive immediate lifesaving emergency care, especially the severe and critically ill patients.Lack of national triage guidelines in Kenya could lead to the healthcare facilities in Kenya being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Based on current estimates, 80% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 can be treated as outpatients, up to 20% require hospitalization and 5% need intensive care. [3, 4, 30] Efficient triage of patients with COVID-19 at the ED will help hospitals in the country cope with the patient influx, direct necessary medical resources to efficiently support the critically ill and protect the safety of health-care workers. The WHO algorithm for COVID-19 triage and referral for resource-limited settings during community transmission is a useful guide that should be adopted to categorise patients into those that can be isolated in the community, those needing admission to the hospital and those needing ICU care. [30] Lack of infection prevention items in emergency care facilities in Kenya could lead to an increased exposure to healthcare workers and patients. Since the identification of COVID-19 in December 2019, there have been many reports of infections in healthcare workers and hospitalised patients in both the UK and other countries across the world. [31] [32] [33] [34] Without the appropriate infection prevention and control measures in the EDs in Kenya, acutely ill COVID-19 patients seeking evaluation and treatment in the EDs will not only have the potential to spread the disease to the healthcare personnel but also other patients across the hospitals. Practical interventions that can be instituted to improve COVID-19 infection prevention in the ED are shown in Table 2 .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 2 Interventions Hand hygiene [35, 36] Improve access to necessary supplies (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer, personal protective equipment (PPE)) Empower patients to ask if the healthcare workers have performed hand hygiene Standard precautions [37] Promote PPE use through pre-notification Transmission-based precautions [37] Redesign work processes to incorporate hand hygiene and PPE useEmploy COVID-19 screening tools in triage to identify patients requiring precautions Designate clinician champions Ask patients with respiratory complaints (i.e., cough) to wear a mask Audit practices through formal monitoring programs and provide feedback to the healthcare workers Implement a respiratory hygiene programPost visual reminders (e.g., signs)Though most facilities in Kenya had pulse oximetry and oxygen therapy, many could not perform endotracheal intubation needed for those severe COVID-19 patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Most patients with severe COVID-19 disease require oxygen therapy and the most critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation. [3, 4] Oxygen therapy is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first-line therapy for treating COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and hypoxia. [38] For these reasons, there is a need to ensure all EDs within COVID-19 treatment health care facilities in Kenya are equipped with pulse oximeters and functioning oxygen systems including single-use oxygen delivery interfaces. Similarly, they need to have the necessary resources and skills to perform endotracheal intubation to ensure that those who need respiratory care support due to COVID-19, or beyond, receive it.The current number of ICU beds and ventilators in the country is significantly lower than the current prediction models have estimated which is an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators if all the expected number of COVID-19 symptomatic infections will occur within a six months period resulting in a higher peak, compared to when the same number of symptomatic infections are spread out over a longer period of time. [19] It is important to note here that the mere presence of an ICU bed does not imply the ability to effectively care for critically ill patients. In addition to the beds, an ICU must meet certain minimum standards relating to work practice, caseload, staffing and operational requirements, design, equipment and patient monitoring. The continuity of care for critically ill COVID-19 patients seen in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ED is dependent on the availability of these critical care services. Given the high burden of critical illness in COVID-19 patients, the high mortality for these patients, and the availability of strategies for their management, there is a rationale for immediately increasing the number of ICU beds and ventilators in the country as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The primary limitation of this study is the data was mainly from published secondary data. Most of the data was from national surveys that included all secondary and tertiary hospitals and all public primary hospitals. Based on this, the data is potentially representative of all the public hospitals able to provide emergency and critical care services in Kenya. The study was further limited by the fact that we could not access the raw data and did not do any physical assessments of the healthcare facilities to verify the information. Data on the availability of the specialised human resources required to provide emergency and critical care services was not available. Further research with individual facility levels of assessment around infrastructure and service provision is necessary to more narrowly define areas with significant shortfalls in emergency and critical care services as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increase.This review highlights significant gaps in the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services for severe and critical COVID-19 patients. With no organised prehospital emergency care system, insufficient emergency departments, ICU beds and ventilators, many of these patients will be at risk of significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, the limitations in the availability of infection prevention items e.g. isolation rooms, N95 masks etc will potentially lead to the spread of the disease to the healthcare personnel and other patients across the healthcare system. Immediate action is required by the national and county governments and all stakeholders involved in the healthcare system in Kenya to address the gaps identified in this review to enable the country to safely deal with the projected large numbers of severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Results from this review were shared with the Ministry of Health through an informal presentation.Authors contributed as follow to the conception or design of the work; the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; and drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content:","Kenya","abstract","2021-01-18",1

It proceeds to develop a research agenda underpinned by the narratives of 'resilience' and 'vulnerability' as discernible in Kenyan urban informal settlement policy discourses and as related to the management of COVID-19. The current COVID-19 management strategies and interventions tend to assume that any attempt to control the pandemic is philosophically feasible only if it is compatible with the blanket rules of social distancing. Consequently, these rules are applied across geographical spaces without taking into consideration the settlement nuances in urban spaces. The formal settlement is a form of space that is legally sanctioned, regulated through state intervention and marked by regular work of the residence. In contrast, the informal settlement is often considered to be a problematic and an unregulated settlement outside the legal sanction of the state (Hart 1973) .However, the tenacity of the otherwise marginalised group of informal settlers who embody resilience amidst socio-economic, political and geographical exclusion is a silver lining that is yet to be tapped into by policy makers and researchers working on dynamics of urban spaces. The aim of this brief is to outline a research agenda proffering an alternative model of intervention to a reductionist approach often employed by policy makers across urban areas. The major challenge with a reductionist model of intervention is that it is unable to show the fullness of urban space, is limited in understanding the deep nuances of urban differentiation and misses out on the complexity of the livelihood depicted by the urban poor. Moreover, existing literature on urban intervention tends to view and analyse the so-called formalization of the informal (Banks et al. 2020 ) as a transformation agenda (housing, hygiene and labour market) within slums.In as much as this approach has the potential of securing livelihoods of the residence, it tends to narrow its focus, intervention and analysis of urban informality to class (the poor vs the rich). In fact, most of the analysis narrows the studies of informal urban to those who live, work, and access services through unregulated channels. Such endeavours not only raise moral questions of essentialising the informality of things, but can also lead to misguided diagnosis of the problem. Despite the fact that urban informal space can be all these, it is obviously more than this. Moreover, this is evident when managing a respiratory disease , that thrives on human-human interaction, regardless of class. The artificial boundaries across class and spatial domains as well as the oversimplification of the formal-informal binary tend to mask the broader issues of political economy. In other words, the reductionist model that continues to shape the COVID-19 response mechanism in urban spaces of the global south tends to neglect the pre-existing inequalities, groups and actors that define the urban informality.In this brief, we aimed to develop a research agenda for the future management of COVID-19 and other unforeseen pandemics in the informal urban areas. The choice of Nairobi as our study area is informed by various geospatial features, key among them: (1) the informal settlements in Nairobi account for over 50% of the city's total population; and (2) this huge population is however only concentrated in roughly 5% of the residential area of the city (UN-HABITAT 2019). This problematic relationship between space and population density has far reaching implications on the spread of a contagious disease. Elsewhere, our modelling study on the management of COVID-19 has shown close relationship between environmental factors and transmissibility of the disease (Onditi et al. 2020) . Indeed, the authors of this brief have previously spent time simulating a model of intervention appropriate for informal urban dwellers based on a combination of expertise in various fields, ranging from political science to international relations tomedicine. There is however need for further research to unravel the philosophical orientation of the society during a pandemic, and the following section attempts to frame questions that would guide such an agenda in future.The ancestry of our argument is rooted in James's (1890) philosophy of the mind and the brain. The two are inseparable. The problem however is that current reductionist models applied in the management of COVID-19, see the various components of life as separate entities. Yet, as rightly put by Lisa Barrett (2019) , human emotions, cognition and the socio-economic surrounding are complex systems of life, and they cannot be separated from life science. For instance, how do you explain the exponential spread of COVID-19 in more advanced nations compared to the global south, yet majority of the population in developing nations can rarely afford sanitary facilities that are crucial for the prevention of the pandemic. Even within urban areas of the global south, the rate of transmission among slum dwellers did not rise to levels that were initially predicted. Yet, by all scientific standards, the unprecedented inequalities in urban areas in the global south predispose them to heightened risks of transmission (Ouma et al. 2020 ).Our research agenda presents a possible solution to this philosophical lacuna that involves 3 sets of social problems with an assortment of research questions.The first question concerns the 'formalization of the informality,' in the context of a pandemic. The transmissibility of COVID-19 and the socio-economic disruptions that were triggered by the pandemic simply magnified the existing fault lines in the social fabric of the society.Rather than cautioning the most vulnerable slum dwellers, the reductionist approach to the control of the pandemic edged slum dwellers further on to the periphery.Blanket rules characterized by curfews, partial lockdown, and work-from-home,instituted by the state were inconsistent with the socio-economic realities of the slum dwellers. Hence, these social dimensions of healthpresent an interesting conundrum and potential lacuna for research into the impact of imposing 'formal' policies in an 'informal' environment: How do you ensure the pandemic management strategy in urban slum connects with the socio-economic and political realities of the residence? Secondly, the geospatial analysis of the pandemic is crucial in advancing the knowledge of how factors such as location, time and human behavior caninfluence on the rate of transmission. To our knowledge, such a study would be the first to provide insight on the link between geography and the patternof transmission as well interventional strategies. Along this line of thought, a number of research questions are suggested (1) are there differences in transmission of the pandemic between urban and rural setting? (2) Does the behavior of residents from various urban setting (formal and informal) influence the transmission and response to the pandemic? (3) is the intensity of transmission influenced by the pattern of social, gender and class inequalities?Finally, like any other crowded city in the global south, slum dwellers in Nairobilive in crowded single-roomed -low-quality shanties. Several people are forced to share run-down, even at times, overflowing toilets and bathrooms while children have to play in a polluted environment. More often, the residents are crumbled in the tinny homes withmulti-generational family members that poses a serious threat to the vulnerable population:children, women, and old age citizens. Outdoor infrastructure can be instrumental in minimizing casualties whenever a disaster strikes. However, in the urban slum areas, lack of accurate data on the slum residents and unrestricted entry and exit, makes surveillance difficult. Yet, public surveillancehas been hailed for flattening the COVID-19 transmission curve in countries such as China and Korea. Therefore, important questions informing future research endeavors should address the following (1) decongesting slum spaces through modern urban planning tools as a pre-emptive measure against the dangers of asymptomatic cases (2) designing case management tools in tandem with the local livelihood activities and assets (3) Intervention framework entail social safety nets as a strategy to enhance access.Our thinking of future research and policy agenda on this subject was motivated by the limited attention that potential negative impact of the blanket public health intervention has received in the current COVID-19 crisis. Moreover,the consistent application of the weak reductionist approachand its impact on residents of informal settlements raises both moral and practical questions that require attention. The brief acknowledges theweaknesses of this model in regard to the various sectors in the informal settlements. Based on this observation, we recommend increased microanalysis of policy implications on different segments of the society in a holistic approach. In essence, the researchers and policy makers working on dynamics of informal urban space should be able to see both the 'forest' and the 'trees.'","Kenya","first author","2021-01-12",1

Since the first case reported in Wuhan Province in China, almost twelve months ago, the disease has spread swiftly to affect more than 200 countries in all continents around the world (Lu et al., 2015; Young et al., 2020) .In Algeria, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was declared on February 25, 2020. Soon thereafter, a contagion area was formed in the Blida region, which became then the epicentre of the outbreak. After a steady state observed from the beginning of last September, an alarming upsurge was reported from the end of last October, raising the total contamination count to more than 62,300 cases https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103012 0964-3397/Ó 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. and the total mortality rate of more than 2000 cases, as reported by the latest public reports (''47-Ministère de la Santé de la Population et de la Réforme Hospitalière avec la contribution du Ministère de la Poste et des Télécommunications,"" n.d.) .The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is known for its very heterogeneous aspect; while in most cases, the disease remains silent or is restricted to a few mild respiratory symptoms, for certain individuals the disease may progress to severe or even critical forms, requiring specific management in intensive care units Wu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . The seriousness of severe forms is related to the particularly high rate of shortterm mortality. Indeed, according to recent epidemiological investigations, the mortality rate is estimated to be twenty-fold higher in patients who acquire severe forms of the disease (Ge et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020a) .Facing this pandemic, it is a challenge for clinicians to avoid progression to severe forms. It is therefore crucial to dispose of an early risk stratification system. This system will allow identifying high-risk patients at an early stage, possibly leading to optimized management, and overcoming the shortage of medical and material resources Shi et al., 2020; . At the same time, this system will provide a more adequate screening of patients eligible to be transferred to specialized intensive care units, thus avoiding the overload of care and the medical errors that may arise (Garcia-Alamino, 2020; Jansson et al., 2020; Lucchini et al., 2020) .In a recently published work, we have identified, in addition to advanced age, six biological abnormalities that could serve as early risk markers and these include: elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), decreased natremia, decreased albuminemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Bennouar et al., 2020) . The present study was designed with the aim to construct a scoring system that would allow the screening of high-risk subjects at admission, to validate this score in a separate cohort, and also to assess its relevance in predicting short-term mortality.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; it was approved by the local ethics committee 441/ DG/2020 , however, the requirement for written informed consent was waived given the context of the fast emergence of this infectious disease.This is a single-center, retrospective, cohort study, including SARS-COV-2 infected subjects who were admitted to the Frantz-Fanon Unit of the University Hospital Center (CHU) of Blida. Algeria. The study population, design, and site were detailed elsewhere (Bennouar et al., 2020) . Briefly, upon the onset of the outbreak in the Blida area last March, three isolation wards as well as an intensive care unit were set up in the hospital to handle the confirmed cases of COVID-19. After excluding subjects under the age of 18 years, pregnant women, cases of active cancers, and patients who died within 48 hours after admission, a total of 329 subjects, admitted to the hospital's isolation wards, between March 27 and April 22, 2020, were enrolled and followed for up to 28 days, this group represents the risk-score development cohort in the present study.All included patients were tested upon admission for the following biological parameters: inflammatory markers including: CRP and a total blood count with the calculation of the NLR ratio, blood glucose and renal function markers including: blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and electrolytes (sodium and potassium), albumin and total protein, hepatic enzymes: LDH, glutamo-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamo-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), gamma-Glutamyl-Transpeptidase (c-GT) and alkaline phosphatases (PAL).Severity was defined according to the following standard criteria: severe form by one of the following criteria: 1) shortness of breath: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min in the resting state; 2) pulse oxygen saturation < 93% or 3) arterial blood oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FIO2) < 300 mmHg. Very sever or ''critical form"" was defined by the presence of one of the following criteria: 1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; 2) shock or 3) multi-organ failure, requiring ICU .The final endpoint was the progression to a severe form, as defined above by respiratory symptoms requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, transfers to the ICU or death.In the previous study (Bennouar et al., 2020) , baseline biological parameters, as measured at admission were integrated into a proportional Cox regression model in order to identify, among them, those that could serve as early predictors of disease progression. As a result of this study, age above 60 years in addition to six biological conditions, were selected as potential risk markers, independently related to COVID-19 severity. These were elevated blood urea nitrogen (8 mmol/l), elevated LDH (367 UI/l), elevated NLR (7.99) and elevated CRP (42 mg/l), as well as decreased albumin (33.5 g/l) and decreased natremia (133.6 mmol/l). These seven factors were then combined into an ordinal risk score consisting of seven consecutive levels (S0-S7).The significance of the association between the risk level, as assigned upon admission, and the occurrence of severe forms was first assessed in the development cohort, and then in a separated validation cohort composed of 247 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, who were admitted to the same hospital between April 25 and June 20, 2020. The same exclusion criteria were also applied when enrolling in the validation cohort. In the second stage, the ability of this score to predict in-hospital mortality was tested in both cohorts separately.The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 25.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to explore continuous variable distribution. The continuous variables are presented as Means ± Standard Deviations or Medians (interquartiles) and are compared using the Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or ANOVA depending on the normality of the distribution and the number of subgroups to be compared. Qualitative variables are outlined as percentages and are compared using Pearson's v2 test for trend.For the purpose of assessing the predictive performance of the developed score in the early detection of worsening outcomes as well as the prediction of in-hospital mortality, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Cutoff values were defined using the Youden index; the maximum value reflects the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.For all statistical tests, a p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.A total of 576 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 329 patients formed part of the development cohort and 247 patients of the validation cohort. The baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 .A clear predominance of both male sex and age above 60 years was noted in each cohort, without any significant differences. Over the follow-up period, 43.5% of patients in the development cohort had progressed toward a severe form requiring intensive care, in the validation cohort this proportion was 34% (p = 0.02). Moreover, the validation cohort exhibited a higher mortality rate (26.7% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.0001) and a lower average survival duration (22.8 ± 9.4 vs. 25.0 ± 7.7 days, p = 0.002) ( Table 1) .From a biological standpoint, the two groups were broadly comparable. However, the validation cohort showed a higher level of blood urea nitrogen, white blood cells, neutrophils, and NLR, as well as lower albumin, protein, and lymphocyte levels ( Table 2) .Risk score, occurrence of severe forms, and in-hospital mortality For each patient, the risk score was calculated by the sum of points assigned to each of the included variables (Table 3) . Seven risk levels were defined. The incidence of severe forms and the mortality rate by risk level are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively.In the development cohort, the lowest severe forms incidences were observed in both score levels S0 and S1 (2.5% in the S0 level, and 3.3% in the S1 level). Then, this incidence increases gradually and significantly across the score levels. Interestingly, it was observed that all patients classified in both score levels S6 and S7 had acquired a severe form (p for trend < 0.0001) ( Fig. 1-a) .A similar trend was noted in the validation cohort ( Fig. 1-b) ; whereas no severe form was reported in patients assigned to level S0, all patients classified at level 7 had progressed to a severe form (p for trend < 0. 0001).With regard to the mortality rate, according to the risk level, a linear by linear association was also found in both the development and the validation cohorts, with no fatalities reported in the S0 level of the development cohort, nor in the S0 and S1 levels of the validation cohort. The highest mortality rate, meanwhile, was reported among patients who were admitted with a level S7 of the risk score, in both the development cohort (66.7%) and the validation one (100%, p fortrend < 0.0001) (Fig. 2-a and 2-b) . Similarly, in each cohort, the average survival duration tended to decrease gradually with increasing risk score levels (p ANOVA < 0.0001) (Fig. 2-c and 2-d) .Performance of the risk score in predicting both severity and inhospital mortality:The ROC curve was used to explore the effectiveness of the risk score in predicting both severity and mortality. The results are shown in Fig. 3(a-d) .In the development cohort, the score showed a very satisfying ability for the early prediction of both severity (AUC = 0.95) and mortality (AUC = 0.84). For a threshold value of 3.0 and higher, the score could predict severity with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85%. Similarly, for a threshold value of 4.0 and higher, the score could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 71% ( Fig. 3-a, and 3-b, respectively) .Likewise, in the validation cohort, the score showed a predictive performance as satisfying as what was observed in the development cohort (AUC = 0.74 and 0.90) for severity and mortality respectively. For the same above-mentioned cut-offs, the score presents a sensitivity of 82% and 91% and a specificity of 71% and 70%, respectively for severity and mortality.In this retrospective study, we developed and validated a risk score, which, with satisfying performance, was able to predict not only progression to the severe form but also short-term mortality caused by COVID-19. This ordinal score, to be calculated as early as the admission stage, will enable ranking patients into seven consecutive risk levels, and could thus contribute to the more targeted management of higher-risk cases, particularly in low-resource areas.This score is built up, besides age, from six biological factors, widely available in current practice, easy to assess, and quite affordable. These are CRP, NLR, urea, natremia, albuminemia, and LDH. Some of these parameters had already proven their individual effectiveness in predicting COVID-19 severity in numerous previously published studies (Gong et al., 2020b; Henry et al., 2020; Mardani et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wang, 2020) .In this study, the analysis of the ROC curve led to the identification of two important threshold values: a threshold value of 03 predicts the severity with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85%. In addition, a threshold value of 04 predicts short-term mortality with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 71%. Among the recently published studies on this topic, the study conducted by Galloway et al (Galloway et al., 2020) led to the establishment of a clinical-biological score based on the following parameters: advanced age, male sex, co-morbidities, respiratory rate, oxygenation, radiographic features, neutrophils, elevated CRPs, and reduced albuminemia. The authors reported that a threshold value Total* -7The risk score was calculated by the sum of the seven variables. CRP: C-reactive protein, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, NLR: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Fig. 1 . Distribution of severe forms incidences, according to the risk score, in the development cohort (a), and in the validation cohort (b), p for trend < 0.0001 respectively.S. Bennouar, A. Bachir Cherif, A. Kessira et al. Intensive & Critical Care Nursing xxx (xxxx) xxx of 04 was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of critical forms and 28-day mortality. In another study conducted by Gong et al (Gong et al., 2020a) , a nomogram, based on biological parameters, was constructed to predict, at an early stage, the progression of COVID-19. The authors found a significant correlation between the clinical severity and elevated LDH, urea, CRP, direct bilirubin, red blood cell distribution width-coefficient variation (RDW) as well as a decreased albumin level.In most available studies, the increase in inflammatory markers was a constant sign related to COVID-19 severity (Liang et al., 2020; Wynants et al., 2020) . Besides CRP, NLR is a particularly interesting inflammatory marker for monitoring COVID-19 progression, as it indicates both a decrease in lymphocyte count; a direct consequence of viral aggression (Guan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) , and an increase in neutrophil count; an indicator of exacerbated inflammatory reaction and bacterial super-infection .In addition to the inflammatory parameters, the concomitant decrease in albuminemia and natremia, as well as the elevation of cellular damage-related markers (LDH and urea), are further indicators of the extent of the inflammatory response, and thus of the disease's severity. Their prognostic value in hospital settings was discussed well before the COVID-19 pandemic (Barazzoni et al., 2020; Barbosa-Silva, 2008; Berger et al., 2019; Thibault et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020) .This study has limitations. Firstly, this is a retrospective singlecenter study which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the score developed is based solely on biological parameters; the inclusion of other clinical and radiological features could contribute to the development of a new score with improved predictive capability. Finally, and despite a satisfactory follow-up period, most of the patients included were still hospitalised at the end of this study, so their status could ultimately change. Further studies with a longer follow-up period and larger sample size are needed to understand the impact of this score on survival beyond 28 days. Fig. 2 . a: Distribution of mortality rates, according to the risk score in the development cohort, p for trend < 0.0001. b: Distribution of mortality rates, according to the risk score in the validation cohort, p for trend < 0.0001. c: Average survival duration, according to the risk score in the development cohort, p ANOVA < 0.0001. d: Average survival duration, according to the risk score in the validation cohort, p ANOVA < 0.0001.This study provides a useful risk score based on biological routine parameters assessed at the time of admission, which has proven its effectiveness in predicting both severity and short-term mortality associated with COVID-19.

In this study, we developed an integrated approach of drug discovery integrating 3D structure-based pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening of 75 compounds library, molecular docking workflow, ADMET pharmacological analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This scheme will provide an informative insight into the exploration of potent antiviral drugs, which could help in progressive attempts in the therapeutics of COVID-19.System preparation. The 1.95 Å crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) in complex with α-ketoamide (αk-13b) inhibitor was extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6Y2F) 10 . The structure of the enzyme was pre-processed, minimized and refined using the Protein Preparation Wizard 14 implemented in Schrödinger suite. This involved eliminating of crystallographic waters, adding missing hydrogens/side chain atoms, and assigning the appropriate charge and protonation state for the acidic as well as basic amino acid residues at pH 7.0. The enzyme structure was subjected to an energy minimization step using the OPLS-2005 force-field 15, 16 with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) cut-off value of 0.30 Å to relieve the steric clashes among the residues due to the addition of hydrogen atoms 17 .The preparation of the crystalized inhibitor, αk-13b, and the 75 candidate compounds were performed using LigPrep module of Schrodinger Suite which undertakes hydrogens atom addition, amending realistic bond lengths and angles, accurate chiralities, ionization states, tautomers, stereo chemistries, and ring conformations. Partial charges were assigned to the structures using the OPLS-2005 force-field 15 and the subsequent structures were imperiled to energy minimization until their average RMSD reached to 0.001 Å. The ionization state was set at the neutral pH = 7 using Epik ionization tool 18 . Preparation of inhibitor-like ligand library. The 75 candidate compounds were retrieved from the experimental work proposed by Gordon et al. 13 based on their experimental anti-viral activities against SARS-CoV-2. All candidate inhibitors were considered for further virtual screening-based 3D-pharmacophore features analysis. The library of the 75 compounds are presented in Table S1 .Identification of 3D-pharmacophore hypotheses. For the structure-based pharmacophore modeling Schrodinger PHASE module 19 was used with the default set of seven chemical features-hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobic contacts (H), negative ionizable (N), positive ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R) to create the utmost illustrative features based on the crucial interactions with the key residues of the enzyme accommodated the inhibitor. The seven 3D-features were generated using Hypothesis Generation for Energy-Optimized Structure Based Pharmacophores considering the omitted volumes within 5 Å of the refined ligand for the enzyme 20 . The extracted pharmacophore hypothesis comprise the functional groups included in their bioactivity of targeted enzyme.Screening of M pro inhibitors. All acquired seven 3D-pharmacophore features were exported and used for PHASE-based virtual screening of the 75 compounds library retrieved from recent experimental work by Gordon et al. 13 . Out of 75 candidates, 43 hit compounds were generated based on the highest PHASE screen score and matched ligand sites (Table S2 ). Both the quantity and quality of feature matching is taken into account in the Phase-Screen-Score.Docking-based virtual screening. Molecular-docking-based virtual screening was performed using Glide workflow of Maestro 11.6 to prioritize the lead compounds that strongly bind to M pro enzyme 21 . Receptor grid was created as center coordinates (X = 9.81 Y = − 1.47 Z = 20.51) using two cubic boxes having a mutual centroid to systematize the calculations: a larger enclosing and a smaller binding box with dimensions of 24 × 24 × 24 Å and 18 × 18 × 18 Å, correspondingly. The grid box was centered on the centroid of the ligands in the complex, which was adequately large enough to search a superior region of the enzyme structure. All the chosen ligands were docked by using a three docking protocols of Glide 21 which starts with ""High throughput Virtual Screening"" (HTVS) followed by ""Standard Precision"" (SP) and then by ""Extra-Precision"" mode (XP). Finally, the 43 input compounds were assessed using Docking-Based Virtual Screening and filtered to final three optimized lead compounds based on XP-GScores.ADMET properties assessment. Schrodinger QikProp 5.6 module was used to calculate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the considered compounds to produce the ADMET associated descriptors. This protocol predicts noteworthy physicochemical and pharmacokinetic-based descriptors based on Lipinski's rule of five 22, 23 . ADMET properties of the top three compounds and crystalized control inhibitor were analyzed using QikProp 5.6 module and the best three compounds were considered for final analysis step through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.MD simulation considered to be the most essential approach in understanding the fundamental structure and function of biological macromolecules. This method helps in finding the underlying www.nature.com/scientificreports/ dynamics and how it is connected to enzyme's biomolecular function 24, 25, 26 . AMBER 18 27 simulation package was used to execute 200 ns MD simulations on all the prepared complexes using (Graphics Processing Unit) GPU accelerated version of Partial Mesh Ewald Molecular Dynamics (PMEMD) simulations 28 . The ff99SB 29 and the general AMBER force fields (GAFF) 30, 31 were employed to parametrize the enzyme and the considered ligands using LEaP implemented in Amber 18. The ANTECHAMBER module was used to assign atomic partial charges for the ligands employed in General Amber Force-Field (GAFF). The system was solvated using the TIP3P 32 explicit water in a cubic box with 8 Å box edge. The Na + counter ions were added to randomly to neutralize the complex. The partial Mesh Ewald (PME) 33 method was used to account the long-range electrostatic forces using cutoff of 12 Å, and the SHAKE algorithm 34 was used to constrain all the hydrogen atoms bonds.Energy minimizations were performed in two stages with 2500 steps of steepest decent minimization followed by 2500 of conjugated gradient to remove the bad contacts. The first stage was followed with a harmonic restraint of 500 kcalmol −1 A −2 on the solute molecule whereas, ions and water molecules were relaxed. On the second stage of minimization the restraints were removed and the whole system was relaxed. Each minimized complex was then gradually heated up from 0 to 300 K for 200 ps to keep the solute using a weak harmonic restraint of 10 kcalmol −1 A −2 . The 50 ps density equilibration with weak restraints followed by the 500 ps constant pressure equilibration at 300 K were performed at constant pressure using Berendsen barostat 35 . Ultimately, the production phase of 200 ns MD simulation was performed on all the complexes at a constant temperature of 300 K and constant pressure of 1 atm 36 .Post-dynamic trajectories analyses. The 200 ns MD trajectories were analyzed to calculate the RMSD of C α atoms, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue in the complex, radius of gyration (R g ), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and intramolecular/intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions using CPPTRAJ module 37 implemented in AMBER 18. Molecular visualizations and plotting were conducted using Maestro 11.6 and OriginPro 2018 software 38 .Principal component analysis (PCA) . PCA as an important tool for identifying the conformational changes of proteins was carried to describe the residual motions upon inhibitor binding of biomolecular complex 39 . PCA generates highly correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations derived from MD trajectories by applying dimensional reduction 40, 41 . The collective motions were studied using the positional covariance matrix C constructed based on the atomic coordinates and their corresponding eigenvectors. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are defined as the extent and the direction of motions, respectively 42, 43 . By the following equation, the matric elements of the positional covariance matrix C were determined:where q i and q j are the cartesian coordinates for the i, jth of Cα atom, and N is the number of Cα atoms. To remove all translational and rotational movements, the average is calculated after superimposition with a reference structure using a least-square fit procedure to excerpt the important motion from MD trajectories 44, 45, 46 . To derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the symmetric matrix C is transformed into a diagonal matrix Λ of eigenvalues by an orthogonal coordinate transformation matrix T:in which the eigenvectors correspond to the direction of motions relative to q i and each eigenvector associate with an eigenvalue that represents the total mean-square fluctuation of the system along the corresponding eigenvector. CPPTRAJ module from the Amber 18 suite was used to perform the PC analysis and the porcupine plot of protein collective motions was created by NMWiz implemented in VMD 47 .Binding free energy calculations. The relative binding free energies were computed using Molecular Mechanics/ Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy method 48 . Water molecules and counter ions were stripped using the CPPTRAJ module. The binding free energies (ΔG bind ) were calculated with the MM-GBSA method for each complex as below:(1) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The gas phase energy (ΔE gas ) is the sum of the internal (E int ), van der Waals (E vdW ) and Coulombic (E elec ) energies, (Eq. 6). The solvation free energy is the pattern of polar (G GB ) and nonpolar (Gnonpolar, solvation) contributions (Eq. 7). The polar solvation G GB contribution is estimated using the Generalized Born (GB) solvation model with the dielectric constant 1 for solute and 80.0 for the solvent. Conversely, the nonpolar free energy contribution was assessed using Eq. 8, where the surface tension proportionality constant, γ, and the free energy of nonpolar solvation of a point solute, β, were set to 0.00542 kcal mol −1 Å −2 and 0 kcal mol −1 , respectively 49 . The SASA is calculated by the linear combination of pairwise overlap (LCPO) model 50 .Selection of compounds. An specific drug repurposing library of 75 anti and pro-viral agents including FDA approved drugs, clinical trials compounds and preclinical compounds with enzyme inhibitory activity between 10 and 100 nM range 13 against SARS-CoV-2 was considered as the input library for this in silico study. The library including the compounds name as well as their corresponding smile structures are presented in Table S1 .interacting features can be obtained from structure-based pharmacophores based on three-dimensional structure of a target protein 51 . The most common descriptors in pharmacophore modeling are H-bond donors, H-bond acceptors, positive and negative ionizable groups, lipophilic regions and aromatic rings. The most effective 3D structure-based e-pharmacophores were produced using the receptor-ligand pharmacophore generation protocol implemented in PHASE, which was executed for a co-crystal αk-13b inhibitor inside the active pocket in order to determine possibly critical amino acids that are involved in ligand binding ( Fig. 2A) . The generated e-pharmacophore for the considered enzyme showed seven main 3D-features including, H-bond acceptor, H-bond donor and π-π stacking of aromatic ring. In each pharmacophore feature, the red arrows represent www.nature.com/scientificreports/ hydrogen bond acceptor, blue arrow represents hydrogen bond donor and orange spheres represent π-π stacking of aromatic ring, Fig. 2B . Numerous excluded volumes were also produced in the models to demonstrate the space balancing. The seven 3D pharmacophore features and 2D-chemical structure of αk-13b inhibitor are presented in Fig. 2B ,C showing three donor hydrogen bonds, three acceptor hydrogen bonds and one aromatic ring sphere.Virtual screening of the candidate compounds. The obtained structure-based pharmacophore hypotheses of αk-13b inhibitor in complex with M pro were used to screen the 75 candidate anti-viral compounds retrieved from recent experimental work by Gordon et al. 13 (Table S1 ). These compounds were screened based on PHASE screen score, matched ligand sites indices. A total of 43 compounds subsequently passed this filter based on the created pharmacophore hypothesis. Molecules which have satisfied all the features of the pharmacophore hypothesis were considered as potential hits. The output of virtual screening analysis of 43 compounds consist of their PHASE screen score and matched ligand sites are presented in Table S2 .Docking-based virtual screening analysis. The 43 screened compounds obtained from virtual screening were considered for docking analysis using Glide workflow 52 of Schrödinger package. Three step wise filtering protocol were used for docking using HTVS where a total of 23 compounds (Table S3) were obtained followed by Glide SP where a total of 12 hits were generated (Table S4) . Finally, the best lead compounds were obtained using Glide XP lead optimization protocol, while among 10 generated docking poses per ligand, only one pose was retained (Table S5 ). The Glide GScore and the interacting binding residues of the five lead compounds presented in Table 1 . The αk-13b inhibitor as well as the best optimized lead generated from XP docking were selected to map their potential interactions within the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme using molecular docking approach. This approach aids in understanding the optimized orientation of a ligand and its target protein by minimizing inclusive energies of the corresponding complexes. The estimated docking binding energy values of all three compounds Daunorubicin, Onalespib and ABBV-744 with their experimentally viral inhibition activity (pIC50) 6.67, 6.81, 2.46 against SARS-CoV-2 13 as well as αk-13b inhibitor are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1 .As it is shown in Fig. 3 , αk-13b inhibitor interacted to HIS164, GLU166, HIS163, PHE140, ASN 142 and CYS145 through six hydrogen bond interactions. HIS41, CYS44 and MET49 formed three π-π stacking interaction with αk-13b inhibitor.The Daunorubicin-M pro , Onalespib-M pro and ABBV-744-M pro docked complexes presented considerable binding affinities with the energy values of − 9.33, − 8.21 and − 7.79 kcal mol −1 , respectively (Table 1) . These three lead compounds contributed into the binding site of M pro enzyme through the hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking and π-Sulphur interactions (Fig. 4) .The daunorubicin created one hydrogen bond and one π-alkyl interaction with the catalytic dyad CYS145 and HIS41, respectively. The other five hydrogen bonds were formed by the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of daunorubicin with HIS164, Arg188, Thr190, ASP187 and Gln192 as presented in Fig. 4A . ABBV-744 formed the interaction network of six hydrogen bonds with Arg188, Thr190, GLU166, HIS163, GLN189 and Gln192 with the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the compound, Fig. 4B . The catalytic dyad CYS145, HYS41 and MET165 formed π-π stacking interaction and π-Sulphur interactions with ABBV-744. Onalespib formed an interaction network of total four hydrogen bonds with THR26, ARG188, THR 190 and GLN192. The catalytic dyad and MET165 interacted to Onalespib through π-π stacking and π-sulphur interactions (Fig. 4C) .Thus, it could be contemplated that these three compounds bound favorably to the binding site of M pro through hydrogen bond, π-π stacking and π-alkyl interactions mainly generated by CYS145, HIS41, MET165, HIS163, GLU166, GLN 189, Arg188, Thr190 and Gln192 as key contributing active residues into the docked complexes.ADMET analysis. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity features were predicted using QikProp module of Schrodinger for Daunorubicin, Onalespib, ABBV-744 and αk-13b inhibitor. Outcomes of pharmacokinetic and toxicity study are illustrated in Table 2 . The selected properties of the compounds are representatives of influence metabolism, cell permeation, bioavailability and toxicity.The predicted central nervous system activity (CNS) of Daunorubicin, ABBV-744 and αk-13b inhibitor depicted as inactive whereas, Onalespib was presented as an active compound.

The estimated total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of all three compounds and αk-13b inhibitor met the acceptable range: 300-1000. Predicted octanol/water partition coefficient (QPlogPo/w) showed in the acceptable range from − 2 to 6.5 for all the ligands. The predicted aqueous solubility (QPlogS) for Daunorubicin, Onalespib and αk-13b inhibitor were in the acceptable range of − 6.5-0.5 whereas ABBV-744 showed slightly low value. The predicted brain/blood partition coefficient (QPlogBB) for all these compounds showed in the acceptable ranges. The percentage human oral absorption for all the compounds met in the recommended range. Number of violations of Lipinski's rule of five for all the compounds satisfied this rule for all the studied ligands.The structural variations within the enzymes structure is correlated with their biological activities. Any alterations or interference on enzymes structural integrity might have a substantial impact on its activity 41 . The binding of inhibitors influence the mode of action of enzymes that are comprised in disease pathways, thus there is a requirement to estimate the structural dynamics and conformational changes associated with the inhibitory activity of these inhibitors 53 .In this section, 200 ns MD trajectories regarding the four complexes, namely, Daunorubicin-M pro , Onalespib-M pro , ABBV-744-Mpro and αk-13b inhibitor-M pro as control model were analyzed. Different metrics and analysis were applied to investigate the stability and flexibility of the complexes as well as the contribution of the studied compounds upon binding in terms of binding free energies. The 2D chemical structure of all the ligands considered for MD simulations are presented in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1.The computation of a time variable with reference to an RMSD of C α atoms from generated trajectories was accomplished to investigate the consistency and efficiency of M pro in complex with αk-13b inhibitor and along with the three lead compounds, Fig. 1 and Scheme 1.The perturbations in the RMSD values as denoted in plot (Fig. 5A ) throughout the simulation time disclosed the possible conformational deviances in the enzyme structure upon ligand binding. As Fig. 5A revealed, all the complexes were stabilized and attained convergence after almost 50 ns of simulation run. ABBV-744-M pro Table 2 .

Solvent Access Surface Area (SASA) analysis was performed to define the activity of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues and forces exposed to the solvent over 200 ns MD trajectories. The constant and accurate scheming of SASA is highly useful in the energetic evaluation of biological macromolecules 55 . The interfaces among the hydrophobic native contacts inside enzyme structure is a noteworthy intermolecular interaction that effect enzyme inhibition. Hydrophobic interaction constructed between the non-polar residues corroborate the stability of the enzyme structure in solution by sheltering the non-polar residues inside the hydrophobic core distant from an aqueous solution 56 . As shown in Fig. 5D , standard SASA values for all selected compounds have been measured during 200 ns MD trajectories. Average value of SASA for the compound ABBV-744-M pro complex is 14,230 Å 2 which was showed to the solvent system. Overall SASA values of 14,303 Å 2 and 14,426 Å 2 were prominent by Onalespib-M pro and Daunorubicin-M pro complexes, individually. The differences in SASA values for all the complexes during the simulation period corresponds with the folding and unfolding of enzyme structure. The overall SASA values in the control complex was 14,001 Å 2 , slightly less than ABBV-744-M pro complex. The SASA assessment perceived in compound ABBV-744 bound complex additionally validated that ABBV-744 compound has better exposure to solvent and consequently favored the improved inhibitory activity of compound ABBV-744 over other complexes.Hydrogen bond analysis. For overall conformation and stability of enzyme structure, we have measured the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis (Fig. 6 ). This analysis gives extreme understanding into binding mechanism of enzyme-ligand with detailed consideration 57 . An average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in ABBV-744-M pro complex was noted to be 136 as displayed in Fig. 6A . In compound Onalespib and Daunorubicin, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds were observed to be 139 and 140, respectively.The number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds produced in the catalytic site of M pro enzyme notable to be 9-10 in ABBV-744 bound M pro complex. However, number of these bonds are more in Daunorubicin-M pro complex with 11-12 hydrogen bonds and less in Onalespib and αk-13b-inhibitor bound M pro with 7-8 hydrogen bonds as presented in Fig. 6B . It is evident in Fig. 7A , the Onalespib, Daunorubicin and αk-13b-inhibitor with the trace covariance matric of 37.45 Å 2 , 37.67 Å 2 and 37.69 Å 2 , imposed highly fluctuated anti-correlated effects as the negative values of 2D-scatter points into the protein, Fig. 7B . Interestingly, in the case of ABBV-744 with the trace covariance matric of 37.64 Å 2 , the prominent correlated motions were observed with the least fluctuations of the system upon ligand binding, Fig. 7B . Thus, from the above observations Fig. 7B , it was concluded that ABBV-744 induced least fluctuations into the binding site upon binding than the variants complexes.To understand the impact of inhibitors upon complexation in terms of their binding affinities, MM-GBSA binding free energy method were utilized to calculate the binding free energies and their energy components of the complexes, Table 3 .As it is evident in Table 3 Per-residue decomposition energy analysis. The binding-free energy decomposition offers an immense understanding in account of enzyme-ligand complexes produced from the trajectories by MD simulations. To achieve this, we fragmented the total binding energies of complexes into each-residual involvement by per amino acid residue existing in the catalytic site of M pro enzyme to provide comprehensive identification of key contributing residues upon ligand binding as depicted in Fig. 8 . The interactions between catalytic site electro-negative and electro-positive residues develops ligand binding and its stabilization at the target enzyme. This creates an improved intermolecular binding that surges the binding affinity of the ligand in the active site. Active site residue MET165 in ABBV-744 contributed with the lowest ΔG bind with − 4.22 kcal mol −1 however this residue has contributed with notably less ΔG bind of − 2.50 kcal mol −1 and − 2.45 kcal mol −1 in Onalespib and Daunorubicin bound complexes. The ΔG bind of another participating residues GLN189 was also observed to be lowest in ABBV-744 bound M pro complex with − 3.94 kcal mol −1 however, it is slightly less in Onalespib-M pro complex with value of − 3.45 kcal mol −1 and − 2.48 kcal mol −1 in Daunorubicin-M pro complex. Gln192 significantly contributed in the binding of ABBV-744 compound with ΔG bind value of − 3.00 kcal mol −1 and observed a very minor difference with − 2.99 kcal mol −1 ΔG bind in Onalespib bound M pro but showed a lesser ΔG bind of − 1.50 kcal mol −1 in Daunorubicin compound.GLU47, PHE140, LEU141, ASN142, GLY143, SER144 and GLU166 are the other active site amino acid residues which favored with the negative binding of ABBV-744 compound with ΔG bind values of − 0.48 kcal mol −1 , − 0.39 kcal mol −1 , − 0.52 kcal mol −1 , − 0.50 kcal mol −1 , − 0.14 kcal mol −1 , − 0.41 kcal mol −1 and − 1.50 kcal mol −1 respectively, however, these residues contributed with positive energies in Onalespib and Daunorubicin bound M pro complexes. The catalytic dyad residues, His41 and Cys145 showed the lowest ΔG bind value of − 1.64 kcal mol −1 and − 0.61 kcal mol −1 in control inhibitor αk-13b inhibitor bound M pro , although these residues showed less binding energies in ABBV-744, Onalespib and Daunorubicin bound M pro complexes. Thus, this assessment discloses that similar binding residues contributing into the overall binding energies of the ABBV-744-M pro complex indicative of ABBV-744 compound binds significantly to M pro enzyme.The necessity to control alarming COVID-19 pandemic made us to rationalize potential lead compounds that could be considered in clinical trials. Despite major investigations in the design and development of specific drugs or vaccines, not much proven to be effective against COVID-19. This challenge motivated us to explore the drug designing approaches that could serve informative to combat this disease. In this report, we have performed 3D structure-based pharmacophore modeling followed by virtual screening-based 3D-pharmacophore hypotheses of 75 compounds as potential antiviral agents retrieved from PubChem. Molecular docking workflow using HTVS, SP and XP protocols were used to generate the best hits and their corresponding docked poses. The Six best compounds generated based on their lowest docking binding affinities using XP were considered for ADMET prediction-based physicochemical and pharmacokinetic descriptors and MD simulations analysis. MD simulations approach revealed the two highly selective compounds namely, ABBV-744 and Onalespib www.nature.com/scientificreports/ possessed significant binding affinity and presumably inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme. Based on our overall observations, compounds ABBV-744 and Onalespib could be recommended as potential lead for the therapeutic of COVID-19 patients.The data used/generated to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Even though great efforts have been made, the pandemic has continued and worsened in some countries. As of June 29, 2020, it has caused more than 10 million confirmed cases and 499 913 deaths in as many as 213 countries and territories [4] . To contain the global spread of COVID-19, a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been suggested and implemented, such as isolation of ill persons, quarantine of exposed persons, contact tracing, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gatherings [5, 6] . It is estimated that more than 138 countries have closed schools nationwide, and several other countries have implemented regional or local closures [7] . An integrative literature review has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic may have a great socioeconomic impact on global poverty [8] . The entire world is facing a human, economic and social crisis [9] [10] [11] . According to the World Health Organization, there is an urgent need to aggressively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring that other diseases, such as malaria, are not neglected.Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease, which has long been a nightmare for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the WHO's world malaria report 2019, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for about 93% of all malaria cases and 94% of deaths in 2018, from an estimated 228 million cases and 405 000 deaths worldwide [12] . As of March 12, 2020, several malaria-endemic regions in Africa have reported a few imported COVID-19 cases, which has led to serious public health emergencies. As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads in Africa, it becomes a challenging task to maintain core malaria control services while protecting health workers against COVID-19 transmission [13] . As a consequence, malaria control services have been disrupted in many malariaendemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa, among which insecticide-treated net (ITN) campaigns have been considered as the most important measure for malaria intervention and control across Africa in the last two decades [14] . However, as of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. 1 It is estimated that under the worst situation, where all ITN campaigns were suspended, malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 would reach an estimated 769 000 [15] .In this study, we aim to assess the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention in four malaria-endemic countries in Africa: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method to estimate the epidemiological parameters in each country [16] . Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, we can then simulate the epidemic curves of the COVID-19 in each country under various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in terms of when and how different NPIs are implemented. Existing studies have shown that NPIs play essential roles in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic [5] . For example, Lai et al. have studied the effects of three major groups of NPIs on containing the spread of COVID-19 across China [6] , including (1) contact restrictions and social distancing, (2) early identification and isolation of potential cases, and (3) inter-city travel restriction. Because in this study we focus mainly on the spread of COVID-19 in Africa at the country level, we only conduct scenario analysis on the first two groups of NPIs in the four countries. Moreover, to quantify the impact of COVID-19, we assume that the distribution of ITNs is affected by the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic. The severer the epidemic, the greater the impact on the distribution of ITNs.There is no doubt that the cessation or disruption of ITN distribution will result in an increase in the human biting rate, and further the transmission potential of malaria. Specifically, in this study, we adopt the notion of vectorial capacity (VCAP) to characterize the transmission potential of a mosquito population in the absence of Plasmodium, which is defined as the number of potentially infective contacts a person makes, through the mosquito population, per day [17, 18] . Since 2012, Ceccato et al. have proposed a VCAP product to monitor malaria transmission potential in epidemic regions in Africa, where the value of VCAP is calculated by the dynamically changing meteorological factors, i.e., temperature and rainfall [19] . Based on the historical VCAP data, we can analyze the seasonal patterns of malaria transmission potential in each country. By treating the number of ITNs Keywords: COVID-19 pandemic, Non-pharmaceutical interventions, Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Insecticidetreated nets, Vectorial capacity, Malaria transmission potential distributed in 2019 as a benchmark, we can then access and predict the impact of cessation or disruption of ITN distribution on malaria transmission potential under different NPI scenarios in each country. In this study, we aim to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia in Africa with high malaria burden could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. Figure 1 illustrates the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases and the incidence of malaria infection in Africa. The four countries are located in eastern Africa, western Africa, and central and southern Africa, where the infection risk of both COVID-19 and malaria is relatively high. First, to estimate the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in each country, we use the time series of cumulative COVID- 19 . Finally, to quantify the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, we have also collected the population size, the ITN coverage, and the total number of ITNs available for each country. Based on the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) in each country, the ITN coverage rate before 2020 is estimated by the percentage of de facto household population who slept under an ITN the night before the survey. While the total number of ITNs available in 2020 can be obtained from the Malaria Operational Plan (FY 2019) of each country. All data and their sources are summarized in Table 1 .To accurately predict the trend of COVID-19 pandemic, we first estimate the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 by fitting the time series of reported COVID-19 cases in each country. Here, the time series is about the reported date of the COVID-19 infections as of June 2, 2020. Evidence has shown that asymptomatic infections play essential roles in the spread of COVID-19. However, due to limited public health resources in the four countries in Africa, it is difficult to identify asymptomatic infections in the early stages of the epidemic. In this case, following existing studies [26, 27] , we resort to the classical susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in a population of size N:where S(t), E(t), I(t), and R(t) represent the number of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed individuals at time t. In this study, we assume that the reported COVID-19 cases are removed or quarantined from the population and can no longer infect others. Along this line, the time series of reported cases we observed is actually the states of R(t) over time.There are three epidemiological parameters in the SEIR model: R 0 is the basic reproduction number; D E is the average latent period; and D I is the average contagious period (i.e., the average duration that an infectious individual is confirmed to be infected). Following the study in [26] , we assume that the latent period is the same as the incubation period. Further, based on the estimation in [1] , the mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.2 days. In this case, we set D E = 5.2 . The infectious rate, β = R 0 /D I , controls the rate of spread that represents the probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible and an infectious individual. In this study, we adopt the particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters R 0 and D I in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases [16, 20] .We implement the PMCMC method and simulate the COVID-19 epidemic using python programming language version 3.8.5 (source: https ://www.pytho n.org/). We assume that the first exposed case [i.e., E(0)] appears d days before the date of the first reported case in eachcountry. According to the Bayesian inference method, uninformative uniform priors are assigned to model parameters to reduce their influence on the posteriors, that is,Since the interval of each prior covers almost all possible values of the corresponding parameter, such settings have little effect on the inference results as long as the number of iterations is enough. With careful pre-testing, we set the proposal distribution of each parameter to be normal distribution:After initializing the values of model parameters as R 0 = 2.5 , D I = 5 , and d = 14 , we run the PMCMC algorithm with 200 particles for 100,000 iterations. Finally, the posterior of each parameter is built upon the last 80% iterations with a discarded burn-in of 20,000 iterations.Based on the estimated model parameters, we simulate the dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing (e.g., contact restrictions and personal preventive actions), and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Generally speaking, contact restrictions can reduce the infectious rate β of COVID-19; while early identification and isolation of potential cases can reduce the average duration of infection D I . On the one hand, we assess the effects of social distancing interventions by reducing the estimated infectious rate β to 25% and 10%, while keeping the duration of infection unchanged. This is equivalent to reducing R 0 to 25% and 10% of its original value. On the other hand, we also evaluate the impact of combined intervention strategies, where both social distancing and early identification and isolation are implemented. Specifically, the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 are simulated when reducing R 0 to 25% and D I to 2 (or 4) at the same time. In addition to what types of NPIs are implemented, it is also important when to implement the interventions. Accordingly, we further simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under various settings of NPIs that are implemented on May 18 and June 17, 2020, respectively.We adopt the notion of vectorial capacity to evaluate malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. Based on the Macdonald model [21] , the VCAP can be formulated as:where m is the average mosquito density per person; a is the expected number of bites on humans per mosquito, per day (i.e., human feeding rate); g is the per-capita daily death rate of a mosquito (i.e., the force of mortality); n is the sporogonic cycle length of the Plasmodium; p = e −g represents the probability of a mosquito survives through one whole day. Conceptually, the VCAP incorporates all information about mosquito population (e.g., human biting rate, life expectancy), which is defined as the number of potentially infective contacts a person makes, through the mosquito population, per day. Many studies have shown that the value of VCAP can be calculated based on meteorological factors, such as temperature and precipitation [22, 23] . For example, Ceccato et al. have calculated the average vectorial capacity per 8 days for areas where malaria is considered to be an epidemic in Africa [19] . If there is no abnormal climate change, the annual pattern of malaria transmission potential in each country should be relatively stable across different years. On this basis, we download and extract the 8-day average vectorial capacity for each county from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2019. We then use the means of the 16-year VCAP as a baseline of the annual pattern of malaria transmission potential.In this study, we focus mainly on assessing the impact of COVID-19 response on the disruption of ITN distribution, and further on the transmission potential of malaria. Launched in 2005, the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) strives to reduce the burden of malaria across 15 high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa through a rapid scale-up of four proven and highly effective malaria prevention and treatment measures, including insecticide-treated mosquito nets. In most countries, the PMI has supported ITN distribution through universal mass campaigns and continuous distribution channels. Based on the Malaria Operational Plan (FY 2019) in each country, we can obtain the total ITNs available from different partner contributions in 2020 (see Table 1 ). In this study, we assume that the available ITNs are distributed throughout the year in a way that the number of distributed ITNs is proportional to the annual pattern of malaria transmission potential in each time interval (eight days in this study). In doing so, the newly increased number of ITNs in a specific time interval t in 2020 can be estimated as:where i represents the total number of available ITNs in country i throughout 2020, and V i (t) represents the mean value of 16-year VCAP in time interval t of each year. As the number of newly reported COVID-19 casesincreases, it is assumed that the distribution of ITNs will be disrupted accordingly. Moreover, when the COVID-19 becomes serious (e.g., the number reaches a threshold value τ ), the distribution of ITNs will be suspended. Mathematically, we assume that the number of distributed ITNs in time interval t, D i (t) , is inversely proportional to the number of reported COVID-19 cases. Thus, we have:represent the cumulative number of distributed ITNs from the first time interval to the tth interval in 2020. Then, the newly increased ITN coverage rate till time interval t becomes D i (1 : t)/N i , where N i is the population size of country i. For case studies in each of the four African countries, the threshold value τ is set to be the number of reported cases when various NPIs are implemented.The disruption or cessation of distribution of ITNs may reduce the expected ITN coverage in a country, which may lead to the increase in human feeding rate a, as well as the transmission potential of malaria. Denote C i as the ITN coverage rate in country i before 2020. In this study, we treat C i as a reference value, which corresponds to human feeding rate of the baseline value of VCAP. Then, if all available ITNs are distributed as expected, the relative change of human feeding rate can be estimated as follows:where α indicates the efficiency of ITNs against mosquito bites. According to the definition of vectorial capacity, the expected transmission potential of malaria at time interval t can be calculated as:Similarly, if the distribution of ITNs is disrupted, the relative change of human feeding rate is: and the transmission potential becomes:In this study, we set α = 1 . Note that if the ITN distribution is disrupted, we have V exp i (t) < V dis i (t) < V i (t) . In doing so, we can quantify the relative change of malaria transmission potential due to the negative effects of pandemic COVID-19 on the ITN campaigns in each country.In this study, we adopt the PMCMC method to estimate the epidemiological parameters, i.e., the basic reproduction number R 0 and the average duration of infection D I , by fitting the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country till June 2, 2020. Fig. 2 , the fitting curve is slightly lower than the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. As a consequence, R 0 of Ethiopia may also be underestimated.We simulate the epidemic curves of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia under various types of NPIs implemented on May 18 and June 17, 2020. First, the NPI of contact restriction and social distancing is evaluated by reducing the basic reproduction number R 0 to 25% and 10% of its estimated value, while keeping the duration of infection D I unchanged. In doing so, the infectious rate β is reduced to 25% and 10%, respectively. It is noteworthy that both NPIs are very stringent. For example, even if R 0 is reduced to 25%, it becomes R 0 = 0.6175 in Tanzania and R 0 = 0.3925 in Ethiopia. Intuitively, the more stringent the intervention measures, the easier it is to control the epidemic, and its influence on malaria intervention measures will gradually be weakened. As shown in the left column of Fig. 3 , the solid lines always reach zero cases earlier than the dashed lines. Moreover, the earlier the intervention is implemented, the smaller the peak number of infections, and the sooner the peak comes. Figure 3 indicates that if the NPIs are implemented one month late, the number of infections will increase exponentially. The second column of Fig. 3 shows the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases under combined NPIs, where R 0 is reduced to 25%, and D I is reduced to two or four days. Comparing with the NPI of reducing R 0 to 25% only, the combined NPIs cannot decrease the total number of infections. Nevertheless, when the duration of infection D I is smaller (e.g., D I = 2 days), the epidemic will be controlled faster than the NPI with a larger D I . Meanwhile, the peak of infection (i.e., the inflection point) will also come earlier. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that the combined NPI with D I = 2 (i.e., the solid lines) can control the epidemic faster than that with D I = 4 (i.e., the dashed lines) when they were implemented on the same day. In this case, if the ITNs are distributed throughout the year, the time duration it will be affected by the epidemic will be shorter. Hence, the combined NPIs may reduce the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the distribution of ITNs, and further the transmission potential of malaria.In this study, we adopt the notion of vectorial capacity to evaluate the transmission potential of malaria. To quantify the impact of COVID-19, we first analyze the annual pattern of the transmission potential of malaria. The first column in Fig. 4 shows the mean values of VCAP and corresponding confidence intervals in each country. It can be observed that the annual patterns of VCAP in different countries vary greatly due to different meteorological conditions throughout a year. Intuitively, if the COVID-19 epidemic occurs during the malaria transmission season, it will seriously disrupt health services for routine malaria intervention and control. Therefore, we further quantify the expected reduction of malaria transmission potential without COVID-19 pandemic Fig. 4 . The purple lines show the expected reduction of malaria transmission potential when the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur. It can be observed that in Ethiopia and Nigeria, the trend of reduction is generally consistent with the annual pattern of VCAP. The reason is that based on our assumption, most ITNs in Ethiopia and Nigeria will be distributed during the malaria transmission reason from June to October. While in Tanzania and Zambia, the reduction of malaria transmission potential will gradually increase in the second half of the year. This is because some ITNs will be distributed in the first half of the year, and the cumulative number of ITNs will play an important role in reducing the malaria transmission potential in the second half of the year. In addition, the second column in Fig. 4 also shows the difference of VCAP compared to the expected VCAP ) caused by various NPIs implemented on June 17, 2020. It can be observed that in the first quarter of 2020, there is no difference between the red, yellowgreen, and turquoise lines in each country because no COVID-19 cases are reported. As the COVID-19 epidemic becomes more and more serious, the difference �V i (t) begins to grow in Tanzania and Zambia due to its negative effect on the distribution of ITNs. On the contrary, in Ethiopia and Nigeria, the difference becomes large during the malaria season (i.e., from June to October) due to the simultaneous transmission of COVID-19 and malaria. When the COVID-19 epidemic is controlled and ITNs are distributed as scheduled after October, the malaria transmission season is over. As a consequence, the distributed ITNs cannot contribute to malaria intervention and control this year anymore.The third column in Fig. 4 shows the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic under various NPIs that cannot achieve the desired reduction in the transmission potential of malaria. Here, the negative effect is defined as, which indicates the proportion of VCAP reduction that cannot completed as expected. In the first half of 2020, as the number of reported cases increases in each country (i.e., the gray bars), the negative effect begins to increase accordingly. However, because no NPIs are implemented before June 17, 2020, the negative effects of different NPIs are all the same. Therefore, the three lines are overlapped. After June 17, 2020, different NPIs are implemented. It can be observed that the more stringent the NPI, the more it can achieve the desired goal. When no NPIs are implemented, the negative effect is the largest (see the red curves in Fig. 4 ). When R 0 is reduced to 25% on June 17, 2020, the negative effect is alleviated after September. The reason is that the COVID-19 epidemic cannot be controlled before September. However, when the combined NPI (i.e., R 0 is reduced to 25% and D I = 2 ) is implemented, the epidemic can be controlled much earlier. Hence, the negative effect is alleviated before September, and the negative effects is the smallest (see turquoise lines in Fig. 4 ).As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads rapidly in Africa, there is an urgent need to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-endemic countries and contribute towards a syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention. To achieve this goal, the first priority is to assess the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in each country. Because populations in different countries have different contact patterns, the epidemiological parameters (e.g., the basic reproduction number R 0 ) of COVID-19 may also vary in different countries [24, 25] . Even in the same country, the epidemiological parameters measured with different data at different stages may also be different. For example, Li et al. have analyzed the first 425 diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and found that R 0 is about 2.2 [1] . Then, Wu et al. have combined international aviation data and domestic Tencent mobile data to estimate that the R 0 of COVID-19 is around 2.68 [26] . Tian et al. have analyzed through different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China: before the emergency response was initiated on January 23, R 0 was 3.15; since January 23, due to the expansion of the scope of prevention and control measures, the R 0 in different provinces has declined; when the intervention coverage reaches 95%, the average R 0 drops to 0.04 [27] . In this study, based on the time series of COVID-19 cases as of June 2, 2020, we have employed the classical SEIR model to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, and adopted a PMCMC method to estimate the epidemiological parameters by fitting the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country. Comparing with the early stage of COVID-19 spread in China, the estimated R 0 and D I are both in a reasonable range [1] . However, the epidemiological characteristics of the four countries are different. Therefore, to assess the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention, it would be necessary to simulate the various COVID-19 responses in each country separately.To simulate the impact of COVID-19 response, in this study, we have conduct scenarios analysis on two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing by reducing R 0 to 25% or 10% of its original value while keeping D I unchanged, and (2) early identification and isolation of new cases by reducing D I to two or four days. The results have shown that the former NPIs can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic, while the latter can shorten the duration of the epidemic. In this case, a combination of them should be a better response to the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition to the type of NPIs, when to intervene is much more important. Our simulation results have also shown that if the NPIs are implemented one month earlier (see Fig. 3 ), the scale of infection will be greatly reduced, and the epidemic will be effectively controlled much earlier. Because of this, the early adoption of comprehensive NPIs like China is essential to timely and effective control of COVID-19 epidemic.Different from the COVID-19, malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease, whose transmission depends on various impact factors, such as climate [28, 29] , human movement [30] [31] [32] [33] , and socio-economic factors [34, 35] . In this study, we adopt the notion of vectorial capacity to represent the transmission potential of a mosquito population in the absence of Plasmodium. Existing studies have shown that the value of VCAP can be estimated based on meteorological factors, such as precipitation and temperature [19] . Because different countries have different meteorological conditions, the patterns of VCAP vary greatly through a year (see Fig. 4 ). In Ethiopia and Nigeria, the high-risk season for malaria transmission is from June to October. In contrast, Zambia has a relatively low risk of transmission during this period. While in Tanzania, the risk of transmission is relatively stable throughout a year.To assess the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention, it would be necessary to consider whether they spread together over a period of time. On the one hand, if the COVID-19 occurred during the malaria transmission season, it would have a great impact on the allocation of resources for malaria prevention and control, thereby greatly reducing the expected effect of malaria intervention. For example, in Ethiopia and Nigeria, even with strict prevention and control measures, it is still impossible to contain the COVID-19 epidemic before the malaria transmission season (from June to October). In this case, the negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic will be amplified due to the cumulative effect on unallocated ITNs (see the third column in Fig. 4 ). To jointly address endemic malaria and pandemic COVID-19 in such countries, as suggested by World Health Organization, it would be necessary to maintain core malaria control services (e.g., ITN distribution) while implementing stringent NPIs for COVID-19. On the other hand, if the simulated peak of the COVID-19 epidemic is not in the malaria transmission season (e.g., Zambia), it will have little impact on the expected effects of malaria intervention in a short period. Even so, the cumulative effects still can be amplified in the future. Therefore, to avoid the resonance of COVID-19 and malaria, the best way is to do everything possible to contain COVID-19 before the next malaria transmission season. Otherwise, it would be necessary to allocate as many resources as possible for malaria prevention and control before the arrival of the next malaria transmission season. In summary, in African countries where malaria is considered to be epidemic, strategically maintaining core malaria control services such as the distribution of ITNs, is crucial important during the COVID-19 pandemic.Limited by the data available at the moment, the proposed method in this study still has several limitations that are worthy of being improved in the future. First, without identifying asymptomatic infections, it would be difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of asymptomatic infections on the COVID-19 epidemic in the real world. Second, asymptomatic infections can also increase the difficulty of case identification and result in the underreporting of COVID-19 cases. This will lead to an underestimation of the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic. Nevertheless, in reality, the decisions to reduce or suspend the distribution of ITNs are based on the reported COVID-19 cases. Therefore, even the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic is underestimated, it may have little impact on assessing the impact of NPI response on the potential risk of malaria transmission as long as the number of reported cases can be correctly estimated.In the future, when information about asymptomatic infections is available, it would be possible to tackle the underreporting issue by constructing more precise transmission models.In this study, we have presented a data-driven method to assess the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention in four malaria-endemic countries in Africa: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia. To achieve this goal, we have first estimated the epidemiological parameters, i.e., the basic reproduction number R 0 and the duration of infection D I , based on the time series of reported COVID-19 cases of each country. Then, we have simulated COVID-19 epidemic under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves of COVID-19, we have quantified the impact of COVID-19 response on the distribution of ITNs in each country. Finally, we have further assessed the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic and various NPIs on the transmission potential of malaria using the notion of vectorial capacity. The results and findings in this paper provide a way to jointly address COVID-19 and malaria transmission, as well as to efficiently utilize limited health services in malaria-endemic countries in Africa.Abbreviations ITN: Insecticide-treated net; PMCMC: Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo; NPI: Non-pharmaceutical intervention; VCAP: Vectorial capacity; SEIR: Susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed; MIS: Malaria indicator survey; PMI: President's malaria initiative.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-07",1

In the course of its propagation, the outbreak has reached more than two hundred countries around the six world continents. Intriguingly, however, is the very widely heterogeneous rate of reported contaminations, severe cases and related mortality, not only across countries, but also across different areas within the same country (1, 2) .In fact, it is widely recognized that COVID-19 severity is a multifactorial condition; several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, ethnicity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular diseases (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Interestingly, each of these factors is also known to be related to vitamin D deficiency in some way (1, 7, 8) . This has led to raising the issue of whether inadequate vitamin D levels can affect the progression or even the prognosis of COVID-19.Vitamin D is a secosteroid with a hormonal function; its synthesis, from cholesterol, starts in the epidermis under the effect of the sun's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays (7) . In reality, the link between vitamin D and respiratory infections of all kinds -bacterial, viral, and fungal -has been raised far earlier than the COVID-19 era (8) (9) (10) . The first assumptions date back to the early part of the previous century, when it has been noted that there was an inverse correlation between the amount of UVB solar irradiation and the mortality rate during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic (4) . On the basis of the above mentioned arguments, several studies have been designed with the aim to explore that association. Although the findings are very heterogeneous and inconsistent, most of the observational studies agreed on a strong and significant association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (3, 9) . There is even some research demonstrating that adequate vitamin D levels correlate with a better prognosis in a number of respiratory infections such as those caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the common influenza virus (9) .In the ongoing pandemic, a substantial body of evidence, particularly from observational and ecological surveys, involving countries from all over the world, suggests an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and the likelihood of infection, progression toward severity, and even fatality from COVID-19 (3, 9) . However, no definitive conclusions have yet been pronounced.On the other side, hypocalcemia is a common in-hospital complication, which occurs concurrently with other bio-clinical disorders such as an unbalanced status of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, hypoproteinemia, and even chronic kidney disease. It is tightly linked to a poor prognosis, especially in critical patients; however, its association with the progression of COVID-19 has not been well investigated (11, 12) .In light of the above-cited data, this study was carried out to assess both vitamin D and serum calcium status among COVID-19 severely affected patients, and to test the hypothesis of a possible link between their serum levels and short-term prognosis of this affection.This is a cohort, prospective, single-center study conducted at the Reanimation-Anesthesia Department of the Frantz Fanon University Hospital (CHU) Blida. Algeria. This department was converted, since the onset of the pandemic, into a COVID-19 center, set up to receive severe to critical cases of this infection. Patients admitted between July the 6 th and August the 15 th , 2020, for a confirmed COVID-19 severe and critical form, and who had been tested on admission for vitamin D and serum calcium levels were included in this study. Ineligibility criteria were: age < 18 years, patients deceased or transferred within 48 hours of admission, pregnancy, and ongoing malignancy. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; it was approved by the institution's ethics committee. The requirement for written informed consent was waived given the context of the fast spread of this disease.The COVID-19 diagnostic and severity definition was performed according to WHO criteria. Details are provided elsewhere (13, 14) . In this study, all patients were followed for a period of 3 to 28 days depending on patient state, length of hospital stay and survival. The final endpoint was in-hospital mortality within 28 days of admission.For all included patients, a venipuncture blood sample was drawn upon admission; the same blood sample was used to assess all the biochemical parameters. All tests were performed in the same laboratory.Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring the serum level of total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25 (OH) D total), using a sequential competitive immuno-fluoroassay method on VIDASV R . According to the Endocrine Society 2011 recommendations (15) ; subjects were assigned into one of the following categories based on their total 25 (OH) D levels: optimal:(>78 nmol/l or >30 lg/l), insufficiency (52-75 nmol/l or 20-29 lg/l), deficiency (26-52 nmol/l or 10-20 lg/l) and severe deficiency (<26 nmol/l or <10 lg/l).Total serum calcium was determined by a colorimetric method and then corrected for albumin levels using the following formula:Corrected serum calcium ¼ measured serum calcium À 0:025 Ã serum albumin À 40 ð Þ :Following our laboratory's norms, hypocalcemia was defined as a corrected serum calcium level of less than 2.20 mmol/l. In further statistical analysis, the study population was divided into three groups based on the tertiles of the corrected serum calcium.In addition to 25 (OH) D and total serum calcium, all patients were tested upon admission for the following laboratory parameters: hypersensitive troponin (hsTrp), inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelets; blood glucose and renal markers: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr); nutritional markers: serum albumin, total protein, and total cholesterol (TC); liver enzymes: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamo-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) glutamopyruvic transaminase (GPT), c-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatases (ALP).Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines (16) by an increase in serum creatinine of 26.5 lmol/l (03 mg/l) within 48 hours or at least a 50% increase in serum creatinine over 7 days. Cardiac injury was defined based on the hsTrp Kit by an hsTrp >100 ng/l or an increase of more than 30% of the baseline value.For continuous variables, the normality of the distribution was examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Then, they were presented as Means ± Standard Deviations or medians (interquartile) and compared by the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test according to their distribution normality. Qualitative variables were described as percentages and compared with the Pearson v2 test.Survival and cumulative in-hospital mortality rates were compared between the 25 (OH) D classes and the serum calcium tertiles, separately, using the Kaplan-Meier method. The curves were then compared using the Log Rank test. The association between these two variables and in-hospital mortality was assessed by uni-variate and multi-variate proportional Cox regression analysis. The variables included in the fitted model were those associated with in-hospital mortality in the uni-variate model (p < 0.1).The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve (ROC curve) with its 95% confidence interval was calculated in order to evaluate the prognostic performance of 25(OH) D and corrected serum calcium. Cutoff values were determined using the Youden index; the maximum value reflects the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.For all statistical tests, a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 25.0.As shown in Table 1 ; a total of 120 severe COVID-19 patients were included in this study, predominantly males (69.2%). The mean age was 62.3 ± 17.6 years. Approximately threequarters of enrolled patients had an inadequate 25 (OH) D level, distributed as follows: vitamin D insufficiency (19.2%), vitamin D deficiency (29.2%), and severe vitamin D deficiency (26.7%). Hypocalcemia on admission was also very common as only 35.8% of patients admitted had adequate levels of corrected serum calcium. During their follow-up, about 25% of the patients developed an AKI, 19.2% developed a cardiac injury and 30.8% of them did not survive. The mean duration between intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death was 7.7 ± 4.7 days, range [03-28] days.A comparison of the bio-clinical characteristics between deceased and survived patients is provided in Table 1 . Deceased patients were significantly older (68.6 ± 18.4 vs 59.5 ± 16.6, p ¼ 0.008). As expected, there was a significant difference in baseline laboratory parameters and onset of vital organ injury between the two groups. In particular, there were significantly higher incidences of acute renal and cardiac complications among patients who did not survive (40.5% vs 18.1%, p ¼ 0.009 and 32.4% vs 13.3%, p ¼ 0.014 respectively). In addition, the deceased patients were admitted with higher blood glucose levels and inflammatory markers (CRP, neutrophils and NLR) as well as with lower levels of corrected serum calcium, 25(OH) D, albumin, total protein, TC, platelets and lymphocytes. Moreover, among the deceased patients, only 10.8% and 13.5% were admitted with adequate levels of 25(OH) D and corrected serum calcium, respectively (Table 1) . The mortality rates, according to vitamin D status and corrected serum calcium tertiles are presented in Figure 1(a,b) respectively. In both cases, a highly significant linear-by-linear association was found, indicating a dose-effect relationship between these two parameters and short-term mortality (p for trend ¼0.001 and 0.0001 respectively).The lowest mortality rate was observed among the group with adequate 25(OH) D levels (>78 nmol/l or 30 lg/l) (13.3%); the rate increases gradually and inversely across the 25(OH) D classes; the highest mortality rate was recorded in the group with severe vitamin D deficiency (46.9%). Similarly, an inverse relationship was also noted between the mortality rate and corrected serum calcium tertiles, as assessed on admission; the highest mortality rate was recorded among patients who were admitted with serum calcium in the third tertile (< 2.05 mmol/l) (46.8%).The relevance of this association was further demonstrated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis for crude cumulative in-hospital mortality as shown in Figure 2 . Indeed, the remarkably divergent curves for severe vitamin D deficiency and the third tertile of corrected serum calcium (p Log-Rank ¼0.009 and 0.001 respectively), indicates a significantly reduced survival likelihood in these two groups (Figure 2(a,b) , respectively).The proportional Cox regression analysis was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of short-term mortality in relation to both hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia. One crude model and two adjusted ones were performed for this purpose. Results are provided in Table 2 .In the unadjusted analysis, and when taking the sufficient vitamin D group (>78 nmol/l or 30 lg/l) as a reference, patients who were admitted with vitamin D deficiency and severe deficiency had a relative risk of in-hospital mortality of 3. 23 Similarly, hypocalcemia was significantly related to a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Indeed, when taking the first tertile of the corrected serum calcium as a reference, subjects who were admitted with serum calcium levels within the second and the third tertiles had a 3. 3 The ROC curve was performed in order to test the prognostic effectiveness of vitamin D status and corrected serum calcium in the early prediction of survival probability in severely COVID-19-affected patients. The characteristics of the ROC curve, the cutoff values, and their predictive performance are presented in Figure 3 and Table 3 respectively.Both parameters showed satisfying and comparable predictive abilities (AUC¼ 0.73 and 0.77, p < 0.0001 respectively, for 25 (OH) D and corrected serum calcium). For a value of less than 15 lg/l (<39 nmol/l), 25 (OH) D could predict a poor prognosis with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 69%. Similarly, a serum calcium level of less than 2.05 mmol/l could predict short-term mortality with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 60%.This prospective, single-center, cohort study was designed with the aim to assess vitamin D and serum calcium status in COVID-19 severely affected patients, but also to test the assumption of a possible link between these two parameters and the short-term prognosis of the disease. The most relevant finding of this study was the revelation of a significant association between severe vitamin D deficiency as well as hypocalcemia with short-term COVID-19 mortality in ICU. This association was independent of other confounding factors with already proven prognostic value such as inflammatory markers (CRP, NLR and neutrophils), AKI, cardiac injury, gender, and age.Globally, our observations are consistent with most previous studies that have investigated the link between vitamin D status and COVID-19. For example, in two retrospective observational studies conducted, one in Switzerland (17) and the other in the Middle East (18), involving respectively 107 and 7807 suspected COVID-19 subjects. The authors have reported a positive association between vitamin D deficiency, and the likelihood of infection but also of hospitalization for COVID-19. Another retrospective observational study conducted in Italy and involving critical COVID-19 patients (19) had found that patients who were admitted with severe vitamin D deficiency were at significantly higher risk of short-term mortality. Similarly, a recent large metaanalysis including 1368 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported that vitamin D deficiency was associated with poor prognosis (20) .In the course of this pandemic, the hypothesis of a possible link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity first arose from the observation of an extremely heterogeneous ""geographical"" distribution of reported contamination and mortality rates, not only across countries and continents, but also across regions within the same country. Over the past few months, several ecological studies had attempted to test the accuracy of this assumption (8, 10) . From this context, a study involving 88 countries worldwide provided the first evidence of a significant correlation between latitude, sunshine level and mortality by COVID-19 (21) . Another, large-scale study, including 117 countries around the world, had reported that the mortality rate per million inhabitants was significantly lower in the countries below 35 latitude (22) . In the same context, several authors have extended the analysis by incorporating vitamin D levels in addition to latitude and sunshine. Ilie et al (10) , for example, in a study involving 20 European countries, had observed a significant negative correlation between average vitamin D levels and the number of declared cases as well as the number of deaths per million inhabitants.Together with geographical disparity, numerous additional shreds of clinical evidence have contributed to the basis of the ""vitamin D hypothesis"". From the physiological perspective, the possible protective role of vitamin D against viral infections such as COVID-19 may be attributed to its modulating effects on the innate and adaptive immune system (5, 6) . These immunomodulatory effects are well characterized since the detection of vitamin D receptors on a wide range of immune cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells as well as T and B lymphocytes (1, 23). On one side, vitamin D boosts innate immunity through the stimulation of gene expression of numerous peptides such as cathelicidins, IL-37 and defensins. Besides their antimicrobial activities, these peptides may also contribute to endotoxin neutralization, thus minimizing inflammatory extension (2, 4, 7) . On the other side, and through its antiinflammatory actions, vitamin D acts as a key factor in the regulation of the adaptive immunity as it can suppress the responses induced by the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) and thus contributes to the attenuation of the cytokine storm particularly that of interleukin 6 (IL6). The latter is considered as the trigger of the systemic extension of inflammatory response, and of numerous acute complications, particularly pulmonary ones, observed in severely affected COVID-19 patients (3, 9) .Another important finding derived from this study is the revelation of an inverse association between corrected hypocalcemia, as assessed on admission, and short-term mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. Among our study patients, hypocalcemia was very common and could be partly explained by impaired intestinal absorption, hypovitaminosis D, but mostly by hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia;conditions that are particularly prevalent in intensive care, including severe cases of COVID-19 (11, 12, 14) .Although the prognostic value of hypocalcemia is well known in hospital settings, particularly in intensive care (12, 24) , its association with COVID-19 severity was mentioned only anecdotally. For example, in a retrospective study, including 241 confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom 80% were severe to critical cases, the incidence of hypocalcemia was estimated to be as high as 74%, the authors found that patients with a serum calcium level of less than 2.0 mmol/l had also a higher incidence of multi-organ failure, septic shock, and a higher 28-day mortality rate. However, the authors did not correct serum calcium for serum albumin levels (11) .The results of our study should be interpreted taking into account several limits; in particular with regard to the sample size and its single-center design, as these may affect the strength or generalizability of the reported findings. Further prospective studies with a larger sample size are therefore needed. In addition, the serum calcium values were those of total calcium rather than ionized calcium, the latter representing the active fraction and better reflecting true hypocalcemia. However, we believe that the correction for albumin levels can, at least partially, overcome this limitation. Further studies integrating a more extended phosphocalcic profile with PTH, ionized calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are also desirable to better clarify the link with COVID-19 severity.Our study demonstrates the high frequency of hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D in severe COVID-19 patients and provides further evidence of their potential link to poor short-term prognosis. It is, therefore, possible that correction of albuminemia, hypocalcemia as well as supplementation with vitamin D may attenuate the severity and improve the vital prognosis. Randomized controlled trials should be conducted to evaluate the effects of this supplementation and to confirm preliminary hypotheses drawn from observational studies.

(A) We obtained convalescent plasma and detected the matching infecting variant in the first SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in South Africa. A blood draw and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal was performed on study participants. First wave virus was outgrown from one of the participants and compared to two viruses outgrown from the second wave, which were 501Y.V2 variants. A focus forming microneutralization assay was used to quantify neutralization. (B) Phylogenetic tree and mutations of variant sequences. Variants which infected the study participants who were plasma donors only for this study are marked in blue. Sequences of variants which were outgrown are marked in yellow. Participant 039-13-0013 was both a plasma donor and the donor from whom the first wave virus was outgrown. Y-axis denotes time of sampling for viral sequencing. Here we present clear evidence using authentic SARS-CoV-2 that the 501Y.V2 variant first detected 91 in South Africa is associated with reduced neutralization by plasma collected from patients infected 92 in the first wave with SARS-CoV-2 variants without the 501Y.V2 defining RBD and NTD mutations.While our findings are based on plasma samples from six convalescent study participants, the relative 94 consistency of the effect argues that the potential to escape neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior 95 SARS-CoV-2 infection may be widespread.The reduced neutralization is most likely related to the mutations in the spike RBD and NTD that 97 characterize the 501Y.V2 variant. While the E484K mutation has the clearest association with immune 98 escape, the other mutations in the RBD (K417N, N501Y) are also located within residues targeted 99 by some class 1 and class 2 NAbs [7] . Information about the significance of NTD mutations is also 100 emerging. NAbs targeting this site have been shown to be potent neutralizers of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6].The deletion at residues 242-244 is just outside an antigenic supersite loop (residues 245-264) and L18 102 also falls within the antigenic supersite. Furthermore, mutations at L18 and D80 have been selected 103 during passage with mAbs [5]. Our second variant contains the L18F mutation. This may be associated 104 with the trend to lower neutralization sensitivity relative to the first 501Y.V2 variant ( Figure S2 ). This 105 variant also has strikingly larger foci ( Figure 2A ).Lack of pronounced curvature of the data in the range of the solid line indicates that a the data is a reasonably good fit to a normal distribution. see https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/normplot.html for additional information.","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-26",1

Casi el 15% experimentó violencia por parte de un cliente o por una pareja sexual habitual que no paga durante el periodo de confinamiento. El acceso de las participantes a los servicios de salud no se vio interrumpido.The COVID-19 pandemic and national responses to it have had serious health, economic and psychosocial consequences [1] [2] [3] . Vulnerable and marginalized populations such as female sex workers face the stark choice of risking exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as they engage with clients or prioritizing their health at the cost of losing a primary source of income. In March 2020, the Kenyan government enacted broad measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, referred to as a lockdown. Measures included strict limits on national travel; a dawn-to-dusk curfew; and closure of clubs, bars, and other public venues. These measures curtailed the ability of female sex workers to engage in street-based sex work [4] , compounding the omnipresent threat of arrest for sex work with detention for curfew violation. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kenya rose slowly between March and May 2020 but the rate of increase picked up between June and October 2020, and at the end of September 2020, the national government reintroduced mitigation measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Kenya's SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity has grown throughout 2020, with a weekly testing rate of 6000 per day the week of November 9, 2020 [5] .As of December 22, 2020, there were 94,614 COVID-19 cases in Kenya, the second highest number of confirmed cases among East African nations after Ethiopia (120,348 cases) [6, 7] . Documentation of the pandemic's impact on the dynamics of sex work, female sex workers' socio-economic livelihoods, and their access to HIV services has been limited. We evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 among a cohort of young female sex workers aged 18-24 years enrolled in an ongoing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) study in Kisumu, Kenya.We enrolled and conducted baseline interviews with 200 young (18-24 years old) female sex workers in the IPrEP study in Kisumu, Kenya, between October 2019 and February 2020. IPrEP is an ongoing open-label, randomized controlled trial providing daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention to young female sex workers and comparing the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of two behavioral support interventions to optimize PrEP adherence. Participants will be followed for 24 months. Criteria for trial participation are: (1) no previous diagnosis of HIV infection; (2) being a biological female; (3) age 18-24 years; (4) living or working in study area; (5) intention to stay in study area for 24 months; (6) exchange sex with men for goods, money, favors or other services in past 3 months; (7) no current or recent (within past 3 months) PrEP use; (8) able to complete study procedures in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo; and (9) willingness to be randomized and adhere to PrEP plus adherence support interventions.Study participants were recruited through community outreach and social network referrals in the greater Kisumu area. Kenya's third-largest city, Kisumu, has been proactive in increasing community COVID-19 awareness and protection measures. It operates a successful fully digitized COVID-19 Response Call Centre at Maseno University; has trained healthcare providers and community health workers on the management of COVID-19 patients on home-based care; sensitized security personnel and the police [8] ; and advocated for handwashing [9] . There are two public-sector COVID-19 testing facilities in Kisumu; however, a shortage of reagents has caused delays in conducting the tests. As a result, samples had to be transported to Nairobi and testing restricted to those who present themselves at hospitals and their close contacts [10, 11] . This has constrained the number of tests performed daily [12] . The number of COVID-19 tests performed in Kisumu has increased from 350 between April-August 2020 to 1138 between Sept 20th to Nov 12th, 2020. The percent of positive tests increased from 2% between April-August 2020 to 11.5% in the period from Sept 20th to Nov 12th, 2020 [13] .A brief module of questions focused on COVID-19 awareness and precautions, access to health services, and sex work during Kenya's COVID-19 state of emergency was integrated into study follow-up visit interviews. Specifically, we asked participants about the effects of COVID-19 on their income, access to food, sex work (number of clients, interactions with clients, venues for meeting and having sex with clients, amount of money charged clients), ability to obtain needed health care services, ability to obtain PrEP medication from the study, and violence from a client or regular/main sexual partner. We also asked about whether participants experienced an increase or decrease in stigma or discrimination (i.e., how people treat them because they are sex workers), concerns about getting infected with COVID-19, and measures for self-protection.At scheduled 3-and 6-month follow-up visits between April and July 2020, participants were given a three-month supply of PrEP medication and an oral OraQuick In-Home HIV Test (HIV self-test; HIVST) kit [14] to support PrEP use during the lockdown. Participants received an orientation to the HIVST and reviewed instructions for use with the study staff. They were asked to send the study staff a photo or text of their HIVST results. We did not provide incentives to study participants for using the HIV self-test kits and returning their test results. Research assistants working remotely conducted participant follow-up interviews, including the COVID-19 module by telephone, to maintain physical distancing. Participants received protocol-specified compensation in Kenyan shillings equivalent to $5 for scheduled follow-up interviews.The study was approved by the Maseno University Ethics Review Committee and the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All study participants provided written informed consent at enrollment in the main study. Modifications to study procedures to maintain physical distancing were approved by the two ethics bodies; participants provided verbal consent to telephone interviews.For participants with both 3-and 6-month interviews during the period of COVID-19-specific data collection, only 3-month data were used in the analysis. Baseline and followup interview responses were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods in SAS v 9.4 (Cary, NC).A total of 193 of 200 (96.5%) enrolled study participants completed the COVID-19 survey module during scheduled study follow-up interviews. The primary reason for nonparticipation of seven women in the follow-up interviews was that the participant could not be reached by phone. Table 1 describes the baseline, pre-pandemic sociodemographic characteristics of those IPrEP study participants completing the COVID-19 questions. The median age was 22 years (IQR = 20-23). More than one-third (38.9%) completed secondary education or higher, 70.5% were not married and not living with a partner, and over a quarter (26.9%) had no regular partner.More than three-quarters (78.2%) lived in an informal settlement or other urban neighborhoods in Kisumu. Most had electricity at home (71.0%), 25.4% had a refrigerator, 47.7% a television, 87.1% a mobile phone and 9.3% an indoor toilet. Regarding living arrangements, 21.8% lived alone, 35.2% with relatives, 24.9% with their children, 29.5%% with a roommate or other paying residents, and only 1.6% with a partner. Forty-four percent of participants reported not having enough money for essentials and another 45.1% indicated that although money to buy food was adequate, they had limited funds for other things. Only 10.4% of all participants reported having sufficient funds for their household needs. Two-fifths (40.9%) supplemented sex work income with additional work, such as informal sales, domestic labor, and other income-generating sources.The median number of paying sex partners in the last month was 12 (IQR: 5-37), with 78.2% reporting condom use at last sex with a paying partner. The most common venues where sex workers engaged clients were bars, clubs, and other entertainment venues (78.8%), followed by telephone (39.4%) and roadsides/streets (22.3%) ( Table 2 ). The most frequently reported venues for having paid sex were rented rooms in a lodging or bar (89.6%) and the client's home (20.2%).Nearly all (99.0%) study participants were aware of COVID-19 and reported taking protective measures, including wearing face masks (80.1%), frequent hand washing (69.1%), using hand sanitizer (39.8%), and staying at home more (30.9%) (see Table 3 ). Over half (52.9%) were somewhat or very concerned about becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.In response to the question of whether the COVID-19 state of emergency affected their ability to get any needed health services, a majority of participants (82.9%) reported that COVID-19 did not affect their ability to obtain health services. Nearly all (91.2%) indicated that they had no problem getting their PrEP medications from the study site. Among the minority who reported difficulty getting PrEP medications, traveling to pick up the medication and having moved out of the study area were the two most common reasons cited.When asked how others treated them during the lockdown, 17.1% of participants noted an increase in stigma or discrimination against sex workers and 14.5% experienced violence from a client or regular non-paying sex partner during the lockdown.Most participants (92.2%) reported a reduction in access to basic needs and 79.3% reported lower payments from clients. When asked how COVID-19 affected their work, 85.0% indicated that the pandemic changed their work with clients: 83.9% reported fewer clients seeking sex and using different meeting and sex locations (72.5% and 73.1%, respectively).Of the 187 participants who were given HIVST kits as a way to screen for their HIV status prior to using a new bottle of PrEP medication, 97.3% (n = 182) reported their results to study staff -143 sent a photo of test result via phone, 38 via short message service (SMS), and one called for support to read her result. (These program data are not shown in a table) Of the remaining five participants, two physically brought the HIVST kit results to the study facility, one verbally reported her results on the date of her study follow-up visit, and another two reported having lost their kits, but were tested at the facility on their study follow-up visit date. The remaining six participants did not come to the study site to receive HIVST kits but were tested at the study facility when face-to-face study activities resumed. No positive test results were reported.Our findings highlight the dilemma that women engaged in sex work face in balancing how to protect themselves from the risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus while maintaining their economic livelihoods. In the first four months following Kenya's enforcement of restrictions to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, only about half of female sex workers in our study reported concerns about acquiring the virus. Night curfews and closure of bars and clubs adversely affected female sex workers' sex work business, reducing the number of clients and the amount of payment from clients who also may have had less money to spend. One female sex worker interviewed on a popular news website commented: ""many of our clients have also lost jobs, so as long as they are jobless, we are also jobless"" [15] . Such restrictions also may compel female sex workers to abandon precautionary infection prevention measures so that they can continue earning an income [16] . Although there is no evidence of sexual transmission of COVID-19, sex work entails close contact between sex workers and clients that creates an opportunity for respiratory droplet transmission. Even before the COVID-19 lockdown, the financial security of this cohort of young female sex workers was precarious, with a substantial number reporting they did not have enough money and needing to supplement their sex work income with other income-generating activities. However, economic vulnerability increased during COVID-19 lockdown due to fewer clients and reduced income from sex work. Common venues for meeting clients and having sex became less accessible at the same time as other opportunities for income-generating work such as small-scale sales and catering suffered under the lockdown.Within the several weeks of lockdown prior to being interviewed, 14.5% of participants had experienced gender-based violence from a client or regular non-paying sex partner. This finding is consistent with other reports indicating that violence has spiked since the COVID-19 lockdown in Kenya and elsewhere [17, 18] . Female sex workers are vulnerable to violence from clients as well as from police and community members [15, 18] . The Kenya Sex Workers Alliance (KESWA) documented 80 incidents of violence against sex workers by clients, neighbors and police in the first month of the pandemic who blamed them as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, compared to a monthly average of 25 incidents before the pandemic [18] . This underscores the importance of linking sex workers with anti-violence services and ensuring that those services remain accessible during public health emergencies like the current pandemic. The IPrEP study procedures were successfully and rapidly modified in the context of COVID-19 to allow for physical distancing while ensuring uninterrupted, safe use of PrEP. Of note, study participants did not experience disrupted access to health care and PrEP specifically, as reported in other settings [19] [20] [21] , due to special measures taken by the study investigators, e.g., distribution of HIVST kits and remote interviewing, put in place to minimize the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on access to healthcare. Our study findings confirm anecdotal reports of the deleterious effects of COVID-19 on the economic livelihood of sex workers [22] . They are consistent with reports from the Bar Hostess Empowerment and Support Programme in Nairobi, which reported that sex workers have faced a 75% reduction in payments for sex work in that city since the onset of the pandemic [23] . Job losses in the formal and informal sectors in the western region around Kisumu have coincided with natural disasters in 2020, including massive flooding and a historic locust infestation [24, 25] . This confluence especially impacts sex workers and other vulnerable populations who lack safety nets to cushion loss of existing income sources. Sex workers have demanded that the Kenyan government include them in economic relief initiatives. To help sex workers in Kenya, KESWA launched a fundraising campaign to purchase hygiene packs with hand sanitizer, masks, and menstrual pads as well as food baskets for sex workers, and also is disseminating security tips on how to reduce the risk of violent encounters with clients [18, 26] . These efforts build on established systems of mutual assistance among female sex workers in Kenya such as chamas (informal savings and loaning groups) and other collaborative activities. Our qualitative research with 30 female sex workers in Kisumu, Kenya, conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, found that economic assistance during illness and for funeral expenses and release after arrests were common, as were other forms of support, including protection from violence by clients and the police, social support, and information-sharing [27] . Research into the role of mutual aid practices and networks among female sex workers during the pandemic may yield insight to strengthen interventions that leverage female sex workers' support systems [28] [29] [30] .This study has a number of strengths. To our knowledge, it is one of the few studies that have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of young female sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa. It was conducted among a prospective cohort of female sex workers that will be followed for 24 months and will permit us to identify changes in the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 restrictions over time. The study successfully transitioned to remote interviewing, resulting in an analysis sample (96.5%; n = 193/200) representative of our complete study cohort. We documented a smooth transition from in-person to remote follow-up with the introduction of HIVST and remote reporting of test results to minimize disruptions to study participation and enable continued access to PrEP medication refills while maintaining social distancing practices at the study site. The study also has several limitations. It assesses the experience of female sex workers enrolled in a PrEP trial, and findings may not be generalizable to other young female sex workers in Kenya. Because questions were interviewer-administered, responses may reflect social desirability and response bias due to reactivity of interviewing participants at regular intervals. COVID-19-specific questions were positioned within the temporal framework of the pandemic-related lockdown and were answered at either the 3-or 6-month follow-up visit, depending on when participants had enrolled in the study. Thus, we were unable to make direct comparisons with baseline responses about experiences of violence, stigma, and discrimination in the past three months. Finally, questions about the pandemic were limited in scope and do not permit a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.In conclusion, our study confirms the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a group of young female sex workers in Kenya. These impacts are most keenly felt in reduced financial income, which impacts their livelihood and survival; gender-based violence; and further stigmatization of an already marginalized population. Alternative support and economic relief may be needed as a safety-net measure at this time. Further monitoring is needed to ascertain the intermediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihood and mental health of this vulnerable population.","Kenya","abstract","2021-01-02",1

Some of their stories about COVID-19 are stories of distress, rooted in loss and uncertainty. Some of their stories are more uplifting and positive. The hallmark of being human is the desire to tell and hear stories. For centuries in all cultures, stories told and stories heard have defined us both personally and culturally, drawing us into a family, a clan, a tribe, a nation, and a collective as a human species. As psychotherapists, we hear them, and this act of listening begins to give their stories some grounding and validation. It is largely in telling the story to another that patients can begin to make sense of their experience. In a way psychotherapy is a process of storytelling. Our work is to be empathically immersed in their stories. We are thus trained to bear witness to their stories, absorb them, and to also protect ourselves from some the details of the stories that could unsettle us too much, and make our work less effective. In this regard, we also have our own inner stories that we bring into the therapeutic process of 'being with' the other, and then, our inner stories are subsequently shaped and formed by and through their stories, such is the nature of the psychodynamics of transference and counter-transference that make up our joint intersubjectivity. In my experience as a psychotherapist, the essential story told by patients of the COVID-19 pandemic is the story of life as no longer being the same. They describe it as the new normal. This new way of being and relating may include challenges of living under lockdown rules, such as the unexpected loss of income, loss of physical connection with significant others, being confined to the home, unplanned shifts to online work, as well as coping with wearing a mask. It is thus the story that has forced many patients (and therapists) into re-evaluating what is important in life. This paper documents my story in response to some of the stories of my patients' experience of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there have been pandemics recorded in history before, such as the Spanish flu that killed 50 million people, this pandemic is arguable unique because of social media. Social media has given people an opportunity to share their experience, and such experience is shared across space and time, uniting and bonding people in a collective community of telling the tale of COVID-19. It is reported that more than 4 billion people have self-isolated at home, something unprecedented. In the consultation room, now a virtual space for many therapists, patients tell their stories of the experience of the impact of COVID-19. Some of their stories describe difficult experiences of loss and uncertainty. Some of their stories are more uplifting and positive. In this paper, three patients' stories have been selected that illustrate both the positive and negative experiences of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the paper focuses on the intersubjective nature of the therapeutic relationship, my counter-transference, as a storied reaction, is included throughout.Since the theoretical relational turn in psychoanalytic theory and psychotherapy (Aron, 1996; Atlas & Aron, 2018; Mitchell, 2000) there has been an emphasis on the value of not only the awareness of the analyst's reactions, or counter-transference, towards the patient (Benjamin, 2009; Cooper, 2012) but also on how such reactions can be used to inform the therapist about the patient and their dynamics and process. With this relational turn, there is now a view of two subjectivities relating to each other in the therapeutic process. The implication of this two-person approach is the understanding that the analytic material that arises in the therapy process is assumed to be a co-creation of the internal dynamics of both the analyst's and the patient's subjectivity (Aron, 1996; Parsons, 2006) such that there is a flow and ebb of the subjectivity of the one with the other, leading to a dance of intersubjectivity occurring in the room. This joint consciousness, or intersubjectivity, between the two members of the dyad is thus understood as a bi-directional engagement between patient and analyst such that each person registers differently -a co-created and mutual dance governed by what is recognized as the concept of the analytic third (Ogden, 1994) . Application to relational psychoanalytic work of this idea of two subjectivities in the room, or the two-person approach to therapy (Aron, 1996) means that countertransference becomes a rich source of deepening our understanding of what the patient thinks, wants, and feels about themselves, others, and us as therapists. It is also viewed as a rich source of self-knowledge for therapists in that our patients evoke feelings and perceptions within us that also need reflection and examination in service of the patient who sits before us. In relational thinking, an important sign of thirdness is being open to hear multiple voices -""I can hear both your voice and mine as can you without one cancelling the other out; I can hear more than one part of yourself, you can hear more than one part of yourself … It is now possible to recognize the presence of multiple voices and parts of self"" (Benjamin, 2009, p. 442) . Later, Benjamin (2018) wrote further about intersubjectivity (transference and counter-transference) within the therapeutic relationship to emphasize how: 'I change you, you change me', meaning that the paradox is that both participants are themselves changed by the other. This idea of intersubjectivity and co-creation of the analytic material means that my reactions to my patients' stories shape and change my own inner stories about them but also about myself, thus multiple voices are heard, and made sense of, within the intersubjective milieu. Once this listening to multiples voices unfolds, the significance of empathy becomes paramount so as to make and maintain a connection with our patients (Geist, 2013) .My own story begins when lockdown was enforced seven months ago in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, in early November 2020, we are still in continuous lockdown. Given this length, we are possibly the world longest and uninterrupted period of lockdown, and perhaps for months, the strictest lockdown. In Johannesburg where I practice as a psychoanalytically-informed psychotherapist, we underwent nine weeks of what can be termed 'hard lockdown' which had rules and regulations that severely limited freedom of movement, the closures of non-essential businesses. Schools were closed, and five months later, most children were not at school. Hard lockdown was difficult to bear for many of my patients, giving rise to anxiety and depression. The months of hard lockdown lead to some restrictions being eased a bit to allow more economic activity and freedom of movement.For the first five months of lockdown, unique perhaps to this country, no family visits were permitted, and a ban on alcohol and cigarettes was implemented with the threat of imprisonment and a criminal record for any infringement. The ban on family visits hit my patients the hardest. Some were unable to abide by this rule, and sneaked out under the threat of arrest, to visit parents and children in the same city. Also unique to this country was a nighttime curfew, still enforce, and the public control by police and army to enforce the lockdown rules. Many arrests were made, including wedding and funeral parties as there was a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. One major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both myself and my patients has been the unplanned shift to online therapy. In the beginning of lockdown, as social isolating and social distancing was enforced, it became apparent that the only way to continue therapy under these conditions was to shift to online psychotherapy 1 . In the past I had not used the Internet for therapy. I needed to rapidly self-educate on becoming adapt with all e-platforms. It was stressful for me. At the time of the shift to online therapy, I wondered if my current patients would join in with this new virtual modality, or if new patients would come on board with this kind of online work. I also wondered if my Wi Fi would be strong and stable enough to manage video calls to my patients. My current patients, however, did join me for online therapy, and we continued, with mostly little internet problems, for many months during lockdown. I also had new appointments.Below are some of the stories of my patients of lockdown and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Aaron 2 , was a mature, energetic and healthy Jewish man in his late 50s who had been seeing me before lockdown and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic for help with the dissolution of his 28-year marriage. He was a likeable, thoughtful and quiet man, thinking about things in a deep and meaningful way. While he was now living alone, his adult children living in another city, he found that life under lockdown allowed him to explore his world more because lockdown initially had rules against visiting family and friends. This ruling allowed him to spend time alone, which he loved. He reported that the isolation was experienced as healing. There were now no expectations from others, including family, and he could live in peace, contemplating each new day, each new moment. He became mindful of his thoughts, of his emotions, and of his breath. He decided to begin to write short stories, always wanting to have done this kind of work years before. Later as lockdown continued and there were longer periods of self-isolating, Aaron found himself starting online yoga, something he could not do before because he was busy with meeting expectations of others. He had retired at 55 years from a successful business, and now he was trying to find a new purpose in life. When the divorce occurred, he reported that it set him free. Free to find himself, or find parts of himself hidden by years of social compliance, meeting expectations, and a marriage that he felt controlled him.I always enjoyed our sessions. Aaron would speak for a long time and I did not intrude. He spoke slowly and with care, selecting his words as he may have done with his new adventures into writing stories. I felt as if I was witnessing the unfolding of a flower that had remained as a bud for too long. He reported that the COVID-19 pandemic was about a call or calling for a new collective consciousness that was concerned more with inner life than outer materialistic trappings and wealth creation. He said he spent more time in the garden, listening to the sound of life, from children laughing next door, to birds singing, to the constant roar of traffic on a nearby highway. The global pandemic initiated an inner process of self-discovery as he began to think about life as being one of freedom and possibilities. He reported that he was not afraid of dying from the virus, and that he did not change his views of death as final, with no afterlife. In fact, he reported a sense of being happy for the first time in years. He did not want lockdown to end in that it might mean he would have to make contact again with friends and family. He wanted the isolation that lockdown enforced.Aaron's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown was unusual and refreshing. I had not heard many similar stories from my other patients. I was most affected by Aaron in his storytelling because he was so positive in his approach to his own new world of selfisolating. It resonated with me. For some months I had also begun to find a lost part of me that can be described as a return to my center. In the businesses of life prior to lockdown, I had lost something of myself in my treadmill pressure to perform, to meet expectations, to fall in line with a social world of demands. Aaron's idea of a call to a new consciousness made sense to me and I also began to re-think what I did. Because so much of those early lockdown days required home life and self-isolation, I found myself also enjoying the pleasure of being at home. While not alone at home, and not afraid of contracting the virus, perhaps because I felt I would recover, my thoughts shifted to what I used to like doing, and what gave me a sense of inner peace, and thus to find ways to escape from the hurriedness of city life. My life, like Aaron, became more free as I unshackled the need to always be there for others, to live up to expectations, of performing well, and to self-care more. Aaron once said, ""I am finding freedom in doing stuff I would not have done before because it would not have been socially acceptable"". He reported that he had stopped shaving his face, and now he was growing a beard. His ex-wife always said men with beards were not to be trusted, and this had negatively impacted on him and stayed with him. Now he flaunted his beard whenever his ex-wife contacted him on Zoom. He also said that the isolation of lockdown allowed him to experiment with new styles of clothing. He started wearing loose shirts untucked into pants. His ex-wife had said that Online psychotherapy, referred to as online therapy, is a psychotherapeutic intervention that makes use of the Internet and its various eplatforms, such as Skype, Zoom, MS Teams, WhatsApp, to connect mental health professionals with their patients or patients. 2 The name Aaron and all other names of patients' are pseudonyms. Any other identifying data related to them have been changed so as to protect their identity. In response to his stories of finding freedom, I think that I also began to do things that I had not done before. I stopped shaving my legs. Hairy legs are something not approved by our society for a westernized woman. Like his beard and untucked shirt, I felt inspired by his stories of finding freedom and going against what is socially expected. With the stories of finding himself, of becoming a different person, of welcoming and wanting lockdown to last as it cocooned him with new pleasures in freedoms unexplored and unexperienced, Aaron's stories impacted me in a positive and profound way. While other patients told stories of fear and distress, he told stories of returning to himself under lockdown. I found myself being more free within myself too. When restrictions lessened, I bought new non-western clothing that reflected my new inner freer self. Like Aaron, I resonated with his idea that the COVID-19 pandemic was a call to a new consciousness that sought inner freedoms once lost and unclaimed.Psychotherapy is storytelling. Most of the time the stories are distressing. While Aaron had stories of distress, his experience was also stories of growth and self-discovery. ""The consulting room of the psychotherapist is a powerful sanctuary for storytelling and an important laboratory for learning about this relationship between story and transformation"" (Abbot, 2011, p. 94) . Added to this is the notion that it is in telling the story that healing happens. The story needs to be told to release it from the shackles of repetition and internalization that seek to dominate every new moment and every new experience. Healing and transformation, once the story is told, takes on many forms and shapes, but for Aaron he began to discover something hidden within himself -the capacity for renewal and regeneration.As stories are told in therapy of the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to ask ourselves as therapists what story could be told to the patient in response to their stories to facilitate understanding and further storytelling. This is the work of empathy, as so eloquently described by Kohut (1959) who elevated it to being the core of therapeutic work. As therapists we hear the stories of our patients. In response, our own inner stories are evoked and rise up into consciousness so that the relationship is imbued with our stories too. Suddenly there are two layers of storytelling mirrored by the two people in the therapy. My own counter-transference to Aaron stories is irrevocably inserted into his stories in such a way that I hear his stories against this background music of my own storied responses. I found my story of COVID-19 called me to a new awakening about finding a new story for myself, a new storied self. Inspired by Aaron, I reached beyond the strain and stress of living under lockdown, and the darkening shadows of angst and fear of an uncertain future. I found something different, a new story for myself about perseverance and human dignity. As I continued to selfisolate into a fifth month of lockdown, with a loss of physical contact with colleagues, friends and family, my story shifted to it is good enough. In the past and prior to lockdown, I was a driven person, ambitious and overly selfdemanding. Now with lockdown, there is a new normal and with this, there is a sense that 'things I do are good enough' thus releasing me, somewhat, from my own inner stories of high expectations and demands. This is the impact on me of the good stories of my patients of COVID-19 pandemic.Katlego was a married African woman in her early 40s who made an appointment at the start of lockdown because her husband, Tshepo, has tested positive for COVID-19. They had been married for a few years and she had just given birth to their third child. She described their marriage as warm and supportive. Due to lockdown rules, her older two children were now no longer at school and doing online learning from home. Katlego was not permitted to go to the office as she was not an essential worker. She made a plan to work online from home. Her husband, Tshepo, was a medical doctor and had contracted the coronavirus at work. He was a first responder to people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Tshepo was in his late 40s, and was a diabetic with a congenital heart problem, which was rectified several years ago with open heart surgery. Within two days of contracting the virus, Tshepo was seriously ill with difficulties breathing and admitted to hospital. With a new baby and two young children to care for as well as a full-time job, and no family or domestic help, Katlego was overwhelmed. In addition, she reported that her elderly parents, who were living across the city, could not visit her, nor could she see them to assist them with daily necessities, such as grocery shopping.In our first session, as Tshepo lay in hospital struggling to breath, Katlego described her angst and fear of losing him. She said how frightened she was of being left alone to cope if he should pass away. We talked about her fear of losing him as well as a past memory of being a small child and left at home in the evenings while her religious parents went to bible study. While the high demands of her life were mentioned in passing, I noted that she had an intense anxiety about being abandoned. She told me other stories that had themes of being left alone or left behind. One story was about how her father forgot to collect her from school one afternoon and she waited until dark before he finally came. She reported how she had a fear of the dark and that she could not easily trust anyone to be there for her. These stories set the scene of me to be alerted to the possibility that she may not trust me to be there for her, or that I must not let her down or leave her. In our second session, Katlego spoke again about her fear of losing Tshepo. During this time, as lockdown rules did not permit visits to family, she could not visit Tshepo in hospital. This was devastating for her. We worked with this experience in therapy and it seemed to echo earlier stories of being left alone. Later in the same session, she spoke about her own fear of dying from the virus. She became upset when she told me that she would call the hospital each day for a report on her husband, only to be told that he was not any better. With memories of abandonment and a fear of loss as well as the ongoing stress of living under lockdown, Katlego was becoming more anxious. I suggested increased therapy sessions as well as recommended medication for anxiety. She agreed to both. In our third session, a few days after Tshepo was admitted to hospital, she came to therapy in a state of distress. Tshepo had passed away the previous night from COVID-19. She was not there to be with him because of the ruling of lockdown about family visits. She told me the story that she had received a call in the night from the hospital, and was informed about his death. He had been put on a ventilator late the same night but this had not helped him. Now she 'sat across from me' on our online video call, with tears streaming down her face. She was utterly devastated and inconsolable. Her world had been shattered. We did a long marathon session that day in which she mostly cried and asked me what was she supposed to do now. It was an emotionally intense session. I felt my own heart break for her. Indeed, what was she supposed to do now? I had not known anyone die from COVID-19, not then, and not now. In the first five months as the virus peaked in the winter months and over 640 000 people were infected, I was aware of only two colleagues who had contracted the disease but both had fully recovered. Katlego's story was heart-breaking because she was now a single mother, dealing with the cycles of grief and pain regarding the death of Tshepo, and essentially alone. Her story had a profound impact on me because I came to be reminded of the fragility of life. I could not possibly know the depth of her pain and loss because I was living under lockdown with very different circumstances which were essentially comfortable, supportive, and thus enjoyable. While I could empathize with her, I felt that her world was broken. She described feeling lost and without a sense of what to do. In subsequent sessions, she explored her grief and loss, and each time we met, she slowly began to make sense of what had happened. She often returned to her stories of childhood abandonment and linked that feeling with what was happening now. My own story shifted because of her story. I had an encounter with death and pain as never before in terms of this pandemic. It brought me a self-awareness of the real threat to human life that the virus posed. I began to take extra hygiene precautions such as hand sanitizing a bit more, washing my mask daily, and moving away from gatherings and invitations to small social functions.Stephanus was an Afrikaans man in his mid-30s living alone in the city. He had made an appointment to see me during the early days of lockdown because he felt anxious about getting sick with the coronavirus. He described a daily routine that reflected an obsessive mannerism of constant handwashing, sanitizing surfaces in the house not just a few times but many times a day, as well as washing down all his groceries, which were ordered online and delivered to him. He never left the house except to seek medical attention or visit the dentist. He scanned all the newspapers and news channels for information about COVID-19 and he knew the daily new number of confirmed cases. He made contact with friends and family via Zoom or What-sApp. He preferred to be alone. At one point he fired is maid so she would not come to the house. He confessed that he felt she could infect him as she lived in close proximity to a large family and within an over-crowed community in the townships. His sessions were filled with anxious stories of getting ill, of other people getting ill, and of the daily news of COVID-19. After a few sessions with the same kind of stories, I began to notice my boredom, which spilled over into a dread for our sessions. Perhaps I was defending against some inner story of getting ill but Stephanus was my boring patient. But all stories have meaning, and all patients, boring ones as well, have something to say. I told myself to listen harder.About two months into lockdown, when restrictions were still severe, and the confirmed case of coronavirus increased daily, Stephanus told the story of how his mother had died when he was a young boy. She had been ill for a long time, perhaps months, and he remembered she was in and out of hospital. His father, a strict authoritarian man had ordered the household servants to clean the house every time the mother went away to hospital. He realized as a boy that it was the father who wanted a germ-free household which would ensure that he or his father did not get ill. The father would also order little Stephanus to wash his hands regularly and bath every day. One day the father said to him that if he missed washing his hands on a regular basis, his mother would die. Frightened and fearing his father's dire warnings, young Stephanus, an only child, became obsessed with cleanliness. On the day his mother died, he tried to recall if he had washed his hands enough that day. When the father returned from the hospital with the news of her death, little Stephanus believed that his mother had died because he had not washed his hands enough.It is not difficult to make the connection between this story of his childhood story drenched in obsessive cleaning and hand washing to prevent the death of a beloved mother, and the adult man who feared getting ill and washed his hands and cleaned the house many times a day. I heard the story now, no longer masked by my counter-transference of boredom. Stephanus was no longer my boring patient. In the shadow of COVID-19 and the threats it held to his health, Stephanus was living in the shadows of a past that was repeating itself in the present. The pandemic, with its lack of a vaccine, had brought up dreadful and unspoken memories of a father insisting on rituals of cleanliness that would, in their minds, prevent the death of the mother. The stories of cleaning and fearing contracting COVID-19 made sense to me. In my mind I was never afraid of contracting the virus. My thoughts about it were that most people who became infected recovered especially if they had no comorbidities. I also felt that the washing of hands or hand sanitizing was appropriate but that I need not do it so many times a day. His stories of childhood and his stories of adulthood of obsessive cleanliness to fight against an unseen enemy virus impacted on me in a deep and meaningful way. I realized that although I was not as fearful as Stephanus, I recognized that I was defending against not so much as getting ill with the virus but with infecting my partner. In this context, the tale of his childhood belief that he killed his mother, was a warning to me that while I may get infected at some point and yet also survive and recover, my partner may not survive as he has comorbidities. To this extent, I may also kill the very person I love.Since Freud's writings and into the development of contemporary relational psychoanalytic theory, remains the core concept that unprocessed experience remains repressed within the psyche only to replicate itself unconsciously in some form in the present moment. Stephanus told the tale of childhood memories that had remain unheard and unspoken. As a child, he had believed he was responsible for the death of his mother because he had not washed his hands enough. This story had played out unconsciously within his psyche, like an old tape recorder, when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. While sobering and unsettling, his story reminded me about unconscious dynamics within myself and to be more cautious and use the preventative measures available against this pandemic, lest I kill that which I love. Katlego's story of loss and pain impact on me because it recalled to my mind the utter vulnerability of life in the face of Covd-19. We are all defenseless without a cure against this dragon-monster of a virus that threatens life.My inner story is shaped by Katlego and Stephanus and their stories of COVID-19. Stories like these are stories of the unbearable. Hearing these unbearable stories gives meaning to them, gives a voice to them, and thus gives a spark of healing. Without the story first told within oneself, and then told to another, the story remains disconnected and frozen, without a beginning or an ending. It has been written that without the creation of a storyfirst told within oneself and only transformative when told to another -catastrophe will produce only the doodling of sound which is the desperate seeking of language, con-nectiveness, and story before the silence of psychosis or psychic death is complete (Bion, 1963; cited in Abbott, 2011) . The harder to hear stories are stories of creating a language to suffering, and thus a collective connectivity bonded by suffering -for who can remain separate, untouched, uninvolved from human suffering caused by COVID-19? The harder to hear stories of suffering -because they are told -fight off, for a while, the silent threat of madness and psychosis.This paper set out to describe my story as shaped by my response to hearing the stories of my patients of their experience of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In writing this paper and documenting my story or storiedcounter-transference, I found myself wondering about the harder to hear stories of my patients. As a therapist, I have been exposed to many difficult to bear stories that they tell. The stories of Katlego and Stephanus are examples of these harder to hear stories. The trauma they have experienced as a result of COVID-19 shattered their world. To some extent, there is a dissociated horror. Their stories sit with me and stir up some old untold stories within me. The good stories, on the other hand, told by my patients of their good experiences of the impact of COVID-19, are like sunshine after a stormy day. They make what is unbearable bearable. Aaron's stories are uplifting, a reminder of the human spirit's capacity to transcend uncertainty and horror. Abbott (2011) sums up this link between the good and harder to hear stories when he writes, ""The joyful story comes as a rainbow for our tears; as a balm in our lamentations; as a dream of forever love in the face of surrounding death. The good memories -long gone into the hiddenness of the unconscious -are given rebirth when the unbearable experiences become driven out or forgiven"" (Abbott, 2011, p. 93) .A final comment refers to my overall counter-transference in relation to the three stories. These three stories or cases are linked together through the threads of COVID-19. They show the diverse and diversity of the impact of the pandemic. To this end, as mentioned earlier by Benjamin (2009) ""I can hear both your voice and mine as can you without one cancelling the other out; I can hear more than one part of yourself, you can hear more than one part of yourself … It is now possible to recognize the presence of multiple voices and parts of self"" (p. 442). This statement assisted me to make sense of my own reactions in that I heard their voices, and they heard mine too, and each time voices were heard, they did not cancel each other out. I could hear more than just the negative aspects of this pandemic in these three voiced stories. The notion that 'I change you, you change me' means that my reactions to my patients' stories really did change my own inner stories. ","South Africa","first author","2021-01-14",1

The disease was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [1] . According to the WHO daily situational report [1] , the outbreak of the virus remains rapidly increasing and life-threatening worldwide since its starting time. It is claimed in suffering more than 200 countries and territories worldwide [2] . Researches indicated that the main transmission route of COVID-19 is through Mathematical Modelling and Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemic and Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease.people to people contact [3] [4] [5] . Its transmission shows almost an exponential growth in the early phase of the epidemic as daily global reported data indicated. It results in mild to high severe clinical outcomes around 20% of all the confirmed cases [6] [7] [8] . As of 12 June 2020, the COVID-19 causes for more than 7.4 million cases and more than 481 thousand deaths globally; and Africa shares 155,762 cases and 3,700 deaths. On 14 March 2020, the first 5 confirmed cases were detected in the Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, the epidemic grows slowly near to mid of June 2020 since its onset on 14 March 2020 compared to the other countries. As of 12 June 2020, Ethiopia reported 2,915 cases and 47 deaths [1] .Since no medication for COVID-19 has yet been found, the WHO along with the concerned bodies continues to announce and release non-medical potential intervention strategic measures to combat COVID-19 all the time intensively in addition to the vaccine discovery trials. Social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, cleaning hands with soaps often, staying home, wearing a mask, and so on are some of the strategic intervention measures being practiced to mitigate and suppress the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Ethiopia adopts some of the intervention measures such as closing schools, lock-down international travels, restricted social gathering, and so on. However, administrative problems are observed in the strict implementation of the measures, and it causes a rapid increase in the infection.Mathematical models have the potential to understand the dynamic transmission of communicable and non-communicable diseases and forecasting their long-run transmission behaviors [3, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Mathematical models of disease dynamics could address the following questions: when will the epidemic be occurring? How many individuals will be infected next time? At what time will the epidemic peak be attained? How many individuals will get infected at the peak period? When will the epidemic last? Several scholars have developed mathematical models of the novel COVID-19 to study the dynamic transmission in Wuhan, China, and the other countries in the world [3, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .Recently, the authors [21] analyzed a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) COVID-19 using a discrete-time model assumption to forecast its outbreak. In this study, we propose a continuous nonlinear deterministic ordinary differential equation Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) system to study the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and further investigate its future trends in Ethiopia using COVID-19 daily reported data. In the process, we investigate the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium, perform the parameter estimation of the proposed model, and the sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number to the parameters. The rest part of this paper is presented as follows. Section 2 presents the formulation of the model and further studies the qualitative analysis. In Section 3, we study the basic reproduction number, the existence of a disease-free equilibrium, its local and global stability. Section 4 presents the estimation of the parameters. The numerical simulation and discussions are presented in Section 5. In the last section, a brief conclusion is given.The total population size N at each time t with respect to their disease status is divided into four mutually-exclusive compartments of susceptible population (S), infected population (I), recovered population (R), and dead population (D).In the formulation of the method, we make the following assumptions: (i) The total population is closed. (ii) The population is homogeneously mixed. (iv) The exposed compartment is not taken into account.(v) The recovered population develop permanent immunity. (vi) All variables and parameters of the model are non-negative.Based on the assumptions and population scheme in Fig. 1 , the differential equations that describe the transmission of COVID-19 becomesubject to the initial conditionswhere the total population of the model is given byThe susceptible population is declined following the infection at a rate µ ( the effective transmission rate of COVID-19 resulted from interactions of infected and susceptible human individuals per unit time) while the infected population is generated by same rate µ. The infected compartment is reduced by the recovery rate and disease-induced death rate, (β + γ), where, 1 β +γ is the average infectious period of the disease. Further, the population of recovery from COVID-19 infection is increased proportional to the infected individuals (I) at a rate β . The dead population is recruited at a rate γ. Descriptions of the state variables and parameters are presented in Table 1 , and the flowchart diagram for the system is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

NThe total size of human population. µThe rate of transmission from susceptible to infectious individuals. βThe rate of recovery from infection. γThe disease induced death rate. Since T is the maximum of all time t, it can be written asIt follows thatUsing a similar method, it can shown that all other state variables of the model remain positive for all time t > 0.The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the most important term in disease dynamics. It is used to quantify the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease. It is defined as the number of the secondary infected people produced by one infected individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. R 0 is used to decide if a disease persists in a community in a given population. If R 0 is less than one, each infected individual infects less than one individual on average and therefore the disease will cease to persist in the community. However, if R 0 is greater than one the disease persists and can spread [22] .The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is determined by the next generation matrix method. It can be determined from the general classical epidemiological models using [23] approach and summarized as follows: Hence, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is given as the spectral radius of MD −1 . That is,Using [23] approach, we can easily determine R 0 of system Eq. (1). That is, x = (S, R), I = (I, D). Furthermore, we haveHence, using Eq. (3), one can easily find R 0 as R 0 := µS 0 β +γ = µN β +γ , where S 0 ≅ N is the initial population during the onset of infection.In epidemiological modelling, we admit two equilibrium points in general: Disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). Disease-free equilibrium is in the absence of infected individuals in the population. On the other hand, endemic equilibrium is the equilibrium solution in the presence of infected individuals. The model presented in Eq. (1) has a DFE, computed by equating the right-hand side of system Eq. (1) to zero, given by E 0 = (N, 0, 0, 0). We have the following theorem.Theorem 3.2. The DFE, E 0 , is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1, and unstable otherwise.Proof The local stability of the system Eq. (1) is investigated using the jacobian matrix of the model Eq. (1) computed at E 0 , given byFollowing Eq. (4), the eigenvalues are λ 1 = 0, which is simple, and λ 2 = (β +γ)(R 0 −1). This turns out that the disease-free equilibrium, E 0 , is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1, and unstable if R 0 > 1. This completes the proof.In this section, we consider two conditions, (H 1 ) and (H 2 ), that would guarantee the global asymptotically stable of the DFE stated in [24] . Now, we write the system Eq. (1) in the form:where, x ∈ R m denotes the components of uninfected individuals and I ∈ R n denotes the components of infected individuals. Let U 0 = (x * , 0) be denoted the disease-free equilibrium of the system Eq. (1). Moreover, the conditions (H 1 ) and (H 2 ) below are supposed to be held true.where, A = D I G(x * , 0) is an M− matrix and Ω is the region where the model makes biological sense.To investigate the global stability of the DFE, we rewrite the system Eq. (1) in the form of Eq. (6). Then, x = (S, R) and I = (I, D). Moreover, we then haveSince N ≥ S ≥ 0, it is clear that G(x, I) ≥ 0. Thus, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable.Now we return to the estimation of the constant parameters given in the system Eq. (1). We now formulate the system asHere, y is the state variables and θ is the constant parameter values to be determined. To measure our fit to the real data, we define a least squares objective functiony(i) represents the real data and y(i) is the solution to Eq. (7). To obtain the optimum parameter values we minimize the objective function min θ φ (θ ) subject to Eq. (7).The algorithm is presented below: Algorithm:Result: Optimal estimated parameter values p.1. Guess initial parameter values p 0 . Set p = p 0 .2. Using MATLAB version 2013a ode45 routine, solve Eq. (7) using p to find the solution y(i).3. Evaluate error using Eq. (8).4. Use p to minimize Eq. (9) using an optimization algorithm nlinfit to find the parameters with 95% confidence intervalp and the co-variance matrix. Update p =p.Check for the convergence. If the convergence is not satisfied go to 2.6. On convergence, set p =p.Here we have used the inverse problem which requires an experimental data and an iterative solution. This inverse problem is an iterative procedure for solving the forward problem and hence, the ode45 solver will be nested within nlinfit.Using the above algorithm the estimated parameter values are given in Table 2 . Table 2 , the basic reproduction number is R 0 = 8.45. This indicates every infected individual can probably infect on average 8 individuals per unit time.Similar to [25] , we also calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The MAE and RMSE are used to determine the accuracy of the predictions which are also called the performance metrics. The computed values of MAE and RMSE are 2.464511452058917e −10 and 12.77, respectively. The values for MAE and RMSE show noticeably small compared to the results observed in [21, 25] . This indicates that the model simulation fitted very well to the real data. The MAE is given as:and the RMSE:where N p represents the data sample size.

The basic principle is that if the residuals appear to be behaving arbitrarily, it is sound to conclude that the model matches the actual data. However, if the non-random structure is noticeable in the residuals, the model presumed is not good enough to represent the data. Or the data are not suitable for the model. Fig. 2 shows the fitting of the susceptible and infected population. Fig. 2a depicts the fitting of the susceptible model output to the real susceptible population and the COVID-19 model simulation to the COVID-19 observed data is presented Fig. 2b . Furthermore, the fitting of the recovery confirmed population to the recovery model simulation is seen in Fig. 2c . In all cases, the continuous line depicts the output of the model simulation, and the dotted points represent the actual observed data taken from Ethiopia. Even though some data points do not fit well, overall the model simulation and the actual data fit well.Residuals plots for the model and the real observed data are presented in Fig. 2d . As given in Fig. 2d , the residuals seem to be random and the errors are reasonably small for the model. The possible implication of this is the model fits very well to the field data of Ethiopia. In general, the outcome of the model validation shows that the estimated parameters are reasonable and hence the assumed model fits well to the real data. Table 3 .Model simulation fitting to the system variables data in Table 3 and the residuals plot.of this is the model fits very well to the field data of Ethiopia. In general, the outcome of the model validation shows that the estimated parameters are reasonable and hence the assumed model fits well to the real data.It is natural that some of the parameters in the disease dynamics maybe related and others be unrelated. An increase in one parameter may cause in an increase in the other parameter. During the parameter estimation of the parameters some of these could covary. Covariance is the measure of how the parameter p i is related with p j . The covariance matrix approximates the uncertainties in the model parameters. The interrelations between the parameters is based on the signs. If the sign of the covariance is positive, then an increase in one parameter causes in an increase in the other parameter. If the covariance between any two parameters is 0, then parameters are not related. However, if the covariance between two parameters is negative, then an increase in one parameter will cause in a decrease in the other parameter. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix is the variances of the parameters and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances between all potential pairs of parameter. The matrix Π is positive semidefinite and symmetric. The covariance matrix Π for the model is:The covariance between the transmission coefficient rate (µ) and the recovery rate (β ), the transmission coefficient rate (µ) and the rate of death due to infection (γ) is negative. The possible implication is that an increase in one parameter value may result in a decrease of the other. On the other hand, the covariance between the recovery rate (β ) and the rate of disease induced death rate (γ) is zero. This indicates that an increase/or decrease in one parameter does not cause in an increase or decrease of the other parameter. The summary of the covariance of the model is depicted in Table 4 . C µ,β Negative C µ,γ Negative C β ,γ ZeroSensitivity analysis is the vital tool to investigate the importance of each parameter for the system Eq. (1) in prevalence and transmission of the disease. This tool is usually applied to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameters as errors occurred in collected data and presumed parameter values [26] . In particular, sensitivity analysis is used to identify parameters of the system that would have great influence to the basic reproduction number, described in Section 3.2, and should be targeted by intervention strategies through the stakeholders.To this end, we employ the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable for the system relative to each parameter, that could be defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter [26, 27] . Definition 4.1. [26] [27] [28] . The normalized forward sensitivity index of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is differentiable with respect to each parameter of the system is defined byFollowing Eq. (13), we calculate the normalized forward sensitivity index of R 0 with respect to each parameter as follows:The estimated values of model parameters and sensitivity indices of R 0 are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 , respectively. Table 6 : Sensitivity indices of R 0 calculated at the estimated parameter values presented in Table 5 .Note that one should carefully estimate the sensitive parameter, since a small change in the parameter causes a big quantitative changes. In contrast, it could be given less emphasizes in estimation of a parameter with small value for the sensitive index, because a small variation in that parameter could not bring a significant quantitative changes.The sensitivity index of R 0 remains independent of any parameter with respect to the parameter µ. On the other hand, it depends on the parameters β and γ with respect to the parameters β and γ, as it can be seen in Eq. (14) . Hence, Table 6 shows that R 0 is highly sensitive to the parameters µ and β . It is clear that R 0 attains its maximum value with the parameter, µ. In particularly, an increase (decrease) the value of µ by 100% will increase (decrease) R 0 by same value 100%, and an increase (decrease) the value of β by 100% will increase (decrease) the value of R 0 by 91.42%. On the other hand, an increase (decrease) the value of γ by 100% will increase (decrease) R 0 by 8.58%, respectively.Numerical results of system Eq. (1) are discussed in this section. Based on the real data collected from 14 March to 12 June 2020 in Ethiopia presented in Table 3 , we estimated the parameters' values of the system Eq. (1), and perform numerical simulations to investigate the impact of the most and least sensitive parameters at the estimated values of parameters. We also carry out numerical simulations and predictions using the estimated parameters' values. For simulation purpose, we set the following values as initial conditions: S 0 = N − 1, I 0 = 1, R 0 = 0, and D 0 = 0, where N is the total size of Ethiopian population given by N = 115 millions [2] .This subsection is devoted to show the numerical simulation results are in accordance with the sensitivity analysis results in Section 4.3. As can be observed, for example, from Fig. 3b a small increase in the transmission parameter results in a great effect in the transmission of the disease in the community which is in agreement with the result in Table 6 . Fig. 3 shows the solution trajectories of the system by varying the rate of the transmission of the disease, µ, and the recovery rate, β . An increase in the rate of transmission µ causes a decrease in the susceptible population (Fig. 3a) . However, an increase in the rate of this parameter increases in the dynamics of the disease (Fig. 3b ). More precisely, increasing µ from 0.000000000376963 to 0.000000000476963 and 0.000000000576963 resulted in significant decline in the susceptible individuals. In contrast, increasing the parameter µ from 0.000000000376963 to 0.000000000476963 and 0.000000000576963 causes in significant increase in the infected population.On the other hand, Fig. 3c reveals that decreasing the rate of recovery β from 0.007176440779023 to 0.006176440779023 and 0.005176440779023 results in significant decrease in the number of susceptible individuals. Conversely, the infected population increases while the rate of recovery decreases, as depicted in Fig. 3d . Thus, our results are in agreement with results reported in the sensitivity analysis (Table 6) . Therefore, to minimize or eradicate the disease from the population policymakers are recommended to minimize the rate of transmission of the disease.This subsection is devoted to show the numerical simulation results are in accordance with the sensitivity analysis results in Section 4.3. As can be observed, for example, from Fig. 3b a small increase in the transmission parameter results in a great effect in the transmission of the disease in the community which is in agreement with the result in Table 6. ). However, an increase in the rate of this parameter increases µ ). More precisely, increasing from 0.000000000376963 to 0.000000000476963 and 0.000000000576963 resulted in significant decline in the susceptible to 0.000000000476963 and 0.000000000576963 resulted in significant decline in the susceptible µ individuals. In contrast, increasing the parameter from 0.000000000376963 to 0.000000000476963 and 0.000000000576963 causes in significant increase in the infected population. in significant increase in the infected population. β On the other hand, Fig. 3c reveals that decreasing the rate of recovery from 0.007176440779023 to 0.006176440779023 and 0.005176440779023 results in significant decrease in the number of susceptible individuals. Table 2 .Based on the results in the sensitivity analysis, the disease-induced death rate of COVID-19 is the least sensitive parameter. The numerical simulation of the system by varying this parameter, γ, is presented in Fig. 4 . It is evident from Fig. 4a and Fig. 4c that the susceptible and recovered populations associated with decreasing of the disease induced death rate is not significant. Precisely, decreasing γ from 0.000673679204030 to 0.000573679204030 and 0.000473679204030 resulted in insignificant decrease in the susceptible and recovered populations. It is also clear from Fig. 4b that the spread of the disease associated with decreasing of the rate of death due to the disease is not significant. Moreover, decreasing γ from 0.000673679204030 to 0.000573679204030 and 0.000473679204030 causes insignificant increase in the disease dynamics as compared to the most sensitive parameter. However, decreasing γ from 0.000673679204030 to 0.000573679204030 and 0.000473679204030 shows decreasing in the dead population, as shown in Fig. 4d . Table 2 .The behavior of state variables in the proposed model using the estimated parameters is described in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a represents the human susceptible population to CODID-19. Fig. 5b depicts the population infected with COVID-19. It shows that the infected population with COVID-19 is small at the beginning and are monotonically increasing eventually. Fig. 5c describes the humans size recovered from COVID-19. The number of recovered individuals continues to be high in number as the number of days increases. Moreover, Fig. 5d exhibits that the number of dead individuals become monotonically increasing. Table 2 .Ethiopia declared its first confirmed COVID-19 case on 14 March 2020 [1] , and continues reporting daily new cases. Prediction of the pandemic is most essential to take effective and efficient strategic intervention measures. Hence, this analysis aims to investigate the trend of the pandemic COVID-19 in Ethiopia using the value of the estimated parameters in Table 2 . It attempts to carry out a numerical simulation of the system Eq. (1) for the prediction of COVID-19 for 60 days. To achieve this, we use the final values of the state variables as an initial condition of the system Eq. (1). The number of state variables for the next 60 days is depicted in Fig. 6 . It can be observed from this that the number of susceptible individuals decreases monotonically (Fig. 6a) . And the number of infected, recovered, and dead individuals are increasing rapidly (Fig. 6b, Fig. 6c, and Fig. 6d ). According to this numerical simulation, policymakers need to enforce preventive measures such as wearing a face mask and disinfecting and decontamination of contaminated areas to flatten the curve. Table 2 when the initial population is (S 0 , I 0 , R 0 , D 0 ) = (114999781, 193, 24, 2).The analysis from the prediction of our system reveals high variations in the cumulative number of infected, recovered, and died individuals relative to the official data published on August 11, 2020 [2] . On the 11th of August 2020, the system predicted 113,877 cumulative number of infections, while the reported cumulative number of infected individuals was 24,175. On 11 August 2020, the projected cumulative numbers of recoveries and deaths were 13,951 and 1,310, respectively, while the confirmed cumulative numbers recorded were 10,696 for the recovered and 440 for the dead individuals. The variation between the real reported cumulative data and the forecasted cumulative value could be attributed to the lack of inclusion of protection measures in the proposed system.In this paper, we proposed a SIRD simple mathematical model to address the current COVID-19 transmission dynamics and predicting its future trends in Ethiopia. We carried out the local and global stability analysis of the disease free-equilibrium point E 0 in case of R 0 < 1 based on the geometric method presented in [29] . Based on the reported data of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, we also estimated the value of the parameters transmission rate, the recovery rate, and the disease-induced death rate. A graphical method is applied to validate the model. Our result shows that the proposed model fits well with the real data reported in the country for 91 days. It is found out from the sensitivity analysis that the rate of transmission parameter is the most sensitive parameter. The epidemiological implication of this is that an increase in this parameter could aggravate the disease in the community. On the other hand, the disease-induced death rate is the least sensitive parameter. Meaning an increase or decrease in this parameter does not result in a substantial spread of the disease. Furthermore, the reproduction number estimated for the case of Ethiopia is found out to be R 0 = 8.45. The biological significance of this finding is that the elimination of COVID-19 may not be achieved in the population in a short period. Unlike the authors [21] who have considered a discrete differential equation with the frequency-dependent force of infection, we proposed an ordinary differential equation with a linear force of infection. The numerical experiment, based on the estimated parameter values, of the system exhibited a small number of infected individuals at the beginning and are increasing eventually. Numerical results of the model in the prediction also indicated a significant variation in the cumulative number of infected variables relative to the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases. The variation may be resulted from the lack of incorporating the intervention strategic measures to the system. In addition, our findings on the short-term prediction of the disease show that the disease will aggravate in the community. This result is in agreement with results obtained in [30] .The study has limitations. First, the values of the parameters defining the system are determined by applying field data to COVID-19. Estimating the parameters is a difficult task due to the absence of a significant part of the infectious cycle. The most important limitation is the use of ode45 and the optimization method nlinfit to find the optimum parameters. nlinfit is an optimization strategy that can obtain both positive and negative optimum parameters, but the required parameter values are non-negative. In this case, we have to simulate the system using different initial values of parameters until we get positive optimum parameter values. In addition, this paper considers a deterministic model with a homogeneous population mixing assumption, ignoring the stochastic model assumption and the spatial distribution of the population. It has also failed to include intervention measures like vaccination, quarantine, and social distancing. Although our assumed system answers relevant questions, extending the system into an age-structured and model with implementing vaccination may result in a wide range of global dynamics [31] [32] [33] . Therefore, incorporating these into the system would be an exciting area of future research to foresee their impacts on the transmission and mitigation of the epidemic in Ethiopia.The authors declare that they have no any conflict of interest. a linear force of infection. The numerical experiment, based on the estimated parameter values, of the system exhibited a small number of infected individuals at the beginning and are increasing eventually. Numerical results of the model in the prediction also indicated a significant variation in the cumulative number of infected variables relative to the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases. The variation may be resulted from the lack of incorporating the intervention strategic measures to the system. In addition, our findings on the e vaccination, quarantine, and social distancing. Although our assumed system answers relevant questions, extending the system into an age-structured and model with implementing vaccination may result in a wide range of global dynamics [","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-29",1

Mathematical models are commonly used in many fields, such as medicine [39] , agriculture [25, 47] , management and social sciences [41] and references cited therein. Such models can either be linear or nonlinear, stochastic or deterministic. In the health sector, mathematical models have been used to forecast disease outbreaks, avoid or cure these illnesses. Currently, there are many mathematical models used to explain disease processes and they can be found in books dedicated to mathematical models in biology and medicine, for more details, refer the reader to [10, 18, 26, 35] . By the end of December 2019, the world's deadly coronavirus pandemic, popularly known as COVID-19, erupted in the ancient town of Wuhan Hubei Province, China spreading almost through several countries in 2020 [2] . Several unexplained cases of cough, pneumonia, dyspnea, exhaustion and there were fever in Wuhan, China, for a short period. The arrival of COVID-19 resulted in the closure of business, schools, markets, traveling within and outside, intermingle, curfew, lockdown, reduction of gathering to mention but a few [3] .Nigeria has fallen into the category of nations affected by the coronavirus pandemic. February 27, 2020, culminated in the arrival of the pioneer case of COVID-19 in Lagos state southwestern Nigeria when an Italian citizen arrived on 24 February and presented at a health facility on 26 February 2020 [1] . Before the arrival of COVID-19 into Nigeria, the Federal government with some states in Nigeria established various medical agencies and isolation centers to handle and stop the spread of the pandemic. The Federal government through its Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) provide appropriate public health advice to Nigerians, on the symptoms, dissemination, and prevention of information with national and sub-national networks of public health staff, built capacity for contact tracing and case management and strengthened some laboratories for diagnostic activities of the pandemic.With the arrival of COVID-19, researchers have been using and formulating mathematical models as a technique in gaining insight into the mode of spread of the pandemic, transmission, impact of the pandemic, prevention and control of the pandemic, the influence of preventive measure on the pandemic ranging from washing hands with a disinfectant such as a hand sanitizer, 2 to 5 meters social distance and use of face mask, see the recent literature [20, 33, 34, 36, 43, 48, 50, [53] [54] [55] . Okuonghae and Omame [38] analyzed the spread and behavior of COVID-19 in Lagos, Nigeria. Roseline et al. [37] used the linear regression method to modeled the rate of fatality of the pandemic in Nigeria. Adegboye et al. [6] dealt with early spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Ajisegiri et al. [9] analyzed the outbreak scenario of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Researchers in different areas have presented excellent research on preventive and curative steps to contain the pandemic and have reported better outcomes. However, a further review of the latest form of models with a justified and satisfactory evaluation is required.In all of the research cited above, the models presented therein were based On classical derivatives with some restrictions on the order of differential equations involved. To overcome these limitations, several researchers have sought the aid of a rapidly growing field of mathematics known as fractional calculus. The differential operators used in fractional calculus are non-integer or fractional order, which have memory features and are useful in demonstrating many natural phenomena and facts having non-local dynamics behavior. The concept of fractional order has gained significant attention due to its wide-ranging advances and various applications in knowledge areas, see [13, 14, 21, 22, 32, 40] . Recently, Atangana and Baleanu [16] proposed a new fractional derivative operator with a nonsingular and Mittag-Leffer kernel. The main advantage of the operator is that it has a nonlocal and nonsingular kernel. More recently, new advances and studies in fractional differential equations has been published from a mathematical modeling point of view, see recent papers [4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 19, 27-30, 44, 46, 52] .The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we formulated the model together with the description of the parameters defined in the model. In Section 3, we obtain the invariant region. Also, we compute the basic reproduction number and study it is disease-free equilibrium (DF E), local stability, the existence of endemic equilibrium, local stability of the endemic equilibrium, and global stability of the endemic equilibrium. The existence and uniqueness of solutions were investigated via the techniques of fixed point theorems in Section 4. In Section 5, we present the model fitting as well as the estimation of the parameters. Besides, sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation are also highlighted. Finally, we give the conclusion of the paper in Section 6. In this research paper, a model of the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using simple rates of transmission is considered. Let N (t) be the total population of human. This population is divided into seven classes: susceptible individuals S(t), exposed individuals E(t), asymptotically infected individuals I A (t), symptomatic infected individuals I S (t), quarantined individuals Q(t), and individuals that have recovered/remove from COVID-19 R(t). Based on this consideration, the total population is N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + Q(t) + I A (t) + I S (t) + R(t).The natural human natality and mortality rates are denoted by Λ and µ respectively. Susceptible individuals (S) gets infected from enough contact with exposed individuals (E) at the rate of β or just move to quarantined class at the rate of τ . The exposed individuals (E) may move to quarantined (Q) class first or get infected without symptoms (asymptomatic) (I A ) or with symptoms (symptomatic) (I S ) at the rates of γ, σ and η respectively. Also quarantined individuals (Q) may be confirmed infected through a test with symptoms (I S ) or without symptoms (I A ) at the rates of υ and θ respectively. The asymptomatic infected individuals (I A ) may recover at the rate of r 1 and the symptomatic infected individuals (I S ) at the rate of r 2 .Each of these classes may decrease as a result of natural mortality µ, while the class of individuals infected with symptoms (I S ) may also decrease as a result of death from the disease at the rate of δ. In the infected class of individuals without symptoms (I A ), the death as a result of the disease is not considered. The possibility of reinfection after recovery has not been considered in this model. Through the schematic diagram depicted in Figure 2 .2, a system of nonlinear differential equations is obtained and presented below:subject to the following initial conditions: Rate of transfer of exposed individuals to quarantine η Rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatic infected individuals class θRate of quarantined individuals to asymptomatic infected individuals class µ Natural mortality rate υRate of transfer of quarantined individuals to symptomatic infected individuals class σRate of transfer of exposed individuals to asymptomatic individuals class Λ Recruitment (natality) rate r 1 Recovery rate of asymptomatic infected individuals r 2Recovery rate of symptomatic infected individualsReproduction number is vital in the study of infection disease model [23] . This section presents the computation and presentation of basic reproduction number and invariant region for the proposed model (2.1) and study the • Locally asymptotically stability of its disease free equilibrium (see Theorem 3.1).• Unique endemic equilibrium point (see Theorem 3.2).• Locally asymptotically stability of its unique endemic equilibrium point (see Theorem 3.3).• Globally asymptotically stable of its endemic equilibrium (see Theorem 3.5). 3.1. Invariant region.Having described the human population in the model (2.1), it is vital to show that the state parameters S(t), E(t), Q(t), I A (t), I S (t), R(t) are nonnegative for all t ≥ 0. Solution with positive initial data remains positive for all t ≥ 0 and are bounded. It is easy to see from systems (2.1) that dN (t) dt = Λ−µN (t)−δI S (t) and sup t→+∞ N (t) ≤ Λ µ . As such we can study the system (2.1) in the following feasible region:is now positive invariant in relation to (2.1) . Meaning the proposed model (2.1) is epidemiologically well posed and all solutions of the system with (S(t), E(t), Q(t), I A (t), I S (t), R(t)) ∈ R 6 + remain in Ω.Setting the parameters E = Q = I A = I S = R = 0, the disease free equilibrium is obtained. Therefore, the system (2.1) indicates that the DFE point is given byThe basic reproduction number denoted by R 0 is the expected value of infection rate per time unit. The infection occurs in a susceptible population, caused by an infected individual. Based on the system (2.1), the article generates an equation that involves the classes of exposed and infected population. The disease reproduction number R 0 of the proposed model (2.1) is defined herein in the infected classes. This threshold quantity has been described in [23, 51] . In all cases, R 0 < 1 implies that disease will decline, whereas R 0 > 1 implies that disease will persist within a community and R 0 = 1 requires further investigation. R 0 is obtained using the next generation matrix approach [23] where several authors have used it. We implore the use of a next-generation matrix to find the basic reproduction number for the model (2.1). Without loss of generality, it is clear from the model (2.1), the article generates an equation that involves the classes of the exposed population, infected population without symptom, and infected population with symptom as follows: Referring to [51] , from the equations (3.3), the study generates matrix F and V, i.e.The Jacobian matrix of F and V at DFE, denoted by F and V are given as follows:Therefore, FV −1 is the next generation matrix of the model structure (3.3). So, as described in [23] , R 0 = ρ(FV −1 ) where ρ stands for spectral radius of the next-generation matrix FV −1 . Thus,3.3. Local stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium.Proof. The Jacobian matrix with respect to the system (2.1) is given by:The characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix at DFE is given byContaining Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Classes §12 Page 12/42Simplifying and solving for λ, givesThis completes the proof.In this subsection, we look at the existence of endemic equilibrium point. Let us denote the endemic equilibrium bywill be used henceforth. This endemic equilibrium always satisfies:From the first Equation of (3.6), we obtainInserting (3.7) in the second Equation of (3.6), we getContaining Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Classes §13 Page 13/42Using (3.8) and (3.9) in the third Equation of (3.6), givesSubstituting Equations (3.8) and (3.10), in the fourth Equation of (3.6), we haveInserting Equations (3.8) and (3.10), in the fifth equation of (3.6) we getBringing Equations (3.11) and (3.12), into the sixth equation of (3.6), yieldsThus, we conclude with the following theorem.Theorem 3.2. The system (2.1) has unique endemic equilibrium point given by 3.5. Local stability analysis of the endemic equilibrium E 1 .Proof. The Jacobian matrix with respect to the system (2.1) is given by:which implies,The characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix at E 1 is given by det(J E1 − λI) = 0. where λ is the eigenvalue and I is 6 × 6 identity matrix. Thus,Simplifying the characteristic polynomial (i.e making the characteristic equation) and solving for λ, gives(3.14)The quadratic λ 2 + (τ + µ)R 0 λ + (γ + µ + η + σ) 2 has all terms positive and thus, its roots must all be negative. Meanings λ 5,6 < 0. This completes the proof. 3.6. Global stability analysis of the endemic equilibrium E 1 .Theorem 3.4. The system (2.1) has no periodic orbits.Proof. We employ the Dulac's criterion to achieve this. Now, let X = (S, E, Q, I A , I S , R).Taking the Dulac's function Thus,Hence, the system (2.1) has no periodic orbit. This completes the proof.Since Ω is positively invariant, it follows from Poincaré-Bendixson theorem that all solutions of the system (2.1) originate and remain in Ω for all t. We conclude with the following theorem:Theorem 3.5. The endemic equilibrium E 1 for the system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 > 1.In the current research work, researchers have shown that mathematical models constructed with the aid of fractional operators are often more precise and reliable compared to the integer-order case due to the enhanced degree of freedom. In fractional-order models, the memory property allows more knowledge from the past to be added, which predicts and translates models more accurately. Recently, Atangana and Baleanu [16] , introduced new fractional derivatives without singularity and locality. The non-singularity and non-locality of Idris the kernel give a better description of the memory. The aforementioned operator has found wide applications to model dynamics processes in many wellknown fields of science, engineering, biology, medicine, and many other, see [5, 17, 17, 31, 45] and the references cited therein. Besides, in comparisons with classical Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, the AB operator recorded the highest efficiency in terms of experimental data and numerical efficiency [42] . Motivated by the above-mentioned application, in this section, we generalize the proposed model (2.1) to fractional order in the sense of ABC-fractional derivative and study the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the generalized model using the techniques of fixed point theorems. Now, before we generalize the model (2.1), we recall some preliminaries definitions which are important throughout the section. is called the ABC-fractional operator where N (r) represent the normalization function and satisfies N (0) = N (1) = 1 and E α (·) denotes the one-parameter Mittag-Leffler function of form:.Definition 4.2.[16] The fractional operatoris referred to fractional integral operator associated with ABC-fractional derivative.Therefore, the proposed nonlinear fractional model in the sense of ABC- fractional operator is of the form:where ABC D α 0 (·) is the ABC-fractional derivative of order (0 < α ≤ 1) and the variables are assumed to be non-negative with appropriate initial conditions.Remark. It is worth mentioning here that, the parameters are assumed to be non-negative and have dimension time. In this paper, the dimensionality consistency was taking into consideration when fictionalized the integer-order model as the dimension of each left-hand side equation carries time −α , (α > 0), whereas the right sides remains dimensionally time −1 . This technique was proposed by Diethelm in [24] . which implies(4.7)The kernels in Equations (4.7) satisfies the Lipschitz condition for 0 ≤ M i < 1, i = 1, 2, · · · 6, if and only if the nonlinear functions S(t), E(t), Q(t), I A (t), I S (t)Containing Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Classes §20 Page 20/42and R(t) have an upper bound. Indeed, suppose S(t) and S * (t) be two functions, then we getwhereRepeating the same procedure as in Equation (4.8) above, we have where M i (i = 1, 2, · · · 6) are the corresponding Lipschitz constant for the functions F i (·) for i = 1, 2, · · · , 6.Page 21/42Now, Equation (4.6) can be written in recursive form given by Let us denote difference between successive components by Φ i n , i = 1, 2, · · · 6. So,. Taking the norm on both side of Equations (4.12) and using Equations (4.9) −Page 23/42 (4.10) yields Now, we are ready to state and prove the main theorem based on the above results. T α < 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , 6. (4.14)Proof. Since from the assumptions the functions S(t), E(t), Q(t), I A (t), I S (t), R(t) are bounded and satisfies the Lipschitz condition. Thus, in view of Equation Hence, the sequences above exist and as n −→ ∞, Φ i n (t) −→ 0, i = 1, 2, · · · 6. Also, utilizing the triangular inequality for any k, Equation (4.15) yieldswhere the P i , i = 1, 2, · · · 6, are the terms within the bracket of Equations (4.15) and the condition 1−α theorem the function S n , E n , Q n , I S,n , I A,n and R n constitute a Cauchy sequence in E. So, applying the limit theory on the equation (4.11) as n → ∞ shows that the limit of these sequences is the unique solution of the proposed model (4.4) . In addition, we conclude the existence of a unique solution of the proposed model (4.4).One of the essential mechanisms for evaluating the transmission dynamics of a disease is the validation of a newly developed epidemiological model. The availability of real data for the underlying ailment contributes significantly to the completion of this task and the real data gives us an insight into how to determine the best values of some of the model's unknown biological parameters. To this end, we employ the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting method with the help of ""fminsearch"" function from the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox. This approach states that, if a theoretical model t → Ξ(t, q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q n ) is attained and depend on a few unknown parameters q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q n and a sequence of actual data points (t 0 , y 0 ), . . . , (t j , y j ) is also at hand then the aim is to obtain values of the parameters so that the error calculated can, Fitted parameter Value (Range) Units/remarks Sources τ 0.0002 In this subsection, the concept of sensitivity analysis is used to discover the robust significance of the generic parameters present in the basic reproductive number R 0 . Furthermore, both the analytical and numerical values of the R 0 parameters are derived from precise assumptions using parameter values. If and only if the dynamics follow the model (2.1), the analytical expressions obtained can be used to shed some light on how to track the model's onset in variant locations. The threshold value R 0 is a quantity known to be the primary way of reducing and aborting the ailment spread by reducing the number to less than unity. The sensitivity index technique is used to measure the most sensitive parameters in the model, those with the positive sign are considered to be highly and proportionally sensitive to-the value of R 0 while those with the negative sign are less sensitive to decreasing R 0 and the other category is neutrally sensitive (with zero relative sensitivity). The cause of the transmission of the infringement is commonly recognized to be directly linked to the specific reproduction number R 0 . The R 0 elasticity indices is given by Equation (3.4):where R 0 denotes the basic reproduction ratio and P i is as stated above. Following the described formula, we reach:Containing Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Classes §28 Page 28/42 The numerical values indicating the relative significance of R 0 are given in Table 3 . Some parameters are found to be positive while some are negative. A positive relationship for the parameters implies that an increase in that parameter's values will have a major effect on the frequency of the ailment spread. While a negative relationship means that an increase in the importance of these parameters would help to decrease the violence of the disease. The physical outlook of the numerical signs stated in Table 3 is depicted in Figure 5 .4.To gain insight into the behavior of the solutions, a numerical solution is needed for both the classical order and the proposed fractional-order model as it involves a nonlinear equation. For this task, we used the recent numerical scheme proposed by Toufik and Atangana in [49] . The numerical scheme for the proposed model (4.4) used in the present analysis is presented by: (5.6) To fit the model to the reality of the pandemic, we used the daily cases of the spread of the disease in Nigeria. For this study and for the current situation in the world we are only interested in infected individuals as the week's pass. From Figures 5.5-5.7, we observed that both population of infected individuals I S and I A have been declining as weeks pass which may not be unconnected to existing government restrictions on movement and other contact activities. Not only that, there is a possibility that the government has put in place a public health education system that made the population take safety measures. This further confirmed the result obtained from the fact that a decrease in contact among the population plays a vital role in curtailing the spread of the disease. The behavior of the system further confirmed the current situation in Nigeria. Both the classical and fractional differential equations indicate that the disease is declining with a very high number of recovery. It is therefore easy to understand that in Nigeria restriction on social contact can work wonders in decreasing the number of infected individuals in addition to quarantine and testing. Meaning it should be of particular interest for all that in the fight against the pandemic is the exposure as a result of contact with infected individuals especially that there those who are asymptomatic (I A ). Equally important, there is also a strong agreement between the classical model and the fractional model as seen in Figures 5.5-5.6.In this current work, we developed a simple mathematical model to investigate the transmission and control of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from human to human. Principles drawn from the literature of mathematical epidemiology have been used to model how individuals are exposed and infected with the disease and their possible recovery. The mathematical analysis was done using both the ordinary differential equation (ODE) and the fractional differential equation.It is important for health practitioners and the world at large to understand and predict infected individuals for health concern arrangement of the citizens and to control its spread rate with restricted supply. The data used in the simulation is based on the disease spread in Nigeria. Positivity of the model is established and the basic reproduction number, R 0 is obtained for the model. It is observed that when R 0 < 1 the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable otherwise is unstable. The behavior of the system further confirmed the current situation in Nigeria. Both the classical and fractional differential equations indicate that the disease is declining with a very high number of recovery. It is therefore easy to understand that in Nigeria restriction on social contact can work wonders in decreasing the number of infected individuals in addition to quarantine and testing. Meaning it should be of particular interest for all that in the fight against the pandemic is the exposure as a result of contact with infected individuals especially that there those who are asymptomatic (I A ). Equally important, there is also a strong agreement between the classical model and the fractional model as seen in . Also the endemic equilibrium E 1 exist and globally stable if R 0 > 1. This means that the disease may persist in society. The sensitivity analysis of R 0 concerning the parameters shows that the most sensitive parameter of our model structure that represents Idris the chance of transmission is the contact rate between susceptible persons and exposed persons. It has the most dominant sensitivity to increase the endemicity of the disease while the rate of transfer of individuals to symptomatic class decreases the endemicity of the disease. Also, using the techniques of fixed point theorems, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are presented. Furthermore, given that the non-local (fractional order derivatives and integral) operator is better able to predict the future and better fit the experimental data compared to classical order derivatives and integrals, we have generalized the model to a fractional-order model in the sense of the Atangana-Baeanu derivative. Based on the actual data on the number of infected people in Nigeria and the best fitting techniques, we have obtained some of the values of the model's unknown biological parameters, which successfully captured the COVID-19 pattern for the case α = 1. Therefore, our results of the ODE form of the model present the situation in Nigeria and with this, we may conclude that authorities and health practitioners in Nigeria need to work hard to ensure that the contact between the exposed individual and susceptible individuals is minimized. This calls for strict social distance and quarantine.","Nigeria","abstract","2021-01-06",1

The Beta-coronavirus is the genus and Coronavirdae is the family to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. The SARS-CoV-2 is anSSRV having a 30 kb genome with fourteen ORF consisting of 4 major structural proteins that are nucleocapsid (N), Spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins [7] [8] [9] [10] . Rhinolophusaffinisbat coronavirus RaTG13 hasa J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 93.1% nucleotide sequence identical to that of Spike gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 strains, however only less than 75% nucleotide sequence similarity to that of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 viral S sequences as compared to SARS-CoV have 3 extra short insertions in the N terminal domain & 4 out of 5 key residues changes in the RBM of S protein RBD [9, 10] . The SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV share similar HCR ACE-II, however,SARS-CoV-2 is more rapidly transmitted from humans to humans [1, 7, 11] . For the development of COVID-19 vaccine, the protein S that is a spikeprotein has become a major target, mainly based on the elicitation of viral neutralizing antibodies. The current scenario regarding the vaccine developmental process consists of, 1) 47 vaccine candidates in clinical trial 2) 155 vaccine candidate atpre-clinical stage [12] . and loss of TGFβ [25] . For the inactivated vaccines of the RSV and MERS-CoV after viral challenge, it has been documented that the Th2is associated with immunopathology [13, [26] [27] [28] [13] . It is therefore necessary that vaccines developed against COVID-19 should be carefully assessed while conducting clinical trials [29] . The epitope-rich S1 or RBD part of S protein is considered as a target instead of a whole full-length Spike for the development of a vaccine against MERS-CoV.Owing to the dramatic rise in the number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide, numerous attempts have been stimulated to develop vaccines against this deadly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-22 virus.. About 47 vaccines qualified for clinical-stage entry and more than 155 vaccines are under investigation in the pre-clinical stages [30] .None of the vaccines is having a license for any other coronavirus affecting human subjects like SARS or MERS. One of the significant reasons for the absence of vaccines is due to financial constraints. However other reasons also exist, including the design of the vaccines, transient immune-responsiveness, and toxicity concerns in pre-clinical models [31] . Due to several challengesoccurringin the development of the vaccine; discussed further in section 5.0 of this paper, developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is an onerous task to perform.Multiple methodologies are adopted for developing vaccines including both the next generation as well as conventional techniques. In the case of coronavirus, live attenuated vaccines has safety concerns however inactivated ones have been successful up to pre-clinical in the primate models [32] . In the case of COVID-19, within seven days, the immunized macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were shielded from extreme ailment & virus levels, while placebo-subjected macaques endured SIN.The human phase I and II clinical trials of the inactivated vaccine are ongoing in China [30] .The S protein of SARS-CoV-22 is the subject of several efforts. The S protein is an essentialmolecule for viral entry into the host cells, being present on the outer layer of the virus. The antibodies targeting the S protein will prevent the virus from entering the host cell, thereby preventing the virus from replicating inside the host cell machinery. [33] . On the 10 th of January 2020, the full genetic sequence of S protein was released globally providing an idea for the development of a vaccine [4, 10, 33] . The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the UK are based on S protein. The researchers at the University of Oxford have modified a chimp adenovirus vector that carries genes encoding this Spike protein.Infecting human cells with this adenovirus will lead to the production of spike protein and became a valid target for the immune response. Approximately J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 1,000 subjects were recruited by the sponsor for phase 1 human clinical trial, initiated on 23 April 2020. [30] . A phase I/II preliminary study performed on the patient between 23 April and 21 May 2020 was published by the same sponsor in August.The vaccine has been reported to have a good safety profile along with both cellular and humoral responses produced. [34] .As of 11 th November 2020, the trial is under phase III, results of which are awaiting.The novel strategy for vaccine development is the use of mRNA; however, no licensed vaccines have previously used this methodology. The concept for mRNA is based on injecting mRNA encoding S protein and allowing host cell machinery to prepare the said protein. The merit of this methodology is allowing rapid scale production with a straightforward route. In the USA, mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 have entered clinical trials and interim findings from phase III clinical trials have indicated 90 per cent effectiveness in participants with no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. [35] .The vaccines which are already being developed for other ailmentsare repurposed for COVID-19 as an alternative means of virus control. There areseveral vaccines for other ailments other than COVID-19 globally, which are being re-investigated for coronavirus control. The BCG vaccine which is already marketed against tuberculosis can boost the immune system offering some protection in many ailments, from influenza to bladder tumors [36, 37] .Many investigations have suggested an epidemiological correlation between reduced national occurrence of COVID-19 and community coverage of BCG. [38, 39] . There are about 5 clinical trials recruiting healthcare professionals to study whether BCG shows any protection against SARS-CoV-2 [30] . The other repurposed vaccines consist of OPV & MMR vaccine [40, 41] .The scientists are now hypothesizing that BCG can offer protection to COVID-19, and some publications support this claim [42] . The basic crux behind the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hypothesis is that the US and Italy have suffered high mortality because of COVID-19 than BCG vaccinated countries like Japan, South Korea [43] .However,other multiple factors can give rise to COVID infection-related mortality in different places of the world. Many clinical investigations are ongoing to estimate BCG vaccination's effect on the possible responses from SARS-CoV-2 like in the Netherlands, The US, and Australia in the high-risk subjects (health care workers and older), whether it might provide protection [44] from COVID [42] . A study in Germany are investigating VPM1000, which is an rDNA vaccine candidate derived from BCG, could prevent older or health care professionals from SARS-Cov-2 [42] The relation of MMR vaccination and COVID associated death rate hasbeen suggested by the worldwide epidemiological data [44] . Several investigators did not agree to this statement for the live MMR vaccines other than BCG. Many countries like Latin American (Argentina, Ecuador, Chile) and Iran maintained more than ninety percent vaccine coverage from 1985 till the high death rate from SARS-CoV2 [44] . The MMR is a live attenuated virus-based vaccine.MMR is currently in phase III clinical trial (NCT04357028) against COVID-19.The hypothesis regarding the repurposing of the MMR vaccine is that antibodies can be generated against measles, which may cross-react with SARS-CoV2 [45] .Much effort is being made to develop vaccine against COVID-19 on accounts to Table 1and Table 2 spleen. Delivery can also be done using the electroporation method [50] . There are some groups, on the other hand, working on a needle-free delivery system, for example, Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc./EpiVax, Inc./PharmaJet [51] . RNAbased vaccines are classified as conventional and self-amplifying RNAs.Traditionally mRNA-based vaccines encode the antigen of interest and contain untranslated regionsfrom 5ʹ and 3ʹ, whist self-amplifying RNAs(same RNAs) encode viral replication mechanism in addition to viral antigen permitting intracellular RNA amplification and profuse protein synthesis [52] .Notwithstanding the numerous advantages of nucleotide vaccines,there are no approved mRNA/DNA vaccines so far available for the public used. If any vaccine for COVID-19 happens to be from this category then it will be the first of its kind. November 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their vaccine candidate demonstrated evidence of efficacy in 90% of participants, who were not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infectionbefore injection,based on the first interim efficacy analysis from the Phase 3 clinical study [35] .Vectored vaccines are constructed from a carrier such as adeno or pox virus which has been modified to contain a gene from the virus of interest [58] . The platform is broadly classified as replicating and NRVV.Ads are extensively studied vectors for vaccine development attributable for its few potential benefits including their capacity to taint a wide range of hosts and to initiate elevated levels of transgene expression without the capability of the infectious viral gene being incorporated into the host genome; moreover, Ads can be fabricated safely and cheaply. Adenoviral vectors can be made nonreplicating by removal of the fundamental gene for replication (E1 genes).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f genes.Asthe E1 gene stays intact, as an outcome, these vectors have restricted ability for foreign gene insertion in comparison to RDV [59] .Extensively studied Ads are human Ads serotype 5(AdHu5) but because ofthe high frequency of AdHu5 neutralizing antibodies (NAs) found across the human populace, the efficiency of gene transfer by the vector is affected leading to diminishing potency of the vaccine. To beat this issue, Ads procured from numerous different species are tried to fill in as potential immunization vectors.Ads derived from chimpanzees were found to be advantageous as AdCs can be easily produced in a human cell line. Moreover, in comparison to human serotypes of Ad (AdHus),their seroprevalence in the human population is low, because they rarely circulated in humans [60] AdCsare currentlybeing utilized forthe development of the COVID-19vaccine, for instance, asingledose of avaccine candidate, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(Oxford University/ AstraZeneca) has demonstrated to protect six rhesus macaques from the incidence of pneumonia invoked by the virus. The vaccine manifested safety profile within an acceptable range and subsequent booster doses increased antibody immune responses in phase I/II single-blind, randomized control trials [34] . There are many more vectors being investigated for their efficiency as vaccine candidates. Subunit vaccines incorporate just the parts, or antigens, that best invigorate the immune system framework. Since there is no live fragment involve, there is no danger of prompting a disease [61] . Subunit antibodies can be additionally classified into Protein-based subunit vaccines, Polysaccharide vaccines, and Conjugate subunit vaccines [48] . Protein subunit vaccines are more steady and safer than live attenuated and inactivated/killed vaccines. They can be manufactured in a more cost-efficient manner as compared to other types of vaccines [47] . A shortcoming of this strategy is that if isolated proteins get denatured, may bind to different antibodies than the targeted protein of the pathogen [48] . Centre are testing their unique ADDomerTM multiepitope display vaccine tech in animals. ADDomer is an ADMP-based self-assembling nanoparticle scaffold constructed to promote the plug-and-play display of numerous immunogenic epitopes from pathogens. What is unique about ADDomer-based vaccines is that it is thermostable thus making it free from cold storagerequirements [66] .However, safety and efficacy in preventing SAR-CoV 2 infection are not proved yet. The passive immunization is an old procedure however reegrading SARS-CoV2 it is gaining scientific importance. The non availability of therapies against COVID-19 has triggered a pandemic, and now every scientific way is is being utilized to takle this crisis. The available reports of passive immunization against COVID-19 was intiated by Chinese and south Korea researchers [68] . A lot of publications have reported that passive immunization could be a great alternative unless and until some effective treatments are available like vaccines [69] . It was reported by Shen et al. that the application of convalescent plasma could be an available approach against COVID-19 subjects suffering from respiratory failure and with this approach they reported success in JAMA. In about five patients the passive immunization was effective with a decrease in viral load within 12 days after the transfusion however these antiviral drugs were not showing any effect [69] .It has been reported that MSC therapy could act as a potential candidate for COVID-19 by treating ARDS and the hypercytokinemia [70] . There are about thirty-one clinical trials registered on the NIH CTD which are going on, that are selectively for COVID-19 despite the absence of any pre-clinical evidences in covid models [70] . Due to COVID-19 the death rate is rising the MSC are being investigated in the clinical settings to find out that whether it can show some proming outcome in the corona positive subjects. The subjects who received the MSC demonstrated lower TNF-α and high IL-10 levels as compared to placebo, but only three subjects were included in the study, so MSC can have a great potential in treating COVID-19 [70] .Structural proteins that are coveringthe SARS-CoV-2 surface serveas potential vaccination targets. These structures include the protein S, the protein E, protein M and the protein N [46] Table 4 ). The potential components of S protein for use as antigens include the FLSP, the RBD domain, the S1 subunit, the S2 subunit, the N-terminal domain (NTD), and membrane fusion peptide (FP) [72] The S protein of coronaviruses is essential in promoting viral entry into target cells. Several researchers have discoveredS2RBD in S protein and found that the RBD protein firmly binds to hACE2 receptors. The investigation further affirmed SARS-CoVRBD(S-RBD) generated antibodies that cross-react with S2-RBD protein, and S-RBD-actuated antisera cross-kill SARS-CoV-2, recommending the possibility to create SARS-CoV RBD-based immunizations for counteraction of SARS-CoV2 infection [73] Most advanced spike protein-based candidate, ChAdOx 1 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford Jenner Institute. The vaccine contains the optimized full-length surfaceS glycoprotein sequence of SARS-CoV-2, with a TPA asa leader sequence. It uses a RDCA to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 S protein to induce a protective immune response [34] . The evidence for the effectiveness of the ChAdOx 1 was increased after researchers confirmed that the single-dose protected 6 rhesus macaques from the incidence of pneumoniainvoked by the SAR-COV-2 [74] . No vaccine that is explicitly focusing on nucleocapsid protein has entered clinical trials, however, ImmunityBio, Inc. &NantKwest Inc. vaccine candidate that is a Human Adenovirus Type 5 Vector (hAd5) encoding Spike (S) + Nucleocapsid (N) have entered phase I of a human clinical trial [12] . The M protein of coronavirus has a vital role in virus assemblage [80] . M is positioned amidst S proteins in the virus envelope alongside modest quantities of E and is the prime component in initiating the virus budding process. In the course of viral assembly, M interacts with several other SPsincluding N protein, with E protein, S protein, and also with itself [81] . Significant CD4+ and CD8+T cells mediated immune responses were identified against S2M protein during the recent studies conducted in the virus-infected and recovered patients. S2Mwas recognized significantly and notable reactivity was observed [82] . Past function in viral pathogenesis [84] . A group recently designed the TCEBPIfor COVID-19 using the envelope protein as a target by utilizing an immunoinformatics approach. The designed vaccine however requires thorough testing to guarantee its safety and immunogenic profile [85] . S2E protein is 100% homologous to bat coronavirus and the pangolin coronavirus. Also, lessthan 95% of sequence similarity was noted between the S2E protein and the E protein sequence of SARS-CoV [84] . It is therefore suggested to carry out J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f further investigation to determine and confirm the immunogenicity and efficacy of E protein as a potential vaccine target.Nsp3 contains several functional domains that are important in assisting viral pathogenesis. During the phylogeneticand MSA study of nsp3 protein, It was reported that this protein in SARS-CoV-2 was more analogous to the human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS), and bat coronaviruses (HKU3, HKU4, and HKU9).nps3 can serve as a potential vaccine target, further,an investigation is therefore suggested to validate its potential [78] i) Should be safe, even in immunocompromised people. ii) Should be highly effective and optimally induce 'sterilizing' immunity [86] . iii) Should retail immunogenicity despite adverse storage. iv)Inexpensive v) Free from toxicity and adverse effects vi) Should give long term protection vii) Should have high thermal stability.Vaccine development is a lengthy, expensive process and many challenges arise during the development, manufacturing, and mass distribution.The major challenge in developing COVID 19 vaccine is the fast-tracking of every step in the discovery, development, and evaluation process. This was not the case before the pandemic, asfor any new vaccine to enter a commercial market and be widely available in the public domain, follows extensive safety and efficacy evaluation which usually requiresa minimum duration of 5 years.However, due to an expedited increase in the number of COVID -19 cases worldwide, vaccine regulatory authorities both at international and national J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f levels are forced to fast track every process of development to meet the world's immediate vaccine requirement. Thescientificcommunities are using multiple approaches to shorten development phase including overlapping clinical phase and using advanced computer-aided and biotechnological tools.The fast-tracking ofprocesses arisethe risk of increased side effects. There is an immense possibility that some essential data might go missing or unnoticed at this accelerated speed of development. Researchers are concern about the risk to instances of polio, leaving 200 youngsters with differing degrees of paralysis and several deaths [87] . Therefore manufacturing methodology has to be extremely audited and validated; manufacturers should be extremelymeticulous in producing large quantities of doses of vaccine. This will be challenging during the present race to license the first COVID-19 vaccine and mass-produce a large number of doses.Ideally, vaccination should provide long term protection. However, immunization induced resistance blurs after some time and the loss of protection varies with every disease [88] . Two doses of inactivated polio antibody (IPV) are 90% effective or more against polio and three doses are 99%to 100% effective and the duration of protection lasts for several years to decades [89] . Most promising SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidates in clinical trials require booster doses. It is too early to say any of it provides long term protection.Reinfection is another major aspect affecting theprotection period. A very recent study has confirmed reinfection with genomic evidence. It was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 might flow among the human populace regardless of crowd insusceptibility on account of general infection or immunization.Additionalmonitoring of patients with reinfection will help optimized vaccine design against SARS-CoV2 [90]In the early pandemic situation, there was concern among the scientific community over mutations arising in SARS-CoV-2. However recent studies have indicated no cause for concern.The outcomes of phylogenetic examination of various SARS-CoV-2 strains procured from various nations showed that all the glycoproteins of various strains of SARS-CoV-2, obtained from various nations were strongly related to each other; hence antibody structured against one strain would be successful against the various strains of SARS-CoV-2 from various nations.Nevertheless, it is essential to continuously monitor genomic sequence given the knowledge of previous experience on virus mutation rate [91] . Even if a single vaccine is proven safe and efficacious, large scale manufacturing and distribution will be challenging especially if vaccine candidate belongs to novel technologies as very few manufacturing plant have previous experiences in mass production. The establishment will have to comply with the GLP guidelines for the particular vaccine candidate. Setting up new premises and infrastructures for vaccine production which is meeting complete quality guidelines will have cost involving. Also in the current global rush to develop a vaccine, there is a possibility that this very crucial compliance step might miss adequate attention; posing a potential danger.The challenge is to vaccinate the entire world population. Experts worry that this might be physically difficult to achieve owing to resource scarcity. Also, there should be production balanced against the need for other vaccines. The kind of infrastructure needed for production will depend on the type of vaccine. The world's governments and companies need to invest enough money so that vaccines can be made quickly available. Financial losses may also occur if the pandemic is ended before development phases are completed as experienced from previous epidemics like SARS.So far researchers have assured vaccines for SARS-CoV2 will be ready within a few months. If the first licensed vaccine happens to be from a novel technology platform, it will lead to a revolution in the vaccine development landscape.Since these platforms utilize machine learning,immunoinformatics, biotechnological tools,genomesequencing, and other in-silicoapproaches to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f arrive at the most promising hit molecule, aiding in the reduction of the duration of vaccine development significantly. It will change how we will respond to future emerging virus infection. Some of these candidates have loosened animal toxicity studies and started directly dosing in humans. If such vaccines are successful in justifying such a break from the usual protocol, usage of animal models will also change. International and national vaccine regulatory authorities might be required come up with newer guidelines in conducting preclinical and clinical evaluation studies with thecondition that novel vaccine candidate is successful in providing immunity against the virus for a more extended period.Post-licensure vaccine safety assessment is a long term assessment of adverse event occurring post-vaccination. It is necessary for detecting vaccinerelated rare and LTAEs and keeping uppeople'scertitude in vaccines and following immunization schedules [95] . Such surveillance has to be conducted meticulously using either active or passive methods to determine AEFI/ADE or if there is a decrease of immunity.Keeping entire hope on a vaccine to end the pandemic should not be encouraged. Because of the wide challenges highlighted above, it will not be a quick process to reach the vaccine shots to each individual. According to WHO, world leaders andthe public must follow and come up with a novel social measure to reduce viral concentrates within the human populace.More study is required urgently to reach the most successful vaccine candidate in order to minimize the increasingly growing number of cases of COVID-19that have exceeded 74,864,905 worldwide to date (17 th , December 2020).The need for thorough review of testing methodologies is just as critical as its urgent obligation to ensure that vaccines produced are free from long-term and short-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f term toxicity and adverse effects.Since the vaccine alone cannot combat the pandemic, modern preventive social strategies are needed so that the world can battle the present pandemic and be able to face another pandemic if it occurs in the future.None","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-28",1

However, majority of the population lacks regular access to essential medicines. Many of those who are able to access it are either given the wrong treatment, receive too little medicine for their health conditions, or use the medicines incorrectly [1] . The effective management of drug supply addresses practical ways in which government policymakers, essential medicines program managers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), donors, and others can work to ensure that high-quality essential medicines are available, affordable and are rationally consumed. Medicines are of critical importance because they can save lives and improve health. Moreover, they promote trust and participation in health services. They can be expensive and with special concerns bring a uniqueness that sets them apart from other consumer products [2] . Many essential drugs are currently short in Nigeria with the supply of antiretroviral being the most threatened.The Chairman of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN), in January 2019, made a case for drug insecurity in Nigeria. He urged the federal government to increase local production of essential drugs from the current 40 to 75%. Moreover, he demanded that at least 300 billion Naira should be injected into the sector to enable players in the pharmaceutical industry to ramp up local production rather than depending solely on import products. In line with this interest, and that of the Pharmaceutical Open Access *Correspondence: Johnbshara@gmail.com 3 Faculty of Medicine, Tishreen University, Lattakia, Syria Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Society of Nigeria (PSN), that have suggested policies that would encourage local manufacturing of medicines, the federal government jacked up the tax for importation of essential drugs up to 20% as part of measures to encourage pharmaceutical firms to manufacture medicines locally [2, 4] .In 1990, the maiden National Drug Policy for Nigerians launched to address the challenges associated with the inadequacies of drug supply and distribution These inadequacies resulted from various factors, such as: an ineffective structure of drug administration and control, inadequate funding of drug supply and control activities, increased reliance on foreign sources for finished drug products, pharmaceutical raw materials, reagents and equipment, inefficient storage, transportation and distribution facilities, poor selection and procurement practices, involvement of incompetent persons in procurement, distribution and sale of drugs, poor performance of drug suppliers to public health care institutions, and lack of political will to provide safe, efficacious and good quality drugs to meet the health needs of Nigerians. The policy was created with commendable goals and objectives intended to deal with the unsatisfactory situation at that time. The adoption of this policy was an encouraging development by the observers. After more than a decade of its adoption and implementation, modest progress has been reported. The positives to take are the publication of an Essential Drugs List and a National Drug Formulary, the establishment of a statutory agency responsible for drug administration and control, and the introduction of drug registration procedures.Regardless, a lot remains to be done in many areas, including the actualization of self-sufficiency in local production of essential drugs, establishment of an effective drug procurement system, development of a well-ordered drug distribution system, harmonization and updating of drug legislation, effective control of drug advertisement and promotion, entrenchment of and commitment to rational drugs use at all levels of healthcare, and drug research and development, etc. [5, 6] . The revision of the policy presents an excellent opportunity for the formulation of new strategies, strengthening achievements in areas where progress has been recorded, and addressing those areas that call for more effective action. It is expected that with judicious implementation of the revised policy, as laid out in the accompanying implementation plan, the Nigerian people will have sustainable access to safe, efficacious and good quality drugs [6] .In addition to the importation of finished products, wholesale and retail pharmacy businesses have been flourishing in Nigeria. There has also been a parallel growth in local drug manufacturing, coupled with a very high demand of industrial conditions and standards required for both raw materials, dosage form processing, equipment, and processing environment [7, 8] . Moreover, the control of global drug business by multinational cooperation that has overcome most of their initial development problems, has resulted in unfair competition from imported products and multinationals against the locally manufactured products [9] .The need to standardize many drugs of herbal origin circulating in Nigeria, and the inability of the countries to put to good use the research results from their basic or applied scientists has led to brain drain to foreign laboratories. There is still the inadequacy on the part of the government to check illegal importation, manufacture, and sale of fake, adulterated, substandard and expired goods due to fraudulent drug dealers and some corrupt government officials. Lack of effective research and development due to poor research support from the government and private companies has also been a major factor associated with drug scarcity in Nigeria [10, 11] .With the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic still looming, it is high time that the federal government removes bottlenecks on importation of drugs and devises other effective ways of ensuring that Nigeria is not at any time cut off from the supply of essential drugs.There is dire need to achieve financial sustainability through greater efficiency and financing mechanisms that will increase availability while ensuring equity. Efficiency in public pharmaceutical supply through strategies that build on public-sector strengths should be ensured, while also incorporating greater flexibility and competitiveness. More effort should also be directed at changing the behavior of providers, patients, and the public to promote effective, safe, and economical prescribing, dispensing, and patient use of medicines. The role of government in improving the availability, affordability, and rational use of medicines in the private sector should also be strengthened. Through adoption and enforcement of legislations and regulations, the government should also regulate the safety, efficacy and quality of drugs and medical products as to ensure all medicines meet basic quality standards.

Broadly, HCW can be classified as hazardous (healthcare risk) and nonhazardous (general) waste. Nonhazardous waste does not pose any specific biological, chemical, radioactive, or physical hazard, whereas hazardous waste can pose several health and environmental risks [1, 2] .Hazardous HCW contains potentially harmful microorganisms that can infect hospital communities and the general public. It may also be a source for drug-resistant microorganisms that spread from health facilities into the environment. In general, health risks associated with HCW and by-products include sharps-inflicted injuries, toxic exposure to pharmaceutical products, chemical burns, air pollution, thermal injuries, and radiation burns [3] . In lowincome countries, including Ethiopia, HCW is often not separated into hazardous or nonhazardous waste, making the real quantity of hazardous waste much higher [3, 4] . e current pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID- 19) brings an additional challenge in the waste management of healthcare facilities.Hospitals produce more waste than usual during COVID- 19. e diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 produce wastes that include masks, gloves, gowns, and other protective equipment that could be infected with the virus. e amount of single-use plastics being produced is also greatly increased [5] [6] [7] . Inappropriate management of waste, especially during COVID-19, can predispose healthcare workers, patients, and the general public to coronavirus since the virus can survive on inanimate objects and different surfaces in the hospital [8] [9] [10] .e World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all HCWs produced during the care of COVID-19 patients should be collected safely in designated containers and bags, treated, and then safely disposed of or treated, or both, preferably on-site. Furthermore, if waste is moved offsite, it is critical to understand where and how it will be treated and destroyed. All who handle HCW should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and perform hand hygiene after removing it [11] . Similarly, as per the recommendations of both the Ministry of Health (Ethiopia) and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, all HCWs produced during the care of COVID-19 patients must be considered as infectious waste and should be collected safely in designated containers and bags, treated, and then safely disposed [12] .Ethiopia is already stressed with hospital waste before the COVID-19 pandemic, and currently, there is an unpredicted increase in the volume of medical waste [4] . Confirming that COVID-19-related hospital waste is timely, tidy, efficiently, and harmlessly disposed and end up in the safest dumpsite has also become an important part of the battle against the pandemic. Evidence on the HCW generation rate, type of waste generated, and its management system is very important in designing proper hospital waste management systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in Ethiopia, there is no study performed on the amount and types of waste generated from healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. erefore, this study aimed to assess the HCW generation rate and its management in Tepi General Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia.Period. Institution-based cross-sectional and case studies were conducted in Tepi General Hospital from July 1 to 30, 2020. e hospital is found in Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region State, and it is one of the newly constructed hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. It was established in 2014 and providing healthcare services for more than six hundred thousand populations. Currently, it is serving as COVID-19 isolation and treatment center for people of the Sheka zone and partly for those from the other three zones of Southwest Ethiopia. e facility had 188 beds in four wards which include surgical, medical, pediatric, and gynecology/obstetrics. Outpatient departments (OPD) include adult OPD, pediatrics OPD, maternal and child health clinic, antiretroviral clinic, tuberculosis clinic, emergency case team, follow-up clinic, and others. Moreover, the hospital had a pharmacy, laboratory, and imaging (radiology) case teams. In the first quarter of 2020, the average monthly inpatient and outpatient visits of the hospital were 228 and 3562, respectively.Techniques. All service units (case teams) in the hospital (inpatients, outpatients, laboratory, operation theater, pharmacy, radiology, and kitchen) were considered as a source of HCW generation. A purposively selected 42 workers of the hospital have participated in in-depth interviews.e waste generation data were collected by using observational checklists and measurement apparatus. e observational checklists were prepared to observe and evaluate how the hospital segregate, collect, transport, treat, and dispose wastes. A standard weighing scale was used to quantify the generation rate of HCW. HCWs were collected and measured daily for seven consecutive days. Empty plastic buckets of standard colors (black color for general waste, brown color for pharmaceutical waste, yellow color for infectious waste, and red color for pathological waste) were distributed daily to different sections of the hospital. Plastic bags with different colors were kept inside the respective buckets. e buckets and plastic bags were labeled to indicate the different categories of the HCWs, the place of generation, date of collection, and sample number. Waste weighing and recording station was arranged in a convenient site within the vicinity of the hospital. en, the collected wastes in plastic bags were removed every morning, and the weight was measured at 8:00 AM using a weighing scale, capacity range from 15 kg to 25 kg. e measurement was taken three times, and the mean of three measurements was used as the final weight of wastes.Seven BSc nurses (data collectors) and two public health officers (supervisors) were recruited and trained for data collection. Before data collection, two-day training was given on the purpose of the study, data quality, type of HCWs, the use and calibration of a weighing scale, infection prevention, and control techniques including proper use of PPE. Data collection guideline was developed and used to facilitate the training. Data were recorded daily in a suitable datasheet. Weight scales were arranged and then calibrated every morning. Moreover, daily on-site supervision was made by investigators and supervisors.e pretest was performed before the actual data collection begins, and the daily meeting was arranged to improve data quality. Accordingly, the amendment was made based on the result of the pretest.To get details of the current status of waste management systems of the hospital, additional qualitative data were collected from workers who have direct and major contact with waste management through in-depth interviews. Workers include waste handlers and team leaders, nurses, midwives, laboratory technicians, medical doctors, hospital manager, and others. An interview tool (guide) was used for conducting a face-to-face interview. e interview tool guides the participants to discuss on the waste segregation practice of the hospital, how the hospital collects and transports waste, how the hospital finally disposes the waste, and overall, how the waste is managed during COVID-19. All interviews were audio-recorded and field notes were taken. Meanwhile, an on-site observation was made to observe the status of the current waste management systems of the hospital. e number of outpatients and inpatient flow data for the study period was taken from the patient registration office. e number of inpatients and outpatients was used to calculate the daily waste generation of the hospital.e data collected through measurement and observation checklist were entered and compiled by using SPSS version 22 computer software packages. e total amount of waste generated and its type among various case teams were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test as the data distribution was not homogeneous (with unequal variance) even when transformed. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r s ) was used for testing the existence of any bivariate correlation between the total numbers of patients and the total amount of healthcare waste generated. In addition, daily and annual waste generation rates were described and presented using tables. e annual healthcare waste generation rate was estimated by multiplying the mean healthcare waste generation rate in kg per day by 365 days (the assumption was each patient who visited the hospital may generate the same amount of HCW throughout the year). Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, translated to English, and analyzed with Open Code version 4.02 software, and content analysis was followed. Codes and categories were developed, and findings were summarized by supporting with quotes from respective study participants.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of Mizan-Tepi University, College of Health Science. Written consent was obtained from each study participant. Each study participant was briefed with the objective, benefit, and procedural steps of the study. Voluntary participation was assured, and the right to interrupt from the interview was clearly stated. Anonymity and confidentiality of the data were also ensured.A total of 752 patients have visited Tepi General Hospital during data collection time (within one week) in all health service delivery units. Of these, 212 (28.2%) patients were admitted to the inpatient department and 540 (71.8%) were seen at OPDs. e higher proportion (61.9%) of the total HCW produced was general waste and the remaining 38.1% was hazardous or risk waste. e types of hazardous wastes generated in Tepi General Hospital were sharps, infectious, pharmaceutical, and pathological (placenta and blood) wastes. e mean (±SD) generation rate of sharps, infectious, pharmaceutical, and pathological wastes in the studied hospital was 7.2 ± 0.9 (1.5%), 158.7 ± 0.4 (32.2%), 19.2 ± 0.5 (3.9%), and 2.3 ± 0.2 (0.5%) kg/day, respectively. More than a half (0.6) kg of waste was produced by one patient daily.Totally, an estimated yearly waste generation rate of the hospital was 179,762.5 kg/year (Table 1) .Units.e sharp, infectious, and pharmaceutical hazardous wastes were mainly generated from wards. However, the highest share of the pathological waste was from the gynecology unit. ere was no hazardous waste generated from the kitchen. Generally, the maximum and minimum amounts of hazardous wastes were generated from wards and radiology room, respectively (Table 2 ). e highest amount ((48.2%) 237.3 kg/day) of the hospital waste was generated from the kitchen room, whereas that of the lowest amount ((0.9%) 4.3 kg/day) was generated in the radiology room. e Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a statistically significant (X 2 � 82.1, p < 0.001) difference in daily healthcare waste generation rate among different case teams. is implies that the type or specialty of case teams was a factor for the generation rate of HCWs. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r s ) estimation showed a strong positive linear relationship between the amount of hospital waste generation and the total patient flow (r � 0.7, p � 0.032) ( Table 3) .A total of 42 health workers have participated in an in-depth interview ( Table 4 ) and discussed what the waste management practices of the hospital look like. e response of participants and the observational findings are summarized under a few categories.As we have observed and study participants reported, hospital wastes were temporarily stored using plastic buckets with cover for nonsharp wastes. Safety boxes were used for sharp waste in the emergency room and surgical and gynecological wards. It was also reported that the segregation of HCW by its type at the point of generation and pretreatment of infectious wastes were poorly practiced in the hospital. Majorities of study participants have pointed out that color-coded waste segregation materials were not adequately available in each unit, and front-line health service workers did not segregate those wastes as hazardous and nonhazardous. One of the study participants explained the issue as follows.ere are mixed wastes on the color-coded bins which are due to inappropriate waste segregation practice by concerned bodies of the hospital. (a nurse study participant) Almost all study participants have discussed that, though waste from the outpatient department is collected within 24 hours' intervals, the hospital has no fixed time to transport wastes into the designated area. All waste handlers have reported that they have duty gloves but they do not use during waste collection and transportation. However, they have revealed that they lack safety boots and face masks, and for that reason, they are obliged to wear their habitual personal shoes during their routine working time. One of them depicted the concern as follows.It was observed and study participants reported that the infectious medical HCWs including face masks and nonrisk HCWs are not collected on separate plastic barrel containers; rather, infectious and noninfectious wastes are usually mixed and transported into an incinerator room. reported that the waste incinerator is used for disposal of all medical infectious wastes such as sharp materials (syringe, needles, blades, and others), anatomical wastes, used face masks, and paper towels. On the other hand, the majority of study participants discussed that wastes including used batteries, broken thermometers, radioactive waste, and PVC plastic-like IV bags were not separated and disposed properly in the vicinity. Again, silver and X-ray films from radiotherapy were not managed and recycled properly. e following are part of the responses from study participants.Actually we have an incinerator and other waste management systems but I can't say we are fully practicing as recommended and expected of us. We are working for improvements to make our working environment safe. (a medical doctor study participant)Most study participants have pointed out that COVID-19-related healthcare waste disposal was not arranged by specifically trained staff and special vehicles or supporting materials.ey have also mentioned that all healthcare workers and waste handlers did not take training on medical waste management, especially on waste segregation at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Standard operating procedures were not established, and the hospital did not have a healthcare waste management committee too.Medical activities generate waste that should always be discarded at the point of use by the person who used the item.e quantity of HCW generated should always be minimized, and precautions must be taken during their handling particularly in the time of COVID-19 [6, 13] . e average daily HCW generation rate of Tepi General Hospital was 1.88 kg/bed/day, and this is higher than the findings of the studies conducted in Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital and Adama Referral Hospital, Ethiopia, which reported average waste generation rates of 0.164 kg/bed/day and 1.23 kg/bed/day, respectively [14, 15] . e highest waste generation rate in the current study might be due to the COVID-19 pandemic which brings a new threat to the environment especially in low-income countries [16] . e patient flow was positively correlated to the waste generation rate in the studied hospital. e pandemic of the COVID-19 brings an increased patient flow to the hospital which in turn leads to a high amount of wastes generated, and therefore, proper waste management practices should be implemented. e hazardous HCW is associated with a risk of infecting workers handling HCW and others. Consequently, it requires careful waste management compared to general [14, 17] . e discrepancy might be due to the differences in hospital size, patient flow, and waste management practices among different hospitals. However, our finding is two times higher than the WHO report which states that 15% of HCWs are hazardous [2] . e higher proportion of hazardous waste generation may be attributable to poor segregation practice in the studied hospital. As it was noted from this study, the resources required to segregate wastes were inadequate, and the front-line health service workers did not segregate wastes using available materials. During the pandemic of COVID-19, the priority attention was given mainly to sharp materials by ignoring different infectious wastes such as facemasks. However, facemasks might be the source of infection for coronavirus. As a result, hazardous wastes should be segregated properly. Proper segregation of waste can reduce the treatment and disposal costs and the risks of infecting workers handling HCW. Moreover, the part of the HCW that is hazardous and requires special treatment could be reduced to some 2-5% if the hazardous part was immediately separated from the other wastes [9, 13] . erefore, the poor segregation practice in the studied hospital needs important attention especially during the crisis of COVID-19.e waste collection, transport, treatment, and disposal practices of the Tepi General Hospital were substandard. In this crisis time, all people in the country are recommended to protect themselves from COVID-19 by using different PPE. Surprisingly, the waste handlers, the priority groups to use PPE, in Tepi General Hospital were facing the scarcity of the PPE such as safety boots and facemasks. ey were not using their duty gloves, and this might be due to the lack of awareness creation strategies such as training since they were also reporting that they did not take any training which guides them on how to handle wastes during COVID-19. Wastes were also collected with an open container, and some of the wastes were ended up with open dumping. Furthermore, the absence of standard operating procedures and the healthcare waste management committee was an important finding in the hospital. is is in contrary to the national and international (WHO) recommendations of proper waste management during COVID-19 and the experiences of other countries [11, 12, [18] [19] [20] [21] .e mean HCW generation rate in Tepi General Hospital was high, and overall wastes were mismanaged. Although available resources were poorly utilized, the scarcity of vital inputs for proper waste management was one of the important findings. Moreover, COVID-19-related HCW was being managed as usual, and no different waste management method was employed so far. Availing important resources and training the concerned bodies should be considered during the crisis of COVID-19.Due to the lack of comparable studies conducted during COVID-19, the comparison was performed with studies that were performed before the pandemic. Moreover, our study was conducted in single site and it could not be generalizable to other settings. us, large-scale studies which can also identify the potential determinants of COVID-19-related waste generation and management practices are recommended.Healthcare waste(s) kg:Kilogram OPD:Outpatient department PPE:Personal protective equipment SD:Standard deviation SPSS:Statistical Package for Social Sciences WHO:World Health Organization.e data that support the findings of this study can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-30",1

These changes may be associated with weight gain [1] . In Canada, one study showed that 18.7% of students in a Quebec university were overweight, 57% of students were considered inactive and most suffered from eating disorders [2] .In addition, the world is currently experiencing a pandemic related to the spread of the SARS-CoV-19 virus, which is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious affections. A new strain of coronavirus that had not yet been detected in humans has been named ""COVID-19 virus [3] ."" This infection remains benign or even asymptomatic in 80% of cases. In 15% of cases, hospitalization with oxygen therapy is necessary and 5% require intensive care management with respiratory assistance and hemodynamic support [4] . The related disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 [5] . This constituted a novel situation in all aspects (health, economic and social). In the absence of effective vaccine and treatment, and in response to the pandemic, public health recommendations and government measures have imposed closures and restrictions. While these restrictions help reduce the rate of infection, they have negative effects by limiting participation in normal daily activities, physical activity, travel and access to many forms of exercise (e.g., closed gyms, no group gatherings, social/physical distance). This can promote the appearance of sedentary behaviors and eating disorders that could have a negative impact on health status, including an increased risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and overweight….In the absence of physical activity, the musculoskeletal system is the first to be affected due to the loss of 12% of muscle mass and the decrease in bone density is more insidious and bone loss is estimated to be around 1% after one month of inactivity mainly in the load-bearing bones, lumbar spine and especially the femoral head region [6, 7] .On the mental level, the current situation of confinement is a source of stress which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases with disorders of memory and spatial orientation that could be delayed or prevented by physical activity [8, 9] . Also, the confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic may influence dietary profiles, especially those of adolescents and young adults, who are very likely to develop poor eating habits and consequently the subsequent risk of degenerative diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular pathologies, and so on.Furthermore, the World Health Organization and the Spanish Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics indicate that a healthy diet can contribute to the prevention and treatment of disease since good nutrition plays a central role in the development and maintenance of the immune system [10] .Morocco, like other countries, decreed on 24/03/2020 a state of public health emergency throughout the national territory in order to cope with the spread of the corona virus covid-19 [11] . The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of weight load and to evaluate the effect of confinement on the physical activity and dietary behavior of higher education students during the period of confinement.This is a cross-sectional observational study of 406 students at five public institutions of higher education with students from the Souss region and the three southern regions. These institutions are located in the capital of the provinces of Agadir Ida-outanane and Laayoune.The general principle is to award one point when the recommendation is reached, intermediate points are awarded when the recommendation was only partially reached (0.5). However, points were subtracted (-1) when exceeding the recommended intakes is considered to be detrimental to health [12] .For data analysis, the scores were divided into three slices [13] :Food slices Score PNNS-GS T1 Score < 2.5 T2 2.5 ≤ score < 5 T3 Score ≥ 5Physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Short Version [14] . The short version includes seven physical activity items providing information on time spent walking, vigorous and moderate intensity activity and sedentary activity [15] . The choice of this questionnaire is to have a common instrument that can be used to obtain internationally comparable data on health-related physical activity.The body mass index (BMI) was calculated by the following formula: BMI (kg/m 2 ) = weight (in kg)/height 2 (in m 2 ). The BMI is recognized as an international criterion for assessing weight load. According to the WHO thresholds, overweight is defined as a BMI equal to or greater than 25 kg/m 2 and obesity as a BMI equal to or greater than 30 kg/m 2 [16] . Due to the confinement period and the cessation of face-to-face classes, information on anthropometric data (height and weight) was reported by the students. The degree of appreciation of stressful situations was measured by the psychological instrument ""Perceived Stress Scale"" hosted by Mind Garden [17] .The data was encoded and analyzed using SPSS version 13. Qualitative variables were described in terms of headcount and percentage and then compared using chi-square and exact Fisher tests according to the conditions of application of each. Quantitative variables were expressed as means and standard deviation (SD).To examine the relationship between several variables simultaneously and to eliminate confounding factors, we performed a multivariate analysis by conditional logistic regression, which allows us to estimate the different Odds-ratios adjusted with their confidence intervals. The variables inserted in the model to compose the predictor were chosen according to their clinical relevance, their statistical link to the dependent variable, at the 20% threshold, in the univariate analysis (p-value of the Wald test).The study was conducted with the free and informed consent of participants. Survey participants were assured that all data would be used only for research purposes. Participant responses are anonymous and confidential. In addition, participants were given the opportunity to end their participation in the study and leave the questionnaire at any time prior to submission. Responses were saved only by clicking on the ""send"" button provided for this purpose. By completing the questionnaire, participants acknowledged that they had consented to voluntarily participate in the study. Boukrim et al. Table 2 presents the consumption frequencies of the different food groups that are the subject of the numerical benchmarks in the PNNS. Overall, 48.28% (including 53% female) of the participants could be considered small consumers of fruits and vegetables (less than 3.5 portions/day). In contrast, only 43% of participants ate at least five fruits and vegetables daily. A total of 86.45% (3/4 of whom were female) of the respondents consumed starchy foods at least three times a day. Only 18.47% of participants met the PNNS benchmark for dairy products, while the majority (76.11%, 3/4 of whom were female) ate dairy products less than 2.5 times a day. Nearly half of the participants (45.57%, 3/4 of whom were female) consumed food from the ""meat, poultry, eggs"" group once or twice a day and 44.58% exceeded this criterion. In addition, more than half of the participants (52% of whom three quarters were female) ate less than twice a week fishery products. As for the consumption of sweet products, more than half (52%, of which three quarters were female) consumed them once or twice a week. Overall, more than two thirds of the students had an average nutritional score (T2), of which more than 60% had a weight load. Moreover, among the students who were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 Kg/m 2 ), more than 93% had an unbalanced diet ( Table 3) . Table 3 illustrated that 77% of the participants with a weight load had an average diet close to the PNNS norms and that the weight load is related to the nutritional status of the students (p < 0.0001). Table 4 revealed that weight load is related to the intensity of physical activity and the threat of stress (p < 0.006 and p < 0.008). Only 36% of the participants with a weight load carried out moderate intensity physical activity while two thirds carried out low intensity physical activity. The majority of students at risk of stress were overweight.To highlight the factors associated with weight load, the BMI values were split into two dichotomous variables (weight load if BMI ≥ 25 Kg/m 2 and no weight load if BMI < 25 Kg/m 2 ). The results of the simple binary logistic regression analysis showed that the weight load is related (p < 0.05) to gender, personal expenses below 273.54 USD per month, threat of stress, low physical activity and that a balanced diet is a protective factor (p < 0.05). On the other hand, it is not associated with the consumption of meat, seafood, starchy and sweet products ( Table 5 ).In the simple binary logistic, the main variables that were significantly associated with the occurrence of weight gain at the 0.2 threshold were: gender, personal expenditure less than 273.54 USD, stress threat, low physical activity and balanced diet. In multiple binary logistic regression analysis, the top-down introduction of the independent variables revealed significant associations between several predictive factors and the weight load in the study population during the confinement period. Table 5 Simple binary logistic regression analysis between weight load and participant characteristics. The study found that more than a quarter of the students were overweight (21.7%) or obese (4.7%) and two thirds were of normal weight, which was consistent with the results of other studies [18] . We suppose that confinement of the students for three months appears to be the cause of the weight gain since the students were deprived of their normal activities and physical activity in gyms or outside.More than three-quarters of the overweight participants scored close to the PNNS standards. Only one-third of the weight-bearing participants were moderately active, while two-thirds were moderately active. The majority of students at risk of stress were loaded.Several factors could explain this weight gain. Studies have shown that women are more likely to be overweight or obese [19] . Our results showed that 79% of female students were overweight.In addition, confinement, limitation of normal activities and reduced physical activity due to confinement appear to contribute to weight gain. Indeed, a study of young people in prison showed that in three months of follow-up, 66% developed overweight or obesity [20] . In addition, during confinement the population was deprived of participation in normal daily activities, physical activity and gatherings (social/physical distancing). These facts could contribute to the risk of increased weight gain. To confirm this finding, it is relevant to evaluate the same variables in the same population after confinement.Our study found that the majority of students were at risk of stress according to the Perceived Stress Scale, and more than half of them had a weight load (p < 0.05). Students were subject to stress caused, on the one hand, by difficulties in adapting to university and the new responsibilities of young adults and [21] , on the other hand, by confinement, since students were more worried and anxious [22] . Pedagogical factors (possibility and modalities of exams, internships, success and value of diplomas), economic factors (job loss) and health factors (nature of the disease and its evolution) [23] . In addition, increased stress, anxiety and boredom on a daily basis during the pandemic and during containment would have contributed to higher energy intake, sleep disturbances and less exercise [24] .As for sleep disturbance, 38.2% of the respondents suffered from it and more than half of them were overweight. This disorder affected more girls than boys and this result corroborated that of Mestaghanmi in Casablanca in 2019 [19] . In addition, sleep disorders in students can have both physical and psychological effects; sleep deprivation affects cognitive performance throughout the week. Furthermore, it has been shown that people who are obese or overweight sleep an average of 16 minutes less per day than those of normal weight [25, 26] . Sport contributes to the well-being of individuals and physical and mental health are guaranteed for athletes. Athletes also perceive that their health is excellent. Indeed, regular physical activity contributes to subjective well-being and overall quality of life, by acting on the factors that intervene in different dimensions (lower stress levels, satisfaction with the body, satisfaction through active participation in social life) [27] . In this study, almost 70% of the students were engaged in lowintensity physical activity, of which almost two-thirds were weight-bearing (p = 0.006) and 30% were engaged in moderate-intensity physical activity. Indeed, a study in France on the sports habits during confinement showed that 48.4% did less during this period and especially outside their home [28, 29] . Similarly, a survey conducted by the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics showed that 59% of people practiced less physical activity than before confinement [28] . In addition, the Canadian study showed that 34% of adults felt that they were less physically active during confinement, with the decrease being greater among those who did not meet the WHO minimum physical activity recommendations [30] . Similarly, a study conducted to evaluate the effect of home confinement due to COVID-19 on dietary behavior and physical activity showed a decrease in physical activity during this period and that one third of the students were not physically active [22, 31] .Adequate nutrition is considered a potential health factor in the early stages of life and adolescence [32] . Furthermore, confinement influences lifestyle, especially diet and physical activity [33] . In this study, young adults suffered from eating disorders. Indeed, the study showed","Morocco","first author","2021-01-06",1

In so doing the paper is able to: i) distinguish the specific influences on the system of care for older people in nursing homes in South Africa and, ii) consider the use of decision support tools as a mechanism to improve this area of practice.As life expectancy increases, global level predictions indicate >2 billion people will be aged 65 years by 2050, with the number >80 years expected to reach 400 million by 2050 (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017; Holloway & Henry, 2014) .The implications for managing the increased pressure this will have on healthcare resources and the ability to meet patient demand around the world are profound.The care of nursing home residents who are at increased risk of infection and unplanned hospital admissions resulting in clinical complications, increased mortality and extended length of stay is a growing concern for the global community, as demonstrated during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Dwyer, Gabbe, Stoelwinder, & Lowthian, 2014; Jacobs, Ashwell, Sumaiyah, & Schneider, 2020; Lemoyne et al., 2019; OECD, 2020) . Unplanned admissions now account for 65% of all hospital bed days (Busby, Purdy, & Hollingworth, 2015; Mkanta, Chumbler, Yang, Saigal, & Abdollahi, 2016) : this pressure is set to intensify further in line with the projected rise in people aged 80 years and above, and the subsequent rise in the number of nursing home residents (Dwyer, Stoelwinder, Gabbe, & Lowthian, 2015; Lemoyne et al., 2019; OECD, 2017) .Nursing home residents are at 1.4 times greater risk of emergency admission and have >50% unplanned hospital admissions compared to the general population aged >75years (Dwyer et al., 2015; McAndrew, Garbowski, Dang, & Young, 2016) . Unplanned hospital admissions cost the NHS >£11 billion and the US healthcare economy >$1.1 trillion a year (Busby et al., 2015) and account for more than a third of all admissions each year (Dwyer et al., 2014; Dwyer et al., 2015; Smith, Sherlaw-Johnson, Ariti, & Bardelsy, 2015) . However, evidence suggests that many nursing home residents' hospitalization can be avoided through rapid detection and more timely treatment (Dwyer et al., 2015; Lemoyne et al., 2019; OECD, 2017; Smith et al., 2015) .There is therefore an urgent need to improve the early detection of infection to avoid unnecessary hospital admission and risk of complications for nursing home residents (Dwyer et al., 2015; Lemoyne et al., 2019; McAndrew et al., 2016) .Similar concerns are beginning to emerge in South Africa, reflecting global trends and an aging population with multiple long-term conditions (World Health Organisation, 2016) . South Africa has one of the fastest-aging populations on the continent; the United Nations predicts that between 2009 and 2050, the country's population over the age of 50 will double to 14% (AARP, 2016) . In comparison to the UK, US and other western countries, the provision of care for older people in South Africa has historically been quite different with care being provided at home within the family environment (Lloyd-Sherlock, 2019; van Biljon & Roos, 2015) . Changes to family structures in African families, caused by HIV/AIDS and marked by a lost generation who previously cared for older persons (WHO, 2020; World Health Organization, 2017) , means that over a third now require help and assistance with daily living (World Health Organization, 2017).Care arrangements, similarly to elsewhere, are influenced by financial and human resources, the older persons' level of functional independence and their associated living arrangement (Dwyer et al., 2015; van Biljon & Roos, 2015) . There are three main types of living arrangements; i) 'independent living'; for people aged over 60, where accommodation is located in a purpose built retirement village with onsite healthcare facilities; ii) 'assisted living'where by the older person resides in their own apartment/house with support to maintain their activities of daily living; and iii) 'frail care' which involves a 24-hour healthcare service for those with severe frailty/or who are bedridden.Residential care facilities became available to all South African citizens at the end of the apartheid era, regardless of race (van Biljon & Roos, 2015) . However, their structure and organisation has been strongly affected by the historical effects of the apartheid era (Feinstein, 2005) , the legacy of which has left the country with a myriad of service models and a fragmented healthcare system delivered through a public and private system. This fragmentation creates a dilemma in terms of ensuring older people have access to long-term care South African, particularly in rural areas.In addition to the challenge of ensuring access, the quality of care at the 1,150 nursing homes for older people in South Africa, of which only 400 are registered (Jacobs et al., 2020) . are also challenged by a lack of financial support, lack of human resources and capacity of staff (Dwyer et al., 2015; van Biljon & Roos, 2015) .There are significant financial challenges regarding care provision for older people in South Africa, many of whom suffer financial hardship. Firstly, the pension grant of R1,860 per month (approximately £89/ month), only received by those who are eligible (South African Government, 2020), is insufficient to support a basic living standard. The situation is complicated further as it is widely observed that older people frequently share pensions with household members, and that this arrangement is not always consensual (Lloyd-Sherlock, 2018) . Similarly to other parts of the world the basic pension allowance in South Africa only covers a fraction of the cost of residential nursing care (Ranchod, Childs, Abraham, & Taylor, 2015) . As a result, charitable and government nursing homes, historically the main providers of care home services in South Africa, are subsidised to cover the costs for the poor: the total cost Despite this, nurses, particularly enrolled and assistant nurses and caregivers, who continue to have the most direct contact with residents, tend to be the first people to identify change in psychological and or cognitive behaviour. Emerging evidence suggests decision support tools which provide a systematic approach to monitoring non-specific cognitive and behavioural changes can help ensure consistency and more timely treatment (Lemoyne et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2015) . Building the capacity and skills of the workforce in South Africa so they are supported to identify the signs and symptoms of infection in nursing home residents is one approach that could help alleviate some of the pressure experienced by nursing home staff (Lemoyne et al., 2019) . This in turn should improve the early detection of infection and assist the nursing home workforce in providing more effective and timely care.It is recognised that guidelines and criteria developed in the US such as 'McGeer' (Stone et al., 2012) , and/ or 'Loeb' (Caterino et al., 2017) can support the surveillance and management of infections in long-term care facilities. However, until very recently, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lack of national standardised infection control guidelines for use in nursing homes in South Africa (Department of Health, 2020). This despite the agreement that older people in middle and lower-income countries, including South Africa are at increased risk of infection. This increased risk is confirmed in the context of South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa in various studies including hospitalisation for respiratory infections (Kyeyagalire et al., 2014; Nkosi, Wichmann, & Voyi, 2015; Roomaney et al., 2016) , diarrheal illnesses (Lamberti, Bourgeois, Fischer Walker, Black, & Sack, 2014) , lower urinary tract symptoms (Maharajh, Abdel Goad, Ramklass, & Conradie, 2015) and fall-related injuries (Stewart Williams et al., 2015) .Although it is well-known that wounds such as skin tears, chronic leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers are common among older persons and are a priority of care in nursing homes (Edwards et al., 2017) , incidence or prevalence studies of wound types in nursing homes in South Africa is lacking.In practice, the identification of infection is generally based on detection of abnormalities during routine physiological measures such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration or urine analysis. Any deviations observed by the caregiver or nursing assistant are reported to the registered nurse supervising the care who will decide on the course of treatment, need for referral to a general medical practitioner or hospital admission. While some nursing homes have used the World Health Organization guidelines to inform the development of general infection control procedures; these focus on the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and fail to acknowledge that frail elderly often exhibit atypical signs and symptoms making it difficult to make a diagnosis and initiate treatment (Caterino et al., 2017; Sund-Levander & Tingstrom, 2013; Tingström et al., 2015) . Consequently, the diagnosis and treatment of infection in the frail elderly can be difficult contributing to delayed assessment.It is recognised that hospital admissions of older people from nursing homes are influenced by a number of individual and organisational factors (Dwyer et al., 2015; Lemoyne et al., 2019) . Individual factors are for example, associated with the presence of particular comorbidities i.e. diabetes, and heart failure and reduced functional ability whereas organisational factors include ""for profit' facilities"", poorer staff to patient ratios, and a lack specialist knowledge compared with those owned by not-for-profit organizations and those with improved registered nurse and medical practitioner staffing levels.Emerging evidence however, suggests decision support tools (DST), which provide a systematic approach to monitoring non-specific cognitive and behavioural changes, can help ensure consistency; allow nurses to be more professional and effective at communication, ensuring more timely treatment (Tingström et al., 2015) . Such systems, when not reliant on physiological measures requiring clinical interpretation, may also allow delegation of use to nursing home care support staff, such as caregivers, to recognise and report changes in condition (Morley, 2014; Ouslander, Bonner, Herndon, & Shutes, 2014; Ouslander et al., 2011; Tena-Nelson et al., 2012; Tingström et al., 2015) . They are well-positioned to undertake these activities due to their consistent caregiver relationships with residents (Ashcraft & Owen, 2014; Tingström, Milberg, & Sund-Levander, 2010) .Training these staff members to recognise and communicate signs of deterioration, through decision support tools could provide patient benefit by reducing and or preventing hospital transfers (Ashcraft & Owen, 2014; Boockvar, Brodie, & Lachs, 2000) . Nursing home oriented decision support tools such as Stop and Watch (Ouslander et al., 2014) , rely primarily on observational assessment in order to identify residents who requires closer monitoring that will result in not only more frequent observations but also more frequent recording of vital signs.Another tool, the Early Detection of Infection Scale (EDIS) (Allemann & Sund-Levander, 2015; Sund-Levander & Tingstrom, 2013; Tingström et al., 2010; Tingström et al., 2015) , designed for completion by Swedish care workers, also includes assessment of body temperature. The assessment of body temperature uses a new approach based on the difference from baseline, the so called 'DiffTemp ®' instead of pre-decided values for fever, i.e.>38°C (Sund-Levander & Grodzinsky, 2017) . Recording 'DiffTemp' as part of EDIS enables a more targeted approach focusing on specific aspects of behaviour and functional status. The use of DSTs for rapid early detection of infection in nursing home residents in South Africa could prove helpful (Ouslander et al., 2014; Tingström et al., 2015) and help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the current pandemic and beyond (OECD, 2020) .However, the potential benefits; or indeed how easily a decision support tool could be integrated within the context of South African nursing home organisations has not been explored. Exploring barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of the early detection of infection scale in South African nursing home residents is therefore key to understanding how best to implement and maintain the early detection of infection scale instrument in daily clinical practice. A current UK-based study is exploring views and opinions of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers in UK nursing homes (Carey, Mold, Cox, Lund-Sevander, & Tingstrom, 2019) and other countries (Carey, 2019) .Exploring nurses, care workers and managers views and opinions of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers is an important first step to understanding enabling and reinforcing factors related to successful adoption; implementation and maintenance of the early detection of infection scale instrument; potential barriers, support and resources needed to implement and maintain the early detection of infection scale in daily clinical practice. In order to improve the early detection of infection in South Africa, it will therefore be essential to adopt a similar approach to the UK.There is a need to improve the early detection of infection in nursing home residents who are at high risk of rapid deterioration and unplanned hospital admission, clinical complications and general deterioration. The importance of early detection of infection has been emphasised during the current global COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that decision support tools provide an opportunity to improve early detection of infection and ensure a consistent approach to infection detection, prompt action and treatment, thus avoiding emergency hospital admissions. Similarly to the UK, exploring views and opinions of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers in nursing homes will be an important first step to understanding the potential use and acceptability of the early detection of infection scale tool in South Africa.","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-25",1

The virus spread to more than 200 countries, led to more than 47 million confirmed infections and more than 1.2 million deaths (as of 4 th of November 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with daunting health and socioeconomic challenges (Khandelwal, 2020) . Countries in the African continent have particular challenges with respect to controlling COVID-19 infections and reducing mortality rates; coupled with weak public health delivery systems they have large populations of vulnerable people e.g. those immunocompromised from HIV/AIDS, with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and anaemia, or malnutrition (Kaseje, 2020) .The first COVID-19 case in Africa was recorded in Egypt on the 14th of February, 2020 (Lone and Ahmad, 2020) , and on 27 th February, the sub-Saharan African region recorded its first case in Nigeria. Further cases in sub-Saharan Africa were recorded in South Africa and Zimbabwe, on March 5 th and 20 th , respectively (Msomi et al., 2020) . The initial cases identified in Africa were mostly introduced from Europe, the Middle East and the United States of America (Hâncean et al., 2020; Lone and Ahmad, 2020; Mehtar et al., 2020) .The COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions taken in response to it, disrupted healthcare services and, as a result, overwhelmed the major healthcare programmes in Africa focused on controlling HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Facilities and staff are taken up with attending to the overwhelmingly high demand for care required by patients with severe COVID-19, leaving other patients without the resources they need. This will have far-reaching consequences for other diseases, poverty, food security, and economic growth in Africa .There is an urgent need to understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa, particularly the dynamics of its virulence, transmission, mutation capacity and symptom variation amongst infected people (Kalk and Schultz, 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is estimated to be approximately 2.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per month (Duchene et al., 2020; Meredith et al., 2020) . Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is important to monitor these changes because they are relevant to vaccine efficacy, can be used to infer transmission dynamics, and inform future public health measures targeting its spread. Genomic surveillance backed up with detailed epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 can identifies which lineages of the virus are circulating in the human population. Information on how these change over time can serve as an indicator of the success of control measures, how often new sources of virus are introduced from other geographical areas, and how the virus has evolved in response to interventions. Despite having inadequate health systems, the number of reported cases in many African countries, specifically Zimbabwe, has been rising more slowly than predicted (Nkengasong and Mankoula, 2020) .Zimbabwe took the initiative to sequence SARS-CoV-2 samples from 100 patients collected over the period March to June 2020. The objectives were to use the sequence results to: understand initial transmission events; understand early domestic transmission of the virus in Zimbabwe; add context to the regional and global data; and to evaluate the role of rapid whole genome sequencing for outbreak analysis in this setting.Quality control of the sequenced genomes. Samples were prepared and sequenced in 96-well plates with one cDNA negative control per plate and one RNA extraction negative control, where applicable. Contaminated samples were removed from analysis. Consensus sequence was defined as passing quality control if greater than 50% of the genome was covered by confident calls or there was at least one contiguous sequence of more than 10,000 bases and no evidence of contamination in the negative control. This is regarded as the minimum amount of data to be phylogenetically useful. A confident call is defined as having 10x depth of coverage. If the coverage falls below these thresholds, the bases are masked with Ns. Low quality variants are also masked with Ns. The QC threshold for inclusion in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database is higher, requiring that greater than 90% of the genome is covered by confident calls and that there is no evidence of contamination.The majority of cases recorded prior to 20 th of July were travel associated. The number of cases with no recent travel reported remained below 50 during this period of time. People travelling from South Africa accounted for the greatest proportion (83.4%) of travelassociated cases (Fig. 1) . From the time the first case was recorded to about 120 days later, there were more travel-associated cases than locally-transmitted cases, and the majority of travel-related cases were asymptomatic. During July the number of cases with no recent travel reported increased rapidly, confirming the start of community transmission. An increase in overall number of daily cases was observed from day 60 after the first case and peaked during the first half of August. Thereafter the number of cases decreased to the middle of October when approximately 20 cases per day were identified.In each case, two lineages shared a common ancestor with no intermediary nodes formed with genomes from other countries (blue and green lineages in Figure 3 ). By this more conservative estimation, the minimum number of introductions into Zimbabwe that our data support was 25. The 12 clusters were each comprised between 2 and 30 genomes with 0-3 SNPs between members of the cluster. Seven clusters contained more than one genome that had an identical genome sequence to at least one genome in the same cluster.Two large clusters within lineage B.1.1 were present on extended branches of the phylogenetic tree composed of genomes that were distinct from all other to any genome present in the GISAID database by 4-5 SNPs. These introductions may have been from geographical locations where sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was not reported or the result of sequence divergence during transmission within Zimbabwe from an earlier case within Zimbabwe not included in our analysis.Genome ZW70 was from a traveller arriving from Dubai and was identical to three other genomes: ZW168, ZW169 and ZW214. Local epidemiological investigation indicated that these were infections resulting from cohabitation and may represent the earliest cases of local transmission. This interpretation was supported by the genome sequence data. Dubai airport is an important hub for flights from many locations in the world including Asia.Genomes ZW168, ZW169 and ZW214 all belonged to lineage A, which is most widely distributed in China.An additional seven and three genomes were associated with arrivals from the UK and the US, respectively, in either late March or April. International travel was suspended following the arrival of these cases. Nine of these genomes belonged to the B1 lineage, while the last from a case associated with travel to the US belonged to the B2 lineage. Although in the same B1 lineage, eight of these travel-associated cases were on different sublineage and, with one exception, had no identical genomes from non-travel associated COVID-19 cases in our dataset. The one exception was sample ZW25BY that was from a case recorded in Bulawayo in April, which was identical to samples ZW-391 and ZW-EC, also from Bulawayo, with no travel-history recorded which, therefore, represents potential domestic transmission.Epidemiological analysis identified two phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe.The vast majority of cases in the first 3 months were associated with international or regional travel. This was confirmed by the epidemiological data linking most confirmed cases with a history of having travelled outside of the country exacerbated by rapid influx of Zimbabwean citizens returning from other countries already experiencing the disease. A rapid increase in the number of cases was associated with probable domestic transmission after July 2020.Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in Southern Africa between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers and bordering South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique. Travel history is essential for understanding the introduction of SARS-Cov-2 into a nation, and this was confirmed by the data from Zimbabwe. Initial cases recorded within the first 120 days of the outbreak were associated with travel from international locations already experiencing the disease. The majority of the initial COVID-19 cases in Zimbabwe (20 th March -30 th June 2020) were Zimbabwean residents returning from neighbouring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique. Most were associated with travel from South Africa related to informal trade between these two countries by cross-border traders, the majority of which are aged 25-45 years. The combination of informal cross-border traders and formally returning residents may have contributed to the subsequent increased local transmission in Zimbabwe. Other cases, however, were from Europe, Asia and USA, the epicentres of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the rise is cases was slower than predicted and mirrored what has been seen in many African countries (Nkengasong and Mankoula, 2020) . This slow rise in cases could be attributed to the measures the country instituted which included wearing of face masks, hand sanitization and lockdown. These measures have been shown to minimise and contain the outbreak in other countries, including France (Cauchemez et al., 2020) .The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic is an emerging infectious disease with no known public health interventions except the measures implemented in China, Europe and elsewhere.Nonetheless, current evidence suggests that quarantine of travel-associated cases and early suspension of tourism-associated travel may have been effective based on our genomic analysis of cases in the first 120 days following the first case.The factors associated with contraction of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe were consistent with factors associated with contraction in high income countries. The overall CFR of SARS Cov-2 was 2.9%, which was comparable with CFRs reported elsewhere in Asia, Europe and USA (Niforatos et al., 2020; Pachetti et al., 2020; Samaddar et al., 2020) . Compared with other countries, younger males aged 31-40 years, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Zimbabwe during the first 120 days of the epidemic. However, the older population above 60 years was more likely to die from COVID-19 disease compared with the younger age groups, this agrees with what have been observed in other regions (Brandén et al., 2020; Dhama et al., 2020) . Outbreak descriptions from Europe, Asia and the United States of America, indicated that older members of the population with pre-existing medical conditions were at increased risk of both becoming infected with SARS-Cov-2 and of dying from infection (Sanyaolu et al., 2020; Schultze et al., 2020) . In the United Kingdom (UK) a considerably larger proportion of cases from ages 10-50 were in females, with cases in males being greatest in 0-10 years and 60-80 age categories (Page et al., 2020) . These observations may have been due to two demographic characteristics prevalent in Zimbabwe. First, the younger age-group, 31-50 years is the most mobile and some have migrated out of the country in search of employment (Potts, 2010; Crush et al., 2015) . Secondly, the same age group are sexually active and contribute the highest prevalence's of HIV/ AIDS infection in the Southern Africa region (Gouws et al., 2008) .The D614G genotype was the most frequent variant in early spread events in Zimbabwe, consistent with the reported trend for increased frequency of this genotype in many locations globally, even when the ancestral genotype (614D) was previously established (Korber et al., 2020) . There has been considerable interest in the emergence of a variant lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with a non-synonymous mutation resulting in substitution of 614G in which a glycine residue was replaced by an aspartate residue at position 614 (D614G) of the spike (S) protein. The S-protein is thought to be important for entry of the virus into host cells and D614G has been implicated in increased cell entry (Korber et al., 2020) ; the mechanism for this was via increasing the likelihood of binding the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020) . Consistent with this idea, population genetic modelling studies indicated that the 614G variant increased in frequency in the UK relative to the 614D ancestral variant, suggesting a selective advantage for 614G (Volz et al., 2020) . This protein is also the target in anti-viral (remdesivir and favipiravir) treatment trials for COVID-19 (Saxena, 2020) . The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is important because vaccine-escape strains may emerge quickly and there is also the potential for detection-failure if the target used in the RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 may accumulate mutations affecting the test. A total of 95 of the 100 SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in our analysis contained the D614G mutation. All five of the genomes with the ancestral 614D genotype were from samples from March or April 2020, with none observed in sequences from samples taken in May or June. The dominance of the 614G genotype in Zimbabwe likely reflects the relatively high frequency of the 614G genotype in countries from which the virus was introduced. However, since it has been suggested that the 614G genotype is present in greater numbers in the upper respiratory tract in infected people it may also have been more likely to spread once introduced into the Zimbabwean population.Phylogenomic analysis highlights the dominance of regional migration over intercontinental travel in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Zimbabwe. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from lineages B.1 and B.1.1 were recovered from residents returning from South Africa.These lineages appear to be predominant in Africa and continuous efforts for widespread sequencing is important to provide insights about their origin, and the evolution of local/imported viral dissemination in Zimbabwe. As the epidemic unfolded most of the more than 8,000 cases were due to local transmission. Risk factors for local transmission have not been described. Continuous surveillance using whole-genome sequencing is required to estimate the presence of mutations that may be increasing transmissibility. In addition to describing the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, data from SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance may contribute to the development of vaccines against this novel virus.Zimbabwe will need to strengthen health systems so that public health interventions that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 transmission elsewhere in the world, are also effective in Zimbabwe.Samples used for whole genome sequencing where sampled from the first 120 days of the epidemic. Potential subsequent circulation of descendants of these early intercontinental introductions after around 120 days once transmission was increasing exponentially, remains to be determined.Ethical approval for the study was exempted by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe as this study was in response to a public health emergency.","Zimbabwe","abstract","2021-01-06",1

The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, as cases have been detected in most countries worldwide. 1 As of August 17, 2020, there have been 21,901,102 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases, including 774,299 deaths worldwide according to Johns Hopkins University. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) reported that more than 600 nurses around the world have died from COVID-19 until 3 June 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Ethiopia on 13 March 2020 which was the first one to be reported since the beginning of the outbreak in China in December 2019. 2 According to the ministry of health, in Ethiopia there were 31,336 COVID-19 reported cases and 544 (1.74%) deaths in Ethiopia until August 17, 2020.The pandemic not only affects physical health but also mental health and well-being. 3, 4 Mental health and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly serious for health professionals because of a higher level of exposure. 5 A poorly known contagious disease outbreak, like COVID-19, leads to unavoidable stress, fear, and anxiety that can be profound among the higher-risk groups, such as healthcare professionals including nurses. 6 The mental well-being of healthcare professionals can be negatively affected by fear of being exposed to the COVID-19 cases in hospitals, being separated from families, and confronting the death or illness of patients from COVID-19. 7, 8 During the pandemic, healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at significant risk of adverse mental health outcomes resulted from limited clinical knowledge about the virus, long working hours, risk of infection, and insufficient provision of protective equipment, loneliness, physical fatigue, and separation from families. 9 Studies conducted during the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) showed that nurses developed serious depressive symptoms. 10 Along with the other HCPs nurses plays a pivotal role in healthcare setup in prevention, infection control, isolation, continuous monitoring of the patients and because of their unique patient-facing nature, there are occupational risks to providing care during the COVID-19 outbreak 11 and it is also reported that the chances of occupational exposure are relatively higher in nurses. 12 Additionally, previous studies have shown that a higher level of anxiety and depression among the nurses due to their long interaction with the patients and the nature of their job. [13] [14] [15] Deprived mental health among nurses may not only be damaging to them but may also affect their professional routine and in turn, the quality of providing patient care 16 as it is evident that the well-being of the mental state is crucial to managing infectious diseases. 9, 17 Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of overwhelming workload, long hours, shift duties, and working in a high-risk environment. 18 Nurses are the frontline healthcare professionals who work across acute care hospitals, long-term care agencies, nursing homes, schools, communities, and government healthcare agencies. The multiple roles and functions played by nurses are particularly important during this COVID-19 pandemic by providing health education, screening services, and support for the general public and individuals in high-risk categories. 19 Estimating the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on nurses is important for health authorities to develop preventive strategies and effective treatment modalities to alleviate its negative outcome. Despite this fact, no studies on the epidemiology of depression, anxiety, and stress in nurses have been conducted in the study area. Therefore, this study is intended to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses working in the northwest of Amhara Regional State referral hospitals, northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 25 to October 20, 2020.The study was conducted in the northwest of Amhara Regional State referral hospitals. According to the 2017 Amhara Region population statistics, the region has a total population of 21,134,988. It also has eleven administrative zones. There are a total of sixty-seven public hospitals in the region. Debre Markos, Tibebe Gion, and the University of Gondar are the three referral hospitals found in the northwest of Amhara. Each referral hospital serves 3.5-5 million people. There were a total of 955 nurses working in those hospitals.Nurses working in the northwest of Amhara Regional state referral hospitals and available during the data collection period were included in the study. Those nurses who were seriously ill and attending external training courses off-site during the study period were excluded. Sample Size Determination and Sampling ProcedureThe sample size was calculated using the single population proportion formula by taking the estimated proportion of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses: 50%, a confidence level of 95%, and a margin of error of 5%. The final sample size was 302, after adding a 10% nonresponse rate and using the correction formula. The study participants from the three hospitals were selected after all hospitals were listed down with their respective number of nurses. The proportional allocation formula was used to allocate the number of nurses to the three referral hospitals. Lists of nurses from the hospital's human resource management were taken to prepare a sampling frame. Finally, a simple random sampling technique was used to select the study subjects of each hospital.Participants who score below 8 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no anxiety and those who score 8 and above were considered as having anxiety. 20Participants who score below 10 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no depression and those who score 10 and above were considered as having depression. 20Participants who score below 15 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21) were considered as having no stress and those who score 15 and above were considered as having anxiety. 20Data were collected using a structured pretested selfadministered questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 45 questions arranged into five sections; the first section contains seven questions regarding the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, the second section contains four questions regarding work-related conditions of nurses, the third section contains four organization related questions, the fourth section contains nine personal related questions, and the fifth section contains 21 questions regarding the depression, anxiety, and stress status of nurses. Depression, anxiety, and stress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 Items (DASS-21). The DASS-21 comprises 3 components: stress, anxiety, and depression. Each has 7 scales, and the final score of each part was obtained by summing the scores of the related questions. Each item scores from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree). 20 The reliability and validity of this questionnaire have been investigated. Its test-retest reliabilities for depression, anxiety, and stress were reported as 0.80, 0.76, and 0.77, respectively. For examining the validity of this scale, the confirmatory factor analysis method and the main component technique were implemented. 21 In the present study, the scale's face validity was examined by the psychology and research methods expert. Four trained BSc nurse data collectors and two MSc nurse supervisors were used. The anonymity of the participant was kept by informing them not to write their name. The instruments were distributed among the study population, after guarantying their willingness to take part in the study, and then collected by the data collectors after completion. During data collection data collectors and supervisors followed the recommended precautions to prevent COVID-19.Data clean-up and cross-checking was done before analysis. Checked, cleaned, and coded data were entered into EpiData version 3 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics like frequencies, percentages, mean and standard deviation, tables, and figure were used to present data. First, bivariable relationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable were investigated using a binary logistic regression model. Independent variables with a p-value < 0.25 were included in multivariable analysis to control potential confounding factors. Finally, those variables with a p-value < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval were regarded as factors significantly associated.A pretest was done before the actual data collection time at Debre Tabor hospital. Unclear questions and ambiguous words were corrected accordingly. It was also used to estimate how much time it takes to administer the entire questionnaire. The tool was first developed in the English language and was translated to the Amharic language with back translation to English for consistency.

Principal investigators and supervisors conducted supervision. Each data collector checks the questionnaire from each study participant for completeness daily to ensure data quality. Each questionnaire was reviewed and checked for completeness daily by the supervisors and principal investigators.A total of 293 nurses participated in this study, with a 97.01% response rate. More than half (54.6%) of the respondents were male and 53.2% of them were married. The mean age of the respondents was 29.6± 5.1 SD years and nearly half (48.8%) of them fall in the age range of 25-29 years. Concerning the educational status, more than half of the respondents (59.7%) were BSc nurses. Nearly half (50.2%) of the respondents earn a monthly salary of greater than or equal to 7000 ETB ( Table 1 ). The mean work experience of respondents was 6.2± 4.6 SD years and more than half (56.0%) of them were working inwards. Concerning to duty shift, more than two-thirds (68.9%) of the respondents were working the day shift. The majority (79.2%) of the participants were forced to work more than expected to do at a specified time ( Table 2 ).The majority (85.7%) of study participants reported that there is no adequate protective equipment in their hospital. Fifty-seven (19.5%) of the participants give care for more than ten patients per shift. More than three-fourths (78.2%) of the respondents did not have a guideline for the comprehensive management of COVID-19. More than twothirds (68.6%) of the participants did not take training on infection prevention (Table 3) . The prevalence of anxiety, depression and, stress among nurses was 69.6% with a 95% CI (64.2%, 75.0%), 55.3% with a 95% CI (48.8%, 61.4%), and 20.5% with a 95% CI (15.7%, 24.9%) respectively ( Figure 1 ).The following variables were found to be significantly associated with anxiety using bivariable logistic regression In bivariable logistic regression analysis, the following variables were found to be significantly associated with depression. Sex, workload, have a guideline, adequate protective equipment, having children, feedback from Using bivariable logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with stress. Sex, duty shift, taking training, have a guideline, fear of infecting family members, feedback from families and friends, confirmed/suspected cases in the family, diagnosed with chronic disease, history of mental disorders, and living with a person aged >60 years. Duty shift, taking training, fear of infecting family members, feedback from families and friends, confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and diagnosed with chronic disease were factors significantly associated with stress in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Nurses working in night shifts were two times at higher risk of developing stress compared with those who work in the day shift [AOR: 2.03; 95% CI (1.06, 3.90)]. Those study participants who did not take training on infection prevention were nearly three times at higher risk of experiencing stress compared with their counterparts [AOR: 2.87; 95% CI (1.27, 6.47)]. Those nurses (Table 7 ).The current study revealed that 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5% of the respondents experienced anxiety, depression, and stress respectively in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 31 The possible justification for this difference might be due to the difference in socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors such as attitudes, lack of adequate equipment like personal protective equipment and resources contribute to coping with the psychological crisis of the pandemic. The prevalence of depression in this study is consistent with the findings of studies conducted in Jordan; 57.8%, 28 China; 57.3%, 26 and New York; 53%. 29 On the other hand, this finding was higher than studies conducted in China; 44.4%, 23 Jinzhong, Shanxi Province; 12.4%, 24 Wuhan; 13.5%, 25 Miniland; 25.2%, 32 Guangdong; 43.6%, 31 Spain; 46%, 27 and Singapore; 8.9%. 30 The plausible justification for this difference might be due to the difference in the implementation of psychological protective measures, data collection techniques, and sample size.The prevalence of stress in this study is consistent with studies conducted in Guangdong, China; 24.7%. 31 However, the finding of this study was lower than studies conducted in Jiangsu Province, China; 32.23%, 22 Jinzhong, Shanxi Province, China; 49.1%, 24 Wuhan, China; 29.8%, 25 multiple centers in China; 28%, 26 Jordan; 50.1%, 28 and New York; 64%. 29 The possible reason for this difference might be due to the difference in the study period in which feelings when the COVID-19 pandemic first appears and overtime may vary. Since the previous studies were conducted immediately the pandemic exists.Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family members, and having a chronic disease was significantly associated with anxiety among nurses. The odds of anxiety was three times higher among nurses who did not have a guideline for the comprehensive management of COVID-19 as compared with those nurses who had a guideline. This finding was supported by a study conducted in New York in which a lack of national guidelines regarding treatment for COVID-19 was one of the major sources of distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 29 This might be due to the absence of a guideline for the management of COVID-19 expose nurses to develop anxiety due to the unknown nature of the virus.Those nurses who worried about family members who could be infected when they join them after work were nearly two times at a higher risk of developing anxiety compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Jiangsu Province; China and Spain. 22, 27 This might be due to one of the greatest fears of health personnel during the pandemic is the possibility of infecting others, specifically family members. 33 As a result, those nurses who are worried about infecting family members have a higher risk of developing anxiety. Similarly, having a chronic disease increases the risk of developing anxiety by nearly four times. This finding was supported by studies conducted in Wuhan; China and Turkey. 25, 34 This might be due to individuals with chronic conditions are at a higher risk of developing serious complications due to COVID-19 and dying. 35 Nurses with chronic diseases may be fearful of complications that may arise from infection which increases the risk of developing anxiety.Having a guideline, feedback from families and friends, history of mental disorders, and diagnosed with chronic disease were factors significantly associated with depression. The odds of depression were nearly two times higher among nurses who did not have a guideline for the comprehensive management of COVID-19 as compared with those nurses who had a guideline. This finding was supported by a study conducted in New York. 29 This might be due to nurses become unable to keep up-to-date information without a guideline. It is difficult to control infection risk in health facilities if a guideline is not available which makes nurses more depressed. Similarly, those nurses who received negative feedback from families and friends who joined front line work were nearly two times at a higher risk of developing depression compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by a study conducted in China. 23 This might be due to social stigma and discrimination experienced by the nurse from the community. Families, friends, and the community at large thought that the nurses were carriers of the virus and there was a possibility of transmission. During the outbreak, the community perceived that being a hospital staff means being a carrier of the virus.Having a chronic disease increases the risk of developing depression by nearly five times. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Wuhan, China. 25 This might be due to patients with chronic diseases who are at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms resulted from fear, loneliness, excessive worry, lack of social support, social isolation, and lockdown. 36 Patients with chronic disease were identified as a high-risk group to be affected by COVID-19. Due to this nurses with the chronic disease become more depressed than their counterparts. Also, those nurses who had a history of mental disorders were nearly seven times at a higher risk of developing depression compared with those who had not. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Wuhan, China. 25 This might be due to the reason that infection with coronavirus may exacerbate the pre-existing illness among patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness. 37 Patients with a history of mental disorders who become infected Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress with coronavirus may develop new, comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Due to this nurses with preexisting mental disorders becomes more depressed.Duty shift, taking training, fear of infecting family members, feedback from families and friends, confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and diagnosed with chronic disease were factors significantly associated with stress among nurses. Nurses working night shifts were two times at higher risk of developing stress compared with those who work the day shift. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Jiangsu Province; China. 22 This might be due to working at night shift that can make nurses lose the sense of control in their life, produce the feeling of powerless, cause insomnia, and other psychological problems including stress. 38 Those study participants who did not take training on infection prevention were nearly three times at higher risk of experiencing stress compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Jiangsu Province; China. 22 This might be due to the reason that inadequate training on infection prevention, lack of knowledge, and unclear specific tasks increased the risk of developing stress during a pandemic. 39 Training can help to understand the nature of diseases, standardize protection measures, enhance confidence, and improve compliance with infection control measures, thus reducing the risk of developing stress.Those nurses who worried about family members could be infected when they join them after work was nearly nine times at a higher risk of developing stress compared with their counterparts. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Jiangsu Province; China. 22 This might be because during a pandemic it is difficult for nurses to return home from the hospital because they worried about family infection. 40 During the COVID-19 outbreak, health institutions are the high-risk workplaces, where nurses are more likely to be exposed. Nurses become more stressed as they worried more about their family members highly due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19. Participants who received negative feedback from families and friends who joined front line work were nearly three times at a higher risk of developing stress compared with those who received positive feedback. This might be due to the stigma about the vulnerabilities of their job and restrictions on personal freedom. Poor support from families and friends is a significant risk factor for poor mental health. 41 Nurses become isolated due to discrimination and stigmatization and may have long-term effects on their psychological well-being.Similarly, having a chronic disease increases the risk of developing stress by nearly three times. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Wuhan, China. 25 This might be due to patients with chronic disease are at a higher risk of complications and there are additional questions about safety during the outbreak. Fear and worry about the worsening of their chronic health problems make them become stressed during an infectious disease outbreak. Since patients with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness and death, nurses with chronic diseases become more stressed compared with their counterparts. Also, those nurses who had family members/relatives confirmed or suspected for COVID-19 were three times at higher risk of developing stress compared with those who had not. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Wuhan, China. 25 This might be due to nurses may extremely concerned that their family members/relatives might be infected or even die. Nurses become stressed since they lose the possibility to visit their loved ones, cannot contact their family members, and unable to cope with this challenging situation. This study has some limitations. Study participants included in this study were from all departments but the study did not analyze the differences between nurses working in different departments. The study was based on subjective responses using questionnaires that may be prone to reporting bias since it does not incorporate objective measurements. The short duration of the study did not enable us to assess psychological impacts that accumulate over time and have an impact later in the outbreak like posttraumatic stress disorder.More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak respectively. This prevalence is high and nurses are highly affected psychologically during the pandemic which suggests psychological health interventions like psychological counseling and group meeting sessions. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health.

It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 1,2 By February 14, 2020, the first case appeared in Egypt. The World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 3 There is no proven vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Strong infection control measures and public adherence are the primary interventions to minimize viral spread. [4] [5] [6] General public measures were suggested, including telework, closure of non-essential facilities, and even complete lockdown. 7 The COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge to health care delivery. Telemedicine is not feasible in emergencies such as acute poisoning. 8, 9 In Egypt, a partial lockdown was implemented on March 12, resulting in serious impacts on the economy and mental health. 10 Lockdowns in the United Kingdom led to difficulty in accessing treatment and emergency departments quickly. 11 Italy showed reductions of as much as 73% to 88% in pediatric emergency department visits in comparison to 2019 and 2018. 12 The WHO reported three million annual hospital admissions due to toxic exposure world-wide, and 99% of poisonings that occur in developing countries are lethal. 13 Developing countries report high mortality due to increasing rates of toxic exposure, both intentional and unintentional. 14 Recognition of the pattern of poisonings in a given area may help to predict the need for prophylaxis, early diagnosis, and proper health care utilization to reduce morbidity and mortality during the pandemic.Since patients with acute poisoning usually present as emergency cases, delayed transfer or improper management may lead to serious deterioration. The current study aims to study the pattern of cases of acute poisoning admitted to the Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) in the spring (March through May) of 2016 through 2020 and to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on this pattern.The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative crosssectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. As the only center serving Gharbia governate of Egypt (1942 km 2 ), TPCC covers the high population density of 2,668/km 2 . The center in Tanta also serves neighboring areas lacking such facilities.The total number of cases admitted to TPCC was 2,094 patients. The current study included 1,916 cases admitted to the TPCC during the mentioned times, as 178 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Also, those treated as out-patients were excluded.Data collection commenced after obtaining approval from The Research Ethics Committee number 33829 Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University (Tanta, Egypt). Medical records of all cases admitted to the TPCC during the study period were included. The data were handled anonymously to maintain patient confidentiality.Demographic and Clinical Data-Demographic data were collected, including age, sex, occupation, and residence (ie, urban, rural, or from outside the governorate). The patients were classified according to age as follows: neonates aged less than one month; infants aged from one month to less than one year; toddlers aged one to four years; children five to 14 years; adolescents 15-19 years; adults 20-74 years; and older adults aged over 74 years. The manner of intoxication and whether the incident was intentional (ie, accidental, suicidal, or addiction) was documented. The delay time, which is time from ingestion to emergency services, and length of hospital stay (admission-discharge) were reported in hours.The nature of the toxic substance was determined by referring to the report of the patient or their relatives. Some cases brought the container of toxin so it could be identified directly. The clinical presentation and laboratory investigations were used to confirm the diagnosis. The causative agents were categorized as anticholinesterases, alcohols and drugs of abuse, analgesic antipyretics, phosphides, corrosives and hydrocarbons, Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and cardiovascular drugs and xanthine derivatives. Co-ingestions were also reported.Patient Scoring-The initial condition of the patient on admission was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and each patient was evaluated on a scale of 15; the patients were classified into severe (GCS 3-8), moderate (GCS 9-13), and mild brain injury (GCS 14-15). 15 After being stabilized, the poison severity score was calculated for all cases and the patients were categorized according to Persson, et al into minor, mild, moderate, severe, and fatal. 16 The majority of patients in this study lived in rural areas, regardless of year, with 66.2% of total admissions coming from rural areas compared to 17.1% from urban areas and 16.7% living outside the governate. During the lockdown period, there were significantly more admissions from urban areas (z = 4.4; P <.001).In this study, 1,097 females and 819 males were admitted. During the lockdown, 58.8% of the cases were female, consistent with all prior years studied, although the difference in sex distribution by year was not significant. Adults comprised the highest proportion of admissions (42.9%), followed by toddlers (25.1%) and adolescents (21.8%). The lockdown period brought a marked decrease in the number of hospital admissions (243 out of 1,916 cases). Table 1 shows the proportion of the admitted cases according to their ages over the study period. Linear trend forecasting of total admissions during the lockdown showed that the actual number of admissions was less than predicted with a 101.6% decrease and less than the previous year with a 36.1% decrease. Moreover, the current study revealed that 12.3% of total cases admitted during the lockdown were referred to ICU with 50.0% less than the simulated value (Figure 1 ).Analysis of exposure by age group revealed that adults showed the highest incidence of exposure to all intoxicants, except the corrosives and hydrocarbons, which were significantly more frequent among toddlers (P <.001; Figure 2 ). Table 2 and Table 3 reveal that adolescents showed significantly more frequent exposure to phosphides (z = 7.1) and significantly less exposure to corrosives (z = -4.9). Children's exposure to phosphides was low (z = -3.1), while they were significantly more likely to be exposed to antipsychotics (z = 4.3). Regarding infants, Anticholinesterase compounds exposure presented as follows: adults (57.0%), adolescents (18.6%), toddlers (16.2%), children (7.9%), and infants (0.3%). Alcohols and drugs of abuse exposure presented as follows: adults (61.0%), toddlers (26.8%), adolescents (7.3%), children (3.7%), and infants (1.2%). Analgesic antipyretic exposure presented as follows: adults (43.4%), toddlers (29.5%), adolescents (19.7%), children (5.7%), and infants (1.7%). Phosphide exposure presented as follows: adults (50.0%), adolescents (35.1%), toddlers (9.1%), children (5.2%), infants (0.3%), and older adults (0.3%). Corrosives and hydrocarbons exposure presented as follows: toddlers (65.3%), adults (14.3%), children (12.2%), and adolescents (8.2%). CNS depressants exposure presented as follows: adults (54.6%), adolescents (21.1%), toddlers (16.4%), children (6.6%), and infants (1.3%). Antipsychotics exposure presented as follows: adults (33.9%), toddlers (23.8%), adolescents (21.4%), children (18.5%), and infants (2.4%). Antidepressants exposure presented as follows: adults (49.1%), adolescents (24.5%), children (15.1%), toddlers (9.4%), and infants (1.9%). Cardiovascular and xanthine derivatives exposure presented as follows: adults (37.3%), adolescents (27.0%), toddlers (25.5%), children (9.7%), and infants (0.5%). Other non-classified toxic exposure presented as follows: adults (37.4%), toddlers (32.0%), adolescents (19.0%), children (10.8%), and infants (0.5%).antipsychotics exposure was significantly the most frequent (26.7%; z=2.6; P <.001).The current study revealed that oral exposure was the main route of intoxication (89.6%), followed by inhalation and dermal exposure. Over the study period and regardless of age, phosphide exposure was the most common (18.6%), followed by anticholinesterases (14.1%). The least presented exposure was allocated for alcohols and drugs of abuse (4.0%) and antidepressants (2.6%). Figure 3 shows that 2020 recorded the least proportions of exposure in all drug categories except alcohols and drugs of abuse, phosphides, and antipsychotics. Table 4 and Table 5 clarify that the lockdown period showed significantly high rates of exposure to phosphides and antipsychotics. On the other hand, exposure to anticholinesterases and analgesic antipyretics was significantly low. Linear trend-forward forecasting of phosphides and anticholinesterase intoxications during the lockdown showed that the actual number of admissions during the lockdown was less than predicted with a large declining percentage, especially among anticholinesterase (percentage of change from the predicted value -550.0% and -77.8% from the previous year), as shown in Figure 4 .Regarding the drug exposure among females, phosphide exposure was the most frequent (243 cases), followed by cardiovascular drugs and xanthine derivatives (145 cases). Table 6 illustrates that during the lockdown, exposure to anticholinesterases was significantly less frequent than the previous years (P = .02) and exposure to antipsychotics was significantly elevated (z = 3.1; P = .01). Concerning the male's admission and as shown in Table 7 , anticholinesterase exposure was the most frequent (184 cases) followed by phosphides. During the lockdown, there was significantly more phosphides and fewer cases of anticholinesterase exposure among males (P <.001).In the current study, co-ingestion was reported in 6.4% of cases. During the lockdown period, 4.9% of cases reported mixed ingestion with no significant differences when compared with other years. Analgesic antipyretics, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics were the most commonly co-ingested xenobiotics.The current study revealed that the majority of admitted cases were due to suicidal issues (56.2%). Accidental exposure was second in frequency (39.6%), while admission due to addiction overdose was the least frequent (4.2%), a pattern that remained consistent in all study years ( Table 8 ). The study showed that the majority of suicidal admissions were females (70.1%), while most admissions of males were due to addiction-related overdose ) 71.6 %). Accidental exposure did not show such great variation, as 57.8% were males. The admissions due to suicidal issues during the lockdown period showed similar distribution with more females than males (69.0% females versus 31.0% males). Table 9 shows that corrosives and hydrocarbons constituted the most frequent causes of accidental exposure (21.5%). Figure 5 shows that phosphides were the most involved agents in suicidal exposure (27.9%), followed by anticholinesterase compounds (12.5%).Linear forward forecasting of the manner of poisoning during lockdown is shown in Figure 6 . The actual numbers of suicidal, accidental, and addiction overdose exposures were less than the forecasted values. Suicidal admissions during the lockdown period decreased by 110.3% from the forecasted value and by 39.6% from the previous year. Unplanned admissions during the lockdown decreased by 95.4% from the previous years and by 34 .1% from 2019. Regarding the admission due to addiction overdose, 11 cases were admitted in comparison to 15 predicted cases and eight cases in 2019. Table 10 shows that the lockdown period influenced the delay time obviously as it was significantly increased in comparison to the previous four years (mean: 6.3; P <.001). Bonferroni test revealed that during the lockdown, the delay time to reach the health care facility was significantly prolonged in comparison to previous four years (P <.00). Besides, the current study revealed that the length of hospital stays ranged from 0.1-240 hours. The length of stay varied significantly by year (P <.001). These differences were greatest in 2016, which showed a significantly longer average length of hospital stay than 2018, 2019, and 2020 (P = .002, .009, and .009). Phosphide and analgesics antipyretics intoxicated cases showed the highest length of hospital stay (18.8 [SD = 20.76] and 18.2 [SD = 26.13] hours). Admissions due to antidepressants showed the briefest length of hospital stay (8.9 [SD = 7.14] hours). Linear forward forecasting for the delay time during the lockdown clarifies that the actual value was more than the predicted value by 33.3% and more the previous year by 65.8% ( Figure 7A ). Furthermore, the cases admitted during the lockdown spent more time in the hospital than the predicted by 17.1%, and slightly less time than the previous year 2019 (12.9) by a difference of 4.6%, as shown in Figure 7B . Fayed, Sharif Table 11 shows that the majority of admissions were mild cases (93.0%). This distribution was followed in every studied year. The cases admitted during the lockdown period showed significantly lower GCS than those admitted in the previous years (F = 6.300; P <.001). In comparison to the previous years, moderately intoxicated patients' admissions during the lockdown period were significantly more frequent in comparison to the mild cases, which significantly decreased (z = -6.7). Evaluation by poison severity score yielded similar results; the majority of admitted cases (85.4%) were mild. The least presented categories were the minor cases (3.7%) and the fatal intoxications (0.7%). This pattern was seen in all studied periods, including the lockdown, with no significant differences in between (P = .067).Among the admitted patients, 65.6% discharged against medical advice, usually after completion of treatment, and during the observation period, 19.8% discharged due to improvement and 7.4% discharged with further follow-up. Regarding the outcomes of the admitted cases, the current study revealed that among the five years (2016-2020), the recovery rate per 100 population was 92.9, while the death rate was around 3.1. However, approximately four percent of the total admissions showed long-term complications. Table 12 and Table 13 depict that the lockdown period, when compared with previous years, showed significantly lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1). Higher rates of ICU admissions were also associated. The current study emphasized that the outcome was influenced by the nature of the intoxicant. Phosphide exposure represented the major cause of mortality (83.7% of total deaths over the study period) and it was directly correlated with unfavorable outcomes (deaths; r s = 0.232; P <.001). Besides, the length of the hospital stay correlated significantly with unfavorable outcome (r s = 0.061; P = .009). Lastly, the increasing age of the patient showed a significant direct correlation with unfavorable outcome (r s = 0.118; P <.001).This study aimed to characterize the pattern of toxic exposure over the last five years and to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the pattern of hospital admissions due to toxic exposure reported to the TPCC. This study was carried out during the spring season, which was previously reported to be the peak season for toxic exposures, 17 although other studies have reported peaks in the winter and fall seasons. 18 The majority of admitted cases were from rural areas, consistent with previous studies in Egypt and other countries. 19, 20 Lack of health care facilities and private hospitals in rural areas necessitates referral to the cities. Elsewhere, reports indicate a majority of admissions are from urban areas. 21, 22 Differences may also be due to geographical differences between countries. The agricultural nature of the area served by TPCC leads to greater opportunities for pesticide exposure, exacerbated by easy access to the chemicals and inadequate awareness of safety measures. The significant reduction in rural admissions during the lockdown period is best explained by the quarantine measures that restrict transport of those living in remote areas. 23 In this study, 12.5% of admissions were homemakers, similar to a prior report in India. 13 In Iran, homemakers are one of the most frequently admitted for intoxication. 24 A large proportion of homemakers were involved in Turkey, while the proportion of farmers was greater in that study than in the current study. The greater involvement of students with intoxication (57.2%) due to drug poisoning was reported in other studies. In contrast, students were least frequently associated with intoxication admissions in India. 13 In this study, the total number of hospital admissions during the lockdown was significantly lower than in the four years prior. In Italy, a substantial decrease in pediatric admissions during the lockdown was reported in comparison to the previous year. 12 COVID-19 pandemic-related decrease in admissions of cardiac patients and for surgical procedures was reported. 25, 26 The current study revealed the predominance of admissions among adults and females, which has been verified elsewhere. [27] [28] [29] [30] Consistent with the frequent involvement of toddlers reported in the current study, the majority of admission in Saudi Arabia was for children under five years of age, although the distribution between male and female patients was nearly equivalent. 31 Consistent with the current study, the previous literature agreed that oral exposure was the most common route of toxic exposure. 13, 29, 32, 33 The current study showed that phosphide was the most commonly reported agent, followed by anticholinesterase. A previous study conducted in Egypt revealed that pesticides were the most frequently encountered toxic chemical in children admitted to the poison center, followed by medications and household substances. 33 Pesticides were also reported as the main cause of morbidity and mortality among patients admitted due to poisoning in developing countries, such as Zimbabwe, Turkey, and Iran. 34, 35 However, exposure to pesticides in developed countries was also encountered. 36 Alcohol and sedative-hypnotics were the most common causes of admissions for toxic exposure in Australia. 37 In contrary to the current study, acetaminophen exposure was the most frequently reported agent in Malaysia (35.0%) while pesticides only constituted 6.6% of total admissions. 34 This pattern was also noted in the United Kingdom 38 and Saudi Arabia. 31 Studies in the United States, Turkey, and Oman reported analgesics as the most common cause of drug intoxication. 39 The conflict between the current study and other studies might be attributed to the predominance of children in the latter cohort. 31 Country to country variations in prescribing and availability of over-the-counter medications also account for variability in admissions. However, Al-Barraq and Farahat reported significant exposure to household and hydrocarbons among children in Saudi Arabia. 31 This finding was consistent with a previous study. 29, 33, 35, 40 The frequency of children poisonings could be explained by the overactive and curious nature of children, who tend to explore with their mouths. The lower incidence of hydrocarbon intoxications during the lockdown period might be attributed to the increase in supervision and availability of parents and guardians during the pandemic. Pediatric toxic exposure is preventable and can be reduced by enhancing prophylactic measures. 17, 41 In the current study, exposure to CNS-acting drugs (ie, alcohols and drugs of abuse, antidepressants, and sedative-hypnotics) was not uncommon. Previous similar studies described overexposure to CNS-acting drugs as the major cause of intoxications and overdoses. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently involved drugs in Romania, France, and Norway. 22, 28, 40 Benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants were the most common cause of hospital admissions in Chile and Japan. 17, 42 The differences between these countries are attributable to differences in the socioeconomic levels.The significant prevalence of antipsychotic exposure during the lockdown was consistent with another study. 43 Besides antipsychotics, the current study reported an incremental increase in phosphide exposure during the lockdown, perhaps as a result of the stressful psychological and financial conditions associated with the COVID19 pandemic, such as disturbed sleep rhythms and increased reports of suicidal thoughts. 44 The co-ingestion of multiple intoxicants was only evident in 6.4% of admitted cases, consistent with previous studies conducted. 31, 45, 46 Reports of co-ingestion were higher in other studies. 17, 22, 28, 47 This disparity might be attributed to the frequent use of alcohol in combination with CNS-acting drugs to obtain a greater intoxicating effect.The current study reported that suicidal admissions constituted the highest incidence of admitted cases (58.2%), consistent with reports in other countries. 19, 21, 22, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] Other studies reported accidental poisoning as the most common cause. 29, 33, 53 The current study found that females accounted for around 70.0% of suicidal cases. The emotional response of females to stresses might be a justification as males usually use more violent methods for suicide. 54 The decreased admissions due to suicidal issues during the lockdown period are just a reflection of the decreased total number of cases admitted. Neumann, et al mentioned a decrease in the number of poisoned cases during lockdown, but predicted that with lockdowns and pandemic progression, the suicidal rates might increase due to the resultant depressions. 55 Suicidal use of pesticides accounts for around one-third of the world's suicides, with developing countries accounting for a major portion. 56 Furthermore, pesticide poisoning comes in the second rank of suicides in the Eastern Mediterranean regions. 57 The current study revealed that the phosphides and organophosphorus compounds were the most commonly used toxins to commit suicides (40.0%). They can be easily obtained in Egypt, sold without restrictions, with lacking proper instructions on the containers. This percent was higher than the estimated proportion by WHO for Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region, which may be explained by the presence of few published data and deficient records from these areas. 56 Another factor may be differences in the source of data (urban or rural areas). 58 In Australia, Turkey, and Iran, most suicidal poisoning was due to drugs rather than pesticides, which might be attributed to the nature of the studied areas. 21, 28, 30, 49 The current study revealed more delay in presentation to the hospital during the lockdown (mean = 4.2 [SD = 7.22] hours). A Romanian study reported a delay more than six hours attributed to the mild forms of poisoning often being treated first at home. 22 Studies from England, Spain, and Ethiopia reported shorter delay time with a mean of two to three hours. [59] [60] [61] Patients presenting to the emergency department within two hours of acute poisoning show the least morbidity and mortality. 62 The delayed presentation during the lockdown could be attributed to preference to avoid hours of a lockdown or difficult access to the transport facility or health care centers during lockdown hours. Studies suggested that delayed presentation more than four hours, and hence delay in initiation of resuscitative measures, could be a possible factor for high mortality, which might explain the increased mortality and unfavorable outcomes during the lockdown period in the present study. 63, 64 On the other hand, the current study showed that the length of hospital stay during the lockdown was longer than the predicted, which represents a higher load on the emergency hospital during pandemics. Despite that, the conveyed length of stay was less than reported elsewhere. 21, 22, 61, 62, 65 This may be attributed to the predominance of mild conscious cases in the current study (93.0%).Conducting the study in one center is considered a limitation. The excluded cases due to incomplete medical records might affect data analysis; however, data were excluded from the official data base of TPCC.Conclusion COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Higher phosphides and antipsychotics exposure were reported. The lockdown status significantly played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.The current study recommends restricting pesticides handling, raising public awareness regarding hazardous of pesticides, and establishing psychic consultations to reduce suicidal attempts.

Shortly thereafter on March 12, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1) . Following these declarations and other reports about the emergence of a new severe respiratory infection, public health officials rapidly developed and deployed public health messages about the pandemic around the world. Over a short period of time, the general public was provided information about COVID-19 and guidance about how to mitigate spread of the virus (e.g., face coverings, washing hands, physical distancing). However, awareness (attitudes, knowledge) of COVID-19 differs across various parts of the world. For example, low awareness and misperceptions about COVID-19 were reported in some parts of the world, such as North America, Europe and Africa (2, 3) . As a result, there have been urgent calls to find innovative ways to increase awareness about COVID-19 and help reduce the outbreak of this infectious disease (4, 5) .Ghana recorded its first two cases of COVID-19 on March 12, 2020 and cases have risen exponentially in the country to 13 ,717 as of June 20, 2020 (with 85 deaths), prompting presidential directives to increase awareness among citizens by creating and disseminating information on various preventive measures. These directives, mainly in English with direct translation in Ghanaian Sign Language, were disseminated on electronic and social media platforms. However, citizens who do not understand the national or official language must rely on other citizens to be accurately informed. As of April 25, 2020, the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), which could effectively educate citizens in every district using various indigenous Ghanaian languages, had been unable to do so due to lack of government funds (6) . To compensate for the lack of funding, citizens were educated with regularly posted updates on the NCCE website and social media platforms (7) . This strategy, however, does not address citizens who are more isolated and lack access to the internet or citizens who cannot read the official language.Apart from the updates from the NCCE, some musicians in the country took personal initiatives to compose songs in local languages to educate the public about the disease. These songs were without any government or non-governmental organization support and were also not a part of an official campaign or intervention. Music plays an integral role in the culture of many African countries including Ghana. In addition to serving entertainment purposes, music highlights socio-cultural values and helps in the performances of daily routines. It is also used to recount history, and it forms a part of festivals, ceremonies related to rites of passage and other cultural functions (55) . Music can be used as a vehicle for praise and criticism, especially in cases where authority figures are involved (8, 9) . Also, it has the ability to alter knowledge, attitudes and behavior (10) (11) (12) (13) , and the potential to provide a way to access target audiences that could be missed with other methods of communication (14) . Broadly speaking, music can play a pivotal role in helping increase awareness or gaining insight into different social issues.Music forms a part of edutainment, a popular strategy that allows for educational messages to be embedded in entertainment media in order to positively change behaviors and attitudes (15) . Edutainment is a combination of education and entertainment (57) . It is a theory-based communication process which, according to Ganeshasundaram and Henley (52) , ""involves the design and implementation of media programs that deliberately incorporate persuasive, educational content in popular entertainment formats to influence audience knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and practices"" (p. 311). This communication process is a tool for implicit persuasion as it is able to suspend disbelief and facilitate changes in the behavior of an audience (16, 17) . Govender (53) asserts that in terms of facilitating a desired behavioral or social change, edutainment has been more innovative in Africa than in other parts of the world. As a result, some non-governmental agencies financially support programs and activities that engage members of a community and attempt to solve social problems through creative artistic processes that are receptive and entertaining (18) .Generally, edutainment health interventions are complementary to traditional public health interventions (18) . Several studies have reported how songs and music can be used as a means of education and increasing awareness in public health context and clinical experience (12, (19) (20) (21) 50) . Thus, the use of music to influence knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward infectious diseases like COVID-19 is not a new phenomenon in Africa. In relation to HIV/AIDS and Ebola, for instance, research shows how popular artists in the region incorporated health-promoting messages and basic information about these diseases, and communicated preventative measures in their songs (14, (22) (23) (24) . In 2000, a campaign dubbed ""Stop AIDS: Love Life"" involved a music video produced by Ghanaian musicians to increase awareness about HIV/AIDS in the country. The campaign was implemented by Johns Hopkins University and the Ghana Social Marketing Foundation. It was aimed at de-stigmatizing HIV/AIDS, encouraging compassionate care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS, and encouraging citizens to adopt safe sex behavior (25) . Also, various studies document how popular musicians were commissioned by organizations such as WHO and UNICEF in 2014-2016 to compose prevention songs as a response to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and other parts of Africa (21, 26) .Certain characteristics of songs, such as repetition and the capacity for involuntary recall, enhance the effectiveness of educational messages (27) . These characteristics underpin reasons why, as earlier mentioned, HIV/AIDS and Ebola prevention messages were conveyed through songs in various parts of Africa (28) (29) (30) . In Uganda, for example, music was recognized by healthcare workers as ""a more localized and thus more effective medical intervention than outreach efforts in the form of lectures and seminars"" ((29), p. 27). The assumption is that in African communities, the performance of songs can facilitate information dissemination and public debate on sensitive health topics (15) . It is therefore not surprising that songs have been composed in Ghana and other African nations (e.g., Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Cameroun, and Kenya) to educate people about the novel coronavirus (31) . The purpose of this paper is to describe the content of song lyrics related to COVID-19 messaging and to highlight among other things the preventative measures embedded in them. The songs examined were composed by individual Ghanaian musicians and posted on their YouTube channels during the COVID-19 pandemic.Ghana is located in West Africa, bordered on the west side by the Ivory Coast, and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south. According to recent census data, the population of Ghana is 29 million (32) with over 81 spoken languages (51) . Four languages, including English, Akan, Hausa, and Ghanaian Pidgin English (GhPE), are the most common languages used for broad communication in the country (51) .Akan is the primary language spoken in the south (including the capital, Accra) and Hausa is the primary language spoken in the north (33) . However, English is Ghana's official national language used in education, politics, government business, international trade, and technology (34) (35) (36) . English is also (14) Social distancing/Avoid social gathering 19 (14) No handshake/hugging 15 (11) Cover your mouth when sneezing/coughing 13 (9) Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth 10 (7) Wear face mask 8 (6) Isolate sick people 4 (3)Clean/Disinfect surfaces regularly 3 (2) the language used in print media and most electronic media programs. However, about eight of the written indigenous languages, including Akan, Ewe, Ga, Dagbani, Dagaare, and Gonja, are used for certain programs on radio and television (37, 38) .YouTube [www.youtube.com], a music sharing website, was searched to identify coronavirus-related songs from Ghanaian musicians. following Google. According to the 2020 Alexa report, following Google [www.google.com], YouTube is the second of 500 top websites frequently used among Ghanaians (www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/GH). This makes YouTube the most popular and most patronized music and video sharing website in Ghana. The search was conducted from April 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020 with the following terms ""Ghana coronavirus song, "" ""coronavirus song Ghana, "" ""coronavirus song from Ghana, "" ""coronavirus audio from Ghana, "" and ""coronavirus video from Ghana."" A total of 40 songs from both wellestablished and upcoming musicians were found. We included songs by Ghanaian artists in English or Ghanaian local language with any COVID-19 educative information. We excluded songs that only mentioned COVID-19 without providing any implicit or explicit public health message about the disease. An example can be retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=EduNrGL5OwE. The songs were searched and selected by three bachelorprepared research assistants based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria. The selected songs were then reviewed by two PhD prepared researchers. Each song was assessed solely in terms of its lyrics and no other features such as tempo, rhythm, or mood. Non-English lyrics were translated and transcribed by language experts from Ghana. The lyrics were then reviewed to obtain information about key issues raised (themes), language(s) used, and references to specific symptoms and preventive measures. Of the 40 songs identified, 28 met the inclusion criteria.We conducted a thematic analysis to examine the lyrics of the selected songs. As a qualitative method, a thematic analysis allows for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterned themes within the songs. The four phases of analysis (immersion, code generation, theme identification, and theme confirmation) that guide a systematic thematic analysis were employed (39) . First, we became immersed and acquainted with the data by reviewing the lyrics of each song and noting preliminary points of interest. Secondly, two of the authors engaged with the transcribed lyrics and lyrics were double-coded. Codes were then compared to ensure consistency. We coded any mention of coronavirus, its effects, or how people can avoid it or deal with it. Thirdly, we merged codes and categorized them into major themes. Lastly, we reviewed and made clear definitions for each theme generated from the data. The most representative lyrics for each identified theme were selected to summarize the findings. Non-English lyrics are first presented in italics in the original language, and then followed by an English translation. There was no disagreement between the authors during the analysis.The final dataset included 28 songs that met study selection criteria. In addition to the themes described below, other characteristics of the lyrics are summarized in Table 1 , including the languages in which the songs were sung, the signs and symptoms mentioned in the lyrics, and any mention of coronavirus preventive measures. The songs were in various genres of Ghanaian music including Hip-life, Gospel and Highlife. While only five songs were in one language, most were multilingual, with 14 songs in three languages and 10 songs in two languages (See Table 1 ). The languages that dominated the songs were Akan (n = 21), English (n = 16), and Ghanaian Pidgin English (GhPE) (n = 13).As shown in Table 1 , all 28 songs mention some way to help prevent the infection. The step that people can take to prevent the transmission of the disease were also integrated in the lyrics. Examples of prevention included: wash your hands with soap under running water; rub your hands with alcohol-based sanitizer on a regular basis; avoid handshakes; use face masks; avoid social gatherings such as parties, funerals, and outdoor ceremonies; cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; and put yourself at a distance of about 2 m (6 feet) from other people during interactions.Eight major themes emerged from the analysis of the song lyrics: (1) Public health guidelines, (2) COVID-19 is real and not a hoax, (3) COVID-19 is infectious, (4) Prayer as method to stop the virus, (5) Emotional responses and disruption of ""everyday"" activities, (6) Verbally expelling the virus, (7) Call for unity and collective efforts, and (8) Inspiring hope. Each of these themes is described below.The most prevalent theme in all the songs was emphasis on public health guidelines including the need for personal responsibility to avoid getting infected and infecting others. The lyrics suggested that the only way to combat the disease is to adhere to public health guidelines. Lyrics indicated that people can generally take care of themselves during the pandemic by adopting healthy lifestyles and by being compliant with public health guidelines from the WHO, Ghana Health Service, and Ministry of Health. Examples of lyrics that support this theme are as follow.Lyrics supporting the theme of public health guidelines As seen in Table 2 , all the preventive measures were found in the song lyrics. Handwashing was the most frequently mentioned measure (n = 25). The musicians also emphasized the need for individual responsibility to avoid contracting coronavirus and subsequently, ward off death. They added that in order to maintain health, one must eat healthy, maintain good personal hygiene, keep surroundings clean, remain hydrated, and exercise regularly.The songs sought to inform the public that coronavirus is real and not a hoax as believed by some people. Some lyrics indicated that the disease emerged from China and spread to almost all parts of the world including Europe, United States of America, and Africa. Musicians sang about many people dying, and many others being hospitalized in these countries as a result of contracting the disease. Others referred to the fact that Ghana first recorded only two cases but there has since been an exponential growth in the number of infections. Lyrics that support this theme are listed below.Lyrics supporting the theme that coronavirus is real and not a hoax More than half of the songs expressed the idea that divine intervention is needed to curb the spread of the virus, and to heal and protect people. Some of the lyrics urged their audience to pray to God. For example:Yen sre Twedeampn na obehu yen mb (#17 Akan)""Let us plead with the Almighty and he will show us mercy""Yen su fre Nyame, obehu yen mb (#18 Akan)""Let us cry unto God, he will show us mercy""We for pray say Baba go come save (#23 GhPE)""We need to pray that the Father will save us""Other lyrics were actual prayers asking God to help find a vaccine, restore calm to the world, or protect the people. ""Almighty God … use your power, your protective ability to protect us""Apart from the health implications of coronavirus, other effects of the disease highlighted in the data include the fear it has induced in people and the emotional reactions to disruptions in social and economic activities.In the examples below, the world in general is identified as a fearful place, and some specific countries have been described as ""ghost towns"" due to the restrictions placed on movement. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, many lyrics in the data have called for a more collaborative mindset among individuals at the national level and among nations of the world at the global level. As everyone struggles to adapt to the current reality, people must recognize the need to support and collaborate across borders, to share what works and what does not work in fighting the disease. Some musicians described coronavirus as ""a common enemy"" and thus reinforced the need for unity and collective efforts at both national and global level to help defeat the virus. Some examples of this theme are included below.Lyrics supporting the theme that coronavirus requires unity and collective efforts There were also lyrics that assured their audience that this pandemic will not last forever, and that soon the world will recover from its negative impact. Some musicians also expressed their belief that God will heal those infected and deliver the world from this pandemic.Lyrics that illustrate the theme of inspiring hope:Nyame beyi yεn afiri mu, yareε ne amaneε wei mu (#22) Akan ""God will deliver us from this sickness and trouble""Sing Africa oh oh oh Sing America oh oh ho Sing Asia oh oh oh We will survive, yes. We will survive, together you and I We will survive coronavirus. We will survive. Together we will overcome. It doesn't matter anywhere you from. We will survive, Coronavirus. We will survive, together you and I. We will survive. We will survive, yes (#23) EnglishSoldiers in green but corona looks like it's in patrol. But wait wait God will never fail. His holy name I hail. He go give we bail, bail to conquer. But wait wait, he is the king of kings. He never lose he always wins … We go conquer, we go conquer. Ebola came, we conquered it. Corona dey, we no dey shake. We're staying safe, build up our faith. Pray everyday cos we go conquer (#2) English and GhPE ""Soldiers in green but coronavirus looks like it's in patrol. But wait wait God will never fail. His holy name I hail.He will give us bail, bail to conquer. But wait wait, he is the king of kings. He never lose he always wins … We will conquer, we will conquer. Ebola came, we conquered it. Coronavirus exists, we are not afraid. We're staying safe. Build up our faith. Pray everyday because we will conquer""As evident in Table 1 , the lyrics analyzed in this study involved various topics to create awareness about COVID-19. The major themes found from the analysis are ""public health guidelines;"" ""COVID-19 is real and not a hoax;"" ""COVID-19 is infectious;"" ""prayer as method to stop the virus;"" ""emotional responses and disruption of ""everyday"" activities;"" ""verbally expelling the virus;"" ""call for unity and collective efforts;"" and ""inspiring hope."" The lyrics provided content on the prevalence of the disease, how indiscriminating and infectious it is, and how it has disrupted social activities on both personal and global level. Some signs and symptoms were identified in the lyrics, along with steps that people can take to prevent the transmission of the disease. The song lyrics tend to identify COVID-19 as a global social crisis with significant public health impact rather than a local health issue. Thus, some of the musicians resorted to prayer and asked for divine intervention. They inform the public that COVID-19 has no cure, and infected people may be asymptomatic. They also conveyed emotional appeals that warned listeners that the disease is ""an (common) enemy, "" ""highly infectious, "" ""dangerous, "" ""wicked, "" ""scary, "" ""serious, "" and ""deadly."" While some of these descriptions may induce fear, the message that many people all over the world have been infected irrespective of age, race, nationality, physical stature or social status, can be viewed as an essential step in de-stigmatizing the disease.Acknowledging that loneliness is a common feeling during social isolation can help to address mental health issues, and the act of inspiring hope in some lyrics may also enhance the quality of life of persons who are already infected (54) or assure listeners who are not yet infected that overcoming the disease is possible. The theme of inspiring hope in this study highlights a belief among Ghanaians that reassurance is needed in every predicament, and thus important in health and social care (40) . Together, these songs propose a collective effort to completely fight the virus, but at the same time encourage listeners to take responsibility for their own health and adopt the necessary precautions to avoid the impact of the disease. The theme of ""call for unity and collective efforts"" reflects the communal nature of the Ghanaian society. The collectivity that is projected in the lyrics of the songs implicate not only those who are affected (in)directly by the disease but also, everyone around them (41, 42) .In addition to promoting the public health guidelines for COVID-19, some of the musicians encouraged the use of prayer as well as verbally expelling the virus as methods of combating the disease. This is unsurprising because research has revealed that in Ghana, some people conceptualize the causes and cures of diseases through both biomedical and religious/spiritual means (43, 44, 56) . As noted by Okyerefo and Fiavi (56) , among Ghanaians, the religious/spiritual methods are viewed as complementary rather than challenging or competing with the biomedical models of healthcare. Seeking divine intervention through prayer during the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to the belief that ""doctors can treat certain conditions, but only God heals"" ((56), p. 308). The act of verbally expelling the virus is a display of belief in the power of words among Ghanaians. The general notion is that the power of spoken words just as the health of a person has a link with the metaphysical and supernatural world. As a result, words can be effective in dismissing diseases and healing practices (45). In a broad sense, the themes of prayer and verbally expelling the virus in this study provide us with the understanding that in Ghana, biomedical models exist and operate alongside other healthcare practices.The multilingual nature of Ghana was also reflected in the song lyrics. Akan, English, and GhPE were the languages used most often in the composition of these songs. This finding is not surprising, rather it validates the assertion that these languages serve as ""lingua francas"" in Ghana. Akan is the most widely used local language in different social contexts (46) while English is the defacto official/national language and a cross-ethnic ""lingua franca"" in Ghana (35, 36) . GhPE, however, functions as the only medium of communication between English speakers and non-English speakers who do not share a common local language or non-English people of different linguistic backgrounds (47, 51) . Most of the musical artists displayed their bilingual/multilingual identity as Ghanaian and primarily used these languages of wider communication to ground their messages in socio-culturally relevant contexts.Even though there are several local languages spoken in sub-Saharan Africa (48) , most of the WHO and national educational guidelines on COVID-19 are in the country's official language (English or French). It is therefore important for public health specialists, politicians, media experts, and social leaders to employ strategies that use local languages rather than an official language only understood by smaller portions of a country's population. The use of songs composed in local languages could be an important means of sensitizing vulnerable citizens to the awareness and health implications of COVID-19. Music has much to offer to the communication efforts related to COVID-19 and is especially appropriate for educational needs due to its inherent participatory nature (see (49) ). In addition to musicians, other artistic entertainers such as comedians and poets should also be involved in the broader efforts to engage and educate the public through messages conveyed in their spoken words. This should be done in consultation with public health workers to avoid misinformation.Despite educational efforts targeted at creating awareness about COVID-19, the number of cases continues to soar in many parts of the world. This increase would suggest the need for new and novel approaches that can complement the existing mechanisms for raising COVID-19 awareness and prevention. Song lyrics may be one such approach. Although some lyrics may be controversial or irrelevant just for the purpose of creating a rhythm, music still represents an inexpensive yet innovative and powerful tool for discussing the novel coronavirus and best practices for preventing its spread. It is also noteworthy that not all song lyrics will make a positive contribution to promoting preventive behaviors; however, analysis of song lyrics can provide insight into local attitudes toward the virus. In addition, collaboration between health workers and musicians can offer a means to disseminate information in an accessible way.Undoubtedly, additional research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of using music and lyrics to educate the public on COVID-19, however existing literature clearly demonstrates that music contributes a great deal to public education efforts related to HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. The messages embedded in the lyrics of songs are designed to reach a large segment of the population faster and in a meaningful and more memorable fashion. People with a broad range of literacy and access to information can better retain these types of messages and thus achieve the goal of public health knowledge.The major limitations of this study include the limited focus on Ghana music and the potential for missing some songs created during this short time frame or not having access to other songs that were short-lived in the media. In addition, many of the songs used as data for this study could benefit from a more detailed lyrical analysis (9), which we hope will be undertaken in future research. Nevertheless, this paper focused on the unique and novel contribution of music to creating awareness about COVID-19 in Ghana and similar studies should also be conducted in other countries. Also, we did not assess the impact of the song lyrics on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors; therefore, a more comprehensive ethnographic study is needed to understand the impact of the songs on the society.Raising public awareness on any social issue or health crisis often demands an increase in information dissemination through both formal and informal means. While it was not our intention to prioritize any one dissemination strategy, educating the public through diverse musical genres and other non-deliberative means could yield valuable global results. Music is one such information dissemination vehicle or promotion strategy utilized in health communication in many places over time, mainly because it has the potential to facilitate the process of behavioral change among specific sectors of the population. We showed that the lyrics in the songs used as data are informative and encourage people that they can and should take responsibility for their health and adhere to necessary safety protocols. Thus, the discourse on COVID-19 expressed through songs has relevance for the development of culturally appropriate health messaging. Results from this study support the idea that music has the ability to contribute to the fight against coronavirus and can be employed as an enjoyable supplement that reinforces or amplifies educational efforts in various communities around the world.Results from this study can also be used to inform policymakers that investing in health communications using music could be worthwhile. Supporting musicians with sufficient resources to engage and educate citizens about the ongoing pandemic could be cost-effective. This study should be viewed as the beginning of a journey to document how music can be used to raise awareness about COVID-19. Generally, music is not immune to the problems of misinformation, and attention to song lyrics may provide broad insight into local discourse, including ideas that may contradict accepted public health messages. Therefore, a future study could focus on some recognition of the diversity of messages that may be communicated through songs in order to provide a more nuanced perspective. Further research is required to assess the impact of song lyrics as well as melodies and rhythms. However, results from this study should stimulate interest in how to use songs and tailor them to local communities to fight against COVID-19 and other future pandemic health crises.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Materials, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.RT participated in the design of the study, analyzed all the research data, and drafted the manuscript.

An online cross-sectional study","a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111In Africa, many people have the misconception that they may acquire infection if they visit a healthcare facility due to a lack of trust in the care provided by healthcare facilities and thus, often take preventive and care measures on their own. According to a health behavior model, information knowledge and practice have been identified as important factors for increasing hospital visits among patients with low levels of trust [11] .The Ethiopian government has been very active in disseminating prevention messages on radio and television, at federal and regional levels and there are strong initiatives and recognition of the public health importance of COVID-19 (screening, quarantine, and treatment centers). However, there is still a strong need to enhance community awareness and practices to stop the nationwide spread of the virus [12, 13] .Successful mitigation and reduction of mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19 require behavioral change, which is influenced by people's knowledge and perceptions [14] . However, currently, the knowledge and practice level of the public towards has not been studied yet. Thus, this study is intended to identify the level of knowledge and practice towards Covid-19 among residents in Ethiopia.This study employed an online cross-sectional survey using Facebook, Telegram, and email to collect data from the respondents regarding their prevention knowledge and practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic from April 15 to 22, 2020. Since the first cases of the COVID-19 were confirmed in Ethiopia on March 13, 2020 , the government declared a state of emergency and lockdown practical interaction between the people of Ethiopia on April 5, 2020. This imposed a great problem on researchers to conduct community or institutional-based surveys.Thus, the researchers selected respondents from the population of Ethiopia by using a snowball sampling technique through the author's network with residents on the popular social media, Facebook, Telegram, and email. The link to the questionnaire was posted by the author on the above-mentioned social media to be fulfilled. The Terms and Conditions of the website regarding the responses of respondents, the following questions were added at the end of the questionnaire on Google Forms to help the respondents to submit their responses if they agreed with the Terms and Conditions of the Google Forms: ""By submitting this form, do you agree to the Terms and Conditions of Google Forms?"" In doing so, we were too confidential that our data collection method was compiled with the Terms and Conditions of the Google Form website.The questionnaire contained both open-ended and closed-ended questions that focused on the respondent's socio-demographic, knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 prevention. The inclusion criteria of the participants used in this study were the ability of the respondents to read, write, and understand the English language, having Ethiopian nationality, and aged � 18 years old. Before proceeding to fulfill the questionnaire, the objective of the study, the informed consent of participation, the declaration of anonymity and confidentiality of their responses was briefed in a good manner in the questionnaire [7] .The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 prevention were measured based on the WHO (2020) Survey Tool and Guidance [15] . This study employed descriptive statistics to summarize the knowledge and practice of their respondents towards novel coronavirus pandemic prevention [16] . The questions about the knowledge of COVID 19 prevention had 7 items as presented in Table 2 below, and the questions about the respondent's practice towards COVID 19 prevention had 6 items, as presented in Table 3 . The rest of the five questions were about the respondent's socio-demographic information. All the questions contained the category of (""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Don't know""). Prevention knowledge and practice level were assessed by assigning one point for each correct answer and the knowledge towards COVID 19 prevention indicated by two categories: poor for (< 5 of 7 items) and good for (� 5 of 7 items). Especially regarding the towards COVID-19, the respondents were asked about going to crowded places, wearing masks in public, maintaining social distance, handwashing, avoiding handshaking, and obeying government restrictions. The respondents practiced towards COVID-19 indicated by two categories: poor practice for (< 4 of 6 items) and good practice for (� 4 of 6 items).The collected data were checked manually for its completeness. The data were coded and edited in Epi-Info version 3.5.1, exported to STATA version 14.0, for further statistical data analysis. Finally, descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the data.The study was conducted by preparing an online survey. Thus, the investigators informed the study participants about the general objective of the research that their answers remained anonymous to ensure the confidentiality of the information they provided. Therefore, every respondent's consent for participation was informed before proceeding to fill the questionnaire. Moreover, the questionnaire was designed anonymously and the study result did not identify the personality of the respondents but presented in aggregated statistics.A total of 341 respondents participated in this study. The majority of the respondents (80.3%) were male. Among those participants, more than two-thirds of them were in the age group of 18-32 years old and had an education level of college diploma and above. Among all respondents, more than half of them were unmarried, about two-thirds of them were urban residents. (Table 1 ) presents details.In the current study, from all respondents, the majority (91.8%) had information about COVID-19. The analysis showed that although the majority of the respondents thought to avoid touching the nose, eye, and face with an unwashed hand to protect themselves from getting COVID-19, about 11.4% of the respondents did not agree with this preventive measure. Besides, 286 (83.9%) out of all the respondents thought that wearing the mask could protect them from getting off the COVID-19, and the rest of 16.1% of the respondents did not believe that wearing a face mask could protect from getting off the COVID-19. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents are three-fourths, reported that avoiding hugging with people can protect them from getting the infection of COVID-19. Also, 26.7% of all respondents thought that drinking a lot of water can protect them from getting an infection of the COVID-19. However, more than 93% of the respondents reported that maintaining social distance can protect them from getting off the COVID-19, and 90% of them thought that frequent hand washing for 20 seconds can protect them from getting an infection with the virus. (Table 2 ) presents details.The data revealed that urban area residents have a good knowledge of COVID-19 prevention by avoiding hugging with people than the respondents living in suburban and rural areas, respectively (Fig 1) . Moreover, the majority of the respondents who had the highest educational level knew that avoiding touching the eye, face, and nose with the unwashed hand could reduce the risk of becoming infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) (Fig 2) . Also, the majority of the respondents who had the highest educational level reported that maintaining social distance can reduce the risk of getting a novel coronavirus . On the other hand, respondents with a secondary level of education and below had less knowledge on maintaining social distance to reduce the risk of getting the COVID-19 (Fig 3) .In this study, it was observed that about 77.4% of the respondents were not obeying government restrictions; however, only about 22.6% of the respondents were obeying government restrictions on COVID-19 prevention. Moreover, 137(40.2%) of the respondents were still going to crowded places, and 76% of them did not wear face masks when they left their homes. The data also revealed that 61.1% of the respondents kept themselves two meters away from each other in a public place. On the contrary, 39.4% of the respondents did not experience social distance in the public place to save themselves from the transmission of novel coronaviruses. Moreover, the data show that the majority (84.5%) of the respondents washed their hands when they went to the public place, and 20.8% of the respondents were still shaking their hands with people when they went to the public place. (Table 3 ) presents details.The majority of respondents living in urban areas have a good implementation of prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic when wearing a face mask when they went to the public place as compared to the respondents living in suburban and rural areas (Fig 4) . The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention among residents of Ethiopia Furthermore, those respondents with the highest educational level have a good practice of prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining the social distance (i.e., at least keeping themselves two meters away from another person) as compared to the respondents with secondary school educational level (Fig 5) . Generally, the mean score and standard deviation of the respondent's prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic was 5.5 ± 1.1 or the proportion of respondents know COVID-19 prevention techniques was 78.6%, and the mean score and standard deviation of the respondents on the practice of prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic was 3.1 ± 1.1 or the proportion of respondents who practiced COVID-19 prevention was 51.5%. (Table 4 ) presents details.The Chi-square test of associations shows that age, gender, marital status, educational level, and place of residence are categorical variables independents variables associated with knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 of the respondents. (Table 5 ) presents details.In this study, the collected data revealed that 241(88.0%) and 81(29.6%) males had knowledge of COVID-19 and practice towards COVID-19, respectively. The 198(85.0%) and 67 (28.8%) of the respondents aged 18-32 knew about the COVID-19 prevention and practice towards COVID-19, respectively. (Table 5 ) presents details.This study was the original study conducted to assess the knowledge and practice of the COVID-19 pandemics among the residents of Ethiopia. Accordingly, the prevention The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention among residents of Ethiopia knowledge of the respondents towards the COVID-19 was high and the practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic were low among the community.In the current study, approximately 91.2% of the Ethiopian population had information about novel coronaviruses at the time when the study was conducted. It is comparable with a study conducted in Pakistan in which more than 90% of medical students had heard about the disease [9] . Also, this finding is in line with a study conducted in Nepal, in which 91.6% of the population were aware of all the clinical features of novel coronavirus [17] . A survey conducted in three countries of Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya) showed that more than 94% of the population had information about the novel coronavirus [1] .Based on the knowledge score of the participants, the overall prevention knowledge towards the COVID 19 pandemic was 78.8%. This finding is in line with studies conducted in Jordan [18] , Nigeria [19] , and an online survey conducted in Uganda [20] , in which respondents had good knowledge of COVID 19 prevention. However, this finding is lower than that of a study conducted in China [21] . In this country, the knowledge of HCW towards COVID 19 prevention was high (89%). Furthermore, this finding is lower than the study conducted in Pakistan in which the knowledge towards COVID 19 prevention was 92.3% [22] . This discrepancy could be due to differences in the study population. The previous study was conducted among health professionals to assess their knowledge level, but the current study was conducted among the general population. This is because health professionals have more exposure to information about the disease.This result is higher than the study conducted in Addis Zemen Hospital, North West Ethiopia, in which the knowledge of participants towards COVID 19 was 33.9% [14] . This difference might be due to the difference in study participants, in which the previous study was The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention among residents of Ethiopia conducted among chronic disease patients, while the current study was conducted among the general population of the country. Furthermore, the previous study was conducted through face-to-face interviews, while the current study was conducted via an online data collection. Therefore, knowledge among the general population is higher than chronic disease patients because most of the respondents participated in the current study literate population.The findings of this study were higher than the study conducted in Nigeria among pregnant women. In Nigeria, the result of a study showed that the knowledge of pregnant women regarding the preventive mechanism of COVID 19 was 60.9% [23] . This difference might be seen due to the time of the study and the population participated in the study. In the previous study, the study was conducted when the disease was declared as a pandemic for the first time, while our study was conducted after the population provided with awareness about the disease. Besides, pregnant women were the target population, while all eligible residents have participated in the current study. In the current study, more than 90% of the population had a good knowledge with regards to maintaining social distance and frequently washing hands for greater than 20 seconds. These are the two main strategies that were recommended by WHO to prevent the transmission of this disease [24] .Even though the knowledge regarding social distancing and frequent hand washing was good, the practice of experiencing social support and frequent hand washing is low when compared to their knowledge level. Furthermore, in this study, only 61% and 84% of participants practice social distancing and hand washing, respectively. Moreover, around 88% of participants have good knowledge that wearing a mask can protect people from COVID 19. Similarly, 82% of participants were practiced to wear a mask to prevent COVID 19 in the Ethiopian context.Overall, there is a gap between having knowledge and practicing the prevention mechanism of COVID 19. This could be due to financial scarcity to practice prevention mechanisms, trained health professionals on the disease. The scarcity of PPE could be one reason for the observed gap. Due to the increased need for PPE, it was a global problem in combating the pandemic. Moreover, the strong social interdependence challenges the main prevention practices such as social distancing in Ethiopia [25] . On the other hand, continued political insecurity in some regions of the country would also the main reason for not practicing the prevention method of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the economic status of the population is substandard and their life is depending on daily activities.One of the strengths of this study is that it is the study conducted for the first time in Ethiopia to assess the prevention knowledge and practice of prevention knowledge towards the Novel Coronavirus diseases for the Ethiopian community. However, there are some limitations to this research. Among those one of the key limitations is that questions that are related to the knowledge and practices of the Ethiopian community were not validated. The second limitation of this study is that the data collected by an online distribution of the survey through social media and only individuals with access to social media and the internet participated in the study. Thus, the study may not represent the overall population of the country.In this study, the knowledge of the respondents towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention was high. However, the implementation of prevention knowledge towards the COVID-19 of the respondents was low as compared to those respondents who knew about the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic. This shows that changing the prevention knowledge to practices toward the COVID-19 pandemic was poor in the community. Therefore, to tackle the spread of this COVID-19 pandemic disease in the community, prevention knowledge of the community should be implemented into the practices. To do so, the stakeholders should play their vital role to teach the community about the ways and mechanisms of implementing the prevention knowledge into practice to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic diseases. We recommend community-based awareness creation and education to change the prevention knowledge into practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.Supporting information S1 Data.

[3] [4] [5] The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. 6 On January 30, 2020 and 11 March 11, 2020 the disease was announced as a public health crisis of international importance, and a pandemic by WHO, respectively. 1 This contagious disease can be spread from infected individuals to healthy ones via respiratory droplet, hand shake, and fecal-oral, and it has an incubation time of 2-14 days, but an infected individual can transmit the virus just before they clinically manifest the disease. [7] [8] [9] Globally COVID-19 pandemic is now creating tremendous social and economic burden on the health care system. 10 Currently the pandemic is affecting around 213 countries all over the globe and 2 international conveyances with total cases of 10,249,741, deaths 504,490, recovered 5,557,974, active cases 4,187,277 and seriously critical 57,347. Of those, 385,219 cases and 9698, deaths were in Africa. 11 More than 100 million women globally are pregnant at the movement and nearly all of them are at a risk of transmitting the virus. 12 In every contagious disease outbreak pregnant mothers are especially susceptible, because of their impaired physiology and vulnerability to infection. 13, 14 Since the health care systems of Africa are ineffective, challenges such as lack of facilities and resources, inappropriate training of health care staff and unreliable data communication, specialists have concerns about corona virus propagation to the continent and it was anticipated it would be hard to keep the outbreak under control. 15 , 16 Ethiopia is one the African countries with scarce human and technological assets that are prone to be affected by the current corona virus outbreak. 17 Although the government is highly dedicated to control the outbreak before it brings major harm to the population, the incidence of the virus is continuously accelerating every day.Importantly as of 31 July, a total of 422,354 samples have been tested and 17,530 were corona virus confirmed cases. Of these cases 6950 people have recovered, 274 deaths, 138 people were reported to be in critical condition. Similarly, 1134 people (442 in hotels in Addis Ababa, 220 in Addis Ababa University and 321 in regional quarantines) were under mandatory quarantine at designated hotels and selected sites in the country. A total of 14,269 people, having completed the 14-day follow-up, have been discharged from quarantine. 18 WHO recommended that necessary safety measures and interventions must be taken to reduce the possibility of the disease being propagated from region to region. 19 At the same time WHO also highly recommend a variety of preventive steps including daily hand washing with water and soap, hand rubbing with alcohol-based sanitizers, social distancing, covering hand and mouth during coughing and stopping eyes, nose and mouth touching. 20 Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious and results in many deaths in the world, currently there is no antiviral treatment or vaccine that has been specifically suggested for the virus. Thus, the most important action is to implement protective actions to handle COVID-19 transmission by raising the level of awareness and creating positive attitudes. In Ethiopia there is no study conducted on this issue yet.Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the level of knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 and its determinants among pregnant mothers attending antenatal care (ANC) in Debre Tabor General Hospital Northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was performed in Debre Tabor General Hospital from June 05-26, 2020. Debre Tabor General Hospital is located in Debre Tabor Town, South Gondar district of Amhara Regional state which is about 665 kilometers away from Addis Ababa (capital city of Ethiopia) in a Northwest direction and 103 kilometers from Bahir Dar. The Hospital provides community care including maternal and child health services. All pregnant women who had ANC follow-up for current pregnancy in the hospital during the study periods were the study population. Pregnant women who have given informed consent to take part in the study and had ANC follow-up at the hospital were included; while pregnant mothers who has mental problems, hearing difficulty, or were critically ill were excluded from the study. Sample Size and Sampling ProcedureThe sample size was determined by using single proportion formula with the assumption of proportion of awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 was 50% due to lack of related studies in Ethiopia, margin of error (d) 5%, and considering no response rate of 5%. The final sample size was 403. Systematic random sampling was applied to pick the study participants from antenatal clinic. Based on the hospital report on average 850 pregnant mothers attend the ANC clinic in each month. We computed the Kth interval, which was 2.1~2. Of the first two pregnant mothers, one mother was randomly selected by using lottery method. Subsequently, we selected and interviewed the study participants at every second interval until the required respondents were obtained.The information was gathered through face-to-face interview techniques using a structured and pretested questionnaire, by implementing all the necessary safety precautions of the outbreak. The questionnaire was first developed in English then converted to Amharic language for clarity and back to English for consistency by two separate language expert individuals who speak both English and Amharic fluently. The questionnaire was developed from WHO guidelines and literature in different parts of the world, and revised according to our setting. The questionnaire has four parts including sociodemographics, obstetrics, knowledge related, and attitude related characteristics. Pretest of the questionnaire was performed on 10% of the total respondents (42 pregnant women) in Gaffat health center near to the study setting and necessary adjustments and corrections like; wording, logical sequence and skip patterns were made immediately. The data were gathered by five diploma midwives who had previous experience of data collection and supervised by two trained BSc health professionals. Data collectors and supervisors were trained for one day on the objective of the study, data collection process, confidentiality and informed consent prior data collection. The completeness and consistency of data was cross-checked, cleaned and compiled on a daily basis by supervisors and principal investigator.Knowledge of COVID-19The knowledge level of the study participants was determined using 15 knowledge assessing questions. A value of 1 and 0 were given for each correct and incorrect answer, respectively and labeled as good and poor knowledge based on mean score. Those participants who scored greater than or equal-to the mean score were considered as having a good knowledge whereas those who score less than the mean score labeled as poor knowledge.Attitude of participant was also determined based on 6 attitude assessing questions and labeled as good and poor attitude based on mean score. Pregnant women who scored greater than or equal-to the mean score of attitude questions of COVID-19 were considered as having positive attitude; while those who scored less than the mean score were considered as having negative attitude.The collected data were encoded and entered in to Epi-Data version 4.2 then transferred to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Descriptive statistics including tables and percentages were used to explain the data.Binary and a multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Variables that showed association in binary logistic regression analysis and which had P-value less than 0.20 were entered into multivariable logistic regression analysis model by controlling the potential confounding factors. At the end significant association was announced depending on p<0.05 and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Review Committee of Debre Tabor University. Beside this, a support letter was issued from Debre Tabor Hospital. Written informed consent was gained from each study participant after explaining of the purpose of the study. To keep their privacy and assure confidentiality of the respondents, any personal identifiers were omitted and all information were anonymous. This paper was in compliance with the principles enunciated in the declaration of Helsinki.A total of 403 pregnant mothers were enrolled with response rate of 99%. Of those respondents more than half of them 227 (56.9%) were in to the age group of 25-34 years, the study population age ranged from 20-38 years with the mean age of 27 Orthodox Christians, respectively. About 392 (98.2%) of the women were married and 173 (43.4%) of women were housewives. About 196 (49.2%) and 213 (54.3%) of respondents' husbands had completed college and above education (Table 1) .Among the total respondents, two hundred fifty (62.7%) and one hundred sixty-one (40.4%) were multigravida and multipara respectively. Concerning to the number of children two hundred seventy-nine (69.9%) mothers has less than or equals to 3 alive children. Three hundred twenty-five (81.4%) of the current pregnancy were wanted and planned ( Table 2) .Almost all of the respondents 399 (100%) mentioned that they had ever heard about COVID-19. The primary source of information was mass media 304 (76.2%), health worker 93 (23.3%), social media 48 (12.0%) and others (like friends and colleagues) 16 (4.0%). The two most frequent manifestation reported by the pregnant mothers were fever 291 (72.9%) and dry cough 229 (57.4%). Our study showed that 52.1% with 95% CI of (47.1-57.1) of respondents had a good knowledge about COVID-19 ( Table 3) .Most of the respondents had a positive attitude toward various elements of attitude measuring questions. According to this study, 210 (52.6%) with 95% CI of (47.6-57.4) of participants had positive attitude towards COVID-19 (Table 4 ). Predictors of Participants' Knowledge About COVID-19In binary logistic regression age, educational status, occupation, husband educational status, husband occupational status and condition of current pregnancy, had a significant association with knowledge of COVID-19. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age, educational status, occupation and condition of current pregnancy were statistically significant with the women's knowledge about COVID-19.Respondents whose age ranged from 15-24 years were 4.58 times more likely to have a good level of knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR: 4.58; 95% CI: 1.72-12.20) than respondents whose age was higher than or equal-to 35 years. Compared to those who did not attend formal education, pregnant women who attended college and above were nearly eight times more likely to have a good level of knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR: 7.78; 95% CI: 2.31--15.65). Respondents who were civil servants by occupation were two times more likely to have good level of knowledge about the corona virus pandemic (AOR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.23-4.15) than house wives. In addition, pregnant women whose pregnancy was wanted were 4.55 25 ) as compared to those whose pregnancies were unwanted ( Table 5 ).The finding of binary logistic regression analysis indicated that the important predictors of pregnant women attitude towards corona virus disease were, age, educational status, occupational status, husband educational status, husband occupational status, existing pregnancy status and knowledge of COVID-19. But the result of multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, husband educational status, status of existing pregnancy and knowledge of COVID-19 were statistically significant with pregnant women's attitude towards COVID-19 infection. Respondents whose age was ranged from 25-34 years were 2.61 times higher the odds of positive attitude towards corona virus disease (AOR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.23-5.55) than respondents whose age lies higher than or equals to 35 years.Participants whose husband has completed secondary education were nearly three times more likely to have positive attitude (AOR:2.75; 95% CI: 1.13-6.70) than those whose husband had not attended formal education. Similarly, pregnant women whose husband had attended college and above were nearly four times more likely to have positive attitude towards COVID-19 (AOR:3.77; 95% CI: 1.1.62-8.76) as compared to those whose husband had not attended formal education.Moreover, pregnant women whose pregnancy was wanted were nearly three times higher the odds of positive attitude towards COVID-19 (AOR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.22-5.97) as compared to their counter parts. In addition, study participants who had good knowledge about COVID-19 were 1.65 times more likely to have positive attitude towards COVID-19 (AOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.06-2.572) as compared to participants who had poor knowledge (Table 6 ).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Ethiopia investigating the knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 among pregnant women. This study offers information on the level of knowledge and attitude towards coronavirus infection among pregnant mothers in Debre Tabor General Hospital at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.Our study finding showed that almost all of the respondents had heard about corona virus pandemic. The result is in line with study conducted in Bangladesh. 21 Mass media was the commonest source of information at 76.2%. Similarly, research performed in Kenya found that mass media was the key source of information about the outbreak. 22 Fever and dry cough were the two most known manifestations of corona virus mentioned by the respondents. However, difficulty of breathing was not precisely mentioned as a main sign and symptom even if it indicates life threatening condition that needs hospitalization. 23 This finding is consistent with the study performed at Egypt. 24 According to our finding, almost half of the pregnant women (52.1%) had a good level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding is higher than a study conducted in Egypt (16.39%). 24 The possible explanation for the observed difference might be due to variation in study setting since the current study was completely conducted in urban setting where there is easy accessibility of mass media and social media exposure while, in Egypt 20.8% of the respondents were from rural setting. On the contrary, previous studies from Iran (90%), 25 Pakistan (93.2%), 26 China (90%), 27 and Tanzania (84.4%) 28 reported higher than our finding. The difference may be associated with variations in socio-demographic characteristics, study setting and study participants. The other possible reason might be disparities in the presence of trained human resources and health care system of the countries to create awareness regarding to the pandemic. The current study also attempted to determine respondents' attitude towards COVID-19 and overall, 52.6% of the women has positive attitude towards COVID-19. This result is lower than a study conducted in Iran (90%). 25 The probable reason might be because of variations in educational status of participants, since only 49.2% were attended college and above in this study; while in the comparable study 81.1% of respondents had attended college and above. The present finding is also lower than studies from India (97.33%), 29 Bangladesh (62.3%), 30 and Malaysia (83.1%). 31 The most probable reason might be that there are discrepancies in socio-demographic characteristics, study setting and study participants. Infrastructure limitations like human power, media, and materials may also the other possible factors which indirectly affect the attitude.This study noted that pregnant women who were in the 15-24 years of age group has improved knowledge regarding to corona virus compared to older ones above 35 years old. The finding is comparable with studies conducted in Malaysia, 31 and Egypt. 24 This might be due to quick access of data regarding to the outbreak through massmedia and social medias since they are deeply exposed to and intensively use these medias.As mentioned elsewhere, mothers who attended college and above has good level of knowledge level about the pandemic than women who did not attend formal education. 24, 25, 27 This outcome is also evident in the current study. Those respondents with college and above educational status were more knowledgeable than those with no formal education. This might be due to the fact that educated women are better subjected to various sources of information regarding to the diseases like Internet, Facebook and telegram. Additionally, educated individuals have also the ability to understand the information easily that they receive.In addition, our study showed that being governmental employed increased the odds of having good a level of knowledge compared to house wives. According to our study finding occupation status was another predictor variable for knowledge as it stated that being a civil servant had good knowledge index. This is in agreement with a study from China. 27 This might be explained by those government-employed respondents having higher educational achievement that positively affect their knowledge. In addition, employed women had easy access of information, strategies and interventions regarding to COVID-19 pandemic that are formulated by the government.Besides this, the current finding also revealed that the status of current pregnancy was another significant factor for knowledge. Women whose pregnancy was wanted and planned were more likely knowledgeable than their counterparts. As far as our knowledge, this is a new finding that mentions status of current pregnancy as a predictor factor for knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic. The likely probable explanation might be women with wanted and planed pregnancy may have higher health care-seeking behavior, as early as possible including ANC follow-up which permits to get information and counseling regarding the outbreak, its main manifestation and possible prevention strategies by health care workers. At the same time unwanted and unplanned pregnancy may have psychological disturbance which may negatively influenced the entire wellbeing of the women.Regarding to the attitude of pregnant women towards corona virus infection, those between age of 25-34 years has positive attitude towards the infection. Study from Iran was also comparable with our study finding. 25 The underlying reason may be as the age increase the understanding and attitude of women becomes optimistic. In addition, this segment of women (25-34 years) may have steady life, higher educational attainment and regular job which positively affect their attitude.Pregnant women whose husband completed secondary education and learned college and above has positive attitude regarding to the outbreak. This might be due to the fact that most women were affected by their husbands and as the educational level of the husband increase, they can get information simply and share more important topics clearly with their wife as they are nearer and more intimate to one another. As well, an educated husband may have better understanding regarding to complications and consequences associated with the outbreak thereby positively affecting his wife.Similarly, this study also found that a significant relationship was observed between current condition of pregnancy and attitude of women towards COVID-19. Those respondents whose pregnancy was wanted has positive attitude towards the pandemic. The possible explanation might be due to the fact that unwanted and unplanned pregnancy has various impacts on women including psychological problems which negatively affects healthseeking behaviors.Finally, our study noted that level of knowledge had a strong relationship with attitude regarding to the current corona virus pandemic. Those participants who were International Journal of Women's Health 2021:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress knowledgeable about the outbreak of corona virus had positive attitude concerning to it. Findings from Pakistan are also comparable with our result. 26 The possible explanation may be that good and detailed knowledge of corona virus infection may scale-up women's insight and awareness which might lead to positive attitude towards COVID-19.As a limitation due to lack of specific study findings on the respondents' (pregnant women) we try to discuss with other related findings. This may limit generalizability of the result.The findings of the current study revealed that knowledge and attitude of women towards corona virus disease were 52.1% and 52.6%, respectively. Woman's age, educational status, occupational status and status of current pregnancy were statistically significant with knowledge of COVID-19. In addition, age, husband educational status, condition of current pregnancy and knowledge were also the predictor variables for attitude towards the corona virus pandemic.The authors recommend government, health workers and other stakeholders must give emphasis on regular health education program, advising and counseling a pregnant woman and the whole population regarding the spread, transmission and possible preventive strategies to battle the consequence of the outbreak. For researchers' multidisciplinary team study approach, program assessments, and clinical study should be conducted to investigate and examine the consequence of the current corona virus pandemic on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.","Ethiopia","first author","2021-01-08",1

The virus was started in Wuhan, China but then it spread to all over the world. On January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency. Later, it declared it as a global pandemic (1) .The COVID-19 virus infects all ages. However, older aged people and patients with underlying medical conditions (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised status, cancer, pregnancy, smoking and obesity) are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Severe COVID-19 disease causes hospitalization, admission to the ICU, intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death (2) .Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) is through regular hand washing and covering mouth and nose during sneezing or coughing. Avoidance of closed spaces and crowded places is also crucial for prevention of viral spread (3) .From our daily life in Alexandria, Egypt, there are also many undertaken promotions to prevent COVID-19 such as taking vitamins (vitamin C, zinc, …), conduct periodic examination, use taxi or uber instead of public transportation, increase the school expenses due to COVID-19 and many others. Thus, the main objective of the current study is to calculate the average extra costs of each item involved in households spending and to build a model to predict the total average extra costs spending by households due to COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2020 to November 2020 at High Institute of Public Health (HIPH), University Alexandria.Exponential snowball sampling technique was done to recruit HIPH students, their friends and family.A pre-design structure questionnaire was created to measure the impact of COVID-19 situation on the economics of Egyptian households. Content validity was assessed by three professors at HIPH, they agreed about the main items that must be asked to measure the average extra costs due to COVID-19 pandemic which are masks, face shield, treatment of covid-19, hand wash, chlorine, hand sanitizer, vitamins, periodic examination, transportation, delivery service, grocery spending, school expenses, and university expenses.The questionnaire was completed by a total of 280 respondents, about 17 (6.1%) individuals submitted more than one application so the duplicates were excluded from the study, and the remaining were 263 respondents. The data was collected online using google form.After collection data, it is coded and fed to SPSS (statistical package for the social sciences (IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 25.0).The costs were trimmed to remove the extreme low and extreme high values, so only values between 10% percentile and 90% percentile were entered in calculation.• Average cost of masks per month if they bought.

No reuse allowed without permission.Descriptive statistics were calculated using min, max, mean, and standard deviation (SD) for the numeric data and frequency, and percent for categorical data.Mann-Whitney test was conducted to test the significant difference between household leaving days before and after COVID-19 pandemic.Regression tree modelling technique using CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm (4) was implemented to build a prediction model in terms of if-else rules to predict the total average extra costs spend per month during COVID-19 period based on its items. The regression tree has root nodes and leaf nodes. The root nodes represent a single input value (x) and a split All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Concerning to characteristics of respondents, more than half ages between 30 and 40 (56.3%), females (81%), married (62.4%) and from Alexandria (71.5%) ( Table 1 ).

No reuse allowed without permission.During COVID-19 period, a change in household spending has occurred to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19 for example: buying extra products such as masks, hand sanitizer, vitamins or changing the routine of life such as using taxi instead of public transportation or buying more food due to the long period of staying at home. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the average extra costs of each items to predict the total average extra costs in household spending.The present study reveals that, 11% of families had one person lost his job compared a survey conducted by Adams-Prassl in late March 2020 shows that 8% of workers having lost their job (7) and another study found that 3% of employee having lost their job (8) . Regarding income, 62% of households reported reduction in total income (9) compared to 35.4% in the current study this difference may be due to that our respondents have high level of education (most of them are working in medical field) and those with lower levels of education are more likely to lose their jobs (9) .Regarding to the change of household spending, 49.8% of households had increase in spending (mean = 1215.6, SD = 560.8) while 14.8% had decrease in spending (mean = 1702.7, SD = 989.24). The reason for this decrease can clarify as that many activities had been stopped or delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic.From Income, Expenditure and Consumption survey, the average annual expenditure of the family on food and drink in Egypt is 37.1%, 33.9% in urban, and 40.2% in rural of the total annual expenditure, which is the largest percentage of the family's expenditure (10) . The present All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Concerning regression tree, the minimum average extra cost in household spending was 217 L.E while the maximum average extra cost was 1386 L.E, this result can be validated by comparing it with the change in household spending (min = 200 L.E, max= 2000 L.E).Due to COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face data collection was difficult to do, therefore snowball sampling technique was implemented to recruit individuals; highly educated only. Thus, this result can be generalized only among highly educated people.A phone survey is needed to be conducted to recruit all different groups in the community.The effect of COVID-19 pandemic in households spending varies largely between households, it depends on what they do to prevent COVID-19.The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethical Committee of High Institute of Public Health in Egypt. Anonymity and confidentiality of the participants' data was ensured and maintained.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.","Egypt","first author","2021-01-20",1

COVID-19 had infected at least 4,801,202 people by May 20,2020 with the total number of deaths standing at 318,935 and that of recoveries at 964,161 and had affected over 213 countries worldwide according world health organization [19] . In Africa, the virus has spread to dozens of countries within weeks. In Kenya the number of people tested of the virus by May 20, 2020 were 49,405 with 1029 cases, 366 recoveries and 50 deaths [19] . In February 2020, WHO decleared the disease COVID-19, a global pandemic [20] . The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 greatly exceed those due to the other two corona viruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV), and the outbreak is still ongoing, which poses a huge threat to the global public health and economices [10, 15] Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that are zoonotic in nature [1, 13, 23] . The virus spreads mainly from person-to-person and is transmitted between people who are in close contact with one another (within a distance of one meter of each other). When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs [21] . The most contagious people are those who have developed the symptoms (symptomatic). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads [22] .COVID-19 can also be transmitted through touching contaminated surfaces or objects. A person can be infected by touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads [22] . The speed at which a virus spreads from person-to-person varies. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been spreading very fast in the community (community spread) where it is not sustained.According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, headache, chest pain and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea [18] . About 80% of people who get COVID-19 experience a mild case -about as serious as a regular cold -and recover without needing any special treatment [24] . Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19 [8] .Results in [16] revealed that interventions such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The Kenyan government has adopted extreme measures to mitigate COVID-19 outbreak. On March 15, 2020, the government closed all the schools, banned public gatherings, and closed all inbound and outbound air transportation. The public panic in face of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak reminds us the history of the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom [11] .In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and help identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth, help estimate risk to other counties, and guide the design of alternative interventions. A simple mathematical model was used to trace the temporal course of the South Korea Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak [6] . Further, a mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics was used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions [3, 9] . Other authors used clinical mathematical modeling technique for explaining the disease outbreak [14] . In [16] , the likelihood-based estimates and the model-based estimates are applied to a deterministic model to estimate the control reproduction number of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In this study, we extended the works of [11, 12] . We note that the governmental action in Kenya, summarizes all measures including school closure, wearing of masks, social distancing, city lockdown, mass testing, hospitalization and quarantine of patients. The parameter values may be improved when more information is available. Nevertheless, our model is a preliminary conceptual model, intending to lay a foundation for further modelling studies, but we can easily tune our model so that the outcomes of our model are in line with previous studies [2-4, 7, 12] .The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the formulated model. In Section 3, we carry-out model analysis including equilibrium analysis. The model is fitted to COVID-19 data in Section 4. The effects of social distancing and mass testing are also investigated in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide dicussions and recommendations.To describe the dynamics of COVID-19 in Kenya, we develop a seven disease state compartmental SEIHCRD-model describing the movement of individuals from one state to another starting from the susceptible class S, that is, individuals with no history of infection by the disease. Individuals get infected with the virus and move into compartment E, referred to as exposed, who are asymptomatic. Then the exposed can develop symptoms and move to compartment I, referred as infected individuals. The Infected individuals will take themselves to be hospitalized or quarantine themselves at home. Those who get hospitalized move to class H. The hospitalized can get worse and move to ICU class denoted as C or recover and move to compartment R. The last class is the Death,represented by compartment D containing those who succumb to COVID-19. Figure 1 shows the structure of modelSusceptible (S) Exposed (E) Infectious (I) Recovered (R) Hospitalized (H) Death (D) ICU (C) ρΛ λ(t)S(t) (1 − ζ)γE(t) ζγE(t) κE(t) αI(t) σC(t) µ c C(t) µ h H(t) ωH(t) δH(t) κE(t) µ I I(t) (1 − ρ)ΛThe total population at any time t, is denoted by N (t) and is given by3The rate of generation of new COVID-19 cases is modelled by λS, where λ is the force of infection given by(2)The variables and parameters description for the model are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 : proportion of susceptible entering the country from other countries κ rate of recovery after being exposed β 0Effective contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals .Effective contact rate between susceptible and hospitalized individuals β 2Effective contact rate between susceptible and those in ICU γ transition rate from exposed to infectious α hospitalization rate ω recovery rate after treatment δ transfer rate to ICU σ recovery rate from ICU η effects of social distancing ζ effects of mass testing µ death rate due to COVID-19.Given the flow diagram in Figure 1 , the parameter description in Table 2 , we have the following system of non-linear ordinary differential equations:subject to the following initial conditions Proof. Considering the first equation in system (3), we haveUpon integrating,Applying the above procedure to the rest of the equations in model system (3), we obtain: 5 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fClearly, all the state variables, S, E, I, H, C, R, D of model system (3) are non-negative for all time t > 0.Restating equation (1), we haveSubstituting the derivatives in system (3) and simplifying, we obtainUpon integration we getClearly, there exists a bounded positive invariant region for model system (3), that is N (t) ≤ Λ µ .We shall study the dynamical nature of the COVID-19 model system (3) in the feasible closed region:Therefore, any solution of our system (3) that commences in Ω, at any time t ≥ 0 will always remain confined in that region. The region Ω is therefore positively invariant and attracting with respect to COVID-19 model system (3) . The deterministic model in (3) is hence mathematically and biologically well-posed.The basic reproduction number R 0 , is defined as the number of secondary infections produced by one infective that is introduced into an entirely susceptible population at the disease free equilibrium [5] . The next generation matrix approach is frequently used to compute R 0 , see [17] . System (3) has a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) given by E 0 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) .The matrix F V −1 is called the next generation matrix. The (i, k) entry of F V −1 indicates the expected number of new infections in compartment i produced by the infected individual originally introduced into compartment k.The (i, k) entry of F V −1 indicates the expected number of new infections in compartment i produced by the infected individuals originally introduced into compartment k. The disease reproduction number, R 0 ,which is defined as the spectral radius of F V −1 , and denoted by ρ(F V −1 ) is evaluated to:Hence,Here R 0 is the sum of three terms each representing the average new infections contributed by each of the three infectious classes. R I represents the new cases generated by infected individuals in compartment I, R H represents new cases generated by patients hospitalized, and R C represents new cases from patients hospitalized and in ICU. From R 0 in equation (5), each term is multiplied by (1 − η) which represents the Government control measures, hence if the measures are followed, then the emergency of new corona cases is reduced. Therefore the government campaign of ""social distancing""and ""hygiene""is very important in preventing the development of new cases. From Theorem 2 in [17] , we have the following result:Theorem 2. The DFE, E 0 of the system of equations (3) is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1 and unstable otherwise.Question: What is likely disease burden (total infections, total hospital admissions, total ICU admissions, total deaths) if epidemic is not contained by a country?• SEIHCRD model (incorporating social distancing, hygiene, quarantine and current curfew) willgive insights on how soon Kenya is likely to reach 1,000 or 10,000 cases under current control measures.• The model will give, at any time, the estimated number of new infections, the total infections, the total population hospitalized, the patients in ICU and the number recovered together with mortality estimates.• The model to predict expected cases of COVID-19 in future (say two weeks time)In this section, we present a series of numerical results of system (3) using COVID-19 reported cases data in Kenya to predict and estimate the incidence of the virus in the country. Using least squares curve fitting method, the model system (3) was fitted to the COVID-19 reported cumulative cases in Figure ( 2) to estimate the model parameter. The parameter values which are calculated from the given data in Figure ( 2) are displayed in Table 3 and the initial conditions for the populations are as given in Table 4 Using parameter values in Table 3 , we identified how different input parameters affect the reproduction number R 0 of our model as shown in Figure 3 . With the current intervention measures put in place in Kenya, our model shows the reproduction number has reduced to R 0 = 1.68.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Figure 3 : Tornado plots of sensitivity indices of parameters that influence disease R 0 generated using parameter values in Table 3 From Figure 3 , it is evident that an increase in individual initiated behaviour and recovery rate are most likely to reduce the number of new cases and severity of COVID-19 infections. A lot more emphasis on individual change of behavior is therefore necessary. Such actions include compulsory face masks, regularly and proper washing of hands with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers. To improve the rates of recovery, good care for COVID-19 patients is warranted. Infected individuals should be taken to isolation centres for proper treatment and care.Results of parameter sensitivity, further indicate the need to reduce contacts between the susceptibles and the infected COVID-19 persons. This is achievable through compulsory social distancing and imposed night curfews in the country.Using the parameter values and initial values as given in Tables 3 and 4 respectively, and applying them on system (3), we have the fitted and projected curves as displayed in Figure 4 . We observe that model system (3) fits well the COVID-19 data from Kenya (see Figure 4a ). Figure 4b shows the projected COVID-19 cases in Kenya with current intervention measures. Moreover, with relaxed intervention measures, Kenya is likely to experience exponential growth in the number of COVID-19 cases (see Figure 4b ). The Kenyan government should therefore strictly deploy and implement existing control measures against COVID-19 in every county. Figure 7 , it is shown that with aggressive mass testing, the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients who are not yet in hospital will be identified and either hospitalized or quarantined as shown by the green line in Figure 7a hence preventing further transmission. This implies that correct information based on an adequate diagnosis system would be desired for the Kenyan government to act appropriately. Figure 7b shows the impact of aggressive mass testing on patient recoveries, if the government embarks of aggressive and effective contact tracing, then infected individuals will be identified and given proper care hence increasing the number of recoveries as depicted by the green line in Figure 7b . A combination of adherence to existing government control measures and improved medical environment is likely to yield most recoveries from COVID-19 infections as shown in Figure 7b In this study, we applied the SEIRHCRD compartmental model to the daily reported cases of COVID-19 to determine the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Kenyan population over time. The model simulation shows that ignoring safety guidelines such as social distancing, wearing of masks, frequent washing of hands with water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and cutting down on travel has devastating effect on the disease dynamics. The model results also give insights to health policymakers and Government on the effective approaches and implementable actions that can enhance the prevention, preparedness and readiness for future emergencies of COVID-19 and similar diseases.The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and individual Kenyans, the rate of COVID-19 infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery. Given the non availability of the vaccine in Kenya at the moment, individual initiated behavior change is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size. The most effective non-pharmaceutical interventions are the combination of keeping social distancing, mass-testing and hospital patient care.Our study suggests that aggressive and effective mass testing is required to identify and isolate the asymptomatic patients in the community. Moreover, our analysis reveals that , individual initiated behavior change and improved hospital care will see Kenya free of COVID-19 new cases, deaths and improved recoveries from the disease.","Kenya","abstract","2021-01-27",1

The diseases vary from mild, self-limiting forms to more severe manifestations depending on the type of viruses involved [2] . Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronaviridae, which consists of four genera: Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus members infect mammals, while Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus only infect birds and some mammals [3] . Among the coronaviruses that infect humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle East respiratory syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are highly pathogenic [4] .The current human coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged as a public health problem from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, on 31 December 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases. On 7 January 2020, the a etiological agent of the pneumonia was officially announced as a novel coronavirus [5] [6] [7] . On 11 th January 2020, the first fatal case was reported. On the next day (12 January 2020), the whole genome sequence of the virus was shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the public. Confirmed cases outside Wuhan were reported from Thailand (13 January 2020), Japan (16 January 2020), Korea and in another province of China (19 January 2020), all from persons who had travelled to Wuhan [8] . On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreaks a public health emergency of international concern [9] . The WHO announced that COVID-19 should be characterized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [9] .As of September 29, 2020, approximately 33,556,252 million cases, 1,006,450 deaths and 24,881,239 recovered cases have been reported globally [10] . Europe and America have been highly affected by the virus, as shown by overwhelmed health systems and high death tolls [11] . Although the virus arrived late in Africa, the number is increasing and it has been predicted that more than 1.2 billion people are at high risk [12] . In the context of Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported on 13 March 2020. Based on WHO recommendations, Ethiopia implemented thermal screening at various institutions, social distancing, providing hand washing facilities, stay-at-home orders, quarantining people assumed to be exposed and encouraging the community to use homemade masks when needed, including in areas where there are more people and traffic flow such transportation services and other service providers. As of 29 September 2020, there had been 73, 944 confirmed cases, 1,177 deaths and 30, 753 recovered cases in Ethiopia [13] .According to the WHO global strategy to respond to COVID-19, the overarching goal of all countries is to control the pandemic by slowing down the transmission to reduce the immediate burden on health systems and to reduce the mortality [14] . According to this strategy, everyone has a crucial role to play to stop COVID-19. Individuals must protect themselves and others by adopting behaviors like regular adequate hand washing or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers, avoid touching their faces, practice covering their mouths and noses anytime or while coughing and sneezing, maintain physical distancing, isolate themselves if they are sick, identify themselves as a contact of confirmed cases when appropriate and, most importantly, strictly follow measures announced by their government or health authorities [14] . The implementation of all the above depends on the background knowledge, skills and attitude of the public to COVID-19.The knowledge, attitudes and, practices (KAP) that people hold towards the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioral change measures from health authorities [15] . The KAP of people towards COVID-19 is critical to understand the epidemiological dynamics of the disease and the effectiveness, compliance and success of infection prevention control measures adopted in a country. Moreover, research has demonstrated that effective control and mitigation of COVID-19 in any country requires operational research and timely epidemiological data generated among different groups of the population. Such evidence-based data will inform health authorities so that they can design robust interventions and policies that are relevant and comprehendible to the community and beyond [16] .In a previous study, a plethora of evidence demonstrated that there is a disparity in the KAP level of the public about viral infection, including COVID-19 [15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The difference in the public KAP towards COVID-19 could be explained by geographical difference, methodological variability, health care system infrastructure, socio-economic status of the participants, the burden of the pandemic and residence of the participants, among many other factors.The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated measures of confinement will have devastating consequences for micro and small business operations and will disrupt many existing value chains. This, in turn, will lead to loss of income and sharp increases in unemployment. The COVID 19 pandemic has and will continue to have a strong effect on labour markets worldwide, especially in developing economies, where more than 70% of the workforce is selfemployed or works in micro and small enterprises [27, 28] . These effects will undeniably have many significant effects on a wide range of the population.Engaging service providers and/or small and medium enterprises and exploring their preparedness to fight the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. So far, government, health authorities, health institutions and the media have strived to help public and service providers be aware of the disease and apply preventive measures. Despite the public health measures, there is a huge research gap with regard to the public KAP and service providers' preparedness towards Therefore, the present study aimed to assess: (1) the public KAP and (2) the preparedness and response of service providers towards COVID-19 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional, community-based survey was conducted in selected sites in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, among adults to assess their KAP and the preparedness of the service providers regarding COVID-19. The study was conducted during the last week of March through first week of April 2020. To achieve the intended study objectives, a self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the public KAP and a brief checklist was utilized to evaluate service providers' preparedness and response towards COVID-19 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Addis Ababa is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. The study was carried out in 10 high traffic sites located in the respective sub-cities.The study population was adults who were by chance walking in the 10 sites. Service providers in the selected sites were considered for assessing their practical readiness against COVID-19. Being adult (> 18 years of age) and consent to participate in the study taken were the inclusion criteria.A single population proportion formula was used by considering 50% prevalence of public awareness of COVID-19, with a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level, with a design effect of 2.0, and adding 10% for non-response. A total of839(84/ per site) participants from major city sites were recruited. Again, given that there was no study among service providers related to a possible outbreak, we considered a 50% proportion of preparedness for COVID-19, with a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level, and adding 10% for non-response. Therefore, 420 service providers recruited from the 10 sites. A convenient sampling technique was employed and verbal consent obtained from all participants.The intended study was conducted during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia at Piazza, Arat Kilo, Mexico, Bole Medhanealem, Bole Michael, Teklehaimanot, Megenagna, Jemo, Ayer Tena and Kera. The selection of specific streets from the high traffic enumeration site was done by spinning a bottle. The participants were approached and informed of the study objectives. Consecutive service providers on the same streets were included; their preparedness was assessed using a brief checklist along with a direct observational assessment.Data collection was done using a self-administered structured questionnaire and a brief checklist. The questionnaire consisted of 40 close-ended questions that aimed to collect the following information from the respondents: socio-demographic characteristics, travel history, risk factors and KAP related to COVID-19. The survey instrument took approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.The data collection tool was initially prepared in English (S1 Appendix) version followed by translation to local Amharic language (S2 Appendix). Consistency of content, clarity and appropriate meaning between the two version was maintained through back translation of the questionnaire to the original version. Additionally, the practicability, validity and interpretability of answers for the respective questions was confirmed by performing pre-test in 10% of the targeted sample size. Based on this pre-test study, the format and wording of questions were corrected and refined.A brief checklist and observational assessment were used to evaluate the preparedness and response of service providers (e.g. hotels, cafeterias and transportation enterprises). The brief checklist explored the availability of soap with water, alcohol and/or sanitizer for the any person entering. To facilitate the data collection, 10 data collection facilitators were enrolled to distribute and collect the completed questionnaire from the consented participants. Formal training on a brief introduction of the research objectives, data collection procedure and questionnaire content was delivered.The knowledge section of the questionnaire comprised40 questions. All the questions were developed by considering previous research done in same population with a similar research theme [29]. These questions were in the form of yes or no; if the answer was yes, the participants were asked to specify. The right answer to each question has a score of 1 and wrong answer 0. Modified Bloom's cut-off points were used to judge knowledge as good (80%-100%),�32), moderate (50%-79%, 20-31), or poor (� 50%,�19) [30].Eight questions were asked to evaluate the attitude of the general public towards the disease. A scoring system to attitude was used as follows: good (�6), moderate (5) and poor (�4).There were four questions on practice towards COVID 19 (one point for each questions with correct answer). The cut-offs were similar to the knowledge and attitude scoring: good (4), moderate (3) and poor (�2).Before the analysis, completeness of the data was evaluated. Data entry and coding and were done using EpiData version 3.1. The data were analyzed with SPSS statistical software version 22. A descriptive analysis was performed. Specific knowledge, attitude and practice questions were used to establish scoring to assess the overall status of the participants. For each question, 1 point was given for answering correctly, whereas 0 points were assigned when the responders fail to respond correctly. Based on the total score relative to the maximum score, the public KAP level was categorized as good, moderate or poor, considering modified Bloom's cut-off points. Inferential statistics between the socio-demographic factors and the public KAP regarding COVID-19 were investigated using a chi-square test. A statistically significant association was declared at < 0.05.The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the College of Health Sciences Addis Ababa University (Protocol number: 012/DMIP/2020) and verbal consent was obtained from each participant.The study included 839 participants. The participants mean age was 30.3(standard deviation [SD] = 9.25, range = 18-72) years. The majority of the respondents were males (58.0%) and single (56.6%). With regard to occupational status, government employee and non-government employee occupied one third each (36.7% and 34.7%) followed by traders (8.3%), day workers (6.4%) and others (12.3%).Only 7% of respondents had travel history in the last three months at the time of data collection. Of these, 17%, 11.8% and 10.0% had travelled to China, Europe and the Middle East, respectively, among COVID-19-affected areas at the time of data collection. With respect to contact history, 9.2% of the participants had had contact with individuals who had travelled to COVID affected areas (Table 1) .Knowledge assessment. Knowledge was assessed using a total of 40 questions that focused on nature of the disease, prevention mechanisms, transmission mode, risk groups and signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (Table 2 ). The majority of respondents (58.6%) had moderate knowledge while37.2% had good knowledge (Table 3) . Among the socio-demographic characteristics, only the age and occupation of the participants was associated with knowledge (Table 4) .Attitude towards COVID-19 and association with demographic characteristics. A total of eight questions were used to assess the attitude of the participants to implement preventive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in Table 3 , the mean attitude score was 5.73, most of the public had positive attitude (60.7%) towards implementation of preventive measures against COVID-19. Among the respondents, 83.1% and 74.9% indicated they prefer frequent hand washing with soap and water and use alcohol-based sanitizer, respectively. Moreover, the majority (90.3%) had good attitude towards social distancing and its necessity to prevent COVID-19. With regard to lockdown, more than half of the participants agreed that it had to be in place to mitigate the pandemic in Ethiopia. Similar to knowledge, only occupational status was associated with a positive attitude (Table 4) . Practice towards COVID-19. In the study, there were four questions related to practice towards COVID-19, with a maximum total of four points. The mean practice score was 2.49 ± 0.7(range 0-4). The majority (59.8%) of the study participants had a good practice towards COVID-19. On the date of the data collection, the study participants' experience of hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds and utilization of sanitizer was 96.4% and 82.2%, respectively. Similarly, 88.0% of the participants had not practiced hand shaking. Good practice was only associated with marital status (Table 4) .Correlations among knowledge, attitude and practice. To visualize the correlation of participants knowledge, attitude and practice with one another, we performed a scatter plot analysis. There was a moderate positive correlation between participant's knowledge and attitude (r = 0.624), whereas the correlations between knowledge and practice (r = 0.196) and attitude and practice (r = 0.172) were weak ( Table 5) .For the majority of the respondents (84.4%), government-owned television was the primary source of information about COVID-19, followed by government-owned radio (49.7%), social media (46.0%) and private television (43.0%). Besides, the government health and social media were the information sources that the respondents highly believed. With regard to the adequacy of information, more than half (59.6%) of the respondents believed that the broadcasted information was adequate to act against COVID-19.The checklist used to assess the service providers contained questions on type of enterprise, method of preventive mechanism in place and the type of washing facility present (Table 6) .Most (70%) of the enterprises provided hand washing facilities as a preventive mechanism towards COVID-19, followed by social distancing and sanitizer or alcohol use with 8.6% and 7.9%, respectively (Table 7) .Of the enterprises, 264 (62.9%) had hand washing facilities with soap and water, 32(7.6%) had water only, 11 (2.6%) had soap only and 34 (8.1%) had none of the hand washing facilities (Table 8 ).This study is the first survey in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa as far as our knowledge goes, that aimed to assess the public KAP towards the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to assess the preparedness and response of service providers in the city. In the survey out of 839 respondents, almost two thirds had moderate knowledge and good attitude and practice. This level was far lower than a multinational survey in Africa (South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria), which reported that the level of awareness and concern about COVID-19 were very high (94%) [26] . A bi-national survey in Egypt and Nigeria also demonstrated that the mean knowledge score was higher, with a satisfactory knowledge of the disease [22] . A study from Nigeria also proved that the respondents had good knowledge (99.5%) of COVID-19 [16] . Since the current study in Addis Ababa was carried out during the early phase of the pandemic, the reported knowledge level is encouraging; however, periodic assessment should be in place considering the different scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopian setting.A study on Indian diabetes mellitus populations reported a high overall correct response rate on the knowledge questionnaire (83%) [31] . In another study, the majority of the participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19, with a mean COVID-19 knowledge score of 17.96 (SD = 2.24; Range = 3-22), indicating a high level of knowledge and the overall accuracy rate for the knowledge test was 81.64% (17.96/22 _ 100) [21] . A high knowledge level has also been reported in Malaysia, where the overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%and most participants held positive attitudes towards the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%) [15] . The burden of COVID-19 was by far higher in some Asian countries than some African countries including Ethiopia, such difference in the spread would bring a disparity in the overall knowledge status of the population and preparedness towards the pandemic. Though the current knowledge and preparedness status is descent in our setting, the best practice from other countries employed to improving knowledge and preparedness should be adapted for best containment of the pandemic.Knowledge assessment in this study included signs and symptoms, the disease transmission mode, the prevention mechanisms and risk groups. According to the assessment, a considerable number of the participants were aware of the disease signs and symptoms. However, a few participants incorrectly attributed signs and symptoms not shown in COVID-19 cases. This finding is similar to a study from the Philippines; those results showed that coughing and sneezing were identified as a transmission route by 89.5% of respondents [23] . In our study, knowledge of fever and cough as COVID-19 symptoms was high, and the participants knew that younger participants had a lower perceived risk and the elderly were identified as the high risk group [32]. One study from the United States among people with chronic conditions provided unexpected results: nearly one third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%) [25] .Very interestingly, during early phase of COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an aggressive promotion of covid19 information through MOH and main government mass media. This lead to better knowledge and preparedness about the pandemic. Though still the promotion is present, adherence seems to become less. We believe that preventive attitude has to be reenforced and appropriate prevention and control strategies should be promoted consistently.With respect to identifying knowledge question related to COVID-19 prevention, nearly 50% of the participants identified using face mask, frequent hand washing and staying at home as the most important means of preventing the pandemic. The finding was by far lower than a study from Philippines which showed that hand washing was the most common preventive practice in response to COVID-19, adopted by 89.9% of respondents [23] . Another report from Ethiopia demonstrated that even 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing [24] . The moderate knowledge in our survey of participants living in the capital city of Ethiopia with consistent access to information.Our study explored the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the public KAP. There was only an association between occupational status and good knowledge. In contrast with our findings, study from Tanzania and Iran showed that male sex, younger age (16 to 29 years), non-healthcare-related professions, being single and less education were significantly associated with lower knowledge scores [32, 33] .We also assessed the attitude of the participants towards practicing preventive measures, perceptions on lockdown and their stand on staying at home. Concerning attitudes, it was interesting that close to two thirds of the respondents showed a positive and optimistic attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Similarly, a study from Saudi Arabia demonstrated that the mean score for attitude indicated optimistic attitudes and the mean score for practices was high, indicating good practices [21] . Findings from Egypt and Nigeria indicated that the attitude of most respondents (68.9%) towards instituted preventive measures was positive, with an average attitude score of 6.9 ± 1.2. In addition, the majority of the respondents (96%) practiced self-isolation and social distancing [22] .Another finding among the same population from Africa documented that the majority of the respondents (79.5%) had positive attitudes towards adherence to government infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, with 92.7%, 96.4% and 82.3% practicing social distancing/self-isolation, improved personal hygiene and using face masks, respectively [16] .In agreement with participants knowledge, the state of their attitude towards applying the preventive measures has been positive. Moreover, the findings proved that those with moderate knowledge and good knowledge turned out to have positive attitude which could ultimately impact the practice of the public and response towards for any possible outbreak.The aforementioned optimistic attitude was consistent with participants' practice of washing hands with soap and water and frequent use of hand sanitizer. It is an established fact that physical distancing is the most effective but also the most challenging measure. The respondents had a positive attitude towards physical distancing and implementation of lockdown in Ethiopia. This positive attitude will ultimately help in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, periodic evaluation of this positive attitude towards preventive measures must be performed to determine whether it is sustained among the public.In support of the present findings, a study from Ethiopia among several population revealed that frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoiding shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices [34] . Unlike our study, another investigation among health professionals from Oromia regional state, Ethiopia reportedly demonstrated that the practices of the participants towards COVID-19 prevention were relatively low: only 61% and 84% of the participants were practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively [24] . Such a discrepancy might be due to the difference in the study population, study area and the pandemic phase.In our study, only knowledge and attitude showed a moderate correlation. A previous study showed stronger relationship between knowledge, attitude and practice with infection prevention measures [35] . Finding from China revealed that COVID-19 knowledge score (odds ratio [OR] 0.75-0.90, p<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019 [17] . This finding were also reported from Malaysia where most participants held positive attitudes towards the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%) [15] .During an emergency, timely, adequate and appropriate information is important as the best intervention against rumors and misinformation [5] . Following the emergence of the pandemic, a large amount of information has been released in media based on internet information about COVID-19. Based on previous assessment, only 1.9% websites that provide healthrelated information had agreed to the Net Foundation Code of Conduct by the time of assessment [36] .The study explored the source of information regarding COVID-19. The majority of the study participants (84.4%) obtained information from government-owned television broadcast, followed by government-owned radio broadcast, social media and private television broadcast. In line with our finding, study from Iran indicated that government TV advertisements and short message service (SMS) were the most common sources of COVID-19 information and considered trustworthy (by >95% of participants) [32] . This was in support of a research finding from Philippines which demonstrated that traditional media sources such as television and radio were the main sources of information about the virus [23] . By contrast, another recent study in Ethiopia reported that social media were the main source of the information [24] .It was interesting that the public source of information was government outlets at the early phase of the pandemic; however, with time the public also tended to use social media as the primary source of information [24, 26] . Another study from Nigeria found that the participants mainly gained information about COVID-19 through the internet/social media (55.7%) and television (27.5%) [16] . However, the quality of information shared on the social media requires due attention and regulation to provide the public with reliable information so as to combat the pandemic effectively and in a sustainable approach.TheCOVID-19 pandemic has been affecting enterprises of all sizes and types in unprecedented way [27, 37] . The majority of the assessed service providers in Addis Ababa in April 2020 had made available either washing facilities with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub in an accessible spot. The availability of the washing facilities might explain the moderate state of knowledge, good attitude and best practice of public KAP. This is a very encouraging response; it shows that the government strategies were acceptable to the public, stake holders and clients of the service providers.This survey had some limitations. First, the convenience sampling method did not avoid subjective selection bias. Second, selected localities may not reflect the whole picture of Addis Ababa at large because the ten sites were selected purposefully considering high traffic flow. In addition, we used a descriptive cross-sectional study design, which hinders determining a cause-effect relationship between an independent variable and the outcome variables. The comparability to other studies may be limited by use of different questionnaires. Although the study faced the above mentioned limitations, the strength of this study lies in its large sample size. To our knowledge, this is the first large scale study considering the public and service providers KAP and preparedness towards COVID-19 pandemic.In terms of policy implication, the findings will the policy makers reconsider the engagement of the community as a key approach in combating any possible outbreak, including COVID 19. In general, data from the current study showed most probably a positive public health education effect leading to desired preventive measures as recommended by the government in the city.In conclusion, the finding suggested that the public in Addis Ababa had moderate knowledge, optimistic attitudes and notable practice against the COVID-19 pandemic. Government and social media seem valuable sources of information and should further be utilized. COVID-19 knowledge correlated with an optimisticattitudetowardsCOVID-19; these finding indicate that effective awareness creation and health education have been delivered.The service providers' level of preparedness towards the pandemic was encouraging. Still, more practical support seems needed to assure full coverage with hand hygiene options in public enterprises. Periodic evaluation of service providers awareness and preparedness for any possible outbreak should be in place to assure sustainability of efforts.Supporting information S1 Appendix.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 17 million confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 680,894 deaths as at 2 nd August 2020 [2] . The pathogen was rapidly described as a new member of the genus betacoronavirus, closely related to many bat coronaviruses and the severe coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) identified in 2003 [3] . The disease and the virus causing it were named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and COVID-19 or the COVID-19 virus, respectively, by WHO [4] . Although many drugs and therapeutics, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin [5] , remdesivir [6] , and idasanutlin [7] , are currently being tested or suggested, no effective prophylactics or therapeutics have yet been identified. This underscores the urgency to find the much needed intervention for this global pandemic.Scientists are gaining insight into the biology of the virus, particularly how it binds with human respiratory cells through the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) plays a role in cardiovascular and renal disease, diabetes and lung injury [8] . Interestingly, hACE2 has also been shown to be the receptor for human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [9] . The hACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein orientated with the N-terminus and the catalytic site facing the extracellular space, where it can metabolize circulating peptides. The small C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain has a number of potential regulatory sites [10] . It was recently reported that the virus uses a tightly glycosylated spike (S) protein to pull into host lung cells via hACE2 [11] . The SARS-CoV S protein is a fusion protein with three subdomains consisting of a conserved core region, a variable or insertion loop and the C-terminal SD-1 domain. Binding of the SARS-CoV S protein to its receptor, hACE2 requires significant conformational changes in the S protein. The insertion loop of the S protein has been reported to contain the receptorbinding domain (RBD) [12] . This is similar to what has been recently reported for the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 [13] . Although the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 can function as a receptor-binding entity, nonetheless, similar receptor binding modes to hACE2 were observed for SARS-CoV-2-CTD and SARS-RBD [14] . The critical residues for receptor binding have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S protein and C-terminal SD-1 domain (CTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as in the interacting partner, hACE2 [15] , thus making them targets for the discovery and development of vaccines and drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.In light of the urgent need for such vaccines and drugs for the COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing becomes an attractive strategy to find known and approved drugs for this new indication. This approach has gained impetus in medicine, especially in the search for a treatment for complex disorders and pandemics such as COVID-19 [16] . In this study, we conducted a virtual screening (HTVS) of 1070 compounds from the drug bank against interacting surface on hACE2 receptor to which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to bind to. The results showed significant binding of a number of approved drugs, experimental and investigational compounds to the target site. From the top 1070 drugs docked against the interacting surface of the hACE2 receptor, we described two peptide drugs with good predicted binding affinity and poses that might disrupt the protein-protein interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the hACE2 receptor. A number of the drugs predicted may be potentially repurposed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.The compound library consists of 1070 compounds (these were top ranked compounds chosen from an in house experiment of initial virtual screening of over 7000 compounds from DrugBank online against spike protein of Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1)). The selected compounds were imported into Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) database viewer. The compounds were prepared by washing (protonation at pH 7, explicit hydrogen added, 3D coordinates generated), adding partial charges and energy minimized with the Amber10: EHT force field, down to a RMS gradient of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å 2 .The protein target was the hACE2 receptor extracted from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hCAE2 receptor complex. The crystal structure of receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to its receptor, hACE2 (6LZG) was downloaded from the RSCB protein data bank (PDB). We conducted a short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to explore the conformational space of the initial model from PDB followed averaging of representatives from clusters of the conformers to obtain the average structure of the complex. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was deleted from the complex and the remaining hACE2 receptor was used for the docking study. The three-dimensional structure of hACE2 receptor was cleaned, minimized, solvated, and prepared for MD with AMBER forcefield (ff99SB) on the MDWeb server [17] . The simulation was done over 50 ns with Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2019.01 suite (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2019.01). The average structure was viewed and compared to the downloaded structure using USCF Chimera [18] .The protein preparation module in Molecular Operating Environment MOE 2019.01(Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2019.01) was used to prepare the average structure hACE2 receptor for virtual screening. The binding site was defined as the interacting surface between the hACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Molecular docking simulation was carried out with the MOE Dock module using the induce-fit model [19] . The hACE2 receptor was set as 'Receptor'. The 'Triangle Matcher', which is suitable for standard and well-defined binding sites, was set as the ligand placement method. Thirty poses were generated for each ligand and the poses were scored according to the London ΔG scoring function. The thirty poses were taken through molecular mechanics (MM) refinement to get two final poses. The final docking score was evaluated with the GBVI/WSA ΔG scoring function with the Generalized Born solvation model (GBVI) [20] . UCSF Chimera [18] was used to visualize the poses.The hACE2 receptor with and without a docked ligand (the ligand used here was Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P with a binding free energy of -10.63 kcal/mol) were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations using the Simulation module in Molecular Operating Environment MOE 2019.01(Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2019.01). The hACE2 receptor and hACE2 receptor-ligand complex were at different instances protonated and energy minimized with the MMFF94x force field to get the stable conformer of the protein complexes in a vacuum (molecular system). The molecular system was parameterized with ""Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations"" (OPLS-aa) forcefield, suitable for proteins and small organic molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations were done in three steps. We first heated the molecular system to 310 K (37 0 C). Then an equilibration step was used to equilibrate the molecule system at 310 K (37 0 C) for 10 nanoseconds. Next, the simulation step was used to generate the trajectory of the molecular system at 310 K using the Nose-Poincare-Andersen (NPA) algorithm for 100 nanoseconds (time step of each simulation was set to 0.02 picoseconds). Visualizations and data analysis were performed with VMD software [21] .Protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human hACE2 receptor, play an important role in the establishment of the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 in humans. In this study, PatchDock [22] , a free and open accessed web server, was used to predict and analyze the structures of PPIs between the spike protein and hACE2 in the presence and absence of one of the top-ranking ligands (BV2) from the docking studies. FireDock (Mashiach et al., 2008) was used to refine the output from PatchDock and tease out the various interaction energies involved in the simulated PPIs. Molecular visualization of the output was done with UCSF Chimera [18] . Following the prediction of the protein-protein interaction, the SARS-CoV2-hACE2 complexes with and without BV2 were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations using MOE 2019.01 software as described above.We conducted a molecular dynamics simulation on the crystal structure downloaded from the protein data bank, i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complex, before separating hACE2 receptor from the complex for the molecular docking study. Following the molecular dynamics simulation, the results showed that the average root mean squared fluctuation (RMSF) per residue of the protein were between 0.30 Å to 1.33 Å (Fig 1) . The RMSF per residue is the distance between a residue in the first frame (structure) of the protein under simulation and the same residue in the subsequent frames (structures) of the same protein.Higher RMSF values indicate greater flexibility during the MD simulation. The highest RMSF value was observed for Glutamic acid 69 located in the loop region closes to the interacting surface of hACE2 receptor. Five other residues in hACE2 and four residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, located mostly in the loop regions, showed higher fluctuation > 0.8 Å indicative of some flexibility. However, residues, which constitute the interacting surfaces of the loop region of the spike protein and the alpha helix region of the hACE2, showed lower flexibility (RMSF between 0.3 Å and 0.6 Å). Overall RMSF values were higher for a number of residues outside the interaction surface of the complex than those within the interaction surface. The average structure of the complex generated from the molecular dynamic simulations was compared to the downloaded protein data bank (PDB) crystal structure (inserted in Fig 1) . The result showed a root mean square deviation of 0.622 Å between the two complex structures. The larger RMSF values indicate increased random motions for residues outside the interaction surface of the complex, and the converse for residues within the interaction surface of the complex. This is a pointer to the involvement of the latter set of residues in the interaction between the S protein and the hACE2 receptor. In addition, root mean square deviation of 0.622 Å was observed between the two complex structures These observations suggest potential conformational changes and moderate flexibility of the S protein and the hACE2 receptor complex. Hence the need to estimate the average structure of the hACE2 receptor before the molecular docking studies.To predict currently approved drugs that will potentially bind to the interacting surface of the hACE2 receptor, compounds from Drug Bank were docked against this binding site using the induce-fit model in MOE 2019.01. An induced-fit docking model will capture the ensembles of the protein conformations which provide relatively high enrichment of the poses of the docked compounds. The initial London free energy of binding generated for 30 poses were rescored with generalized Born volume integral (GBVI) model to get the final S score for five poses. Higher negative S score is a predictor of better ligand interaction with the protein and more stable the ligand-protein complex. The chemical structures and estimated free energy of binding (S score) of the top poses of the compounds are presented in S1 Table. The top- Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complex ranking compounds based on the predicted S score were mostly peptide-based drugs (approved, investigational and experimental drugs).Ligand interactions of six top-ranked drug hits with the hACE2 receptor were generated (Fig 2) . The number of hydrogen bond interactions of the top six ranked drug hits with residues within the interaction surface of the hACE2 receptor are shown as a heatmap in Fig 3A. The predicted interactions of peptide drug hits with these amino acid residues that are involved in the protein-protein interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its human target (hACE2 receptor) (Fig 3B) might disrupt the protein-protein interaction, thus limits the infectivity of the virus. Molecular docking of the drug library into the average structure of hACE2 receptor, which is derived from an average of the multiple conformations of the hACE2 receptor, provided us with an enrichment of docked compounds with reliable predicted binding energies/affinities. The molecular docking studies predicted drugs that can potentially bind strongly to the virus's spike protein interacting surface on the hACE2 receptor.We explored the stability of the predicted interaction between the top ranked peptide drug, Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P, and hACE2 receptor by conducting molecular dynamics of the system. The stability of the ligand-protein complex system in an aqueous solution was examined using the parameters RMSD (root mean square deviation) and number of hydrogen bonds following a 100 ns unconstrained simulation of the docked structure of hACE2 receptor (bound to Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P) and the hACE2 receptor alone. Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complexThe overall average RSMD for the peptide drug, Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P, alone was 3.49 Å and it fluctuated between 3.1 Å and 3.8 Å during the 100 ns simulation. The high flexibility of this ligand alone, suggested by the RSMD, is expected due to the large number of rotatable bonds in the straight chain structure of this decapeptide. The average RSMD of the trajectories for the docked complex (peptide drug-hACE2 receptor complex) was 0.049 Å, which was slightly lower than the RSMD for the hACE2 receptor alone (0.059 Å). The RMSD of the backbone atoms of the bound and unbound hACE2 receptor showed relative stability during the simulation (Fig 4A) and the difference in the RSMD of the docked and undocked hACE2 receptor was 0.01 Å. This suggests that the configurational entropy of the hACE2 receptor backbone might decrease slightly upon binding of Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P, thus attesting to the potential stability of the docked Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P and the hACE2 receptor complex. Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complex Heteroatom-hydrogen bonds interactions play a critical role in the formation of proteinligand complexes. Regarding stability of the hydrogen bonds (set at donor-acceptor distance of 3.0 Å and angle cutoff of 20 o ) between docked Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P and the hACE2 receptor, the number of hydrogen bonds fluctuated between a minimum of four and a maximum of thirteen during the 100 ns simulation (Fig 4B) . The wide fluctuation of the number of hydrogen bonds between the docked ligand and hACE2 receptor might be due to the high flexibility of the docked ligand (as evidenced by the high RSMD value of 3.49 Å). This result revealed the need for a strategy like cyclization to reduce the entropy peptide-based inhibitors that may be designed for target protein, hACE2 receptor.Overall, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analyses of hACE2 backbone atoms and the ligand atomic coordinates as well as the dynamics of the number of hydrogen bonds were performed to measure the structure stability of the top ranked peptide drug-hACE2 receptor Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complex complex. The results suggest that the predicted Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P-hACE2 receptor complex was relatively stable even though the number of hydrogen bonds might fluctuate.We hypothesized that the top-ranked peptide drug hits predicted in the study might modulate the energy of protein-protein interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 receptor. We conducted a protein-protein docking study to analyze the nature of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor in the absence and presence of a docked peptide drug hits (BV2). The predicted binding free energy for the top 10 poses from the protein-protein interaction simulation (in the presence and absence of BV2) were plotted against the respective binding free energies in Fig 5. The predicted binding free energy between spike protein and hACE2 receptor in the absence of a peptide drug hit was -35.05 kcal/mol for the topmost pose. However, the predicted binding free energy between spike protein and hACE2 receptor in the presence of a drug hit (BV2) Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 complex significantly reduced to -17.32 kcal/mol for the top pose. These predictions suggest that BV2 might limit the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 receptor.The goal here is to study the stability of the predicted protein-protein interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 receptor. We assessed the root mean square of fluctuation (RMSF) of the residues in the protein-protein interacting regions of the two proteins as well as the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the backbone of the protein in the same regions. Generally, the RMSF value of a residue represents the local flexibility of a protein. It reflected the mobility of atoms that make up that residue across the trajectories during the MD simulation. Therefore, higher RMSF values for residues indicate higher mobility (less stability) of such residues. Similarly, higher RMSD value is an indication of greater flexibility (less stability) of the protein backbone. The results for these analyses are presented in Fig 6. The image at the bottom (Fig 6A) is a plot of the sequence number of the amino acid residues against their RMSF values for the spike protein-hACE2 complex in the presence of the docked BV2 (red) and absence of the docked BV2 (navy blue).It can be observed from this plot that the spike protein-hACE2 complex in the presence of the docked drug hit (red) showed significant increase in fluctuations of the residues across most regions of the complex. Particularly, the regions that constitute the interacting surface between the spike protein (sequence number 1-68) and the hACE2 receptor (sequence number 716-771) showed great difference in fluctuations of the residues in the presence and absence of the docked drug. This observation was mirrored by the difference in RMSD of the backbone of the interacting regions of the protein complex in the presence and absence of the docked drug hit (shown on the top left (B) and top right (C) of Fig 6) . This indicates an increase in the flexibility of the backbone of the protein in the interacting regions in the presence of the docked drug hit. The increased fluctuations of residues and flexibility of the protein backbone observed in the interacting region suggest increased mobility and less stability of the residues in that region of the complex. This suggests that the docked drug disrupted the stability of the spike protein-hACE2 complex by steric and/or electrostatic interference with the interacting residues that were holding the protein-protein complex together.One possible explanation for the higher root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and higher root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone observed in presence of a docked drug might be the disruption of the erstwhile stable interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the hACE2 receptor by the docked peptide drug. This suggests the hypothesis that the docked drug has the potential to interfere with the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the hACE2 receptor thus reducing the infectivity of the coronavirus. We quantify the extent of this potential interference of the interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with the host receptor by conducting a protein-protein interaction simulation in the presence and absence of one of the top drugs predicted in this study. The results showed that there was up to 50% reduction in the binding affinity between the proteins in the presence of the drug. This suggests the potential of this top ranked peptide drug (BV2), predicted in this study, to affect the protein-protein interaction required for the infection of the host by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).The aim of the current study was to predict drugs from the Drug Bank that can bind to the interacting surface on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to establish its infection. Such drugs could be further studied, validated and repurposed as potential inhibitors of the interaction of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with hACE2 receptors in the airway. In comparison to the ""de novo"" drug discovery process, drug repurposing considerably reduces the cost and time to bring new treatments to the market [23] . This is because the starting point for drug repurposing is the Drug Bank, which is a pool of approved and experimental drugs with well-documented toxicity, pharmacology, and drug-drug interactions [24] . In this study, a host of computational strategies and techniques were used to predict peptide drugs that may be potentially validated and repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Molecular docking studies have proven to be a very effective method for predicting ligand hits in structure-based drug discovery projects [25] . Molecular dynamics allows the visualization of the motions (flexibility) and stability of macromolecules involved in binding interactions [26] . In all, we predicted that the docked peptide drug hits may provide steric and electrostatic hindrances to the protein-protein interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the hACE2 receptor via the C-terminal domain (CTD). We gained insight into the effect of the binding of one of the top-ranked peptide drugs (BV2) on the dynamics of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the hACE2 receptor by exploring the PPI with molecular dynamics. We also observed that all of the six top-ranked drug hits predicted in this study were peptides (biologics). The potential to inhibit protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been demonstrated by the proliferation of biologics as therapeutic agents, especially in the treatment of autoimmune diseases [27] . The current indications, basic pharmacology relevant to COVID-19 and pharmacokinetics of two of the top-ranked peptide drugs predicted are described in Table 1 .Conclusively, this study predicted peptide-based drugs that could potentially bind sufficiently to the interacting surface of the hACE2 receptor and could modulate the interaction of the SARS--CoV-2 spike protein with its host cells. Literature search revealed that the current or investigated indications for the predicted top-ranked peptide drugs were related to the pathophysiology or symptoms of COVID-19. Thus, the predicted top-ranked peptide drugs could be validated and repurposed to prevent and/or treat COVID-19 infection as well as be used as a template for the design of new peptidomimmetics against the virus. We hope that this drug repurposing hypothesis would stimulate further studies in the quest to find effective treatment for COVID-19.Supporting information S1 An analog of the human neuropeptide Substance P that binds to neurokinin-1 receptor (a transmembrane protein which can be found throughout the body, including in the airways of humans and plays an important role in mediation of local and systemic inflammatory processes) [24] . It has been investigated for use/treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and viral infection [24] .An investigational drug. Predictions using the SWISSADME server [28] revealed that it may have poor gastrointestinal absorption, no blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, be a P-gp substrate, and may not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, this peptide drug is expected to be administered intravenously.2. BV2 (Cholera enterotoxin subunit B) -10.55 This is cholera enterotoxin subunit B. The GO term reported for this peptide (GO: 0046812) revealed that it is host cell surface binding drug. It interacts selectively and non-covalently with the surface of a host cell [29] . BV2 has been shown to bind up to five GM1 gangliosides present on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells [24] . The foregoing attest to our observation that BV2 has the potential to bind effectively to hACE2 receptor and such may prevent protein-protein interaction required for infection by the COVID-19 virus.An experimental drug. Although there are no pharmacokinetic data for this peptide [24] , predictions using the SWISSADME server [28] revealed that it may have poor gastrointestinal absorption, no blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, be a P-gp substrate, and may not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, this peptide drug is expected to be administered intravenously, metabolized by peptidases in the blood and might have low distribution (concentrated within the vascular circulation) because it does not penetrate the BBB and may be effluxed by the P-gp. Prediction showed no tendency for toxicity.Their binding energy (S score) to the target site (hACE2 receptor), their current status in drug development and pharmacokinetics were also stated.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245258.t001Conceptualization: Samuel Egieyeh, Elizabeth Egieyeh.

The provision of quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic depends largely on the health of health care workers (HCWs). This group of persons are especially vulnerable to the risk of infections and could become vectors of onward transmission of COVID-19 [1, 2] . The rapidly evolving pandemic has overwhelmed the health system and has burdened HCWs and health facilities (HFs) both globally and locally [3] . HCWs face the stress of physical and mental exhaustion, the pain of losing patients and loved ones and difficulties in making triage decisions [1, 4] . A resulting implication is an increased pressure on the global health workforce [5] . The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasises the need for every HF to have critical-care HCWs in sufficient numbers and with adequate skills [6] .Globally, occupational exposure account for about 40% of infections among HCWs [7] . Reports from Euro News and Ripples reiterate that infection rates for COVID-19 among HCWs is estimated as 6% globally and 3% in Nigeria [8, 9] . The rise in these cases could be due to the asymptomatic nature of majority of COVID-19 cases. Similarly, infection rates for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) accounted for 13.44% among HCWs in South Korea [10] . Retrospective analysis based on epidemiological data reveals that the case fatality rate (CFR) for MERS among HCWs is 5.78% [11] . The novelty, high infectious rates and associated fatality differentiates the novel coronavirus from other infectious illnesses with which the human race has been faced. For the prevention of COVID-19, safety measures such as hand hygiene, social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were put in place [6] .Safety guidelines have been developed by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the coronavirus [6] . Existing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a viral infection transmitted by droplets and contact, rather than by air [6] . This explains the existence of precautions on social and physical distancing, environmental hygiene, as well as infection prevention and control (IPC) practices [6] . In tandem with existing recommendations from health agencies, a dire need for IPC materials, including face masks, protective gloves, gowns, face shields and respirators exists among HCWs and in health care facilities [1, 6] .Evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and its response revealed the modification of IPC procedures in adaptation to the substantial change in working conditions [6] . This necessitated the discouragement of gatherings of HCWs within and outside the hospital premises. Compulsory use of face masks was also encouraged, and physical meetings gave way to meetings on electronic media [12] . Despite the little risk of infection to the general public during this period, HCWs were particularly vulnerable due to the maintenance of close contact with patients, direct contact with droplets from patients, and inadequate supply of PPE [13] .Similarly, standard IPC precautions have existed regarding hospital-acquired infection (HAI) [14] . HCWs exist as vectors in the patient-to-patient transmission of HAI. Available evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of safety guidelines including the use of PPE, disinfection of equipment and environment and waste management. However, compliance to IPC measures remain poor [14] . The reasons accrued to non-compliance included lack of knowledge, poor risk assessment and behavioural change and inadequate supply of PPE. A study of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus patient transfers to the Radiology department in a Metropolitan hospital also confirmed that infection control measures were not adopted by HCWs especially when the infection status of patients was unknown [15] .The level of adherence of Nigerian HCWs to IPC measures on COVID-19 remains unknown. To the best of our knowledge, the existence of certain factors which could contribute to increased COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Nigeria has not been examined. A dive into research among HCWs could elicit key information necessary to reduce further infection of COVID-19 among HCWs. Hence, this study aimed at an assessment of the causes of COVID-19 infection among HCWs and the solutions.We conducted a qualitative study on frontline HCWs involved in the COVID-19 response in Kwara State, Nigeria. The choice of qualitative study design was made to be able to document a broad range of experiences of HCWs; therefore, the phenomenology method was used to underpin the study.As of the time of the interview, the researchers were members of the COVID-19 outbreak response team in Nigeria. Two of the authors; OSI and AAA, served as interviewers during the interview. To overcome gender-bias, the interviewers were male and female. Both interviewers, had previous training in qualitative research methodology. One of the interviewers is a medical doctor with master's degree in public health, while the second was currently enrolled in the master's of Public Health programme. The interviewers were previously members of an interviewing team for another completed qualitative research among COVID-19 positive HCWss in another state in Nigeria. However, both interviewers were not part of the supervisors of the frontline HCWs.We approached HCWs, all of whom provided consent for participating in the study mainly because one of the interviewers was known to them. Prior to the commencement of the study, one of the interviewers had attended the same training with the study participants. Therefore, this helped to gain participants confidence and build a co-workmate relationship among the interviewers and the study participants. The study participants were informed that the study aimed at identifying gaps that required attention to reduce their vulnerability to COVID-19.Purposive sampling was used to select the study participants. The inclusion criterion was all frontline HCWs participating in the COVID-19 response at the primary, secondary or tertiary levels of care. We included physicians and nurses only to generate sufficient information on the experiences of frontline HCWs who were directly providing care to COVID-19 patients. The interview method was adapted for greater privacy and confidentiality in exploring individual views and in-depth information. Also, the sensitivity of COVID-19 especially among HCWs contributed to the use of the interview method in a designated setting which assured of privacy. Sequel to obtaining informed consent, we scheduled and commenced face-to-face in-depth interviews within seven days (22nd to 28th June 2020) among HCWs in Kwara State, Nigeria. We continued to interview the HCWs who met the inclusion criteria, but however limited the sample size to 16 frontline HCWs (12 doctors and 4 nurses) when saturation; a point where no new information was gotten from the study participants, was reached.Data were collected at a relaxation centre close to the Ministry of Health in Ilorin, Kwara state. Each interview session lasted between 30 and 40 min, and no other person was present at the interview site besides the interviewer, the research assistant and each interviewee.Informed consent was obtained from each participant to record the interview. Due to the busy schedule of the interviewee and the nature of their job one session of repeat interview was conducted by the interviewers to verify the opinions of the HCWs who had participated previously in the study. Both sessions of interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and harmonised by all the authors to ensure the effective communication of respondents' experiences. The field notes taken during the interview also helped to appropriately record recurring statements and facial expressions of the frontline HCWs. Each transcript was returned to each study participant for additional comments and/or correction(s).An interview guide was developed to guide interviewers during the discussion. This included questions like: What do you know about IPC in the management of COVID-19 patients? Why are more HCWs contracting COVID-19? Any recommendation to reduce the infection rates among HCWs? Piloting of the questions on the interview guide was done among frontline HCWs at secondary HFs in Oyo State, Southwest Nigeria to test for ambiguity. Ambiguous questions were rephrased and simplified. During the interview, prompts such as 'Could you please explain further' 'Could you clarify?' and 'Please tell me more about that' were used to enhance the depth of the discussion.The Colaizzi's phenomenological method was used in the qualitative analysis of data. This method is dependent on rich first- person accounts of experience through face-to-face interviews, written narratives, online interviews etc. Descriptive phenomenology enhances a detailed understanding of the subject being investigated and is commonly used in health research [16] . This qualitative method sticks to and analyses data using seven vital steps without losing any element of the data. They include familiarisation of the researcher with the data, identification of relevant significant statements, formulation of meanings, development of cluster themes, description of the phenomenon while incorporating all themes, development of the fundamental structure, and its verification from few participants [17] . Manual transcription of each interview was done by three authors (OSI, AAA and AA), after which themes were identified from the data by AAA and OSI. For the verification process, three participants were invited for an interview which was conducted to ascertain if the identified themes fully matched their contributions on the factors contributing to increasing COVID-19 infection rates among HCWs and recommendations.Ethical approval in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration was obtained from the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (IRB/ 20/048). Also, verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants, and confidentiality of information was guaranteed prior to the commencement of the interview.Sixteen HCWs (4 nurses and 12 physicians) were interviewed; 3 (18.75%) females and 13 (81.25%) males. Other sociodemographic characteristics of the HCWs interviewed are shown in Table 1 . Figure 1 shows the identified themes and subthemes from the in-depth interview.Among the study participants, two females (12.5%) and five (31.25%) males stated that poor knowledge of IPC measures for COVID-19 as a factor which could increase COVID-19 infection rates among HCWs (Table 2) .'I am certain that many healthcare workers do not possess adequate knowledge of IPC in managing COVID-19 patients. This will therefore put many of us at risk of contracting COVID-19.' (N2)The poor knowledge of IPC was viewed among respondents as a consequence of the lack of sufficient IPC training. IPC training is meant to equip HCWs for the prevention of COVID-19. However, when such training is inadequate, HCWs are increasingly posed with the risk of COVID-19 infection. The lack of IPC tools was described in many health care facilities by two (12.5%) participants. The lack of these lifesaving tools will pose threats to the safety of HCWs against COVID-19 while providing care to COVID-19 positives. The availability of soaps, hand sanitisers in inadequate quantities and irregular water supply also compromise the protection of HCWs against COVID-19 infection. 'Regular water supply is not available for use…' (P3)'IPC tools are currently inadequate. This will not assure of our safety …' (N4)Among the respondents, inadequate logistics, lack of training on infectious disease management, poor political will and poor behavioural change were stated among two (12.5%) males and one (6.25%) female as factors which have increased COVID-19 infection rates among HCWs. There is a need to change behaviour due to non-compliance despite presence of IPC materials. Sub-theme two: adequate provision of PPE Alongside the provision of PPE and sanitation kits, two male (12.5%) participants reiterated the need to encourage PPE usage among HCWs. The rational use of PPE has been suggested to depend on improved stewardship from the management of HFs, and this needs to be incorporated into tasks related to the COVID-19 reduction compliance needs to be enforced.'Hospital management teams should provide PPE to health facilities and should ensure compliance to outlined COVID-19 safety measures.' (P3)'Government authorities and non-governmental organizations should make PPE more available to healthcare workers. They should not make empty promises.' (P9)Sub-theme three: enhancement of point-of-care risk assessment In the management of COVID-19, HCWs need to enhance their suspicion index by classifying every patient as suspected COVID-19 cases. Also, the need for prompt commencement of care immediately confirmation of cases is ascertained was noted by 3 (18.75%) males. Also, triaging equipment need to be supplied in adequate quantities.'Point-of-care assessment must be enhanced among healthcare workers.' (P7)'Triaging should be commenced immediately patients are presented to healthcare workers.' (P3)'All patients must be treated as possible COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise.' (P10) Sub-theme four: IPC system strengthening In facilities where none exists, IPC system needs to be set up, with the proper incorporation of the management teams of HFs into the IPC team. Institutionalisation of IPC in quality management plans of hospitals needs to be done, alongside the establishment of IPC champions and cough officers in all departments were described as needful by 1 (6.25%) each of male and female participants. One (6.25%) male participant suggested the need for the existence of IPC focal persons in each HF, with proper monitoring and supervision by the HF management teams.'The institutionalization of IPC in quality improvement plans of hospitals is highly required.' (P11)'IPC focal persons are needed in each health facility and are to be monitored by the management teams in health facilities.' (N3)'Management teams of health facilities should be adequately incorporated into IPC committees. Cough officers should also be assigned to each department.' (P1)The provision of financial rewards and incentives were frequently suggested by respondents. These allowances should be commensurate to the risks that HCWs bear while caring for COVID-19 patients. Incentives and/or hazard allowance was noted as tools which prompt higher levels of commitment to work among HCWs by 1 (6.25%) each among males and females.'Hazard allowance should be regularly paid, and more incentives should be included for healthcare workers who are involved in the COVID-19 response.' P3 'Incentives must be provided for all categories of healthcare workers, not only those in the frontline…' N3Sub-theme six: improved hygiene practices Frequent handwashing practices using soap and water and regular fumigation of hospital premises are required in the reduction of infection rates among HCWs. Improved availability of sanitation kits across all sections of HFs were also suggested by 1 (6.25%) each of males and females.'Healthcare workers should frequently wash their hands with soap under running water, and compliance to hand hygiene must be enforced.' P1'Regular cleaning of the hospital premises and possible fumigation should be encouraged. Sanitation kits are to be present in all wards of each health facility.' (N4)Sub-theme seven: improved health human resources The recruitment of more health professionals reduces the workload on frontline HCWs in COVID-19 management and reduce their vulnerability. The inclusion of break periods during duty hour reduces the stress on HCWs, and enhance proper decisionmaking regarding risk assessment, stated two male (12.5%) participants.'More healthcare workers should be recruited into the COVID-19 response, and workload should be reduced.' (P12)'Break periods must be sufficiently incorporated into duty schedules to reduce the stress faced by healthcare workers.' (P5)The provision of adequate logistics is the responsibility of both government and the hospital management in the enhancement of any outbreak preparation. The regular supply of up-to-date COVID-19 information is required to intimate HCWs of the increased risk associated with COVID-19 exposure. The need for concrete and enhanced outbreak preparedness was described by two (12.5%) males.'Outbreak preparedness need to be enhanced to reduce the risk associated with the exposure of healthcare workers to COVID-19.' (P4)'Adequate logistics should be provided for all healthcare workers.' (P10)This study aimed at assessing HCWs regarding IPC measures for COVID-19. HCWs possess a spirit of dedication to the service of humanity and are always willing to provide the best care regardless of the prevailing circumstances. In this study, we found that the inadequate supply of PPE could increase the infection risk for COVID-19 among HCWs. Errors in the donning and doffing of PPE were also identified as contributory to COVID-19 among HCWs in Nigeria. Similar errors were noted in the West African Ebola outbreak, and this necessitated the new interim guidance during this period [18] . Although regular PPE usage has been a source of physical distress to HCWs, its provision in inadequate quantities denies these HCWs of their rights to protection against COVID-19 [19] . Due to this factor, many HCWs have developed anxiety and apprehension of the fear of infection over the news of an infected colleague with whom they have had contact. These findings confirm the notions of respondents in this study regarding the dire need for adequate supplies of PPE for every HCW. This implies that the management of public health emergencies such as COVID-19 entails prioritising the health of HCWs so that they could be empowered to provide quality health services to all individuals.The findings from this study suggest that poor knowledge of IPC or its negligence amongst HCWs is a contributory factor to the increased prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs. During the SARS outbreak, poor knowledge of IPC was associated with increased levels of emotional distress and fear of infection among nurses [13] . In this study, respondents recommended BCC and enforcement of IPC measures across all facilities as solutions to reducing COVID-19 infection among HCW. Similarly, previous studies on MERS and SARS suggest that sound infection prevention measures such as adherence to the use of PPE and regular environmental decontamination was strictly enforced [6, 19] .A recent study on the experience of frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in China suggest that non-essential HCWs were denied entry into the COVID-19 isolation wards [20] . This proactive measure was in line with sound knowledge of IPC in such facilities [20] . Hence, an improvement in the knowledge and practice of physicians and nurses through health education sessions would serve to protect physicians, nurses and their families from the COVID-19 infection.The WHO has defined eight pillars for an IPC structure, namely: IPC programmes, IPC guidelines, education and training and surveillance. Others include multimodal strategies, monitoring and feedback, workload, staffing and bed capacity, and built environment, materials and equipment for IPC at HFs [21] . We found from this study that the existence of weak IPC structure Epidemiology and Infection in HFs cripples the safety of HCWs. Physicians and nurses interviewed in this study attributed long working hours during the COVID-19 outbreak as risk factors to COVID-19 infection among HCWs, as similar to findings from previous research [22, 23] . This might be due to the lack of rest, long-term exposure of HCWs to COVID-19 cases, and working under pressure.The success of any IPC structure hinges on the inclusion of the HFs management in the IPC team, however, this is lacking in most HFs in Nigeria. A positive relationship between the existence of organisational support and IPC has been identified in previous studies [24, 25] . This is because organisational involvement indicates the extent of value placed on staff care. This also indicates a higher likelihood for logistics and clinical supervision, as well as the development of training protocols adapted to the needs of the local HFs [26] . We also found that IPC focal persons (FPs) were lacking in each ward unit, as contrary to the standard practice. This explains a thorough lack of monitoring, assessment and feedback practice from HCWs in each unit of HFs. When IPC systems are strengthened, multifocal identification of staff needs to become possible, and then responsive actions can be taken to address such identified needs.We also identified poor point of care risk assessment as a factor contributing to the spread of COVID-19 among HCWs. Ensuring triage, early recognition and source control isolating patients with suspected COVID-19 is the first IPC strategy to prevent or limit transmission in health care settings. Our findings however suggest that poor index of suspicion, failure to classify all patients as suspected cases and inadequate knowledge of patient triaging contribute to exposure of HCWs. Undisclosed history of exposure and delay in establishing a diagnosis further complicates HCWs exposure to COVID-19. A study in China established that HCWs who took training on standard precaution guidelines were more likely to always comply with IPC as compared to non-trained HCWs [13] .Findings from this study suggest that poor outbreak preparedness of the Nigerian government for the coronavirus contribute to the escalation in the number of infected HCWs. A likely explanation for this result is the lack of sufficient logistics put in place by the national government regarding the eventual importation of COVID-19. A survey conducted among HCWs during the EVD outbreak in Ghana showed ill preparedness of HFs to handle the cases [27] . In spite of this finding, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) developed the Surveillance and Outbreak Response Management System (SORMAS) for casebased reporting early in the pandemic [28] . Similarly, the National Incident Coordination Centre (NICC) was established for gathering daily intelligence reports, and to ensure a wellcoordinated outbreak response [29] .We also found that the deployment of non-critical care staff in the COVID-19 response at HFs could heighten the infection rates among HCWs. The reasons for this are as follows: Firstly, most of these HCWs provide regular health care services only. Secondly, the deployment of these HCWs directly into critical care for COVID-19 could increase their vulnerability to the infection. These factors were also stated in similar studies [4, 13] . Hence, improved outbreak preparedness for strengthening the national health system for events of future health emergencies was solicited among the respondents in this study.Incentives and financial motivation serve to mitigate the risk with which HCWs are faced during the COVID-19 outbreak. We found in this study that a lack of incentives could increase the COVID-19 infection among HCWs. Unmotivated and tired HCWs are prone to make mistakes while discharging their duties. A study on the application of incentive schemes in health care acknowledges that financial incentives alone are not sufficient to retain and motivate staff, but also effectively improve care processes [13] . Thus, establishing a rewarding system for HCWs who consistently put their lives on the line should be advocated.Poor political will and management support are factors that contribute to poor compliance to IPC in this study. A similar finding was corroborated in an Ethiopian study where management support in HFs positively impacted the compliance of HCWs with IPC [5] . This might be because political and HFs management authorities play key roles and are responsible for an improved access of necessary safety equipment to physicians, nurses and other cadres of HCWs. The active commitment of management authorities in HFs would also enhance investment in safe work environments for HCWs and patients. It is also obvious that, without the support of management teams in HFs, it would be difficult to renovate infrastructures which are suitable for infection control. Difficulties would also be experienced in the allocation of sufficient budget for IPC activities such as training of HCWs [4, 6] . Active political involvement would ensure the decentralisation of COVID-19 treatment centres, which would reduce both the workload of HCWs and the risk of contracting COVID-19 [5] . In addition, HFs management support could also help strengthen infection prevention activities by designing controlling mechanisms and taking corrective measures regarding non-compliant HCWs.The findings in this study could have been limited by being carried out in only one state. The inclusion of only physicians and nurses could have concealed the experiences of other cadres of HCWs who were also frontline HCWs in the COVID-19 response. Despite these limitations, the in-depth interview method made use of in this study elicited robust information regarding the experiences of frontline HCWs in the COVID-19 response. This study also provides novel information on the experiences of frontline HCWs who are involved in the COVID-19 response in North-Central Nigeria. The qualitative research helped in the investigation of individual views and perceptions, and to identify strategies for the reduction of COVID-19 infection rates among HCWs. It further provides a solid background for developing concepts required for future quantitative research.This study reviewed the causes of COVID-19 infections among HCWs from the point of view of front-line HCWs in Kwara State Nigeria. The respondents were aware of their vulnerability to the COVID-19 infection, and the reasons attributed included poor knowledge of IPC measures for COVID-19, inadequate supply of PPE, poor political will and inadequate HFs management support. We recommend scale-up training on IPC measures particularly hand washing and use of PPE as well as the development of effective points of care risk assessment with high index of suspicion in HFs. In addition, improved political will and better involvement of HFs management teams in IPC systems is needed to reduce the risk for COVID-19 infection among HCWs.

The infected cases increasing daily, at the times of writing, this number has now exceeded 12,5 million, with 560k confirmed deaths. The COVID-19 pandemic is related to the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2,which is an enveloped, crowned (+) single-stranded RNA viruses, belongs to the Coronaviridae family [2] . Several protein molecules encoded by the viral genome, exhibit a vital role in the virulence and replication of SARS-CoV-2, among them the main protease known as 3CLpro (Mpro), which have a crucial role in the replication of the polyproteins that translated from the viral RNA [3] . Another protein that plays a key role in viral attachment, fusion, and entry of SARS-CoV-2, is the spike glycoprotein (S-protein). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein binds strongly to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of lung cells [4] . These two proteins, main protease, and spike protein may be a promising drug target to build up vaccines and therapeutic agents to control the new coronavirus (COVID 19) infection. Till now, no vaccine or drug has yet been specifically approved for SARS-CoV-2. The conventional approaches for the development of a new effective therapies and vaccines against the COVID-19 are very costly and require at least one year before the first vaccine is approved and available for widespread use. One of the urgent solutions that have a great global interest among researchers for the treatment and prevention of recent COVID-19 disease is the use of dietary molecules, which can be found abundantly in functional food [5] . Numerous dietary molecules such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, catechin, savinin, curcumin, and betulinic acid has been identified by molecular docking studies, as an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent [6, 7] . Several studies reported that anthocyanins are the main components in strawberry and black raspberry [8] . Mazza and Miniati (1993) have mentioned a range of 25 to 495 mg/100 g anthocyanins for high bush blueberries [9] . Anthocyanins as dietary molecules are members of a large group of secondary metabolites secreted by plants, called polyphenols, which are categorized into four categories: flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes.Flavonoids are subdivided into four subclasses, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones [10] . This subclass was selected because several studies have shown that anthocyanins compounds display diverse beneficial effects, including anti-diabetes, anti-cancer, anti-allergy, anti-mutagenesis, cardioprotection, and antimicrobial effects. Several anthocyanins display also a good antiviral activity [8, 11] . As far as we know, no available research on the evaluation of anthocyanins from berries using computational modeling against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6lu7) and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6lzg).Molecular docking is promising tool for discovery of new therapeutic drug candidates against COVID-19, with this method we can analyze the orientation and conformation (stated together as the ""pose"") of molecules into the binding sites of a macromolecular targets [12] . Several literature reported about the use of molecular docking simulation to assess or predict the drug-target binding affinity with the viral protease [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Using this method, we have screened eighteen dietary molecules belong to the subclass of anthocyanin, which represent the main compounds in several berry fruits, as potent inhibiting agents of the main protease and targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein for SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, molecular docking allocates swift recognition of the amino acid sequences throughout SARS-CoV-2 [22] [23] [24] . The docking outcomes were optimistic and suggested a probable inhibition against the SARS-CoV-2.As molecular targets, two important proteins for SARS-CoV2 infection were nominated. This including the Main Protease (Mpro) (also called 3C-like protease -3CLpro), which represents a pivotal role in the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. The crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with the inhibitor N-[(5-Oxopyrrolidin-3-Yl]Methyl}But-2-Enyl)-L-Leucinamide, (N3),was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB), (PDB code: 6lu7), in PDB formats. However, the novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with its receptor ACE2 was gained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein data bank (PDB ID: 6lzg). A library of eighteen compounds belongs to all the subclass of anthocyanins as displayed in Fig. 1 were selected and screened against both protein targets (main protease and spike protein).The preparation of the two targets proteins, 6lu7 and 6lzg, used in this study, was performed, through BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020. The water molecules were removed from the crystal structure of the two proteins, along with the original ligand that attached to the target protein 6lu7.However, to prepare the ligand, 6lzg, the hACE2 protein (part A) was removed from the complex PDB file, Spike Protein RBD-hACE2. Both receptors were stored in the (.PDB) format. The second step of preparation was performed on AutoDock Tools 1.5.6, by the addition of polar H-atoms and Kollman charges, then, the ligands were saved as PDBQT files. Ligands preparation was done by energy minimization using the Gasteiger algorithm, detecting root, and set the number of torsions.Molecular docking analysis was done using AutoDock Tools 1.5.4, to evaluate the lowest binding energy, between the ligands and the target proteins (6lu7 and RBD of S-protein). The same program was used also to obtain the three-dimensional grid box for docking simulation in which the box with a size of 40×40×40, at 0.742 Å was generated and centered at (x = 13.544, y = 12.198, z = 67.681) around hotspot residues of the active site of the target 6lu7. Furthermore, the grid box for RBD of S-protein was Studio and PyMOL were implemented to visualize and scrutinize the interaction between the ligand fragments with the viral protein (3CLpro and RBD of S-protein).To determine the effect of an active substance after its administration in the human body, it is essential to recognize their absorption, metabolism, excretion, and distribution (ADME), also called pharmacokinetic properties of the drug [25, 26] . Early ADME estimation greatly decreases the fraction of pharmacokinetics-related failure in the clinical stages [27] . Five biochemical features have a great influence on ADME proprieties of the drug, this so-called Lipinski's rule of five, which outlined the relationship between physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties. Lipinski's rule of five [28] , along with other important parameter used to assess drug-likeness and toxicity of hit compounds, such as Veber's rule [29] , bioactivity score, polar surface area (TPSA), solubility (logs), synthetic accessibility (SA) bioavailability score, inhibition of any CYP alleles and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeant, has been evaluated using the free web tool SwissADME (Molecular Modeling Group, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) [27] , and molinspiration tool.The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6lu7) and spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6lzg) was obtained as a PDB format. The model validated before conducting the molecular docking simulation, then the ligands were subjected to energy minimization to obtain the optimized active geometries.Energy minimization was conducted with current forcefield charges using Amber10:EHT forcefield, cutoff (8.10 Å), R-field solvation, a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0, and time scaling of 100 ns [24] . Docked complexes subjected to 500 iterative cycles with a radius offset of 0.4, and a gradient of 0.01 [24] . The ligands were designated based on the obtained scores and their binding modes [30] . Virtual screening was carried from a library of eighteen Phyto ligands compounds, belong to the subclass of anthocyanins to distinguish the potential inhibitors of COVID-19 main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Based on AutoDock results ( Table 1) , out of 18 compounds used in the present study, procyanidin B2 exhibited the lowest docking score with the main protease (3CLpro) (-9.3 kcal/mol) active sites, followed by procyanidin A2 (-9.2 kcal/mol) and cyanidin-3-arabinoside (-9.1 kcal/mol). The three glycosylated pelargonidin display highest docking scores when compared with the aglycone compound pelargonidin, furthermore, the nature of sugar moieties attached to pelargonidin seems important pelargonidin substituted at position 3 with rhamnoside display high score (-9.1 kcal/mol) when compared to pelargonidin-3-glucoside (-8.3 kcal/mol) and pelargonidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (-8.2 kcal/mol). All the selected compounds (pelargonidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, pelargonidin-3-o-beta-D-glucoside, cyanidin-3arabinoside, procyanidin A2, procyanidin B2) shown docking binding energy higher than the recently used inhibitor (darunavir) for COVID-19 main protease. The molecular docking outputs, reveals the probable use of Salvadora persica flavonoids (kaempferol and isorhamnetin derivative), which are structurally closest to the class of anthocyanin, to inhibit SARS-CoV-2main protease [6] . The host cell receptor ACE2, interact with the SARS-CoV-2, via its Spike Glycoprotein. The inhibition of this interaction, using natural product sources, can prevent the virus infection [31] . Several studies selected the target, Spike glycoprotein, for virtual screening research rather than the ACE2 protein, since this latest is expressed in numerous human cells types, and consequently, targeting ACE2 results in various side effects, such as modulatory effect on blood pressure, and several other cardiovascular systemrelated side effects [32] [33] [34] . The values of binding affinity interaction, between the active target site, RBD of S-protein, and the 18 Phyto ligands used in this study, ranging from, -6.2 kcal/mol, for the ligand pelargonidin, to -7.2 kcal/mol, for the ligand procyanidin A2, followed by procyanidin B2 (-7.0 kcal/mol) as shown in Table 1 . All anthocyanins ligands used in this study displayed Vina docking scores better than hydroxychloroquine. In the molecular docking, the least binding energies revealed the stronger docking between ligands and viral targets [35] .The types of molecular interaction, particularly, H-bonds and hydrophobic interaction, involved between the ligands molecules and the residues of the active site of both target proteins (6lu7 and RBD of S-protein) have been studied, because they organize the shape and stabilization of the docking molecules [36] . Analyzing the interacting residues between the top-most binding compounds, which showed the lowest docking score with RBD of S-protein, Table 1 , indicates that pelargonidin-3-glucoside, interact via five hydrogen bonds with the amino acids, Arg 403, Gln 498, Tyr 505, Asn 501, Gly 496, and one π-π stacked bond with Tyr 505 as displayed in Fig. 3 . However, the compound, procyanidin A2interacted with RBDof S-protein through hydrogen bonding with the amino acids, Tyr 449 and Asn 450, and formed: unfavorable donor-donor bond with Phe 490, π-anion bond with Glu 484, pi-sigma bond with Leu 452, and π-π stacked bond with Phe 490. Likewise, the ligand pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, interacted by two hydrogen bonds with the amino acids (Tyr 505, Gly 496), and exhibited π-π stacked bond with, Tyr 505, and π-donor hydrogen bond with Tyr 453, Gly 496 (Fig. 3) . Moreover, a single hydrogen bond was found between the residue Gly 496 and procyanidin B2. The same amino acid (Gly 496), along with the amino acid Gly 502, Arg 403, Asn 501, are involved in unfavorable donor-donor/acceptor-acceptor bond with the compound procyanidin B2, in addition to one π-π t-shaped bond with the amino acid Tyr 505.The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein uses many residues to contact the bottom side of the small ACE2 lobe, including: Try449, Tyr453, Asn487, Tyr489, Gly496, Thr500, Gly502, Tyr505, Leu455, Phe456, Phe486, Gln493, Asn501, Lys417, Gln474 and Gln498 [4] . The ligands, pelargonidin-3- glucoside, procyanidin B2, and pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, by targeting the amino acids involved in the interaction between the S-protein and ACE2, they can disturb the attachment of the virus SARS-Cov-2 with the host's cell receptor ACE2. Consequently, these compounds can prevent the virus infection.Cyanidin-7-arabinoside did not exhibit any interaction with these key residues. For good interaction between the ligands and the S-protein, the presence of sugar moieties appears to be significant. The most scored-ligands (pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, pelargonidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, and cyanidin-7arabinoside) has the presence of monosaccharides group attached in their structures, consequently, it can attach with high affinity to the glycosylated part of the S-protein. On the other hand, the affinity is lower with the glycosylated anthocyanidins ligands (avidin, apigeninidin, peonidin, rosinidin, tricetanidin, cyanidin), the same remarque was raised by Oliveira et al. [40] .Drug-likeness evaluation of the best-scored anthocyanin compounds was carried out using Lipinski's Rule of Five that covers, lipophilicity (reported as octanol-water partition coefficient, and known as LogP), the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, and the molecular weight. Compounds that conform to the Rule of Five, tend to have an increased chance of reaching the market [41] .The results are displayed in Table 2 .The synthetic accessibility of the four compounds which show the best docking score and drug ability is less than 10 (range between 4.99-5.25), therefore they can be easily synthesized as displayed in Table   3 .The ADME properties predicted using swiss ADME, suggested that the four compounds (pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, pelargonidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, and pelargonidin-3glucoside) did not show any hepatocellular toxicity since it was not inhibited any of the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) alleles, furthermore, they don't show any blood-brain barrier crossing suggesting low toxicity induced upon consumption as confirmed through Table 3 . The prediction of the bioactivity score from molinspiration tools, indicates that the four compounds have a very low binding affinity towards key targets of our cell.Thereby, they are inducing very low cellular toxicity, in fact, the compounds do not bind to nuclear receptors and the primary targets like GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptors), and do not act as inhibitors for kinase proteins, proteases, and critical enzymes in our cell. The ability of the reported ligands to bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6lu7) and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6lzg) depends on molecular docking scores [42] . The reported ligands exhibit π-πinteractions and hydrogen bonding, with 6lu7 protease and 6lzg spike glycoprotein as summarized in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. These electrostatic interactions suggest that the reported ligands are powerful inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease [43] , owing to the formation of complex geometries with higher binding energies [24] . Furthermore, H-bond formation with 6lu7 and 6lzg reveals the ability of the ligands to block the COVID-19 binding receptor [30] . (Tables S1 & S2) . Anthocyanins compounds are present in the highest concentration in berry fruits. This study evaluates the ability of eighteen compounds derived from anthocyaninin for the inhibition of the main protease (6lu7) and the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular docking simulation. Cyanidin-3-arabinoside exhibited significant binding stability and interaction, with key residues within the binding site of coronavirus main protease (6lu7). However, according to the molecular docking study, the three compounds, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rhamnoside, and cyanidin-7-arabinoside can inhibit the attachment of the SARS-CoV2 with the host cell receptor ACE2. These compounds have a high drug-likeness as per Lipinski's rule of five and confer favorable toxicity parameters and ADME values. According to our study, the ligand cyanidin-3arabinoside, which displays potent inhibition of SARS-COV-2 in silico, is found in high concentration in black chokeberries, bilberries, lingonberries, gooseberries, rubus, blackcurrants, while pelargonidin-3-glucoside found in raspberry and strawberry. Consequently, they can prevent virus infection. The docking results demonstrated that the reported ligands display a high binding attraction with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6lu7), and spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6lzg) and could hinder its viral disease.Depending on the docking scores and binding energies, Cyanidin-3-arabinoside exhibits docking scores of -7.5 and -5.5 kcal/mol, so it is a potential inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. Considering the obtained results, regular consumption of berry fruits should be crucial to inhibit and control COVID-19 disease by suppression of propagation and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.The authors declare that they have no known competing for financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Algeria","first author","2021-01-21",1

Approximately 6 months later, almost 20 million cases and approximately 700,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [2] .To date, there is still no treatment or vaccine for this pandemic. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine-based treatment with or without azithromycin [3] [4] [5] . However, the efficacy of these medicines has not been proven for curative treatment of the disease. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also evaluated for prophylaxis against COVID-19 in clinical trials among close contacts of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and health care workers. Although the preclinical results are promising, there is currently no evidence of the effectiveness of chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine in the prevention of COVID-19 [6] .The COVID-19 epidemic created widespread psychosis and anxiety among the population in sub-Saharan Africa [7] . This could be linked, on the one hand, to the high mortality observed in some countries, such as Italy and Spain, and on the other hand, to the lack of technical resources to combat the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Regarding the African continent, the WHO indicated that it fears the worst, as the better resourced health-care systems of developed countries have faced enormous difficulties in dealing with the epidemic [8] . Faced with this situation and the variety of information circulating on social media, many plants and substances without the minimum requirements of efficacy and tolerance have been proposed to treat or prevent COVID-19 [9] . The use of these substances without medical advice is considered self-medication, which is defined as taking medicines, herbs or home remedies on one's own initiative or on the advice of another person without consulting a medical doctor [10] . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of poisoning and death have been reported in the USA and Nigeria in persons selfmedicating with chloroquine [11, 12] .Health literacy plays an important role in selfmedication behavior [13] . Concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and other coronaviruses, the level of knowledge is globally low according to a meta-analysis of 70 scientific articles. Indeed, the proportion of people with a low level of knowledge ranged from 4.3 to 57.9% among health professionals and from 4.0 to 82.5% in the rest of the population [14] .Togo, similar to most West African countries, is experiencing significant population growth (2.8% per year): its population has more than tripled in less than 30 years, rising from 2.7 million inhabitants in 1981 to 8, 608,444 inhabitants in 2020 [15] . The demographic context is characterized by (i) a predominantly young population (60% of Togolese are under 25 years old); (ii) a high population density in the coastal regions; and (iii) rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, especially in Lomé (capital) [15] . Economically, the gross domestic product per Togolese was 682 U.S. dollars in 2019, making Togo the 11th poorest country in the world [16] .In Togo, although the dispensing of psychoactive drugs is regulated by law and requires a prescription, this is not the case for other drugs, including antibiotics, which can be sold without a prescription [17, 18] . Despite the efforts of the Togolese National Order of Pharmacists to curb the overuse and limit access to antibiotics without a prescription, these drugs are still widely consumed through self-medication [19] .Togo reported its first case of COVID-19 on March 5th , 2020, and the number of cases multiplied by ten in 3 months, with 98 cases and 6 deaths on April 26th [20] compared to 908 cases and 18 deaths on July 31st, 2020 [2] . On October 27, 2020, the country reported 264 cumulative cases and 6 deaths per million inhabitants [21] . The absence of a recognized treatment for the disease and its constant progression requires a re-evaluation of self-medication practices in Togo, where 80% of people resort to self-medication [22] and 60% resort to traditional pharmacopoeia [23] . Thus, this study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of preventive selfmedication and its associated factors in an epidemic context where there is no preventive or curative treatment.This study was part of a survey aimed at describing the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lomé (the capital city of Togo) [24] . This was a crosssectional study conducted from April 23rd to May 8th, 2020. A total of 955 participants were included, and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.7% according to polymerase chain reaction tests [24] .Participants were recruited from five professional sectors: the healthcare (doctors, nurses, pharmacy auxiliaries, and hospital administrators), air transport, police, road transport (taxi and moto-taxi drivers) and informal (market sellers and craftsmen) sectors. These groups were targeted because they are at high risk of infection during epidemics [25, 26] . Thus, these working professionals had a high probability of being in close contact with travellers or with COVID-19 patients. Participants were eligible to participate in the study if the following four criteria were met: (i) aged ≥ 18 years; (ii) worked in one of the five sectors under study; (iii) were regularly present at their workstation in the month prior to the survey, i.e., had not taken any time off work in the last 30 days and had no sick leave; and (iv) lived in Lomé for the past 3 months.Several sampling methods were used for participant selection based on the expected total size of the target population and the availability of a sampling frame. First, exhaustive recruitment (consisting of the inclusion of all staff present at the moment of the survey) was performed among police (road safety officers) and air transport professionals (International Airport Gnassingbe Eyadema, Lomé, Togo) [24] . Second, participants from the informal sector were recruited by open invitation. Third, random sampling (two or three stages) was performed to recruit taxi and moto-taxi drivers (road transport) and health care workers [24] . For example, for the selection of moto-taxi drivers, we performed a two-stage sampling, selecting the company and then the drivers working in the company.The sample size was calculated using a single proportion population formula with a 95% confidence level. We hypothesized that 50% of the population would practice self-medication, with a 5% margin error. The estimated minimum sample size was 384 participants. A 10% nonresponse rate was anticipated, and the minimum number of participants was estimated at 422 [24] . With a sample size of 955, we reached a 3% margin error.After the eligibility screening and the participants' provision of written informed consent, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 epidemiological data and self-medication practices were collected using a standardized questionnaire developed for this survey by a multidisciplinary team involving two medical epidemiologists, two virologists, one pharmacist and one sociologist. All sections of the questionnaire (sociodemographic characteristics; knowledge, attitudes and practices related to COVID-19; symptoms of COVID-19 and biological tests) were developed based on the data reported in the literature since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was tested on a sample of six medical doctors (those assumed to have the highest level of understanding) and six taxi drivers (those assumed to have the lowest level of understanding), which allowed us to reformulate or remove some questions that seemed complicated or difficult to answer. Five trained medical doctors assisted by students at the end of their medical training administered the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview. The participants were invited to give information on self-medication practices to prevent COVID-19 within the 2 weeks preceding the interview.Self-medication practice was the outcome variable. It was assessed based on the participants' selection and use of medicines/drugs alleged to treat or prevent COVID-19 without a physician order in the past 2 weeks.Descriptive statistics were calculated, and the results are presented as frequencies and percentages for the categorical variables. Quantitative variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). The prevalence of self-medication was estimated with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI).Univariable and multivariable logistic model regression were performed to assess factors associated with selfmedication with the aim of preventing COVID-19. In the model building, characteristics that had a p-value < 0.20 in univariable analysis were considered for the full multivariable models, which were subsequently finalized using a stepwise, backward elimination approach (pvalue < 0.05). This procedure allowed the estimation of adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Predictor variables were selected as those found to be relevant according to the literature review. The data analyses were performed using R© version 3.4.3 software and the level of significance was set at 5%.Ethical approval was obtained from the 'Comité de Bioéthique de Recherche en Santé' (Bioethics Committee for Health Research) from the Togo Ministry of Health (No. 004/2020/CBRS). Potential participants were informed about the study purpose and procedures, potential risks and protections. Those willing to participate were invited to sign a consent form prior to participation.This study was a part of a survey on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in populations at high risk of infection in Lomé. A total of 976 people were approached; 21 people refused to be sampled for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore excluded from the study, for a response rate of 97.8%.In total, 955 people with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included in the study, and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Among the recruited participants, 38.7% (n=370) were in the health sector, 22.1% (n=212) were in the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) were in the police sector, 12.8% (n=122) were in the road transport sector, and 5.8% (n=55) were in the informal economy sector. None of the participants had been previously diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 or had been hospitalized in the last 30 days before their enrollment. Almost all of the participants (98.0%; n=936) were Togolese. Twothirds of the participants (66.6%; n=636) were living with someone as a couple, and half (51.0%; n=487) of them had a university degree. The sociodemographic characteristics by professional sector are summarized in Table 1 .Products used for self-medication Table 2 describes the products used for the prevention of COVID-19 by professional sector. The most commonly used products were vitamin C (27.6%) and traditional medicine (10.2%). Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine was used by 2.0% of the sample, and azithromycin was used by 1.2%.The overall prevalence of the use of at least one product to prevent COVID-19 was 34.2% (95% CI: 31.2-37.3%). The prevalence ranged from 16.4% (95% CI= [9.8-23.0]) for participants from the road transport sector to 51.9% (95% CI= [46.8-57 .0]) for those from the health sector. Table 3 reports the overall self-medication prevalence by professional sector.In the multivariable logistic regression model, after adjustment for the other variables, three factors were positively associated with self-medication: being female (aOR=1.90; p< 0.001), working in the health sector (aOR=1.89; p= 0.001) and having attained a secondary or higher education level (aOR= 2.28; p= 0.043 for secondary level and aOR=5.11; p< 0.001 for university level). Having at least one symptom related to SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with self-medication (Fig. 1 ).The WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a form of prevention or management of COVID-19. Despite the advice of clinicians and governments, 34.2% of the people surveyed in our study used a treatment without a prescription. These treatments included modern treatments as well as traditional medicine. The prevalence of selfmedication found in our study is probably related to i) the long delay in finding an appropriate treatment for COVID-19 based on an adequately powered randomized trial [27] ; ii) the influence of social media that proposes any type of product to prevent or treat COVID-19 [9] ; iii) the influence of leaders (political and religious) who have claimed the efficacy of certain products or who claim to have discovered traditional remedies [28, 29] ; and iv) the stigmatization of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, which encourages some people to take care of themselves at home [30] . Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine was used by 2.0% of the population, and this proportion varied from 0.8% in people working in the health sector and 7.3% in people working in the informal sector. The use of chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine could be linked to the fact that a study published in March 2020 concluded that hydroxychloroquine was effective for the reduction of viral load and recovery time in Covid-19 patients [5] . However, there have been many warnings about the improper use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine outside of hospital or clinical trial settings for COVID-19. Its use may increase the risk for arrhythmias or death [31, 32] . Political leaders such as president Trump also claimed to use chloroquine for COVID-19 prevention [28] . This type of declaration shared with the community could be destructive and nonproductive in regard to public health communication.In our study, azithromycin was used by 1.2% of the sample. Self-medication with antibiotics such as azithromycin could cause harm to the patient and increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance [33] . The low prevalence of the use of azithromycin could be explained by its relatively high cost and by the fact that, in recent years, the Togolese pharmacists' association has insisted that these products be sold only with a prescription, even the necessity of a prescription is not regulated by law.While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are controlled medicines that are sold in pharmacies, this is not the case for vitamin C. In our study, vitamin C was used by approximately one-third (27.6%) of the participants. Several studies have suggested the effectiveness of a high dose of vitamin C in the management of COVID-19 [34, 35] . However, it is also important to note that high doses of vitamin C may cause side effects, most specifically an increased risk of kidney stones [36] .In April 2020, a traditional medicine called Covid-Organics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was promoted in Madagascar [28] . However, the number of cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar quadrupled from 2214 to 10,748 in July 2020 [2, 37] . Several reasons could explain the increase in the number of cases of COVID-19, but this increase raises questions on the effectiveness of Covid-Organics, which has not yet been properly tested in therapeutic trials. Artemisia plant, the main component of Covid-Organics, has shown some beneficial effects in the treatment of malaria but has not been found to be as beneficial as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) [38] . The WHO, fearing the risk of the development of a resistance to ACTs linked to the use of this plant, does not recommend it for the treatment of malaria [38] . Furthermore, no studies have proven the efficacy for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In our study, one out of ten (10.2%) participants declared that they used traditional medicine for COVID-19 prevention. This finding could be explained by the fact that the use of traditional medicine is common in African culture and relatively less expensive than modern medicines [23] , although the composition of these mixtures is usually unknown [23, 39] . In regard to traditional medicine, the WHO welcomes innovations around the world, including repurposing drugs and traditional medicines and developing new therapies in the search for potential treatments for COVID-19 [9] . The WHO is working with research institutions to select traditional medicine products that can be investigated for clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19 treatment [9] .In this study, self-medication was found to be significantly associated with being female, working in the health sector and having a high school education level or higher. There are conflicting data on the relationship between sex and self-medication [40, 41] . Some studies conducted on self-medication reported that female sex was significantly associated with self-medication. A study conducted among undergraduate students of a private university in Nigeria showed that 88.2% of females versus 71.1% of males reported using self-medication [42] . In Spain, the prevalence of self-medication was 16.93% (2715) for women and 14.46% (1469) for men (p< 0.05) in a study about sex differences in self-medication [43] . The reason for the association between female sex and self-medication is not clearly known, but in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, greater anxiety among women, as described in Iran and Italy, cannot be excluded [44, 45] . A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies conducted in Ethiopia showed that healthcare professionals and students were the main practitioners of self-medication [46] . In our study, selfmedication was associated with working in the health sector. Knowledge and access to prescription-only medicines are potential factors of self-medication among health professionals. A lack of time to consult with a doctor and the desire to keep one's health status secret were also mentioned as factors that could explain selfmedication among health care personnel [47] . According to the WHO, approximately 10% of all COVID-19 cases globally are among health workers. In Africa, information on health workers' infections is still limited, but preliminary data show that health worker cases make up more than 5% of cases in 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa alone, and in four of these countries, infections among health workers constitute more than 10% of all infections [48] . The higher risk of infection among health care professionals, their knowledge of drugs and their ease of access to drugs may also explain their higher practice of self-medication [49, 50] .Self-medication has often been associated with a lower education level. A study on knowledge and selfmedication with antibiotics conducted in a Lebanese adult sample reported that self-medication was significantly associated with low education level (p=0.036) [51] . This was not the case for the present study conducted in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Indeed, participants with a high school level or higher were more likely to self-medicate. This finding could be explained by the fact that a good knowledge of diseases is known to be associated with self-medication [52] [53] [54] . The greater access of the educated population to the internet and their ability to understand information about treatment (which is often published in official languages) found on social networks may also explain this trend.Surprisingly, a history of clinical manifestation was not associated with self-medication in our study, which confirmed the finding that self-medication was more likely to be used for the prevention of COVID-19 and not to treat specific clinical manifestations of COVID-19, which are similar to malaria symptoms.This study has some limitations. We did not collect data on the doses of the drugs used and the length of Fig. 1 shows factors associated with self-medication to prevent the infection to SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations, Lomé, Togo in a binary logistic multivariable model. These associations were expressed as adjusted odds ratios. Self-medication was coded as a binary variable (=1 if intake of at least one product and = 0 if not) time they were used. For traditional medicines, the composition of the different traditional products used was not collected. It should also be noted that in the Togolese context, traditional medicines are very often used in combination with modern medicines. Another limitation of this study is that the questionnaire used was developed entirely by our team and had never been used before. Even if the questionnaire had been pretested, biases (primacy effect, order effect, etc.) could not be excluded. Furthermore, the study was based on declarative data, which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of self-medication due to social desirability bias. Finally, according to the characteristics of the surveyed population (people with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection), the extrapolation of these results to the general population should be performed with great caution.This study was the first to assess the prevalence of selfmedication to prevent COVID-19 in Togo. Approximately one-third of people reported ever having performed self-medication. Vitamin C and traditional medicines were the most commonly used products. Health professionals, women and people with a high level of education were the most likely to practice selfmedication. Close collaboration is needed with pharmacists so that they will not sell chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine without a medical prescription. It is also important to fight against misinformation about supposed COVID-19 preventive products on social media with campaigns to improve awareness. Psychology is also important in COVID-19 response strategies, as reducing anxiety and ambient psychosis could reduce the use of dangerous self-medication. Studies in the general population should be conducted to confirm these results.The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12889-020-10145-1.Additional file 1.

As of 16 th May 2020 at 16.13GMT, there were 4,628,879 cases and 308,655 deaths with 1,759,729 recoveries confirmed worldwide (Worldometer, 2020) . The global spread has been rapid, with 213 Countries and Territories around the world now having reported at least one case (Worldometer, 2020) . In Ghana, the first two index cases were recorded on the 12 th March 2020 and by 13 th May of 2020, the total number of cases was 4,120 including 320 recoveries and 18 deaths 1 .National governments have instituted measures in response to the pandemic. Such measures included lockdowns (partial or full) and enhanced safety protocols to control transmission. As part of an integrated intervention, the Government of Ghana adapted a partial lockdown in the two most affected cities, Greater Accra and Greater Kumasi for two weeks, which was extended for a further one week. This was concurrence with individual control measures (social distancing, enhanced contact tracing, handwashing and the use of hand sanitizers, and intensive media education), and government interventions (closure of schools, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health workers, quarantine, self-isolation, hospitalization, and treatment). All the aforementioned interventions have been implemented in Ghana with the aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but no studies to date have evaluated its long term impact on the expected number of cases and deaths to inform policy decision.The global nature of this pandemic with countries at difference levels of the epidemic curves, suggests that the crisis could be long. Clearly, enonomies cannot immediately return to how things were prior to the pandemic. But it is equally clear that the lockdown cannot persist indefinitely, because of its damaging impact on the economy and social life. We need to adapt and minimise the harm it can do, and continue to suppress the spread of the virus while ensuring that children are educated, that businesses can reopen, and that society can function. This will require continuous monitoring of transmission so that remedial measures can be re-instituted should there be a resurgence.Measurement of transmission intensity is important to describe the intensity of the disease outbreak, to assess the impact of public health measures on transmission, to understand epidemiological patterns, and for planning intervention studies. The single most important measure of transmission intensity is the basic 1 https://ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/archive.php.Reproductive number, . The describes the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period. To contain the virus, the must be kept below 1, and this means minimising the risk of spreading the virus at every turn. When is greater than 1, the virus will spread. It is equally important to bring down the number of new cases per day. Lowering the number of new cases per day as much as possible, together with an below 1, will mean fewer cases and reduced harm.The for COVID-19 was recently estimated in the South Korea (Choi, Ki, & Health, 2020) , China and other countries, but limited evidence supports the applicability of outside the region for which the value was estimated (Ridenhour, Kowalik, & Shay, 2018) . Since is a function of effective contact rate, any factor having the potential to influence the contact rate, including individual behavioral changes, other human social behavior, and organization, including population density (e.g., rural vs. urban), social organization (e.g., integrated vs. segregated), as well as the innate biological characteristics of particular pathogens, and seasonality (e.g., wet vs. rainy season for vector-borne infections), will ultimately affect (Delamater, Street, Leslie, Yang, & Jacobsen, 2019) .In this study, we described the epidermic dynamics and estimated the for COVID-19 in an entirely susceptible Ghanaian population using a mathematical model. We provided estimates of the initial basicReproductive number (at the beginning of the outbreak) and the time-dependent Reproductive number at any time during the outbreak using four different estimation procedures: next-generation matrix (Odo Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Roberts, 2010) , exponential growth method (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 2007) , maximum likelihood (White et al., 2009) , and time-dependent Reproductive number method (Wallinga and Teunis (2004) ). We also assessed the effects of individual and government level integrated interventions on cumulative incidence and new cases per day in Ghana.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 2. MethodsThe outbreak data for Ghana were cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths obtained from the Ghana Health Service (GHS). The data from the GHS is a daily time series data of reported COVID-19cases. These dataset do not include individual patient-level information, but aggregate number of total suspected and confirmed cases tested at the two main laboratory facilities at the University of Ghana Although researchers do not fully understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, we formulated the SEIQHRS model ( Figure 1 ) based on the available information and the basic understanding of the biological mechanism through which infection spreads in the population. We partitioned the Ghanaian population into five distinct classes ( =susceptible, =Exposed, =Infectious, =Selfisolation/Quarantined, =Hospitalized, =Recovery). We defined susceptible populations as all uninfected individuals at time but there is the likelihood there may be infected at time + where is the incremental continuous-time point. We included newborn babies from all compartments into the susceptible class since there is not enough evidence on vertical transmission of the virus from the pregnant woman to the unborn baby. After successful transmission of COVID, the susceptible individuals S enter the exposed class where they are infected but not yet infectious to others. They stay in the exposed class before they become infectious and move to the infectious class or identified through contact tracing and quarantined at class . The hospitalized class is the proportion of the population who have been infected but have been identified through contact tracing or self-report to health facilities and hospitalized.We specified three modes of recovery based on the current understanding of the transmission dynamics.First, a fraction of the population who are exposed may recover from the infection without necessarily J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 infecting others and therefore do not transit through the infectious category but enter directly into the recovery class because of boosted immunity. Second, those who become infectious may also recover and move to the recovery class (R) or die from COVID-19. Finally, those in the quarantine-based hospitals and those in self-isolation may also recover and join the recovery class. Individuals who live in Ghana and those arriving from other countries (Ghanaian citizens and non-citizens) who have not yet contracted COVID-19 were classified as susceptible. Thus, the total population size, , is = + + + + + .The experience we gather from the contact tracing being carried out by the Government of Ghana and commentary from some infectious disease experts globally showed that some individuals have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients but were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. We therefore assume that although people might have the infection, they may not instantaneously be infectious to others. As such we have specified and distinguished the exposed or the latent individuals from those who are infectious to others based on the traditional definition of an exposed person in infectious disease modeling. We agreed that there may be some exposed individuals capable of transmitting the infection but their overall impact of the dynamics of infection is assumed to be negligible in this study. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals who recover from viral diseases usually would have either long-life immunity, short term immunity, or in some cases there may be no immunity at all (Keeling & Rohani, 2011 ). Since enough is not known about COVID-19, this study assumed that individuals who recover from COVID-19 may have short term immunity but once the immunity wanes; these individuals will become susceptible to the same or a different viral strain of COVID-19 (Lan et al., 2020) . For the purpose of assessing government intervention, we define the quarantine-based hospitalized class to consists of all exposed and infectious individuals who were identified through contact tracing, isolation, and hospitalization. We further assumed that individuals leave the hospitalize class only after they have fully recovered from COVID-19 or when they suffer from COVID-19 disease-induced death or die naturally. To provide a detailed understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 and the control strategies required to mitigate its spread and relative impact on the Ghanaian population and examine the epidemiology of the infection, we detailed the parameterization of the SEIQHRS model from which useful public health guidance can be generated (Table 1 ). Our SEIQHRS model has eleven parameters: the birth rate ( ), natural death rate ( , rate of transmission from being exposed to becoming infectious within the infectious community ( ). The rate of transmission from the quarantine class is and that of transmission from the hospitalized class is denoted by ! . "" = # $ %×'×( is the time-dependent integrated individual-level intervention and the intensity of media coverage which is parameterized by two non-negative rates ) and * = +, , ,!,-., +, , ,!,-. * is the proportion of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths in the population. ) is the rate of intensity of adherence to prevention guidelines by the individual and media coverage, We assume that the transmission rate also decreases with time as suggested by Chowell, Hengartner, Castillo-Chavez, Fenimore, and Hyman (2004) , and this assumption also seems plausible because of the integrated interventions put out by the Government of Ghana. This assumption is similar to what was reported during the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 where many people began to wear face masks to try to prevent disease spread through contact with airborne particles (Riley et al., 2003) .The parameter, "" ∈ [0, 1] basically models the impact of behavioral change on reducing the effective reproduction number, cumulative number of cases and deaths similar to previous studies that model the impact of behavioral change as a result of intensive media education and increased rate social distancing based on the change in the daily cumulated number of cases and deaths (Shen et al., 2015; Tuncer et al., 2018) . "" = 0 indicates perfect adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols (positive behavioural change) and 5 represents the rate of recovery among the infectious class, 6 is COVID-19 induced death rate, and 7 is the rate of COVID-19 waning immunity (rate of moving from recovered class to the susceptible class). The rate at which an exposed individual recovers without necessarily becoming infectious to others is denoted by 8. The rate at which infectious and exposed individuals are removed from the exposed and infectious classes respectively and quarantine is 9 and : respectively. The community infectious and quarantine classes are hospitalized at a rate of ; and < respectively. The quarantined and hospitalized individuals recover at a rate of = and respectively.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 Furthermore, in determining the effective contact rate and the duration of infectiousness, this study assumed homogenous population mixing and contact patterns where all population members are equally likely to come into contact with one another because of the typical Ghanaian culture, social attributes, and settings. Admittedly, heterogeneous mixing, where there is possible variation in contact patterns among age subgroups, social class, religious affiliations, or geographic regions would have been appropriate but data available to estimate the parameter of interest for these different subgroups of the population would have been near impossible. Furthermore, we assumed that the rate at which susceptible individuals are quarantined is the same as the rate at which susceptible individuals will return to the susceptible class after laboratory results have proved negative. We assumed unstructured populations, that is, we did not account for age or sex structure and therefore assumed a fixed value for the transmission rate using available data from the cumulative number of cases. However, our model can be adopted to include difference sociodemograhic/economic classes, which would require splitting each variable of the model into specific classes if data are available.The following system of differential equations (1.1-1.6) describes the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Ghana. This system of ODEs was solved numerically via the standard Runge-Kutta method using the function ode from the package deSolve (Soetaert, Petzoldt, & Setzer, 2010) . The study only considered constant-valued parameters with the exception of the proportion of the population adhering to the integrated government interventions.Limited data and lack of clear understanding of the etiology of the disease spread place severe restrictions on the attempt to model the dynamics of COVID-19. Nonetheless, this study relied on previous studies and the ongoing discussions from experts at the Ghana Health Service and around the world to initialize the model parameters. The transmission rate in the community was estimated from the observed number of cases using the non-linear least square estimation via Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared error between the observed cumulative number of cases and predicted cumulative cases. Other parameters were carefully chosen to fit our definition of worst-case scenario. The systems of differential equations were analysed using the ""desolve"" package in R (Soetaert et al., 2010) and the estimation of # using the method of maximimum likelihood, time-dependent procedure and the exponential growth methods were done using the "" "" package in (Obadia, Haneef, Boëlle, & making, 2012) . The estimate using the exponential growth and the maximum likelihood methods is dependent on the choice of generation time and therefore sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the how changes with generation time for exponential growth and the maximum likelihood methods.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The rate at which the individual in the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recover classes suffer natural death.

We used the next-generation matrix u proposed by Diekmann, Heesterbeek, and Metz (1990) ; (Diekmann et al., 2010) to estimate the basic reproductive number which is the dominant eigenvalue of u. To compute , we created a sub-model that only considers the 'disease' compartments, a subset of the equations in the SEIQHRS model. The disease compartments are those that include individuals that are in any stage of infection which, for the SEIQHRS model, includes both the exposed, infectious, and quarantine individuals. We only used the latent class as our transmission state of our dynamic models as that was the only state that described the production of new COVID-19 infections and used both the latent, infectious, quarantine and hospitalized classes to represent the transition states; that is changes in the state among , w = "" w c w ‚ w ƒ w i … = † ‡ ‡ − N + 8 + + : N − 9 + 5 + + 6 + ;:− jr + o™ + or + oer + rq + rš š + n + p o + oe + š + j + q ™ + s + š + r −o š + n + p o + oe + š + j + q −• š + n + p › − jrp + ™nq + o™p + orp + oerp + ™qp + rqp + š™q + šrp l + š + j š + n + p ™ + s + š + r o + oe + š + j + q − nq + op + qp + šq l + š + j š + n + p o + oe + š + j + q −p l + š + j š + n + p −The dominant eigenvalue of the Next Generation Matrix u = −vw $c is equal to which we obtained by solving = "" Κ .

We also estimated the effective basic reproductive number , and the generation time using the maximum likelihood-based method proposed by Forsberg White and Pagano (2008) . The generation time is the time lag between infection in a primary case and a secondary case. The estimates were based on readily available daily reported case data. The estimation of R , and the generation time for COVID-19 based on the maximum likelihood is important since the estimate can be obtained in real-time to quantify the impact of government intervention and inform an appropriate public health response to the COVID-19. . We imputed unobserved cases at the beginning of the epidemic to correct for missing data.This study employed the exponential growth method proposed by Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007) The study also estimated time-varying basic reproductive numbers for COVID-19 using the technique proposed by Wallinga and Teunis (2004) . We employed a two-parameter generalized-growth model (GGM) (Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2016) to is È , that is, the cumulative number of cases per unit time (days). We estimated both ) and ‰ using the non-linear least square estimation procedure in Stata 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). This was achieved by fitting the model to cumulative time series data between 12 March 2020 to 7 th April 2020. The estimated parameters of the model were then used to forecast the early growth of the epidemic in Ghana.This study developed and utilized a mathematical model that incorporates intervention strategies for COVID-19. Although there is no vaccine yet for COVID-19, the Government of Ghana and other countries have initiated several interventions to reduce new infections. Our study simulated two modes of interventions. The first is the individual level integrated intervention which includes social distancing, use of face mask, use of hand sanitizers, self-confinement, and use of running water with soap to wash hands.The integrated government interventions include the provision of personal protective equipment, contact tracing, self-isolation based on contact tracing of an index positive case, quarantining, and the intensity of media coverage in selected areas. Key among these interventions in Ghana was partial lockdown placed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f within the Greater Accra and the Greater Kumasi in the Ashanti Region, but we do not study its impact since it was lifted in less than three weeks and also we do not foresee the government re-introducing the lockdown to other parts of the country as it is perceived to be highly unsustainable in the country 4 . The individual and government integrated interventions work instantaneously although the process is complex, capital and labor-intensive, and requires a great deal of commitment. Almost all the interventions focus on the susceptible population and the population of infectives as the interaction between the two subclasses would likely lead to onward transmission of the virus to the larger population. Studies have shown that isolation is effective against any infectious disease even when the etiology of the disease is largely unknown (Keeling & Rohani, 2011) . We model five scenarios of the intervention to examine their likely impact on the dynamics of the epidemic. Specifically, by studying the different scenarios we examine the likely impact of government and individual-level interventions on the worse-case scenario of COVID-19 in Ghana.Scenario 1: First, we modeled the worse-case scenario where we assume that there is no government or individual level interventions and that the individual can only recover from COVID-19 through pure natural process (immune system boosting). We defined this scenario as the normal-life situation.Scenario 2: Second, we modeled the impact of enhanced contact tracing on worst-case scenario 1 and further assume that isolation and treatment centers can transmit the infection to the general public and medical staff at a rate that is one-five of the community transmission rate.Scenario 3: Third, we assessed the impact of enhanced contact tracing on worst-case scenario 1 and further assume that the rate at which isolation and treatment centers will transmit the infection to the general public and medical staff will be reduced by at most 10% (5% reduction from the isolation centers and 5% reduction from hospitals). This is achieved by providing personal protective equipment to frontline line health workers and enforcing strict adherence to isolation protocols to prevent transmission of infection at the centers.Scenario 4: We modeled scenario 3 in addition to effective case management. That is, we introduced a gradual increase in the rate of recovery among the quarantine and hospitalized classes.Scenario 5: We modeled scenario 4 in addition to improved individual level interventions-social distancing, use of hand sanitizers, use of face mask, washing hands with running water with soap, and avoidance of social gathering and intensive media coverage.As of May 13 th , 2020, Ghana had a total of 5,530 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 674 recoveries and a total of 24 COVID-19 related deaths resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.43%. The Greater Accra region is currently the epicenter with 4,204 confirmed cases. The highest daily number of new cases recorded is 367. The Regional distribution of cases can be found at the official Ghana Health Service website (https://ghanahealthservice.org/covid19/).The generalized growth model (GGM) (Chowell, Sattenspiel, Bansal, & Viboud, 2016) which is characterized by the initial growth rate ), the deceleration parameter ‰ were jointly estimated using Table 2 below. Note: For the TD method, daily estimates were averaged over the first 38 days and confidence interval was obtained using 1000 bootstrap simulations. The Bias corrected Maximum Likelihood (ML) method corrects the bias in the Reproductive number estimate occurring in method ML when the epidemic curve is not observed from the first case on (Obadia et al., 2012) . The confidence limit of the next generation matrix was obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.This study varied the generation time between 4-14 days with a standard deviation of 1 day. The graph of the basic Reproductive number versus mean generation time in days showed that the Ro estimates increases with increasing mean generation time for both ML and EG as expected (Nishiura, Castillo-Chavez, Safan, & Chowell, 2009) (Figure 4) . To obtain a correct estimate of the average generation time and to make data-driven policy decisions, there is the urgent need for more data on generation time (Peak et al., 2020) . Five different scenarios were studied to understand the trajectory of the epidemic. We forecast a range of possible future scenarios by assessing the impact of various individual and integrated government interventions. This section presents the results of the different intervention scenarios and the expected impact on COVID-19 deaths and total cumulative cases.Scenario 1: It represents the worse case scenario. We defined the worst-case scenario as the socialcultural and political life of the individual and the country at large before the first two index cases of COVID-19 were reported in Ghana. That is before the 12 th of March 2020, there were no government and individual-level interventions to address COVID-19. Had the situation remained the same, we explore what would have been the total number of expected cases and deaths assuming that the epidemic lasted ayear-long (12 th March 2021). The worse case scenario assumes that because of the immune system, some Figure 5 ). Figure 6 ). Figure 9 ). 3. Impact of enhanced contact tracing on worst-case scenario 1 and further assume that the rate at which isolation and treatment centers will transmit the infection to the general public and medical staff will be reduced by 10% (5% reduction from the isolation centers and 5% reduction from hospitals). This is achieved by providing PPEs to frontline line health workers and enforcing strict adherence to isolation protocols to prevent transmission of infection at the centers. The results in Table 3 were obtained from using parameter estimates from Table 1 .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe main focus of the study is to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Ghana using mathematical models that incorporate waning immunity to COVID-19, naural birth and death rates, integrated individual and government interventions and the fact that an exposed person may recover without necessarily been infectious to other due to boosted immunity. The proposed model allow for possible tramsmission of infection from quarantine, isolation and treatment centers similar to what was reported by (Giordano et al., 2020) . Our model further assume that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 may become susceptible again which is in sharp contrast to (Giordano et al., 2020) . We Previous studies have used mathematical models to study the dynamics of COVID-19 (Giordano et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Munayco et al., 2020; Roosa et al., 2020) The effectiveness of these integrated interventions as found in this study have been reported elsewhere (Prem et al., 2020) . We have shown in this study that separate interventions could reduce the burden of COVID-19 but it was evident that we need both the government and the individual level interventions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 to the barest minimum.Although Authors declare no competing interests.","Ghana","abstract","2021-01-22",1

Infection of COVID-19 could present with a wide spectrum of symptoms inform of fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, kidney failure and possible fatality (WHO 2020; Linton et al. 2020 ). As of August 5, 2020, data from WHO have shown over 18, 354, 342 confirmed cases and 696,147 deaths have been reported globally (WHO 2020) . Due to rapid spread of the disease, many countries implemented different mitigation and suppression programmes. Different combinations of measures such as closure of international boarders, partial/total lockdown of a country or a city, ban on social gatherings, frequent hand washing with soap under running water, physical distancing, quarantine and isolation were introduced as immediate response to the outbreak. Testing, contact tracing and treatment, compulsory wearing of face masks in public spaces were additional measures subsequently or simultaneously introduced.Ghana reported its first two confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 12, 2020 (GHS 2020), since then, the number of cases in Ghana has been on the increased. An initial slow exponential growth during the partial lockdown of Greater Accra and Ashanti regions has been followed by a more rapid growth in cases following the lifting of some suppression and control measures. As of August 5, 2020, data from Ghana Health Service (GHS) shows 39,075 confirmed cases and 199 deaths recorded across the 16 administrative regions of Ghana (GHS 2020).Due to threat posed to human and socio-economic wellbeing by COVID-19, different studies have been conducted to model the spread and understand the contribution of potential drivers for the development and implementation of evidence-based public health and disease control policies. One of the potential predictors of COVID-19 infection that has received much attention in recent times is weather (climate). For instance, D' Amato, Cecchi (D' Amato et al. 2014) argue that respiratory disease such as SARS can be predicted by certain weather conditions. In a recent study Prata, Rodrigues (Prata et al. 2020) , the relationship between weather and COVID-19 cases in Brazil was investigated using GAM. The study established a negative relationship between temperature and the spread of COVID-19. A study by Ahmadi, Sharifi (Ahmadi et al. 2020 ) also established that humidity and wind speed have negative relationship with the infection rate of COVID-19 in Iran.A significant relationship between weather and the spread of COVID-19 has been established in existing literature. However, most of such studies have been conducted in America (Bashir et al. 2020; Runkle et al. 2020) , Europe (Menebo 2020; Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca 2020), Asia (Liu et al. 2020; Ahmadi et al. 2020 ) and Australia (Ward et al. 2020 ) and limited information exist on the African continent which has been predicted as the next epicenter for COVID-19. The rapid spread of the disease poses a serious burden due to its weak healthcare systems characterizing most African countries, especially the sub-Saharan African countries. Although, knowledge from studies conducted in other continents could be used as a basis for policy formulation in general, country-specific studies may be required due to variations observed in the spread of COVID-19 as well as the weather characteristics among different countries. This study seeks to contribute to the knowledge on the effect of weather on the spread of COVID-19 infection in Ghana. The findings from could be helpful in assisting public health professionals to develop control measures.The study covers all the 16 major administrative regions of Ghana. Ghana is in the sub-region of West Africa located between latitude 7.9465° N and 1.0232° W. The country has total land area of 239,567 km 2 with an estimated population of 30,280,482 (GSS 2020). The territorial border of Ghana from the southern part is bounded by the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean. The climatic condition of Ghana is tropical with average daily temperature ranging from 30 °C during the day to 24 °C at night (UNDP 2020).The data used in this study consist of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19, daily average temperature (°C), daily average relative humidity (%), daily average wind speed (km/h) and daily average atmospheric pressure (hpa). Since Greater Accra region is the epicenter of COVID-19 in Ghana, the weather data of Greater Accra was used as proxy for the averages of weather variables in Ghana. The data spanned the period from March 12 to July 31, 2020. The starting date of the data corresponds to the day the first COVID-19 confirmed cases were identified. The daily new cases of COVID-19 data were extracted from GHS (GHS 2020) and the weather data were extracted from Weatherbase (2020). For each variable there were 115 observations.In this study, the effect of weather on daily new cases of COVID-19 was determined using GAM, semi-parametric extension of generalized linear model (GLM) to account for a nonlinear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of covariates. The choice of the model is influenced by the nonlinear relationship that is believed to exist between weather and infectious diseases (Prata et al. 2020; Colón-González et al. 2013) .Let y i represents the new cases of COVID-19 for day i and E(y i ) = µ i represents the expected number of cases, then the GAM is defined by Wood (2017) as: where g(.) is a log link function of the expectation µ i , X * i is a row of the model matrix for any strictly parametric model component, θ represent the corresponding parameter vector, x ij (j = 1, 2, . . . , m) is the covariates (weather variables), and f j are smoothing functions. The estimate of the smoothing functions f can be represented in a regression spline form with known basis functions. Let b k (x) represents the k th such basis function, then f can be expressed as a linear model defined as:where β k represents an unknown smoothing parameter, which is to be estimated. The structure of the smooth function was estimated based on basis function from the Gaussian process model (Kammann and Wand et al. Bull Natl Res Cent (2021 ) 45:20 2003 . This type of basis function was selected in order to account for potential temporal autocorrelation in the residuals of the model. The smoothing parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Within the GAM framework several families of distributions may be assumed for the error structure depending on the nature of the response variable. In this study, a Poisson distribution was assumed for the error structure. The inclusion of the variables and the selection of the final model were based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). All the analysis ware conducted using R version 4.0.2 (Team 2020).The plot of new COVID-19 cases reported in Ghana for the study period depicts an increasing trend (Fig. 1) . The highest peak of new cases of 1513 was observed on July 30, 2020. The characteristics of the COVID-19 new cases and the weather variables used in this study are summarised in Table 1 . An average of 329 new cases of COVID-19 with a standard deviation of 286 was observed during the study period (Table 1 ). The summary also shows that the distribution of the observed new cases of COVID-19 is positively skewed. The daily average temperature observed during the study period ranged between 24.9 and 29.7 °C.In addition, the average humidity observed varied between 72.5 and 85.2% whilst average wind speed varied between 10.1 km/h and 19.8 km/h. On average the pressure observed for any given day was 1013hpa. The average temperature showed a decreasing pattern whilst humidity showed an increasing pattern during the study period (Fig. 2) . During the study period, the wind speed decreased from March to June and increased afterwards whilst the average atmospheric pressure showed an increasing pattern over the period.The effect of weather on COVID-19 infections was explored using generalized additive model with the error structure assumed to be Poisson distribution. The estimated parameters of the parametric and smoothing function terms are presented in Table 2 . The estimated non-linear curves derived from the model are shown in Fig. 3 . From the estimated model, average wind speed and average atmospheric pressure were found to be linearly related to the daily new cases of COVID-19 whilst the average temperature and average relative humidity have a non-linear relationship with daily new cases of COVID-19. All the variables were found to be significantly related to the daily new cases of COVID-19 at 5% level.The developed model suggests that there exists a positive linear relationship between wind speed and the spread of COVID-19. That is, the risk of spread of COVID-19 significantly increase for 1 km/h increase in wind speed. This result might be because high wind speed is likely to circulate any suspended respiratory droplet in the air thereby increasing the possibility of inhalation by people who are exposed to such environment. This result supports the existing findings (Şahin 2020 ) that the virus spread increase when there is high wind speed. There are however some studies which reported no significant relationship (Menebo 2020) and negative relationship (Ahmadi et al. 2020; Rosario et al. 2020) between wind speed and the spread of COVID-19. This difference et al. Bull Natl Res Cent (2021) 45:20 seems to reflect the nature of the local environment and the context where those studies were conducted. The results also revealed that atmospheric pressure is positively related to the spread of COVID-19. That is, the risk of spread of COVID-19 is more likely to increase for a 1 hpa increase in atmospheric pressure (Table 1 ) and the result confirms the findings of existing study in China . The positive relationship between atmospheric pressure and the spread of COVID-19 may be explained by the fact that areas with high pressure are moistier compared to low pressure areas thereby making pathogens more active and invasive to humans.With respect to average temperature, the results confirm that there exists a non-linear relationship between temperature and the spread of COVID-19 (Fig. 2) . That is, the spread of COVID-19 is at more risk when the temperature fluctuates between 24 and 29 °C. However, the risk sharply decreases when average temperature exceeds 29 °C. This results is in agreement with a number of studies (Liu et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020 ) that concluded that warm temperature tends to decrease infection rate of COVID-19. The direction of the results may be influenced by the fact that the survival pattern of the virus and its transmission routes such as respiratory droplets may be influenced by temperature. That is, high temperature is likely to reduce the activeness of the virus and their biological interaction with humans as observed in other respiratory coronavirus studies (Casanova et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2007; Gardner et al. 2019) . Another study (Menebo 2020 ) also found contradicting results on the effect of temperature on the spread of COVID-19. Possible explanation according to Menebo (2020) is due to the fact that people are likely to stay at home during cold weather than when the sun is shining thereby reducing person-to-person contact which is one of the major route of spreading the virus.With respect to humidity, the results show that it has a non-linear relationship with the spread of COVID-19. The risk of spread of COVID-19 significantly decreases for humidity between 72 and 76% and remain leveled afterwards. This result may be influenced by the fact that the survival pattern of the virus is motivated in contaminated areas with low relative humidity (Ahmadi et al. 2020). The results also confirms a study by Liu et al. (2020) who argued that low humidity favours the risk of transmission of COVID-19.This study provides important information regarding the effect of weather on the spread of COVID-19 in Ghana. The results of this study show that weather components such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure significantly influences the spread of COVID-19 infections in the Country. The results indicate that wind speed and pressure have a positive linear relationship with the risk of spread of COVID-19 whilst temperature and humidity have a non-linear relationship with the spread of COVID-19.The study has some limitations, which need to be considered when interpreting the findings. For instance, the risk of spread of infections may be influenced by government interventions such as partial lockdowns of some selected cities in Ghana. Other variables such as socio-demographical characteristics were also in not considered. ","Ghana","abstract","2021-01-12",1

The number of people who tested positive reached 2,397,217 in several countries, which also recorded 162,956 deaths as of April 21, 2020 (Who 2020) . In China, COVID-19 spread rapidly since its first appearance in Wuhan and has proven to be very dangerous because some affected patients do not have fever and other symptoms, which complicates the diagnosis (Guan et al. 2020) . The report of the National Health Commission of China indicated on January 27, 2020, that people with the virus can infect others through respiratory droplets and also through direct contact (Fan et al. 2020) . The severity of the disease is summed up in the ability of the virus to spread and the difficulties in identifying those affected to manage them and prevent them from infecting others (Munster et al. 2020) . Faced with this situation, the Chinese government reacted quickly by quarantining a population estimated at 50 million people, with total closure imposed on Wuhan on January 23, 2020, in order to establish a total social distancing, which forced citizens to stay at home to protect them from the virus , and to prevent the spread of the epidemic to other parts of China. The consequences of the total confinement of the population certainly has effects on the economies of countries and on the mental health of people, as well as their habits and mobility. Psychological effects are increased, and fear seems an almost certain consequence because of this way of life, and anxiety was expected in Wuhan and could increase each time death increased and information on new cases circulated . It has been found that the international response to COVID-19 is more transparent and effective compared to the SARS epidemic (Sohrabi et al. 2020 ), which will allow countries to build on actions already taken.Algeria, a country very close to Europe and located in northern Africa, has been affected by the pandemic. Its first recorded case dates from February 25, 2020. Table 1 shows the evolution of the number of infected people reached 2811, according to the monitoring cell of the Algerian Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform (MSPRH), which a l s o r e c o r d e d 3 9 2 d e a t h s o n A p r i l 2 1 , 2 0 2 0 (MSPRH 2020a) . This pandemic has shown the lack of preparation of several European countries and the slow nature of decision-making processes (Bailly 2020) .This situation was also noted in countries of Africa, including in Algeria, which took a rather late decision to isolate the region of Blida-the most affected at the beginning of the epidemic-thus facilitating the spread of the virus (Madani 2020) . Subsequently, other decisions were taken by the Algerian government, also within the framework of social distancing. The Algerian population thus found themselves in a new way of life imposed by total or partial confinement. This social distancing certainly has influenced several aspects, including the mental health of patients, healthy people, and medical personnel. It has been shown in previous research, for instance, that when dealing with the psychosocial effects of the Ebola epidemic (Van Bortel et al. 2016) , the magnitude of the psychosocial effects on individuals and society even at the international level became apparent during the onset of the epidemic. In Algeria, from March 23, 2020, for more than a month, the population lived in partial or total confinement, which lengthened further and revealed questions linked to the nature of the correlation between age, the social impact, and mobility during the first 3 weeks of confinement in Algeria, as well as the impact of confinement on society, daily life, and the mobility of citizens.We also want to answer questions about the difference in social impact of COVID-19 according to the gender variable and the impact of this virus on mobility according to the same variable. We will also shed light on the impact of confinement on the social aspect and that of mobility according to the family situation. The application of confinement is considered essential, but can cause a slowdown in life and sometimes blockages that can lead to significant psychological and psychiatric disorders marked by depression, panic disorders, and behavioral disorders (Sood 2020) as well as disruptions in mobility and in reactions within society.Currently, there is no detailed information on the impact of total and partial confinement, during this period of the COVID-19 epidemic, on the Algerian population from the point of view of social impact and mobility. Our study was launched after only 3 days of the establishment of this method of disease containment in Algeria. The study's objectives are to discover the impact of confinement on society and mobility in Algeria and to study the nature of the correlation between the elderly, social impact, and mobility during the first confinement linked to COVID-19. The design of a questionnaire to measure the impact of confinement on society and mobility as well as the identification of the main social factors and mobility during this confinement with regard to gender and family situation are also part of the objectives of this study, which will be able to help the Algerian authorities and possibly other countries to take adequate measures to better take care of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Containment procedures involving partial or total confinement were approved by the Algerian state on March 23, 2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The social impacts encompass the various social effects of confinement in Algeria on the social interactions of daily life, including on the impact of mobility, which represents the totality of the behaviors of road users and all road interactions, both measured in the current study by the sum of the responses from the questionnaire according to the respondents in the sample.The present study is limited by its subject, which was to study mobility and the social impact of confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria using a questionnaire to measure these factors. This study is also limited by its actual sample of questionnaire respondents, and the short duration of the study from March 23 to April 12, 2020, imposed by the exceptional nature of this confinement and this epiedemic. A transversal survey plan is used to study the social and mobility impacts during the COVID-19 epidemic on citizens in Algeria. Thus, the descriptive method was used in this study because it corresponds with the nature of the study related to these kinds of impacts of the pandemic. We adopted a crosssectional survey to assess the immediate social and mobility impact on the public during the COVID-19 epidemic using an online questionnaire that was widely disseminated with the help of university students, and our sampling strategy based on the snowball method is suitable in exceptional cases where it is difficult to communicate with the population to study an urgent health problem related to confinement. Therefore, the sample of the current study is made up of 678 Algerian internet users, who lived in Algeria during the first confinement of the coronavirus disease This means that the average score for the questionnaire items is (3); therefore, a total score greater than three indicates a negative impact on this variable, and when it is less than 3, it means that there has not been a negative impact within the meaning of this element. The questionnaire was designed online to facilitate its dissemination and immediately obtain the respondents' answers. The social impact contains (12) elements, meaning that the total score varies from 60 to 12 with a theoretical average of 36, and it also means that a score exceeding 36 reflects a considerable effect on the social factor. In addition, the dimension of the impact of mobility contains (07) items, meaning that the total score varies from 07 to 35 with a theoretical average of 21, and it also means that a score exceeding 21 reflects a considerable effect on factor mobility.To ensure that the coronavirus confinement impact questionnaire regarding COVID-19 would likely produce the same results for all recurrent measures, whether within the same or a similar population, reliability testing is essential. Thus, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient of dimensions-social impact (0.799) and mobility impact (0.613)-to ensure that the questionnaire will produce stable and reliable results. In addition, the internal validity of the questionnaire was confirmed, with all the correlation coefficients between the items and the score of the corresponding dimension being positive and statistically significant. This increases confidence in the results of the questionnaire. Data were entered into the computer using SPSS 22 software. Results are presented in tables, and data were collected using descriptive statistics, including frequencies, relative weights, means, and deviations that were calculated to summarize the responses to the items in the questionnaire on social impact and mobility during the confinement because of COVID-19. In addition, the questions in our study were analyzed by applying several statistical equations such as the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the relationship between age and social impact and mobility. In addition, the T-test was used for the independent sample to study social impact and mobility related to coronavirus confinement by gender and family situation.The correlation between age and social and mobility impact during the first confinement of the epidemic Table 2 shows the presence of a statistically significant positive correlation between the social effects variable and the effects on mobility and transport (r = 0.229), with an error level equal to (0.01), and this result means that road interactions and mobility are only part of the social interactions in daily life. The social impact of the confinement because of the COVID-19 epidemic on the daily life of Algerian citizensThe results in Table 3 indicate that the item related to the avoidance of family visits is ranked first with a relative weight of 92.40% and an M = 4.62. This result is explained by a strong social awareness that direct social communication should be avoided due to the nature of transmission of COVID-19 infection. The refusal to attend funerals has a relative weight of 85.60% and M = 4.28, which also shows the awareness of the danger of traveling for the funeral, especially if they occur due to a coronavirus infection. Family dialogue ranks third with a relative weight of 82.00% and M = 4.10. This means that the Algerian family had a high rate of dialogue during the confinement period, and this is justified by the significant interaction of family members during the day.In fourth place, we find the use of smartphones as the best way to pass the time during the period of confinement with a relative weight of 78.00% and M = 3.90. This indicates that people prefer the use of smartphones that contain programs and applications allowing remote social communication and offer the possibility of watching various videos and news according to the wishes of the individual, as a way to spend time. We find in fifth place the diet is beneficial during the confinement period with a relative weight of 75.80% and M = 3.79. Admittedly, dieting is a necessity, according to the members of the sample, because movements and activities outside are almost stopped due to home confinement. Control of children during confinement, according to the results in Table 3 , are at a relative weight of 73.00% and M = 3.65. This means that families complained about the difficulty of controlling the children and organizing interactions inside the house, especially with the children's usual desire to move. In the seventh row, we find the ease of buying what is necessary for daily life, with a relative weight of 70.40% and M = 3.52. This means that there is a person in charge of shopping on a regular basis, which makes it easier to comply with home confinement instructions. The practice of sports at home in confinement is in eighth place with a relative weight of 68.20% and M = 3.41. This indicates that the study sample prefers to participate in sports activities in the home during the confinement period because of movement restrictions. In ninth place, we find the difficulty of organizing fun games for children at home during the confinement period, with a relative weight of 67.80% and M = 3.39. Admittedly, the organization of renewable and changing games throughout the day and during the days of confinement is an important challenge for parents, and this is what makes them live under pressure because of their desire to put in place a comfortable family climate for their children. In addition, communication with family members according to the instructions for the preventive distance has a relative weight of 65.20% and M = 3.26. This indicates compliance with the instructions to prevent coronavirus, even with family members, especially those who go out frequently, because they can infect family members. The item of difficulty in staying at home is in the eleventh position with a relative weight of 65.00% and M = 3.25. Admittedly, there is confirmation of the slight difficulty in respecting home confinement, but the seriousness of the coronavirus requires caution and staying at home. In last position, we find the effects of the limited space in the house during the confinement period, with a relative weight of 61.00% and M = 3.05; therefore, the limited space of the house negatively affects the commitment to home confinement, especially for large families.The impact of mobility on Algerian citizens during the confinement because of the COVID-19 epidemicThe results in Table 4 show that the item related to compliance with the ban on movement at night during confinement is ranked first with a relative weight of 86.60% and M = 4.33. This result is explained by a significant commitment not to move at night among the members of the study sample; and using the procedures of confinement at home. In second position is the movement on foot during the confinement period with a relative weight of 65.60% and M = 3.28. Thus, many people prefer to walk for a short time to buy products and go home. In third place, there is the availability of individual means of transport during confinement with a relative weight of (61.20%) and (M = 3.06), since during the confinement period, it is permissible to use means of individual transport. The ease of moving during the confinement period with a relative weight of 58.60% and M = 2.93 is placed in fourth position. This shows the difficulty of movement due to strict control of the movements of the citizens to make them aware of the need to respect containment procedures during the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 in order to protect themselves.In terms of preferring to use a bike to move around during confinement, this item is placed in fifth place with a relative weight of 53.60% and M = 2.68. This result reflects the reduced use of bicycles when traveling, which also applies to the normal situation due to the lack of a road strategy to develop a safe environment for cyclists. We find in the seventh position, the availability of the minimum transport service during the confinement period with a relative weight of 49.80% and M = 2.4 because all public transport was stopped for fear that it would intensify the spread of the coronavirus. In the last position, we find the displacement for the purchase of the necessary things during confinement with a relative weight of 49.20% and M = 2.46. This indicates the ease of purchasing various needed supplies without having to travel extensively, which helps to keep confinement in check. The difference in the social impact of COVID-19 according to the gender variableIn order to answer this research question, we needed to compare the male/female means in the social impact variable, and then use an independent T-test to compare the means between men and women in the sample. The data in Table 5 indicate that there is no significant difference in the mean scores of the social impact of confinement during the coronavirus disease epidemic in Algeria between men (M = 44.3443) and women (M = 44.0330). However, when analyzing the differences in the items of this dimension, the T-test for the independent sample revealed certain significant differences as follows: The difference in the mobility impact because of COVID-19 according to the gender variableIn order to answer this research question, we compared the mean men/women responses regarding the mobility impact variable, and then an independent T-test was used to compare the means between men and women in the sample. Table 6 shows the significant differences in the mean scores regarding the impact of mobility during the confinement of COVID-19 in Algeria between men and women, and the T-test for the independent sample revealed that:-The ease of moving during the period of confinement between men (M = 3.11) and women (M = 2.6) is more significant in favor of men. This result reflects the tendency of men to move to buy goods for daily needs to preserve their families. -The results regarding moving to buy the necessary things during confinement between men (M = 2.63) and women (M = 2.21) confirm the above that men are usually responsible for frequent trips outside the house for supplies. -The use of bicycles for movement during confinement between men (M = 2.78) and women (M = 2.53) clearly shows that movement by bicycle remains limited to men in this society due to social traditions. -The movement on foot during the period of confinement between men (M = 3.39) and women (M = 3.13) highlights that men often leave the house, and they prefer to travel by foot more than women. -The results regarding compliance with the ban on movement at night during confinement between men (M = 4.22) and women (M = 4.48) show that women are more respectful of the instructions not to move at night than men. Certainly, the women's movement generally decreases at night, and in addition, they are respectful of laws and regulations.Indeed, the results showed significant differences in the mobility impact between men (M = 21.6370) and women (M = 20.6264) in favor of men.The difference in social impact and mobility regarding COVID-19 according to the family situation (single, married)According to the results presented in Table 7 , there is no significant difference in the mean scores of social impact and mobility during the confinement because of COVID-19 in Algeria between the unmarried and the married; the T-test for the independent sample revealed that single and married people are affected at the same levels due to the confinement implemented because of COVID-19 in Algeria.The results of the study of the social impact and mobility of total and partial confinement due to COVID-19 in Algeria, during the first 3 weeks (from March 23 to April 12, 2020), show the existence of a positive and statistically significant correlation between the variable of social effects and the effects on mobility and transport (r = 0.229) with an error level equal to (0.01). This means that road interactions and mobility are only part of the social interactions linked to everyday life. The need to travel is often present among the population for various reasons.In terms of social impact, the results suggest that 95.1% of respondents avoid family visits to limit the risk of infection, knowing that the confinement measure shows that the authorities consider the situation serious and is likely to worsen , and they are convinced that distancing is the means of prevention and that people carrying the virus can infect others by respiratory droplets as well as by direct contact (Fan et al. 2020) . We find that 80.50% of respondents avoid attending funerals as long as they know the risks of gatherings and also because of the bans imposed by the authorities. In addition, it is known that China managed to contain the spread of the disease for 2 months by total confinement (Verity et al. 2020) .During these first 3 weeks of confinement, 85.5% of respondents say that they spend a considerable amount of time talking to each other as a family. In contrast, 72.9% of respondents find smartphones as the best way to pass the time and as well communicate with family and friends because it is essential during confinements and quarantines (Brooks et al. 2020) .Of respondents, 66.6% find the diet during the confinement period beneficial. Controlling children during this period is considered difficult by 60.7% of respondents, especially because people are used to placing their children in daycare centers, which are closed during this confinement. In addition, 46% of respondents say that it is difficult to organize fun games for children, which further complicates daily life for this part of the sample.Of respondents, 63.3% find it easy to buy the goods necessary for daily life because containment measures allow certain types of commerce to open in different places in cities.Of respondents, 57% say that they play sports during this first period of confinement. The latter are aware that sporting activity is important for staying in good physical and mental health, since it has been shown in previous research, such as that on the psychosocial effects of the Ebola epidemic, that the magnitude of the psychosocial effects on individuals and society appears even at the international level when an epidemic appears (Van Bortel et al. 2016) . For communication with family members, we find that 47.9% of respondents follow the instructions of the preventive distance, which indicates that this category of the population is aware of why it is necessary. Among the respondents, 52.3% find it difficult to stay at home; this seems logical since the 3 weeks of confinement cause negative effects on individuals because confinement causes a slowdown in life and sometimes blockages, which can lead to psychological disturbances. Symptoms are marked by depression, panic, and behavioral disorders (Sood 2020) .The results on the impact of confinement on mobility showed that 87.2% of respondents respect the ban on moving at night, while only 6.5% of respondents do not comply with this ban. This is linked to the new regulatory texts that introduce this kind of night outing as well as the guidelines taken to minimize human contact to protect the population in many countries (Vellingiri et al. 2020) .It is reported that 55.9% of respondents prefer to travel on foot during outings for purchases during the confinement period. This mode of travel is linked to the presence of shops near residents and the desire to make walking a means of physical activity. In addition, avoiding crowded transportation grants more prevention because it is always difficult to fight against this disease of unknown origin and mysterious biological characteristics (Xie and Chen 2020) .Among the other 45.9% of respondents who find that individual means of transport are available during confinement, it is found that many people outside the city center take their means of personal transport and carry people with them by car. The results show, among other things, that 38.3% of respondents find it easy to move during total and partial confinement. For the use of a bicycle, the results show that 20.2% of respondents opt for this mode of travel. This is linked to the absence of cycle paths and a strategy to encourage the use of bicycles in Algeria.Note that 20.6% of those surveyed find transport available because they either use their own means or travel with their friends and neighbors who have individual means of transport. It is also noted that the officials of certain services have means of transport to ensure the movement of their staff. In addition, 16.7% of respondents travel often to buy the necessary products during confinement. This category of people either lives on the outskirts of cities or searches for low-cost products, which pushes them to do a considerable amount of shopping while on the move.For the difference in the social impact of COVID-19 according to the gender variable, the results show that there is no significant difference in the average social impact of confinement in Algeria between men (X ̅= 44.3443) and women (X ̅= 44.0330). However, the analysis of the differences according to the items through the T-test reveals some significant differences, as mentioned in Table 5 .The results showed significant differences in the impact of mobility between men (X ̅ = 21.6370) and women (X ̅ = 20.6264) in favor of men, who spend a considerable amount of their time outside the home. We also note that single and married people are affected at the same levels by the effects of social impact and mobility during this first COVID-19 confinement, which can be explained by the nature of the life of families in Algeria.The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect people in many countries. This study aimed to quickly assess, in Algeria, the impact of total and partial confinement on the social aspects and that of mobility during a period of 3 weeks (March 23 to April 12, 2020) using an online questionnaire.The results showed that road interactions and mobility are only part of the social interactions linked to daily life, since the need to move is often present for different reasons among the population. This study showed significant impacts on the social aspect linked to travel, family relationships, and sports activities. Also, there are significant impacts on the mobility of people, particularly on individual means and modes of travel as well as the facilities of mobility during this period of confinement. The data showed the absence of a significant difference between men and women for the social impact of confinement as a whole; however, some differences are visible for certain items.A significant difference in the impact of mobility between men and women is observed in favor of men. Among other things, single and married people are affected at the same levels by social impact and mobility. The results of this study are not to be generalized over the entire Algerian population, but can help the authorities to mitigate the impacts of confinement on the population through actions to remotely help families to better take care of their children at home.For mobility, it is important to encourage the use of bicycles by creating secure temporary cycle paths because the bicycle guarantees a protective distance. The media should also encourage people who are confined to participate in adapted physical activities at home in order to stay healthy during confinement, since only 57% of the population surveyed takes part in sports.The current study can be developed to study the effects of confinement on quality of life and relate them to risk behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.Contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

By January 11, 2020, the etiologic agent was identified as SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical syndrome was named COVID-19 [2, 3] . Two months later, on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic that had already reached 114 countries, affecting 118,000 people and causing 4291 deaths [4] . On February 14, 2020, the first African case was reported in Egypt. By April 2020, COVID-19 had already affected 10,000 people in 52 African countries [5] . Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, asked then for ""a decentralized response, which is tailored to the local context"".Since then, Sub-Saharan countries have struggled to respond to the pandemic, taking into account the particularities of their context [6] . On the one hand, the following factors may be considered positive and may have worked in their favor: A lower risk of importation and transmission due to a lower flow of transport and trade [7] ; a younger demographic distribution [8] , which is associated with lower mortality rates [9] ; the experience accumulated from other recent epidemic outbreaks [10] ; and other less obvious factors such as specific genetic variations and the continent's climatic characteristics [11] . On the other hand, many other factors suggested greater vulnerability in African countries, namely: Packed unregulated urban areas along with cultural practices that value social cohesion and social gatherings [6, 12] ; higher levels of respiratory diseases [13] ; concomitance with immunocompromising conditions such as AIDS, diabetes or malnutrition [14] ; weak healthcare structures that are too dependent on private or external financing [15] ; low human resources capacity, lack of critical equipment and vulnerable supply chains [16] ; and other factors such as weak public administration, infrastructure patchiness, political instability and armed conflicts, less educated populations who are more permeable to potentially harmful misinformation, among others [12] .Given these particularities, it seems necessary to carry out tailored actions that consider the specific context of different countries [17] . In this regard, an evaluation of the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding COVID-19 has proven useful to identify the most vulnerable communities to which health promoters should pay special attention [18] .To the best of our knowledge, no study of COVID-19 related KAPs has been conducted in the Republic of Chad. With an estimated population of 16 million [19] , Chad is among the most vulnerable countries when it comes to coping with COVID-19 [11] . It has an understaffed, fragmented, and uncoordinated health system [20] . The country is characterized by a high rate of poverty and mortality, a high burden of infectious diseases, insufficient epidemiological surveillance and underdeveloped infrastructure [21] . Like other countries in the region, Chad declared a state of health emergency and adopted public health measures that included the mandatory use of masks, contact tracing, self-isolation or quarantine, closures of worship spaces, the prohibition of gatherings of more than 50 people, closures of airports and public transport limitations. Authorities also made public health recommendations, such as hand washing, breathing practices, and social distancing, while preparing the health systems for specific diagnoses and treatments [22, 23] .By December 11, 2020, Chad counted 1,655 confirmed cases and 102 deaths [24] . These relatively low figures need to be interpreted in the light of a low testing capacity and a fatality rate that goes over 6.1% [25] . Additionally, one must consider the social and economic impact, along with other long-standing health issues such as malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as from recent outbreaks of measles and Chikungunya that have affected the country [26] .In this study, we focused on the KAPs regarding COVID-19 specifically in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad. Our goal was to identify vulnerable social groups so as to inform policy makers in Chad, and thus contribute to the design of health strategies that consider population-specific needs.This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey using a convenience sampling technique. A structured questionnaire and the consent form given to respondents were designed by a group of health professionals at the University Hospital Complex ""Le Bon Samaritain"", N'Djamena. The study was conducted through May and August 2020, a period in which the government of Chad had recently implemented numerous social distancing policies in efforts to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [22] .The study population included individuals from N'Djamena who understood French, were 18 or older, and could provide informed consent. Participation in this study was anonymous, consensual and voluntary, for which informed consent was provided by all prospective respondents.The survey instrument used in this study was designed according to the recommendations for awareness and prevention of COVID-19 described by WHO guidelines [27] . The questionnaire was drafted and validated by a group of health professionals before being used in the study. Health experts were asked to assess the instrument and make suggestions regarding the accuracy of the test in evaluating KAPs relative to COVID-19, as well as the appropriateness of the questions based on the study population. In a pilot study, the questionnaire was administered by 10 health professionals to a sample of 18 people. Their opinions were used in reshaping the questionnaire into an easier and simpler instrument.The final questionnaire designed for this study contained questions assessing socio-demographics, sources of information, as well as general knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding COVID-19. Sociodemographic variables included age, gender, marital status, level of education, occupation and work situation. Occupation was analyzed independently, and was transformed into a dichotomous variable (precarious job) following the advice of local experts.The ""knowledge"" section included 5 items surveying awareness of COVID-19, sources of information, causes, modes of transmission, symptoms, individuals at risk and preventive measures. The ""attitudes"" section comprised 3 items including attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures, feelings and adaptive measures towards the pandemic, and perceptions towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The ""practices"" section included 4 items such as adherence to government disease prevention orders, use of face masks, and the appropriate ways for coughing and sneezing.Data on demographic variables is presented using mean and standard deviations. Associations between variables were analyzed with t-tests. STATA v.13 (StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway Dr. College Station, TX 77845) was used to carry out the statistical analysis.2269 participants accepted and completed the survey. The mean age of the participants was 31.04 (SD 10.96). 38.48% were female, 46.14% were married, 45.61% were protestants and 40.55% had vulnerable jobs. More demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1 .Questions regarding technical concepts, such as what COVID-19 is or what typical symptoms it causes, were mostly answered incorrectly. Only 371 (16.35%) answered correctly to both questions. Nevertheless, the study population had greater knowledge regarding concrete aspects of the pandemic, such as prevention measures and contagion, probably due to the fact that communication campaigns extensively informed upon these topics. Hence, only those 3 questions were further considered in the statistical analysis. 356 participants (15.69%) did not answer any of those questions correctly, 636 (28.03%) had one answer correct, 792 (34.91%) had two answers correct, and 485 (21.38%) answered all questions regarding knowledge correctly Table 2 .Attitudes 784 (34.55%) participants were very concerned about the possibility of being infected, 1844 (81.27%) were unsatisfied/very unsatisfied with their social relationships after the pandemics began, and 1553 (68.44%) thought that the pandemic was a disturbing/very disturbing issue. Among the factors associated with KAPs, gender, education and job vulnerability stand out. Regarding knowledge, 16.15% of women correctly answered all questions compared to 24.64% of men (p = 0.000). 4.82% of people without education correctly answered all questions compared to 21.38% of respondents with university education (p = 0.000). 14.57% of people with vulnerable jobs correctly answered all questions compared to 26.02% of people without this condition (p = 0.000). More results on knowledge based on social factors can be found in Table 3 . When analyzing attitudes, some interesting features emerged. Gender did not significantly influence attitudes, for which 24.63% of women negatively assessed all questions exploring this dimension compared to 23.78% of men (p = 0.302). Education and work were associated to general attitudes, as 13.16% of people without education assessed the pandemic in a more positive way compared to 4.09% of university educated people (p = 0.000). 9.67% of people with vulnerable jobs assessed the pandemic in a more positive way compared to 5.04% of people without this condition (p = 0.000). More data on attitudes can be seen in Table 4 .Finally, when exploring the association between practices and the abovementioned social factors, similar results were found. 49.41% of men follow all preventive measures compared to 32.07% of women (p = 0.000). 14.91% of people without education follow all the preventive measures compared to 48.16% of university educated people (p = 0.000). 3.04% of people with vulnerable jobs do not respect any of the surveyed preventive measures compared to 1.19% of people without this condition (p = 0.000). Table 5 presents complete information on practices based on social factors. The emergence of COVID-19 in China and its rapid global spread has resulted in the largest pandemic in recent times, creating unprecedented public health challenges. As one of the poorest countries in the world [28] , the population of Chad could be at greater risk of higher morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first epidemiological survey aimed at assessing KAPs of individuals regarding COVID-19 in Chad. Collecting such information is necessary for the design and promotion of tailored public health measures. The objective of this study was, first, to estimate the population's knowledge, attitudes and practices relative to COVID-19, and second, to identify vulnerable groups that require special attention from local authorities.Regarding knowledge, our study reports a lower level of awareness compared to similar studies carried out worldwide. Greater knowledge about COVID-19 was found in American [29] , Asian [18, [30] [31] [32] and African countries [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . For instance, the great majority of Nigerian respondents (99.5%) showed good levels of knowledge about COVID-19, which were significantly related to positive attitudes towards preventive measures [39] . Another study among Ugandan health care workers showed that, overall, 69% had sufficient knowledge, 21% had positive attitudes, and 74% followed good practices relative to COVID-19 [40] . Factors associated with knowledge were age (> 40 years old) and access to news media. Factors associated with good practices were age (> 40 years old) and level of education. Some discrepancies between our work and the abovementioned studies can be explained, at least partially, by substantial differences in the instruments used to assess KAPs. Discrepancies could also be due to lower educational levels in Chad compared to other African countries [28] . In addition, the majority of the Chadian population has limited access to television, social networks and the Internet, considering that media access should have a positive effect on levels of COVID-19 awareness [39, 41] .Results more similar to ours were found in a study of KAPs among chronic disease patients in North West Ethiopia [42] . Levels of poor knowledge and poor practices were 33.9% and 47.3%, respectively. Age, educational level, rural residency, and monthly income were significantly associated with poor knowledge levels. Being unmarried, as well as illiteracy, rural residency, low income, and poor knowledge were significantly related to poor practice levels.As for attitudes, our study shows that more than a third of the participants (34.55%) were very concerned about the possibility of being infected. However, an Ethiopian study revealed that being infected with COVID-19 was highly threatening for nearly half of the study participants [42] . On the other hand, an American study reported that only 24.6% of respondents were highly worried about being infected with COVID-19 [43] . Such notable differences could be explained by different sociosanitary contexts in each country. People in highly developed countries may be more confident due to better-qualified health systems. Populations in African countries may tend to express more concern due to misinformation, lack of confidence in political measures and a sense of unpreparedness [36, 39] . It is worth noting that differences in how attitudes and risk perceptions were assessed can also make results difficult to compare.In our study, only 37.2% of participants answered all questions regarding practices toward COVID-19 correctly. A similar prevalence of poor practices was found in an Ethiopian study [38] , although not in studies conducted in Iran [44] and China [18] . A binational African survey reported that the majority of respondents (96%) practiced self-isolation and social-distancing, but only 36% followed all health recommendations [36] . Similarly, the majority of respondents in a Nigerian survey (79.5%) reportedly followed precautionary measures including social distancing, improving personal hygiene, and wearing face masks during the lockdown period [39] . These results sharply contrast from those found among Sudanese residents, who reported low levels of compliance with proper practices towards COVID-19: Only 34.1% of those surveyed wore face masks, and 57.9% avoided shaking hands in recent days [37] . An Ethiopian study showed that hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were dominant practices. Older ages and unemployment negatively predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking [38] . These results may reveal different levels of awareness and concern in study participants, leading to variation in the application of actions and behaviors. However, such disparities might also be influenced by cultural diversity, differences in outbreak phases within study areas, as well as divergences in government recommendations and policies. Finally, correlations between knowledge levels and attitudes towards COVID-19 on the one hand, as well as preventive practices followed by the population on the other hand, have been well established in various studies [18, 36, [45] [46] [47] . Hence, an effective starting point for preventive measures seems to be to increasing knowledge and awareness about the disease. Furthermore, Burström and Tao reported that many of the potential risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g., disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, overcrowding, general poor health and underlying diseases, unviable conditions for social distancing, difficult access to healthcare facilities, etc.) tend to cluster around the same individuals and areas [48] . It is therefore important to identify vulnerable social groups for the design and implementation of effective preventive measures.In order to control the spread of COVID-19, it is essential that public health officials know which groups are the most vulnerable [49] . There can be a tendency in the field of health education and promotion to think of infectious diseases from a biomedical viewpoint. As such, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases can sometimes be perceived to be solely within the clinical domain. Yet, the reality is that both nonclinical and clinical public health responses are required [50] . Not only physical vulnerability, but also social vulnerability has been associated with increased risk of COVID-19 detection and death rates [51] . Therefore, this pandemic confirms the call to redefine vulnerability in broader terms than strictly biological ones [52] .Vulnerable groups are those particularly exposed to a certain risk. Not only the elderly or patients with ill health and comorbidities are vulnerable to COVID-19, ""but also people from a gradient of socioeconomic groups that might struggle to cope financially, mentally, or physically with the crisis"" [52] . The Lancet continues as follows: ""if vulnerable groups are not properly identified, the consequences of this pandemic will be even more devastating. Although WHO guidance should be followed, a one-size-fits-all model will not be appropriate. Each country must continually assess which members of society are vulnerable to fairly support those at the highest risk"".In efforts to answer this call, our study identifies particular social groups that are especially vulnerable as they face this pandemic. According to our findings, gender, job conditions and educational level significantly affect our population regarding health risks associated with COVID-19. Levels of KAPs are lower in women with lower levels of education and more precarious jobs. Therefore, health strategies designed by local authorities in Chad should consider those variables to generate specific interventions focused on groups at the highest risk.According to the HDI, Chad ranks third among the least developed countries in the world [28] . It is, therefore, a critical context that needs to be analyzed by following strict scientific methods that allow for evidence-based health measures. Very few epidemiological studies have been conducted in Chad due to technical limitations, lack of local conditions, etc. All of this has resulted in some kind of scientific isolation [11, 20] . This study intends to fill this gap, and brings the particular concerns of a Sub-Saharan country to the global dialogue on health measures facing the COVID-19 pandemic.The main limitation of this work is related to sample representativeness of Chadian community inhabitants within N'Djamena. Our study was dominated by respondents living in the city who were male (61.52%), single (53.86%), and who reached secondary education or higher (77.87%), therefore, findings for this survey among uneducated and rural populations in Chad might be quite different. Even if these figures are not representative of the Chadian population [28] and these results may not be extrapolated to the general population, a comparable gap has been described in other studies conducted in the region. [37, 39] . Nevertheless, despite this issue, it was possible to carry out an analysis comparing social groups with different characteristics, identifying some groups from the surveyed population, for whom measures against COVID-19 should be reinforced.This study provides a comprehensive assessment of KAP levels observed from residents of N'Djamena, Chad, with regards to COVID-19. Given that a high level of awareness has been shown to be a positive predictor of success in curtailing COVID-19, the vulnerable population (in our study, uneducated women with underprivileged jobs) would require special attention.Efforts toward assessing KAP levels of underprivileged and vulnerable populations, as well as the dissemination of health education among these groups should be intensified. Considering the unique factors observed in different groups of the Chadian population would constitute a holistic and viable approach toward facing COVID-19.","Egypt","abstract","2021-01-23",1

Laboratory testing has a critical role in isolating the patient, break the transmission cycle. As of December 13, 2020, Ethiopia has conducted 1,706,321 tests since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia (FMOH). Initially, the country was sending samples to South Africa to get the test done. The country has slowly established a testing facility at the national reference lab and later on expanded to other labs. Yet the national testing capacity is very low in relation to over a 110,000,000-population size, and the facilities concentrate mainly in major cities and university laboratories. However, this has now improved with significant development, and reached 72 laboratories with a daily capacity of 13, 944 tests. In this opinion we will showcase pointby-point the challenges we face in terms of trained human capital, infrastructure, testing kit availability, logistics constraints, etc. as a resource limited country.One of the critical challenges we are facing is the inadequate well-trained human capital in terms of sample collection and delivery, testing and test result dispatching: it is well known that quality of sample has a significant impact in the diagnostic accuracy of any diseases [2] . At the moment, nasopharynx and/or throat swabs are used to detect SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid in Ethiopia. Here we have a great concern on the quality of samples because of lack of adequate training on how to collect good quality nasopharynx and/or throat samples, or for patient intolerance during sample collection [3] . Once collected, there are possible delays in delivering samples to testing laboratories. Although samples are stable for specified period, maintaining cold chain system is not always possible [2] . This could be a growing challenge in Ethiopia, particularly in peripheral sites weakly equipped with the laboratory equipment and could cause extended turnaround time. To identify COVID-19 cases, the only approved laboratory diagnostic approach in Ethiopia is the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, as this test is considered the most accurate. However, there are multiple factors affecting wide scale implementation of this test. Such as lack of trained man power to run the tests, and shortage of certified biomedical engineers capable of calibration and maintenance of biosafety and laboratory equipment are additional challenges.Besides, engaging laboratory professionals to work with samples which potentially contain the infectious virus is not a simple task. Collection of patient clinical data and sociodemographic information is manual, and electronic or web-based data collection has not been fully in use. Hence, there has been a duplication of effort in transcribing what was written at time of specimen collection and sample delivery to testing centres. Such practice is prone to human error and leads to unnecessary delay in result delivery.Our second challenge is lack of infrastructure: health infrastructure in particular laboratory facilities with trained personnel, is very limited in sub-Saharan African countries [4] . According to WHO, a non-propagative SARS CoV-2 diagnosis should be done in bio-safety class II level-P2 laboratory [2] . However, the number of laboratories with bio-safety class II facilities are very limited in the country. Besides, most hospitals and diagnostic centers are not equipped well to handle the massive inflow samples. If the rising trend of new cases continues as it appears now, it is likely that they will soon overwhelm the limited health and laboratory infrastructures within the country. The third challenge is logistics constraints: almost all consumables for diagnosis and the test kit itself depend on the international market under the national import permit and regulations. To get minor but vital items in the local market is difficult. As a result, the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA) and other agencies are practicing substantially fast-tracked approval process of Covid-19 related products, yet each process of procurement should pass through the existing legal procedures (getting hard currency, shipment, certification, EFDA registration, and customs clearance) which take longer than one´s expectations.Lack of reference laboratories is also another challenge: the currently available nucleic acidbased tests for SARS CoV-2 can miss 30-40% of those actually infected [5] because of several reasons, including individual variation and assay sensitivity. This is mainly true for samples with viral copy number closer to the detection limit of the assay. Along with testing, there is also some sort of subjectivity in setting cycle threshold, and thus standardization of testing protocol is critical. Therefore, in the presence of such uncertainties, reference laboratories are required to evaluate testing laboratories through external quality assurance programs and fill gaps.The fifth challenge is cultural values: health seeking behaviour, the concept to disease origin and dynamics in relation to scientific knowledge in African population is low [6] As a result, people might prefer to visit religious and traditional healers than modern health care facilities. This could limit the number of individuals to avail themselves to health facilities, and impact testing of COVID-19. Furthermore, lack of work ethics of professionals could also be considered as a growing challenge related to COVID-19 risk exposure. This has been revealed by unrealistic and irrational panic, reluctance, and presentation of vague reason not to work in SARS-CoV-2 laboratories. As a result, managing fear and stigma associated with the disease are other challenges related to cultural and historical issues. In particular, stigmatization of the ill is an enormous challenge. It is a very recent memory that victims of HIV/AIDS have been heavily stigmatized across the country. As a result, individuals may become reluctant to undergo testing if they fear or other reprisals from their communities.Last, we also have challenges from the lack of data and weak statistical capacity: the capacity of African countries including Ethiopia in addressing healthcare challenges remains hindered by a lack of data coverage, stemming from weak statistical capacity despite its importance for evidence-based decision-making and policy formulation. Authorities have inadequate access to and use of data and have the problem of using latest statistical methodologies. This represents a significant challenge for the timely production of quality data, which is the most crucial in times of epidemic emergency [7] .In conclusion, the Ethiopian government at various levels is showing high commitment to contain the pandemic before it causes significant damage to the community. The FMOH has prepared national guidelines for disease prevention, patient´s management, and diagnosis to contain the pandemic. Standardized approaches and expanding of laboratory facilities is also ongoing as one of priority areas to speed up testing. However, widespread testing seems impossible for Ethiopia unless all barriers and bottlenecks are critically considered and managed properly. Therefore, we recommend the followings points for health authorities to take immediate actions: 1) They should enhance integrated capacity building both in human capital at various levels of the process and infrastructure development; 2) Technology based data collection system, tracking and communication system needs to be strengthen; 3) They should strengthen emergency use authorization without compromising quality; 4) Expanding testing facilities and encouraging the use of alternative testing methods such as pooling both at direct biological samples and nucleic acid (RNA) shall be started; 5) Establishing reference laboratory which design, implement, and monitor both internal and external quality control tests shall be enhanced; 6) Rapid adoption and validation of point of care tests for diagnosis of COVID-19 in our country shall be encouraged; 7) Integration of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with existing platform which are already widely used for TB & HIV testing shall be implemented; 8) Looking for more funds and support from international agencies and donors to support establishment of testing site and maintain","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-05",1

In most countries so far, partial lockdowns as well as social distancing guidelines, frequent washing of hands and/or sanitizing have been put in place to curb the spread of the virus. Some of these restrictions may remain in place probably until a vaccine for the virus has been developed. In this regards many human behavioural patterns to life have been seriously affected raging from education, economic, health, social, religion etc.In Uganda for example, total ban on people's movement from one district to another, border closure, curfew and others are measures that have been employed to prevent the spread of the virus, however, many patients suffering from other diseases have little or no access to health care service as a result of restrictions especially on movement. Some studies have revealed significant changes in the way people live their lives during this lockdown which included avoiding crowded public places, wearing a face mask, avoiding physical contact, improving personal hygiene (e.g. frequent washing of hands and using hand sanitizer), changes in sleep and use of sleep substances, diet and physical activities (Bruine de Bruin & Bennett, 2020, Arora & Grey, 2020 and WHO, 2018). Some of these may have some behaviours and mental health implicationsIn the period of this pandemic, the way individual behaves is important to note because a change in the public behavior is an alternative to controlling outbreaks when there is no suitable pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, the behavioural patterns of an individual can influence their family, communities, society and social networks (Chen et al., 2017) . Epidermics had been reported in a study which used mathematical models to affect people's fears, emotions and ultimately their behavior (Bi et al., 2019) . With respect to these behavioural changes resulting from the lockdown and restrictions, we envisaged that self-medication practices may be influenced by the way people try to cope with their health management at this crucial time.Self-medication can be referred to as the intake of drugs, herbs or home remedies either on one's own initiative, or on the advice of another person for physical or psychological ailments (Hernandez-Juyol and Job-Quesada, 2002). Common sources of self-medications include previous prescribed drug, pharmacist, family, friends, neighbours, internet, and suggestions from an advertisement etc. According to Osemene and Lamikanra, (2012), self-medication is a serious public health problem globally posing risks such as drug resistance, organ damage and deaths (2.9 -3.7%) in the world because of drug-drug interaction.The probability of drug abuse has been reported to be on the rise as a result of global increase in self-medication (McCabe et al., 2005 , WHO 1998 ). Signs and symptoms of underlying disease conditions can be concealed by self-medication, therefore causing drug resistance, delay diagnoses and making the problem complex or difficult to deal with (Bauchner and Wise 2000, Calabresi and Cupini, 2005) .Self-medication causes adverse reaction and prolonged suffering as well as other related problems such as wastage of resources and high resistance of pathogens. It is important to note that a current world-wide problem especially in developing countries where antibiotics are available without any prescription is antimicrobial resistance (Bennadi, 2014) . The overall self-medication rate in sub-Sahara Africa varies from 11.9% to 75.7%. In Uganda, a high prevalence of self-medication was previously reported in the northern and southwestern region (Mouankie et al., 2011, Ocan et al., 2014, Lukyamuzi et al., 2020). Therefore, this research sought to investigated the beharioural response of the community towards self-medication practices during this COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.A cross sectional household and online survey using traditional method (printed questionnaires) and information technology (Google form) was conducted during the months of June-to-August 2020 in western Uganda. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in communities of western Uganda.The population of the western region, one of the four regions of Uganda was 8,874,862 according to 2014 census (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2013, Citypopulation.de 2016). With about a population growth rate of 3.32% (https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/ugandapopulation), the sample size of the study was calculated using the OpenEpi sample size calculator (Open source statistics for public health. (2013). Accessed: March 9, 2020: http://openepi.com/SampleSize/SSPropor.htm). The estimated sample size was 280, with a confidence level of 90% using an anticipated frequency (p) of 50%.Study participants were selected using a convenience sampling technique and sampling was done by sending a structured online questionnaire via Google forms to some participants. Also a printed hard copied self-administered questionnaires were made available to other participants that did not use the online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 questions covering two parts. The first part of the questionnaire included demographics data of the participants (e.g. age, gender, education, occupation). While the second part of the questionnaire focused on the self-medication practice before and during COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality, no names or email addresses were asked. Those who participated willingly consent to take part in the study and for quality control, strict parameters were set to ensure participants answer the questionnaire once.The researcher checked all filled data collection tools for validity and completeness. Any discrepancies in the entries were corrected by referring to the source documents (questionnaires).Expedited ethical clearance was sought from Kampala International University Ethical Review Committee and registered as Nr.UG-REC-023/201914. Consent to participate was acquired through online submission of questionnaires and traditional printed and filled questionnaires by the participants.Our study showed the sociodemographic features of the respondents where most of them were males 149, (54.8%) and females 124, (45.2%) between ages 25 -34 years (43.8%), Christian (85.7.8%) and others as shown in Table 1 . The percentage of respondents that know about selfmedication is (97%) and those that practice self-medication are approximately (88%). Previous studies report that generally, people are aware of the effects, potential side effects, misuse and abuse of OTC drugs.10-12. Our result showed that 97% of respondents have heard about selfmedication either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while 3% said they have not heard about self-medication. There is a statistically significant difference between those that have heard of self-medication and those that have not. The number of respondents that knew about self-medication were 146 (98%) male and 119 (96%) female while those that are not aware of self-medication were 3 (2%) male and 5 (4%) female (OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 0.49, 8.73) Figure 1 : Pie chart showing the awareness of the respondents on self-medicationAmong 272 respondents, those that never fall sick before COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is 17 (7.4%) in which increases to 81 (35.2%) during the lockdown. 7 (3%) never, 86 (37.2%) sometimes, 121 (52.4%) rarely practice self-medication before COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, however, 4 (1.7%) never, 58 (25.2%) sometimes, 87 (37.8%) rarely practice self-medication during the lockdown ( Figure 6 ). Our result revealed a statistical significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the incidence of sickness before and during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Figure 6 : Showing the incidence of sickness before and during COVID-19 pandemicMany factors have been reported to affect self-medication practice which includes availability of drugs, education society and many more (Vizhi & Senapathi 2010; Montastruc et al., 1997; Habeeb et al., 1993) . Our investigation revealed that most of the respondents know about selfmedication and practice it (Figure 1) . The rate of self-medication was high at 88% before COVID-19 lockdown with more practice shown in the female, but was reduced to 57% during the lockdown (Figure 2 & 3) . The higher rate of self-medication found among females compare to males in this study is consistent with previous studies (Figueiras et al., 2000 and Awad et al., 2005) The World Health Organization (WHO) has continue to promote self-medication as a means to treat common diseases in the community considering it to be beneficial and helping in decreasing the burden on health care services especially in developing countries (WHO, 1986) . In this respect self-medication when practiced correctly could be a great benefit to the community during the COVID-19 lockdown as it allows patients to become responsible and build confidence to manage their health. Nevertheless, previous studies has showed quite a number of negative effects from substance use resulting from social isolation such as COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions, with probable drug abuse associated more to socially isolated people ( Our result shows a significant decrease in the percentage of people that practiced self-medication before COVID-19 pandemic compared to the percentage of people that practiced self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Fig. 4 & 5) . Also there was a decrease in the incidence of sickness during COVID-19 lockdown as many of the respondents never fall sick during lockdown ( Figure 6 ). The decrease in the incidence of sickness may be due to the change in behavior of people as a result of the measures put in place to combat the spread of the disease. During the lockdown, there is a high propensity for people pay more attention to their health as people were encouraged to practice more personal hygiene such as washing of hands regularly and/or using sanitizers, wearing face masks and maintaining social distance which may have resulted in the improvement of people's health status in the community. This is consistent with the report that the incidence of diseases such as infections, trachoma, diarrhea-related diseases, pneumonia and many more can be decreased by maintaining good personal hygiene (WHO, 2018).Major reason for self-medication were convenience, affordability, lack of means to the health facility/hospital, fear of been diagnosed COVIC-19 positive and fear of visiting the health facility/hospital, time saving (Figure 7) . On perception of respondents to self-medication, most of them (40.6%) opined that self-medication should be discouraged (Figure 8) , however the percentage of respondents practicing self-medication is still high. This may have emanated from the fact that self-medication practice reduces the time spent waiting for a doctor, can save life in emergency states and affordable cost of health care (Almasdy & Sherrif, 2011) . Also, the World Health Organization recommended that self-medication can assist in prevention and treatment of sicknesses where consulting a doctor is not necessary, therefore making treatment of common illness cheaper. Nevertheless, inappropriate use of medication could lead to a rise in diseases triggered by abuse and cause waste of public funds (WHO, 2000) .","Uganda","abstract","2021-01-04",1

Of these, a cumulative total of 1,150,163 (2.7%) patients had died of the disease while 31,456,279 cases had recovered from the disease. Although earlier studies suggested that about 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 [2, 3] , the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that people of all ages can be infected by the novel coronavirus. However, older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill and to die of COVID-19 than other at-risk populations.While the virus was slow in reaching the African continent compared to other parts of the world, infection has grown exponentially in recent months and continues to spread throughout Africa. Africa's first COVID-19 case was recorded in Egypt on February 14, 2020. By October 24, 2020, there were 1,696,285 cases of COVID-19 in Africa, with 40,922 (2.4%) deaths and 1,394,094 recoveries [4] . There are more cases of COVID-19 in the Southern Africa region contributing 788,070 (46.4%) of the cases, with the Eastern Africa region responsible for 201,216 cases (11.9%). Within the East Africa region, Ethiopia (92,229) has the highest number of cases followed by Kenya (47, 843) with the lowest cases reported in Eritrea (461).The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Uganda on March 21, 2020 . The government of Uganda introduced up to 33 COVID-19 prevention measures to curb the spread of the pandemic including closure of schools, colleges and universities; prohibition of gatherings of 10 or more people; country-wide travel restrictions and a curfew running between 19:00 and 06:30 h, among other measures. A countrywide home confinement was announced on March 30, 2020 and remained in effect until June 26, 2020 . The number of COVID-19 cases remained low between March and June 2020; however, when these measures were relaxed towards the end of June 2020, reported cases increased sharply: between 23 July and 19 August, Uganda saw an 88% average increase in the number of new cases reported each week, with the majority of new cases reported in Kampala [5] . By October 24, 2020, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases was 11,163 with 99 (0.9%) deaths and 7269 recoveries. A majority of cases have been reported in Kampala, the Capital City of Uganda. By December 26, 2020, the cumulative number of cases in Kampala constituted up to 54% (n = 13,823) of the national caseload and of the cumulative number of people that have so far died of COVID-19 48.2% (n = 118) died in Kampala alone [6] . Nearly 70% of the cases reported in Kampala were local transmissions with up to 90% attributed to the use of public means of transport, including taxis [7] .By end of October 2020, several businesses had been opened and schools and tertiary teaching institutions reopened for candidate classes. However, some of the businesses, including bars and other hospitality establishments were yet to resume while several businesses were struggling financially. The informal sector workers are often hardest hit as reported elsewhere [8] [9] [10] . With a youth unemployment rate of 13% in Uganda [11] and 90.5% of the youth in Kampala engaged in the informal sector businesses, it is likely that COVID-19 lockdown could have had devastating effects on their incomes and general livelihoods. In this paper, we describe COVID-19 awareness, uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures, and the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status, socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours among adolescent boys and young men aged 10-24 years in Kampala, Uganda.The questions analysed for this paper were embedded into a larger formative study conducted to assess the health status of adolescent boys and young men aged 10-24 years in Kampala, the Capital City of Uganda (Fig. 1) . Kampala is located along the shores of Lake Victoria in the central region of Uganda and is administratively divided into five urban divisions, namely: Kawempe, Nakawa, Rubaga, Central and Makindye division. Kampala has a projected population of 1,650,800 according to the 2019 Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) Statistical Abstracts [12] . Of these, 47% (n = 781,700) are males. Adolescents and young people (both males and females) aged 10-24 years constitute 38.8% (n = 640,510) of Kampala's total population. Given that 47% of Kampala's population are males; we estimate that there were 301,040 adolescent boys and young men in Kampala in 2019.This was a cross-sectional study that was conducted among 2500 in-and out-of-school adolescent boys and young men aged 10-24 years, resident in the five urban divisions of Kampala, between July and August 2020.The sample size was determined using the formula suggested by Cochran 1977 [13] . Assuming a type-1 error of 5%, p = 0.14 (the proportion of adolescent boys that have ever used drugs in Kampala, Uganda [14] ); a design effect of 2.0; a margin of error of 0.05, five divisions in Kampala and a non-response of 0.10, we estimated that we would need to enrol a minimum of 2060 ABYM. This sample size was adjusted to 2500 ABYM to ensure adequate numbers of interviews conducted within each division. We used probability proportionate to size to allocate the sample size to the five divisions (Table 1 ). In the absence of individualized data from Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) on ABYM 10-24 years, we used the proportion of the division's total population out of the total population in Kampala as a proxy for the proportion of ABYM in the division. The sample size allocated to each division was distributed among in-and out-of-school ABYM using the percentage of children 6-12 years who were not in school, obtained from the UBOS National Population and Housing Census report [15] .We used a multi-stage sampling technique to guide the selection of wards/parishes within each division and cells/villages within each ward/parish. Kampala is made up of 96 wards/ parishes across the five divisions. During the first stage, we obtained a list of all wards/parishes within each division from the Division Town Clerks. We then purposely selected 50% of the wards/parishes in each division, for a total of 48 wards/parishes in all the five divisions ( Table 2 ). During the second stage of sampling, we purposely selected 20% of the total number of cells/villages within each ward/parish using a random number generator. This exercise was done repeatedly until all the selected wards/parishes had been covered.During the third stage, we obtained a list of households within each cell/village from the area local leaders. From each cell/village, the total number of households needed to be included in the survey was determined by sampling proportionate to size.After selecting the households, we conducted a minicensus in each household and listed down the names, age and schooling status of all ABYM aged 10-24 years that were found in each household. Only one eligible ABYM (age 10-24 years, resident in the selected cell/village, and enrolled in a school within the division) was interviewed per household. If a household had more than one eligible in-school ABYM, we wrote their names of all eligible ABYM on pieces of paper, placed them in a box; churned thoroughly, and one paper was picked at random. The name of the ABYM on the selected piece of paper was then invited for interview. To be interviewed as in-school ABYM, a respondent had to have been a pupil or student in a preselected school within each division prior to the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. Lists of pre-selected schools per division were made available to the study team to guide them in making the right decision on who qualified to be interviewed as an in-school ABYM.On the other hand, since out-of-school ABYM were less likely to be found at home at the time of the survey, we conducted a pre-study visit to each division to list the areas of location and/or types of occupation (such as garages, boda-boda [motorcycle taxi] stages, mobile traders, quarries, construction sites) that were likely to have a heavy presence of out-of-school ABYM aged 10-24 years within the same wards/parishes as those selected for in-school ABYM ( Table 2 ). The number of areas of locations or occupation types varied by ward within each division, and the exact number of areas of location or occupation types per ward was determined pragmatically, while taking into consideration the need to balance out participants by socio-economic status and area of residence (e.g. slums, affluent areas and peri-urban locations). The identified locations and/or types of occupations were considered to constitute sampling lots with each ward/parish. Using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) methodology [16, 17] , we enrolled a minimum of 19 respondents from each lot within a ward until the required number of out-of-school ABYM in each division was attained. Where the number of eligible respondents selected from each lot was deemed to fall below the number of ABYM needed in each division, the number of respondents per lot was adjusted upwards (> 19) to reach the needed sample size within the division. However, where the number of eligible respondents per lot was lower than 19, we interviewed all the respondents within the selected lot but oversampled in the subsequent lots to balance out the number of out-of-school ABYM interviews for each division.Data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted by trained Research Assistants in the five divisions of Kampala while observing COVID-19 prevention measures. We used a pilot-tested questionnaire that was loaded on mobile phones enabled with Kobo collect; a data collection application. Data collection took place between July and August 2020. All Research Assistants had a minimum of a Bachelor's degree with more than 5 years of field data collection experience. Data were collected on ABYM's awareness of how COVID-19 is spread and prevented; uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures, and the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on ABYM's mental health status, socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours.Awareness of COVID-19 was assessed using the question, 'Have you heard of corona virus/COVID-19?' If respondents indicated that they had ever heard of COVID-19, they were asked about how the novel coronavirus can be prevented from spreading from person to person. Respondents were then asked specific questions on how often (never, rarely, sometimes, always) they adopted the COVID-19 prevention measures. Specific questions were asked about the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on: (a) mental health status and various forms of depression (e.g. did the COVID-19 lockdown make you feel so sad that nothing could cheer you up?) including whether or not the lockdown led ABYM to contemplate committing suicide; (b) various forms of violence (e.g. due to COVID-19 lockdown, did you experience more of the following forms of violence-being punched, kicked or beaten up by peers or someone pressuring you to have sex through harassment, threats or tricks?); (c) access to basic needs (e.g. due to the effects of COVID-19 lockdown, did you find it more difficult to afford the price of food?); (d) socioeconomic disruptions (e.g. with regard to your source of livelihood, did COVID-19 lockdown lead to loss of a job?); and (e) engagement in unhealthy behaviours (e.g. due to the effects of COVID-19 lockdown, did you engage in smoking or chewing tobacco much more than before?).We computed descriptive statistics to describe ABYM's awareness of how COVID-19 is spread and prevented, their adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures, and effects of COVID-19 lockdown on ABYM's mental health status and various forms of depression; socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours. Data are reported as frequencies and percentages, unless otherwise stated. Selected statistical comparisons were done using Chi Square tests. Data analysis was conducted using STATA (version 15).The study protocol was approved by the Higher Degrees Research and Ethics Committee of Makerere University School of Public Health (Protocol#: 757) and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS#: 5240). Written informed consent was sought from each of the individuals before participating in the survey. Parental consent was waived for emancipated minors (i.e. those below 18 years of age) who were married, had a child or catered for their own livelihood, as defined in the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology guidelines [18] . Consent from parents/guardians was sought for participants aged 10-17 years who were also asked to provide their own assent prior to participation in the survey. Table 3 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Of the 2,500 respondents, 74.8% (n = 1869) were in-school; 19 .3% (n = 483) were aged 10-14 years; 47.3% (n = 1182) were aged 15-19 years while 33.4% (n = 835) were aged 20-24 years. Most of the respondents were living in Nakawa (28.8%, n = 720), Kawempe (24.7%, n = 617) and Rubaga (20.0%, n = 501) in that order with the Central Division having the lowest number of respondents (10.3%, n = 257). Table 4 shows the proportion of respondents who were aware of how COVID-19 is spread and prevented and the proportion of respondents who practiced the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures. All respondents regardless of schooling status or age-group had ever heard of COVID-19. Nearly three-quarters (74.9%, n = 1872) of the respondents were aware that the new coronavirus is spread through sneezing or coughing (droplet infection); 72.1% (n = 1802) were aware that the virus is spread through human-to-human contact while 52.4% (n = 266) were aware that the virus is spread through contact with contaminated surfaces.Awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures varied according to the measure being explored. Eighty-six per cent (n = 2137) of the respondents were aware that hand-washing with soap and running water could prevent the acquisition or spread of the novel coronavirus, with a similar percentage reporting that wearing a face mask in public places was equally important. Seventy per cent (n = 1759) reported that COVID-19 can be prevented through social distancing (i.e. maintaining a physical distance of up to 2 m between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other). However, only 42.5% (n = 1063) of the respondents were aware that use of an alcohol-based hand-sanitizer was one of the preventive measures and 26% were aware that sneezing through a bent elbow was one of the COVID-19 prevention measures. Only 22% (n = 541) reported that avoiding touching the mouth, eyes and nose with unwashed hands was a COVID-19 prevention measure. However, a slightly higher proportion of in-school (22.6%, n = 422) than out-of-school respondents (18.9%, n = 119) were aware that not touching the mouth, eyes and nose with contaminated hands was protective against the spread of COVID-19. We found low uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures despite a high level of awareness of prevention measures. For instance, only 22.2% (n = 555) of the respondents reported that they always used a face mask in a public place. When these results were stratified by age-group, the proportion of ABYM who always used a face mask in a public place increased with increasing age; 17% (n = 82) among those aged 10-14 years; 19.6% (n = 232) among the 15-19 yearolds and 28.9% (n = 241) among those aged 20-24 yearolds. Only 22% (n = 551) of the respondents reported that they always used an alcohol-based hand rub while 40.9% (n = 1023) reported that they always washed their hands with soap and running water. There was no significant difference between in-school and out-of-school ABYM with regard to hand-washing with soap and running water as a COVID- Table 5 shows the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status and various forms of depression and violence among ABYM in Kampala. Overall, 70.3% (n = 1758) reported that they felt more nervous as a result of COVID-19 lockdown than ever before with those outof-school reporting higher levels of nervousness (77.5%, n = 489) than those that were in-school (67.9%, n = 1269). Sixty-three per cent (n = 1575) of the respondents reported that they felt so sad that nothing could cheer them up while 55.7% (n = 1392) reported that they felt more hopeless as a result of COVID-19 lockdown than ever before. In general, out-of-school ABYM reported higher levels of each condition than their in-school counterparts. When we stratified these results by age-group, we observed that older adolescent boys and young men seemed to report higher levels of each condition than their younger counterparts (Fig. 2) . For instance, the proportion of ABYM who Nearly four per cent of ABYM (n = 97) reported that someone wished that they were dead or had never been born, 10.1% (n = 253) reported that someone told them that they were not loved while approximately 1.2% (n = 31) of the respondents reported that they contemplated committing suicide as a result of COVID-19 lockdown, with a slightly higher proportion of out-of-school ABYM reporting that they contemplated committing suicide than their in-school counterparts (out-of-school: 2.1%, n = 13 vs. in-school: 1.0%, n = 18). The proportion that contemplated committing suicide increased with increasing age; 0.6% (n = 3) among those aged 10-14 years, 0.9% (n = 11) among those aged 15-19 years, and 2.0% (n = 17) among those aged 20-24 years. With regard to violence, we found that ABYM experienced very low levels of physical or intimate partner violence (0.4-1.2%) across three of the five forms of violence assessed, i.e., being punched, kicked or beaten by an intimate partner; someone pressuring them to have sex with them through harassment, threats or tricks; and someone physically forcing them to have sex with them against their will. However, 8% (n = 199) reported that they were punched, kicked, or beaten up by their peers. Table 6 shows the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on ABYM's ability to meet basic needs and access basic health services. Sixty-two per cent (n = 1549) of ABYM reported that they found it difficult to afford a diverse or balanced diet as a result of COVID-19 lockdown, with a higher proportion reported among those who were out-of-school (75.8%, n = 478) than those who were in-school (57.3%, n = 1071). Fifty-five per cent (n = 1364) of the respondents found it difficult to afford food; 53.9% (n = 1346) found it difficult to afford fuel for cooking food while 46.9% (n = 1171) could not afford the travel to a food market to buy food. Nearly 13% (n = 316) could not access HIV/STI testing services while 8% (n = 198) could not access condoms as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. In general, a higher proportion of out-of-school and older ABYM reported that they found it hard to meet their basic needs or to access basic health services than their in-school or younger counterparts. As shown in Fig. 3 , the proportion of those who could not afford a diverse/ balanced diet was 49.7% (n = 240) among those aged 10-14 years, 61.6% (n = 727) among those aged 15-19 years and 69.7% (n = 582) among those aged 20-24 years. Similarly, the proportion of those who could not afford food was higher among the older young men; 46.8% (n = 226) among those aged 10-14 years, 52.8% (n = 624) among those aged 15-19 years, and 61.6% (n = 514) among those aged 20-24 years. Table 7 shows the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the socio-economic status and health behaviours of ABYM in Kampala. Overall, 30.3% (n = 756) of the respondents experienced a reduction in income as a result of COVID-19 lockdown (out-of-school: 79.9%, n = 504 vs. in-school: 13.5%, n = 252; RR = 9.15, 95%CI 7.68, 10.90). Sixteen per cent (n = 407) of the respondents reported loss of a job while 14.8% (n = 370) reported closure of business as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. In general, the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 lockdown were more strongly felt among outof-school than their in-school counterparts and among older ABYM than their younger counterparts. For instance, while only 2.1% (n = 10) of 10-14 year-olds reported a reduction in income, it was much higher at 20.4% (n = 241) among those who were aged 15-19 years and 60.5% (n = 505) among those aged 20-24 years. Our findings show that COVID-19 lockdown led to an increase in sedentary life styles, binge eating, the use of substances such as khat and marijuana and engaging in smoking or chewing tobacco. Sixty-two per cent (n = 1554) of ABYM reported that they maintained a sedentary life style such as excessive watching of television (TV), and this was higher among in-school than out-of-school ABYM (inschool: 65.3%, n = 1220 vs. out-of-school: 53.0%, n = 334). The proportion of ABYM who reported engaging more in a sedentary life style due to COVID-19 was higher among those aged 10-14 years (65.4%, n = 316) than in those aged 15-19 years (61.0%, n = 719) and 20-24 years (62.2%, n = 519). We also found that 25.2% (n = 628) of the respondents engaged more in binge eating (i.e. consuming unusually large amounts of food in one sitting) than before; 6.3% (n = 157) engaged in the use of alcohol such as waragi (a local potent gin) or beer; 4.5% (n = 113) engaged in the use of substances such as khat or marijuana while 2.0% (n = 51) engaged in smoking or chewing tobacco. The engagement in unhealthy behaviours increased with increasing age. For instance, the proportion of respondents who reported more use of alcohol such as waragi or beer increased from 0.4% (n = 2) among those aged 10-14 years and 3.9% (n = 46) among those aged 15-19 years to 13.1% (n = 109) among those aged 20-24 years. Conversely, the proportion of ABYM that reported binge eating decreased from 29.7% (n = 143) among those aged 10-14 years and 25.0% (n = 295) among those aged 15-19 years to 22.8% (n = 190) among those aged 20-24 years.Our study of the COVID-19 awareness, adoption of preventive measures, and effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status, socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours among adolescent boys and young men (ABYM) aged 10-24 years in Kampala, Uganda, yielded three interesting perspectives: (a) although awareness of how COVID-19 can be prevented is very high, with eight in ten respondents being able to name at least two primary COVID-19 prevention measures, self-reported uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures was very low; (b) the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in increased mental health challenges; limited the ability for people to meet their basic needs; and resulted in socio-economic disruptions (including loss of jobs) and engagement in unhealthy behaviours; and (c) the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown among ABYM were more pronounced among older adolescent boys (15-19 years) , young men (20-24 years) and those that were out-of-school compared to those that were in-school. Similar findings have been reported in other countries in Africa, including Ghana [19] and Zambia [20] , among others. Our observation that uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures was low (ranging between 17 and 41%) amidst high awareness of how COVID-19 is spread and prevented raises serious public health concerns. Evidence shows that use of face-masks can reduce the spread of the coronavirus by up to 99.9% through reducing exhalation of large respiratory droplets [21] , suggesting that universal use of face-masks, along with social distancing and hand-washing with soap and running water can substantially reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission at population level. Indeed, Bandiera et al. [21] found that a person standing 2 m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10,000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 0.5 m away wearing a basic single-layer mask. The low uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures reported among ABYM in Kampala, Uganda, could be related to low perceived risk of COVID-19 coupled with misinformation in some population sub-groups [22] . Thus, although a recent study found that 84% of Ugandans were aware of COVID-19, there were still doubts about its existence in Uganda [23] . It is likely that our respondents did not think that they were at risk of contracting COVID-19 or if they contracted the disease, they did not think that it could result in serious consequences, given that there were very few people that had died of COVID-19 at the time of the study. Besides, some Ugandans thought that COVID-19 was a disease of the whites that could not affect them [24] . This low risk perception may have influenced ABYM's limited uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures, which could explain why only about 17-41% indicated that they always followed the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures.We found that the lockdown which was instituted by the government to curb the spread of COVID-19 affected ABYM in diverse ways: over 60% felt more nervous or sad that nothing could cheer them up as a result of COVID-19; 1.2% contemplated committing suicide while 62% found it difficult to afford a diverse/balanced diet. In addition, 30% reported a loss in income while 16% lost a job. Reports from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics show that up to 69% of persons aged 10-30 years in Kampala are engaged in some form of work, with 90.5% of them engaged in the informal sector [11] . The informal sector was heavily affected by the lockdown since most of the informal businesses-which employ a majority of the ABYM in Kampala-were closed between March and June 2020, and some of them, including bars and hospitality places, remain closed to-date. It is, therefore, not surprising that the effects of COVID-19 were more marked among the older adolescents and young men who were more likely to be engaged in these businesses. Besides, although only 1.2% contemplated committing suicide as a result of COVID-19, reports from other countries show increases in suicides with a recent Voice of America news report reporting a 57% increase in suicides linked to COVID-19 lockdown in Malawi [25] . Thus, the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of ABYM may be greater than reported in this study, calling for mental health interventions to help adolescent boys and young men to cope with the consequences of the lockdown.Our findings further show a deleterious effect of COVID-19 on healthy behaviours, with 62% engaging in sedentary life styles and 25% reporting binge eating as a result of COVID-19. Patterson et al. [26] found that sedentary behaviour was associated with greater risk for cardiovascular and cancer mortality, and incident type 2 diabetes while Zhao et al. [27] found that increased sitting and TV viewing time significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular, cancer, and mortality risk. Collectively, study findings have implications on the need for increased health education and health promotion of healthy behaviours, as well as the need for interventions that provide economic support incentives, including soft loans, to enable ABYM who lost jobs or who suffered reductions in income to set up viable businesses in order to continue to cope with the COVID-19 situation as it evolves.Our study had a number of limitations and strengths. The study was conducted a month after the lockdown was lifted; so, people's perception of the disease and its likely effects could have changed as people learnt how to live with it. Besides, we did not include questions to assess what the situation was before the lockdown, and only relied on questions that asked if the lockdown resulted in increased or higher likelihood of the effects happening without a comparative point measure in the past. Thus, the responses to questions asking about the respondents' ability to cope with the situation largely depended on how they perceived of the situation at time of the study rather than a comparison of the pre-and COVID-19 lockdown situation. However, we tried to overcome these limitations by specifying that the questions referred to what the respondents went through as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. We believe that respondents were able to weigh the situation before and after the COVID-19 lockdown and that their responses reflect the effects that they actually experienced as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. These limitations notwithstanding, our study was the first study ever to assess uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures and the effects of COVID-19 lockdown among ABYM in Kampala, Uganda. Besides, since this study was conducted about 4 months after the first case was reported in Uganda, study findings present more realistic rather than anticipated effects of COVID-19 lockdown. Given the high youth unemployment rate in Kampala [11] , coupled with income and job losses as reported in this study, we believe that these findings will help the government of Uganda, and Kampala Capital City Authority (the body that manages the affairs of Kampala City) in particular, to come up with interventions that can help to improve the socio-economic and mental health status of ABYM in Kampala, Uganda.Our study shows that while awareness of how COVID-19 can be prevented is high, uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures remains sub-optimal. We also found that the COVID-19 lockdown had devastating mental, socioeconomic and healthy effects. COVID-19 lockdown led to increased mental health challenges; inability to access basic needs and access to essential health services; and led to income and job losses due to the closure of businesses during the lockdown. Respondents reported increased engagement in unhealthy behaviours including sedentary life styles characterized by excessive watching of TV and binge eating. These findings suggest a need for continuous health education and health promotion to improve uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures and socio-economic support provided to ABYM to help them to cope with the effects of COVID-19 lockdown. Interventions that provide economic support to ABYM to start or resume their businesses and those that can help to improve their health and mental wellbeing are urgently needed.","Uganda","abstract","2021-01-22",1

It is therefore essential to anticipate the types of diagnostic challenges that can occur and build reliable systems that can limit failures from occurring to support the safety of both patients and clinicians. Improving the flow of patients in and out of healthcare settings can help to improve the safety and quality of care. 6 Several improvement tools are being used in health system delivery to improve the safety of processes, one of which is Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. 7 This tool tries to determine all possible failures to measure the seriousness of the outcome and the frequency of reasons that bring about the failure setting up the precedent actions that help in improving the flow and design of processes. 8, 9 Several studies have shown the impact of the tool in quality improvement initiatives in a different hospital setting and also various processes in care delivery. 10, 11 The basic idea behind FMEA lies on the assumption that risks are linked not only to the odds of failure happening but also to the severity of its outcome and the feasibility of detecting and stopping before it unfolds. 12, 13 During the COVID-19 pandemic, using the FMEA tool might be of use to anticipate potential failures that could occur during admission and transfer of patients in emergency rooms at a non-COVID-19 set-up. This study tries to identify possible common failures that could cause admission of COVID-19 patients to a non-COVID-19 emergency set-up and by doing so to limit possible transmission to patients and staff in the set-up and to generate recommendations for patients and staff safety.The project was done in the adult emergency department of SPHMMC, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (a tertiary teaching hospital). SPHMMC is one of the largest hospitals in Ethiopia, located in the capital. Currently, it is providing both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related healthcare services from all walks of life. The COVID-19 treatment center, Isolation ward, and sampling and testing for COVID-19 were among the COVID related service areas at SPHMMC. The non-COVID-19 related healthcare services which were being provided before the pandemic continued with set-up modification. Among these, an adult emergency is one of the service areas, which provides services to medical and surgical emergencies for patients above 14 years of age. It provides services to patients ranging between 25-30 per day. 14 The project period was from March to May 2020.The team consists of five physicians (two from the emergency department with a specialty in emergency and critical care, two from quality control, and one from IPC-Infection prevention and control), four senior nurses, one nurse assistant, one cleaner, and one security guard working in the adult emergency department.The study population consisted of patients and attendants visiting the adult emergency department, physicians, nurses, nurse assistants (runners), cleaners, and security guards working in the adult emergency department.The cross-sectional study was conducted on patients, attendants, and staff working in and around the adult emergency department.The team studies the complex process of screening for COVID-19, triaging, management, and disposal of patients in the emergency setup.The study consists of four stages which include process mapping that identifies the steps in accessing emergency service flow diagram ( Figure 1 ); the second stage is listing potential indicators of failures that can predispose to COVID-19 transmission at each step. In the third stage, it explores also possible reasons for the occurrence of failure and its effect followed by prioritizing failure modes based on the specific risk priority numbers (RPN). 12 All team members will give an approximate score on the probability of occurrence of failure, its severity, and the probability of its detectability before it could take place. All scores will be added to get maximum RPN and, at the final stage, different recommendations on mechanisms of preventing such failures will be identified. Details of scores attached to each of the processes are described in Table 1 . Ethical approval was given by the institutional review board of St Paul hospital Millennium medical college (reference number: PM23/247) and informed consent was taken from participant's during observation and the aim and outcome of the study was explained accordingly. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.The process map for patient flow in the adult emergency department of SPHMMC is as follows in Figure 1 .Based on the process map identified in Figure 1 , 22 failure modes and 89 possible causes and effects attributed were distinguished with 81 possible recommendations suggested to limit the occurrence of failures on each stage of patient movement from the entry gate of the hospital until the patient is transferred/referred or discharged from the emergency department. The RPN identified runs in the interval of 30-336. On the entry gate of the hospital, screening is done to reduce the chance of letting in possible COVID-19 suspect patients, which is done by asking the history for risk factors and symptoms and assessing signs.At the hospital gate entry, five failure modes that could make COVID-19 transmission easy were identified with 21 associated causes, and 18 measures were plotted to tackle the failures. RPN of these failure modes ranges between 30-112. That patient and attendant do not apply standard precautions was the failure mode identified that scored the highest RPN at this step (Table 2) .At pre-triage, patients coming to the adult emergency department further evaluated whether they are further COVID-19 suspect or not. If they fulfil COVID-19 suspect criteria, they will be transferred to the isolation ward but if they fail to fulfil the criteria they will be triaged and evaluated in the emergency department. Six high-risk failures were detected in total with 27 attributed causes and 20 (Table 3 ).In the triage room of the adult emergency department, six failure modes with 20 possible causes and 19 measures to be taken were suggested. The failure mode identified with maximum RPN (336) in this area is a low index of suspicion, and the minimum RPN (42) was patient bypasses the triage area ( Table 4 ).The adult emergency room has separate zones for patient management based on severity score as green, yellow, orange, red, and black. During this time multiple failures might happen that can predispose to or increase COVID-19 transmission. A total of five failure modes with 21 possible causes were identified and 25 actions to be implemented were plotted. RPN of this failure modes ranges between 60-280. A low index of suspicion was the failure mode that has scored the highest RPN (280) ( Table 5 ).We performed FMEAs in the adult emergency department to go through with the potential loopholes associated with delivering service to patients who visit our emergency department. We found that processes of emergency service differ hugely according to the difference in patient clinical condition and were highly exposed to many failure modes; however, most vulnerabilities identified were common to all processes in the emergency department. These play a great role in devising common improvement actions that can be implemented easily. Using FMEA proactively to simulate potential failures during the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown by other simulation studies too that has used FMEA risk analysis to identify potential failures that could occur in transferring COVID-19 patients. 15 A study by Levy et al 16 has also shown how the FMEA tool has helped them in identifying hazards and implement mitigation strategies in their effort during the establishment of a field hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.The most critical process that could increase COVID-19 transmission at the entry gate of the hospital is that clients do not apply standard precautions when they came to the hospital (RPN=112). This most high-risk failure mode occurs most of the time and is believed to result from a lack of knowledge about precautions (standard and transmission-based), lack of compliance, lack of monitoring mechanism for compliance of precautions, and shortage or absence of precaution facility. We believe that significant improvement can be brought by ensuring the availability of precaution facilities with back up, educating clients about COVID-19 orally and with posters, monitoring the compliance of clients on applying precaution measures with the checklist, by not allowing anyone on the gate to enter without a face mask and ensuring 24*7 availability of screening at the gate and assign a staff member to be responsible. Measures listed under Table 1 were applied to curve the effect and strict monitoring of face mask use at the gate and increasing access for the hygienic facility were among actions implemented.The most high-risk failure that could increase asymptomatic COVID-19 patient admission and transmission in the pre-triaging process is that Pre-triage does not detect the case (COVID-19) ( . This failure mode is difficult to detect and has a severe impact which has resulted from the asymptomatic presentation of the patient, the patient might give a false history, presence of atypical presentation, low index of suspicion, misguided by referral diagnosis, and lack of COVID-19 test for unsuspected cases because of resource limitations. Therefore, educating the public on the consequences of false patient history, and providing training for a high index of suspicion has a great role in this regard.Having a low index of suspicion for COVID-19 as patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 were sent to an isolation ward in the pre-triage room makes a high-risk failure (RPN-336 and 280) in the triaging process and emergency room stay, respectively. A low index of suspicion is believed to have resulted from a misguidance from the diagnosis made in prior checkpoints in the pre-triage and triage area.The main limitation of this study is its failure to study the impact of the interventions proposed. As part of the quality improvement tool, there needs to be continuous efforts to study the implementation of change ideas to generate possible mitigation strategies for future planning.COVID-19 has unique characteristics that we have not encountered before, so proactive analysis of what will happen, what can cause the problems, its effect, and what has to be done to reduce the failures will make us stand ahead of the pandemic and result in reducing its devastating effect. Incorporating the FMEA tool as a quality improvement project during COVID-19 pandemic management is highly commendable and in the long run with disaster management at large as it has a great impact on identifying possible failures in a new system proactively and suggests possible solutions ahead of time that could help in reducing secondary transmission to patients and staff.Risk Management and Healthcare Policy is an international, peerreviewed, open access journal focusing on all aspects of public health, policy, and preventative measures to promote good health and improve morbidity and mortality in the population.

Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 infection occurs either because of altered haemostasis, severe inflammation, endothelial dysregulation or disseminated intravascular coagulation. 1 The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) is increased in patients who are antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, those with a low cluster of differentiation (CD4) counts and virally unsuppressed. 6 Dentan and colleagues showed that tuberculosis is significantly associated with VTE. They, however, found no link between TB and PE but postulated that the occurrence of PE in patients with TB (PWTB) could be explained by hypercoagulability. 7 Clinical and therapeutic challenges exist in PLHIV presenting with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Depending on the patient's ART compliance, viral load, certain differentials arise -especially if the patient is viral unsuppressed where in addition to COVID-19 pneumonia, one considers pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and/or pulmonary TB as differentials.

A day later, COVID-19 results returned positive and the patient was transferred to isolation and added onto dexamethasone and therapeutic anticoagulation. Sputa returned positive for mycobacterium TB a day later, and anti-tuberculosis therapy was added. She remained persistently hypoxic, with a Well's score of 3 placing her at moderate risk for PE, which prompted for a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) being ordered, which demonstrated left lower lobe subsegmental PE.

No data exists, describing the occurrence of PE in such a patient co-infected with all three infectious conditions. Blood investigations revealed results as per Table 1 . Based on the patient's history, clinical, radiological and biochemical findings, a diagnosis of CAP was made, and she was started empirically on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, azithromycin, oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, prednisone and prophylactic clexane® 60 mg daily. Nasopharyngeal swab and sputa were sent for COVID-19 and TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A day later, the COVID-19 PCR result returned as positive. She was initiated onto dexamethasone, vitamin D, zinc, thiamine, ascorbic acid and therapeutic anticoagulation (enoxaparin 60 mg BD). Whilst in the ward she remained hypoxic requiring 100% rebreather mask to maintain an oxygen saturation of over 90%. The sputa TB PCR test returned positive on 24/09/2020, and the patient was initiated onto anti-tuberculosis treatment (Rifafour® 3 tablets with pyridoxine 25 mg daily).However, despite being on treatment for PJP, pulmonary TB and CAP, the patient remained hypoxic with a Wells' score of 3 (heart rate > 100 bpm and prolonged immobilisation) putting her at moderate risk of developing a PE. 11 A CTPA was ordered and revealed bilateral GGO and left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli (Figure 2 ).No evidence of deep vein thrombosis was found. Warfarin 5 mg daily was added to her existing anticoagulation regimen.The final diagnosis made in Miss B.N.S. was that of a PLHIV, virologically unsuppressed, who defaulted ART with a CD4 of 66 with confirmed:• Severe COVID-19: 12, 13, 14 • Pulmonary tuberculosis • Pulmonary embolism She remained hypoxic needing prolonged oxygen supplementation until Day 17 post-admission. On Day 18, she was transferred to a step-down facility off oxygen to continue with her anticoagulation and TB treatment with a view to restarting ART in 6-8 weeks.Individually, HIV, TB and COVID-19 can predispose to thromboembolism. This case report describes the presence of PE in a patient with all aforementioned infectious diseases and the complexities associated with diagnosis in a developing country. No literature could be found on the combination of HIV, TB, COVID-19 and the development of PE in a single patient.Daily clinical patient re-evaluation is a necessity even in the times of COVID-19. This is often neglected as clinical staff are afraid of their well-being and resort to making notes without careful patient re-examination. Together with clinical examination, review of blood investigations and patient's oxygen consumption needs, a management plan could be formulated.The plasma D-dimer test has a low specificity and can be raised in a multitude of conditions including HIV-infection, TB, VTE, PE, COVID-19, pneumonia and increased age. 15, 16, 17, 18 This limited its use in differentiating between the four coexistent medical conditions in our patient, all of which are known to cause elevations in D-dimer levels. This highlights the complexity of diagnosing PE in the context of HIV, TB and COVID-19 infection.The debate on the use of thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is ongoing with most studies currently advocating for its use. 19, 20, 21 Prophylactic anticoagulation has long been recommended for at-risk inpatients with medical conditions such as HIV and/or TB. 22 Pulmonary embolism remains a great masquerader and clinicians must maintain a level of vigilance for diagnosing this life-threatening medical condition, more especially during the COVID-19 infection era.http://www.sajhivmed.org.za Open AccessApproval was obtained from the patient, King Edward VIII Hospital and the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health.This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analysed in this study.","South Africa","first author","2021-01-28",1

For instance, pregnant women need a minimum of eight contacts with health care providers to reduce perinatal mortality and improve the experience of care. 10 But currently, there are difficulties to pursue schedules as usual due to the pandemic. For instance, appointments made online are most challenging in the context of our country Ethiopia, and in some situations, the schedules might be cancelled unless they are emergency cases. 11, 12 The aforementioned preventive practices of COVID-19 might compromise the quality of maternal health care services given by healthcare providers from diagnosis to counselling as a prescription of medications. 13 There are shreds of evidence that show a reduction in the contact rate of a pregnant woman with a health care provider significantly associated with perinatal death. 1, 14 Another evidence shows that the majority of the complications of pregnancy can be averted due to counselling based on schedules of antenatal care. 15 Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge. Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant good practices. 16 Despite these facts, there are plenty of evidence as every pregnant woman is at risk and their follow-up should not be compromised as to end the course of pregnancy with the health of the mother and the neonate. But, currently, excessive worry/fear of pregnant women of COVID-19 and shift of government's attention towards preventive practices may lead to increased maternal, neonatal, and child mortality indirectly from the progression of fear to advanced psychological disorders. However, there is limited evidence that shows the current status of fear and knowledge of COVID-19 on the preventive practices of pregnant women. Therefore, this study aimed to assess fear and knowledge of COVID-19 on the preventive practices of pregnant women attending antenatal care in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the effect of fear and knowledge of COVID-19 on the preventive practices of pregnant women in northwest Ethiopia from July 01 to 30, 2020.Source of Population: All pregnant women attending antenatal care services in the public health facilities of Gondar town.Study Population: All pregnant women attending antenatal care services in the public health facilities of Gondar town during the data collection period.Inclusion Criteria: All pregnant women who were attending antenatal care service in selected public health facilities of Gondar town during the study period were included in the study.Exclusion Criteria: Pregnant women who were seriously ill and unable to communicate throughout the study period were excluded.The single population proportion formula was used with the assumption of a 95% confidence interval, 5% margin of error, 50% proportion, and as there was no similar study in the area, a 10% non-response rate was taken to determine the final sample size of 422. Finally, participants were proportionally allocated to the six health facilities in the town based on the number of pregnant women who visited each health facility (Maraki clinic= 30, Gabriel clinic= 20, Loza clinic=60, Azezo clinic=40, Poly clinic=80, University of Gondar referral hospital=192) respectively. During the preceding 3 months before data collection. Then, the study participants were selected through a systematic random sampling technique. The K interval/fraction was calculated by K = N/n = where N=total number of pregnant women attending antenatal care per month from a single public health facility in Gondar town and n=the required sample that should be taken per health facility. Then, to start the interview, we used the lottery method from the first pregnant woman attending antenatal care to the value of k antenatal care submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of Women's Health 2021:13 attendee per a given health facility. Then, the interview started with the selected antenatal care attendee and continued by recruiting every k value of pregnant woman antenatal care attendee and based on their sequence of exit after check-up up to the required 422 participants.Data were collected by using pre-tested face-to-face interview questions with a minimum of one-meter distance between interviewers and interviewees. The questions first prepared in English were translated to Amharic, and back to English for consistency. The questions included: socio-demographic characteristics, and fear-related factor (7 questions), knowledge assessment questions (24 questions); and practice assessment (14 questions). Four BSc degree graduates and two MSc holding midwives collected the data and supervised the process, respectively. Both data collectors and supervisors got a one-day training before the actual work about the aim of the study, procedures, necessary precautions, ways of collecting and ensuring the confidentiality of information gained from respondents. 16, 17 Operational Definitions Good knowledgeable of COVID-19: Participants who scored the mean (13.93) and above the mean on knowledge questions.Poor knowledgeable of COVID-19: Participants who scored below the mean (13.93) on knowledge questions.Have fear towards COVID-19: Participants who scored the mean (23.68) and above on fear questions.Have no fear towards COVID-19: Participants who scored below the mean (23.68) on fear questions.Good preventative of COVID-19: Participants who scored the mean (7.69) and above on practice items.Poor preventative practice towards COVID-19: Participants who scored below the mean (7.69) on practice items.All the data were checked visually, and then it was coded and entered into Epi Info version 7, and it was finally exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 for analysis. Frequencies, percentages, summary statistics like mean and standard deviation were examined to describe the data. Binary logistic regression was run to see the crude significant relations of each independent variable with the total preventive practice score. Then, variables with P-value <0.2 in bi-variable logistic regression were again entered into multivariable logistic regressions. Finally, significant factors were identified based on adjusted odds ratio (AOR) which included a 95% confidence level at P-value <0.05.A total of 422 pregnant women with a response rate of 100% participated in the study. More than half (55.9%) of the respondents were aged 26-35 years with a mean age of (27.56 ± 5.031) years.

The average family income is =<2500ETB accounting 87.0% of the participants (Table 1) .Most of the participants, (35.1%) and (32.9%), were Gravida I, II, while only 21.3% and 10% were Gravida III and IV, respectively. In term parity, 37.0% were para zero, 32.5% I, 20.6% II, 8.3% III, and 1.7% >III para. Of the entire participants, 23.0%, 27.7%, 23.7%, and 25.5% had 1st, 2nd, 3rd and ≥4th ANC visits, respectively (Table 2) .Half (50.9%) of the respondents have fear for the Preventive practices of COVID-19, 55% had good knowledge of the preventive and 47.4% of them have good preventive practice towards COVID-19 (Table 3) .Variables that were significantly associated in the bivariate analysis were further examined in multivariate logistic regression of the variables included in the multivariate logistic regression model based on their P value in the This institution-based cross-sectional study attempted to assess the effects of fear and knowledge of COVID-19 on preventive practice among pregnant women who attend antenatal care in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia.In this study, out of the total 422 participants, 47.4% had good preventive practice for COVID-19. This finding goes with a study done in Jimma and. 16 It is higher than those of studies done in Thailand (13.6%), 3 Iran (16.7%), 18 and China who had better preventive practice. 19 The preventive practice of COVID-19 in this study is, however, much lower when compared to studies done in Iran & china in which 89% of the participants practiced the prevention of COVID-19. 18, 19 The underlying reason for these differences could be the period and the place in which the studies were conducted.The majority of the respondents (55%) had good knowledge of the preventive practices of COVID-19. This finding is in line with a study done on educated Ethiopians in which 52.2% had good knowledge. 17 The results of the current study regarding respondents' knowledge are also lower (26.6%) compared with that of a study done in Thailand. 3 The results of this study are also higher compared with a study done in Jimma (41.3%). 16 This could be due to differences in the level of information regarding COVID-19.In the current study, respondent's knowledge and fear were significantly associated with the preventive practice of COVID-19. Those who have good knowledge were 2.3 times more likely to have good prevention practice of COVID-19 as compared with their counterparts. This finding is consistent with studies done among educated Ethiopians. 17 The study also showed that pregnant women who had fear for COVID-19 were about 2.5 times more likely to have good prevention practices than those counterparts. The finding agrees with those of studies done in Iran 20 and Taiwan. 6 This could be due to people who fear to acquire and transmit the disease could take care of themselves, and better comply with preventive practice recommendations.As in any cross-sectional study, cause and effect relationship was not possible to establish for the factors dealt with in the study. In addition, a shortage of similar studies carried out in Ethiopia has limited the comparison and discussion of results.Only half of the pregnant women had good preventive practice. The findings suggest that healthcare bodies should consider these findings to develop strategies for preventive practice against COVID-19.

The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 30, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, P.R. China [2] .This causative virus was temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the resulting disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by the World Health Organization [3] . On March 11th, the WHO formally announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic. COVID-19 was confirmed to have reached Morocco on March 2th 2020, when the first COVID-19 case confirmed in Casablanca was a Moroccan immigrant who came from Italy on February 27th, 2020.Since the very beginning of human civilization, plants have been an essential supply for prevention and healing for humans and livestock, especially in developing countries. This is illustrated by the following Fig. 1 . Geographical Location of the study area, Salé -Morocco [9] .varied vegetation, and is rich in plant species. Moreover, Moroccans have excellent medical knowledge and traditional experience of basic medicinal plants [8] .Morocco, as is the case in other countries internationally, notably in emerging countries, has seen the relocation of the rural population towards cities which is considered a significant phenomenon of the twentieth century that has led to rapid economic, social and cultural changes. This study aimed to investigate traditional herbalists use of plants for therapeutic purposes in response to the coronavirus pandemic in the Salé Prefecture, Morocco, during 2020.Salé is located in North-Western Morocco, right on the Atlantic coast, near the Moroccan capital Rabat. Its approximate geographic location is 34°3 ′ 11 Northern latitude and 6°47 ′ 54 Western longitude ( Fig. 1 ) .Founded in about 1030 by Arabic-speaking Berbers, the Banu Ifran later became a haven for pirates in the 17th century as an independent republic, before being incorporated into Alaouite Morocco. The total surface area of Salé is 672 km 2 with a population of about 890 403 inhabitants, according to the 2014 Moroccan census [9] .Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Sale has a mild, moderate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in summer. The winter typically gets as cold as 17.2°C during December-February. As for summer, daytime the temperature usually range from 25°C and may occasionally exceed 30°C, especially during heatwaves.Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between 11°C and 19°C and rarely exceeding 20°C. Salé belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560 mm [10] .At the time the study was conducted (March 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020), the Ministry of Health in Morocco had reported that 7 807 con-firmed COVID-19 cases had been reported nationally. Out of the cases, 225 were from Salé ( Fig. 2 ) , including Tabriquet (75 cases), Hssaine (89 cases), Bettana (36 cases), Lamrissa (17 cases), and Bouknadel (8 cases). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was performed at the military hospital laboratory Mohammed V, in Rabat. RT-PCR assays were performed following the protocol established by the World Health Organization (WHO). The largest number of patients (198) had been admitted to Moulay Abdellah Hospital Salé. The rest of the patients continued their treatment at the Military Hospital Mohammed V, in Rabat [6] .As for the treatment protocol, the Moroccan health authorities allowed their hospitals to use antimalarial drugs to treat novel coronavirus. The Minister of Health, Mr. Khaled Ait Taleb, invited, through a note addressed to the directors of the hospital centers, who receive COVID-19 patients to use the drugs ""Hydroxychloroquine"", ""Azithromycin"" ""Paracetamol"", ""Zinc sulfate"", and ""Vitamin C"" to treat the cases with symptoms of the virus.The herbalists in Morocco are male and female, and older than 20 years of age. The training to become an herbalist is usually either through an inherited traditional knowledge from parents, or acquired through formal training. Among the herbalists, some followed old popular lifestyle, while others, notably the young, were more associated with a modern western lifestyle. These herbalists fall under a legal framework called the ""Union of Moroccan Herbalists (UMH)"". Unfortunately, there are no official statistics on their total number. From a legislative point of view, the profession of herbalists in Morocco is regulated by three legal chapters all dated before 1960:• The Dahir of February 27, 1923 (corresponding to Rajab 11, 1341 AH), subjecting the practice of herbalist to the provisions of the Dahir of April 12, 1916 , whose second article is: ""it is especially forbidden for herbalists to sell any poisonous or toxic plants"" [11] . A semi structured questionnaire was prepared in order to document indigenous anti-coronavirus plant use , traditional knowledge and the level of utilization of traditional medicinal plants for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. A total of 30 herbalists (24 male and 06 female) from different districts of the Prefecture of Salé, namely (Bab Lmrissa: 10 herbalists, Tabriquet: 7 herbalists, Laayayda: 6 herbalists, Bettana: 4 herbalists and Bouknadel: 3 herbalists) participated. The data was collected through face-to-face interviews over the period of March 1st, 2020 to May 31th, 2020, ranging from 20 to 40 min. The interview period corresponded to the period when the coronavirus first began spreading in Morocco and in other parts of the world. The interviews were mostly carried in the local language (Arabic Moroccan dialect) spoken by the herbalists in the study area.The inclusion criteria was that the herbalist had to be a qualified healthcare professional and had always lived in the area. Herbalists were excluded if they did not live in the study area. Although quarantine was imposed on all the inhabitants of Morocco; including the inhabitants of Salé Prefecture, the shops of herbalists remained open to their customers to buy necessities, which made it easier for us to visit them and conduct interviews on this subject. The information gathered during the present study included socio-demographic characteristics of the interviewed herbalists (age, gender, academic level, and experience in herbalism) and ethnopharmacological information, including the local and scientific name of the species, local names, plant parts used, modes of use, conservation method, administration mode and toxicity, all documented data were then translated into English and Latin ( Appendix A ).Medicinal plants being mentioned by the herbalists were recorded with local names and photographed. Each reported medicinal plant species was gathered, compressed, dehydrated, and identified. The identification and nomenclature of the collected vegetal material was done first in the field and completed at the Plant, Animal Productions and Agroindustry Laboratory by our great Moroccan botanist Zidane L. These plant species mentioned by the sources were taxonomically identified using floristic and taxonomic references, especially 'The medicinal plants of Morocco' [14] , 'Practical flora of Morocco', volumes I, II and III [15] [16] [17] and 'Catalogs of vascular plants of northern Morocco', including identification keys, volumes I and II [18] . Taxonomy and denominations of species were validated using ""The Plant List 2020 "" database ( http://www.theplantlist.org ). All voucher specimens have been preserved during documentation and deposited in the Ibn Tofail University, Morocco Herbarium for future reference.The study was authorized by the ethical committee of Ibn Tofail University. Before starting data collection, we obtained oral informed permission in each case on a site level and then individually before each interview. We also informed herbalists that it was a student academic project and the investigation was only for our research purposes, not for any financial or other benefits. Herbalists provided verbal informed consent to engage in this study; they were free to withdraw their information at any point of time. Those informants accepted freely to the interview and consented to have their names and personal data to be published.The data obtained from the field and collected from the herbalists were classified and examined with the statistical program IBM SPSS Statistics 21 Premium (SPSS 2019), to determine the proportions of different variables such as socio-demographics of the herbalists and ethnopharmacological data. Quantitative value indices were also calculated for the general uses of these medicinal plants using the use reports (UR) and medicinal use-value (MUV).• Use reports (UR) and Medicinal use-value (MUV) The use reports (UR) of a species or its importance in the culture of a community is denoted by its mentioning rate or its mention frequency by herbalists. The UR of the species of plants being utilized was evaluated using the formula: UR = N i n [19] . Where, N i is the number of times a particular species was mentioned, and n is the total number of times that all species were mentioned.The MUV of recorded medicinal plants was determined by applying the following formula [20] :∑ U R i : the total number of use reports per plants and N is the total of interviewees questioned for given medicinal species. The MUV rate will be more important if there are several useful records for a species, implying that the plant is significant, whereas they will be near 0 if there are few reports compared to its use [21] .In total, 30 herbalists were interrogated using semi-structured questionnaires. 33.33% of the surveyed herbalists were from five Districts: Bab Lamrissa, 23.34% were from Tabriquet, 20% were from Laayayda, 13.33% were from Bettana and 10% were from Bouknadel ( Table 1 ). In the Prefecture of Salé, both genders were interested in herbal medicines. However, the number of male participants was higher (24 herbalists) than females participants (6 herbalists). In this study, results showed that the utilization of medicinal species was widespread in all age groups. The majority of herbalists interviewed were over 50 years old (22) , while 17 of the informants were between 30 and 50 years old. One of them was younger than thirty years old. Regarding the academic level, our results showed that more than half of the herbalists (53.3%) had secondary education, 26.7% had primary education, 16.7% were illiterate and only 3.3% of the herbalists had graduate education.The present research showed that a total of 20 plant species belonging to 20 genera and 14 families were frequently used by herbalists from Salé Prefecture in the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The family Lamiaceae was represented by the largest number of plant species (three species, 15%), whereas Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Myrtaceae contributed with two species to each family. The remaining nine botanical families were represented by one species in each. The vernacular names, scientific names of documented species, their families, mode of preparations, used parts, MUV, and UR were illustrated in Table 2 .Plants intended for medicinal use are utilized to find the most frequently used plant species in the study area. Its value ranged from 0.200 to 0.967 ( Table 2 In our study area, different plant parts harvest for the preparation of herbal remedies (e.g., seed, root, flower, and leaf). The interview results revealed that leaves were the most frequently used part of the medicinal plants 28.43% of the total, followed by the seed (17.5%), whole plant (13%), bulb (11.27%), rhizome (8.4%), other parts (7.6%), flower (7%) and fruit (6.8%) ( Table 2 ).In Salé Prefecture, the bulk of the herbal remedies (70.8%) were made from fresh material followed by their dried form (29.2%). Preparations in the most cases were obtained from individual plants, but some plant compounds were also reported. The preparation of ancestral medicine needs components and solutions. The major solvent was water, but milk, butter, tea, and honey, cereal oils and vinegar, were equally extensively used ingredients. Concerning the preparation of herbal medicine, herbalists employ various methods of preparation for COVID-19. The principal method of traditional medicine preparation reported was infusion (34.63%), followed by decoction (25.1%), powder (15.2%), and maceration (13.8%). The percentage of the other modes of preparation grouped (cataplasm, fumigation, cream, bath, and plaster) did not exceed 11.27% ( Table 2 ) .Herbalists (23) perceived the common COVID-19 as a combination of several symptoms. The most frequent ones were fever, tiredness, sore throat, loss of taste and smell, headache, and dry cough. The rest of the herbalists (7) presented other different combinations of described symptoms. Anecdotally, herbalists have claimed herbal medicines and kept them healthy or improved their symptoms. However, the bulk of research on these herbs used is inconclusive. Besides, herbalists believed that the treatment with herbal remedies for 7 days led to a marked improvement in the rate of recovery from symptoms, and the herbalists reported that the herbal capsules shortened the duration of fever by three days and symptoms of fatigue.Natural products have always been intriguing to scientists for drug research to develop novel candidates. COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a deadly infectious disease against which no specific drug or vaccine is available, yet. Medicinal plants are considered very useful by traditional healers in many societies to prevent and to treat several diseases and ailments. Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, various traditional herbal medicines have been used and resulted in positive health effects among COVID-19 patients, mainly in Salé Prefecture.In this study, both genders are interested in herbal medicines. However, the numbers of male participants were higher than those of females. Men were predominantly represented in the sample because of their work. Females were rarely found at herbal markets during our interviews. These outcomes validate the findings of other ethnobotanical national and international studies [ 60 , 61 ] which have confirmed that men are predominantly knowledgeable in traditional herbs. Regarding the age groups, results showed that herbalists over 50 years This indicates that with a greater level of instruction, the experience of traditional herbal medicine decreases. Therefore, advanced instruction reduces the ancestral therapeutic knowledge of the young generation [62] . Previous ethnobotanical studies [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] report similar findings. All stated that they had acquired their traditional knowledge and experience in medicinal plants from their parents, friends, and elderly relatives. 41.18% of the herbalists had experience as herbalists over 20 years. The present study revealed that a total of 20 medicinal species relating to 19 genera and 14 botanical families were generally utilized by herbalists in the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The Lamiaceae family was present in a high number of medicinal plants (3 species, 15%). The calculated results of MUV showed that Eucalyptus globulus Labill. was ranked first (MUV = 0.967) followed by Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (MUV = 0.933), and Ziziphus lotus (L.) Lam. (MUV = 0.9). These results are similar to international work, particularly in Pakistan. These medicinal species having high MUV must be further assessed for phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies to identify their active constituents for an effective and non-toxic drug extraction.The interview results revealed that leaves are the most frequently used part of the medicinal plants 28.4% of the total, followed by the seed (17.5%), and the whole plant (13%). The choice of leaves was due to its easy availability, collection, and simplicity in drug preparation. Furthermore, photosynthesis takes place in the leaves, and sometimes the storage of the secondary metabolites is effective for the biological characteristics of the medicinal plant. Comparable conclusions showed leaves as a main principal plant part in Morocco [68] [69] [70] [71] and in Africa [72] [73] [74] for herbal medicine preparation.In Salé Prefecture, most of the drugs (70.8%) were prepared from fresh substances. The research carried by Abdurrahman [75] registered that 86% of products were in a fresh form, [76] declared that most of (64%) plant species were employed in fresh form and 36% in freezedried form. Jima et al., [77] indicated that the preponderance of the drugs (78.6%) were prepared from fresh pieces of plant species. The dependency of herbalists on fresh substances is often due to the effectiveness of fresh plant species in therapy as the ingredients are not lost before practice related to the dried plant forms.The main method for herbal medicine preparation described was infusion (34.63%). The frequent employment of the infusion can be justified by the fact that it makes it possible to accumulate the multiple effective components and attenuates or eliminates some remaining poisonous ingredients. Ethnobotanical studies conducted in other parts of Morocco found that the majority of informants prepared herbal remedies by infusion and decoction [78] [79] [80] . This result corroborates the fact that there is an ongoing transfer of knowledge on the effectiveness of plant species between the inhabitants of Morocco.These medicinal plants contain a wide variety of bioactive compounds including flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, eriodictyol, naringenin, and luteolin), alkaloids (pyrrolidine, pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, and quinazoline), saponins (escinidin, glycryrrhizin, saikosaponin B2), terpenes (curcumin, betulinic acid, savinin, iguesterin, dihydrotanshinone I, cryptotanshinone, 3friedelanol, chrysanthemumin B), coumarins (leptodactylone, xan-thoangelol E), organosulfur compounds, glycosides, secoiridoid, tannin, mucus, lignans, anthraquinones, aromatic constituents, phenolic lipids, carotenoids, steroids, and many other compounds. The plant species in this mixture also include a large number of essential oils.A large number of chemicals and compounds extracted from different higher plants is responsible for many pharmacological effects [81] [82] [83] such as antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antipyretic antiseptic, antibiotic, analgesic, antitumor, anticancer, antiallergic, antiatherogenic, antimutagenic, and antinociceptive activities.A variable number of alkaloids such as emetine, tylophorine, and mycophenolate mofetil have been reported to be very significant antiviral compounds [ 84 , 85 ] . Chloroquine is a good candidate, asynthetic derivative of quinine for the development of an effective drug to treat COVID-19 because of its DNA-intercalating properties [86] . The isoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine could inhibit the expression of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in SARS-CoV-OC43 in human lung cells [87] .Essential oils (Chamazulene, Limonene, Thymol, Eucalyptol, Verbenone, -Terpinene, Sabinene, trans-Anethole, Caryophyllene, Linalool, Disulfide, Myrcene, Camphenilone, Camphene, Camphor, Borneol, Menthol, Eugenol, Carvacrol, Myrtenol, Verbenone, etc.) from many medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Salvia officinalis L. Pimpinella anisum L., Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck, Eugenia caryophyllata Thunb., and other aromatic plants with antiviral activities were well documented by several researchers [ 83 , 88-90 ] . Eucalyptol, a vital essential oil from Eucalyptus globulus Labill. was identified as an effective antiviral compound against coronavirus, especially COVID-19 because this major component of eucalyptus oil consists of ether (-O), ketone ( = O), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups which play the main inhibitory role against SARS-CoV-2 [91] . Essential oils can insert nonspecifically into the lipid double layer of the viral envelope, which alters the fluidity of the membrane [89] .The antimicrobial activity of alkaloids has been extensively reviewed [ 92 , 93 ] . Recently, Özçelik et al., [94] published another comprehensive review on this subject. The review considered many alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids with antimicrobial activity and reported that bioactive alkaloids could be found within acridone-, aporphine-, benzophenanthridine-, bisbenzylisoquinoline-, indole-, isoquinoline-, piperidine-, protoberberine-, quinoline-, terpenoid-and steroid-type alkaloids. Flavonoid derivatives have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses such as HSV, HIV, Coxsackie B virus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, poliomyelitis virus, rhinovirus, rotavirus, poliovirus, sindbis virus, and rabies virus [ 95 , 96 ] . Phenolic compounds, polyphenols, steroids, terpenoids, other active phytochemicals, and their derivatives are common plant secondary metabolites that contain aromatic rings with 1 or several hydroxyl groups. For a wide range of viruses, several studies confirmed the abovementioned activity of several phenolic antiviral compounds such as curcumin, luteolin-7glucoside, epicatechin gallate, catechin, demethoxycurcumin, bavachinin, apigenin-7 glucoside, silvestrol, hypericin, psoralidin, mycophenolate mofetil, corylifol, and tomentin [ 85 , 97 , 98 ] . According to Wink [90] , polyphenols are capable of binding easily with the lipoproteins of the virus envelope, which can prevent the viral invasion in host cells.Even though herbal remedies may seem harmless, if misused, they could increase a person's risk for COVID-19. We may find that certain herbs are effective in preventing and treating COVID-19 for some people, however, there currently is not enough data regarding the use of herbal remedies for the novel coronavirus. According to the World Health Organization, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure COVID-19.There is no information provided about the pharmacological efficacy of the medicinal plant species in this study. These are the reported herbs that were being used for COVID-19 symptoms, the effects of which remain unknown.Our study showed that medicinal plants continue to play an essential role in the fundamental healthcare system for the local people living in the Salé Prefecture. Herbalists appear to have a beneficial role in the healthcare of the local population, despite the revolution in modern health technology. The abundance of plant species documented for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is a major indication of the potential that exists locally, so long as the scientific procedure is added to the indigenous knowledge. Furthermore, additional research on the sustainable use and conservation of medicinal species is highly suggested. Finally, pharmacological, phytochemical, and toxicological investigations on medicinal plant species with possible anti-COVID-19 effects are carried out for laboratory validation of the ancestral uses of these plants and to obtain the traditional medicines bios. A combination of natural products or herbal mixtures with validated anti-COVID-19 drugs may constitute a promising preventive and therapeutic alternative but should be assessed.NC: Methodology, investigation, compiled the literature sources, data analysis, evaluation, and interpretation, realization manuscript, helped in data, and made a substantial contribution to data analysis.

These are 1) ""race science,"" the largely discredited idea that race has a basis in the natural world and is therefore ultimately ""verifiable by science,"" 2) race as a social construct, meaning that race emerges from the social meanings that are gathered from ""natural physiological differences,"" 3) race as a driver of historical progress that underlies differing teleologies to a so-called developed modernity (what white nationalists often argue). In her fourth offer, Russell contends that, at its most fruitful, thinking with race as a technology allows us to move beyond the question of what race is and instead ask what race does.In my role as an anthropologist, my fieldwork brought me not to the researchers of life science but their clinical practitioners, in the tense and tender interactions between clinical medicine and patients in South African fertility clinics. These are often overlooked moments in thinking about race in the life sciences; the legacy of ""race science"" and notions of genetic difference looms long and large. But genetics is not the only space for locating ideas of racial difference. As Anne Pollock argues: Race in biomedicine does not originate in the science and filter down to the doctors' offices; neither does it simply filter up. It does slightly different work in each sphere, but gains its durability through its capacity to travel between them. (2012, 5) Less a question of its ""realness"" in office spaces, race certainly has very real effects. These effects I contextualize and embed in South Africa. As Russell has previously argued (2016), voices on the margin need to also be brought forth to the centre of philosophical and bioethical discussions of justice. Thinking about legacies and lessons and manifestations of race and bioethics need not always centre U.S. histories. In those moments in South Africa like the vignette below, race is a category that shapes all manner and measure of interactions, decisions, and engagement between staff and patients. While life scientists have done well to argue against a biological basis for racialized difference, I, like Russell, encourage them to recognize the biological effects of racism. These include, but are not limited to, the ongoing mistrust between medical institutions and many communities and the enduring health disparities emerging from racialized political economy.During my fieldwork in fertility clinics, I often sat with clinic staff as they explained to patients how IVF worked and guided them through the key decisions that they would have to make in the coming weeks. Despite spending three months at one clinic, I encountered only a single black couple coming in for IVF. Like many spaces of post-apartheid life, fertility clinics in South Africa are deeply segregated spaces. While white people make up less than 10 per cent of the population, the vast majority of IVF patients and all the professional medical staff that I met were white. 1 Patients were more diverse, including some patients from nearby Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, but the majority were also white. No doubt the high cost of IVF cycles in private clinics-and twelve of fifteen fertility clinics in South Africa are private-becomes a de facto form of racial segregation as wealth remains cloistered among a persistently white local elite.A black couple came in one day searching for biomedical solutions for their problem -married for two years and they had yet to fall pregnant. Both had children from previous partnerships but desired a child together. Originally from Mthata, a regional hub in the Eastern Cape, the couple now lived near Cape Town, where the man, Fundani, ran and owned a shebeen, an informal local tavern. Estie, the clinic staff member, came to explain IVF and ask them questions about their relationship, understanding of the process, and experience of trying to conceive. At least that would be the typical procedure I had seen from her on several occasions. This case began similarly but quickly veered into discourses of racialized culturalism that endure in white spaces of South Africa. While race science-the notion of race being a biologically-rooted form of difference-provided a form of ""scientific legitimacy"" to the apartheid regime, culture was also a significant fulcrum of difference in the logic of South African white supremacy (Dubow 1995) . This too was backed with ""science,"" as volkekunde anthropologists contributed the theoretical backing for social segregation along demarcations of culture (Sharp 2007) . Racialized culturalism refers to the ways that ""culture"" emerges as a rationale for racial difference, a discourse I had all too often been privy to as a white person living in South Africa today.In the clinic, as I observed, Estie, who was white, asked Fundani and Colleen how long they had been ""struggling to fall pregnant."" Two years, they saidsince their wedding. Then, Estie continued, ""In black culture, it's much more difficult when you want a baby; your wife can be an outcast. But it's different in your case because you both have children. In your culture, you must have a child."" They nodded along as she spoke. Estie continued, asking about their relationship; ""No fights?"" No, Fundani and Colleen said, no fights. ""Do you have enough money to raise the child?"" Fundani nodded. ""How much was lobolo 2 ? How many cattle?"" Fundani chuckled but didn't answer. ""Were you married traditionally?"" Yes, Colleen said. ""Do you have just the one wife or more than one wife?"" He said just one wife. Estie asked what he did, and he said he sold beer. ""You have a shebeen? Are you a drinker? Alcohol can hurt those sperms that we need for making the baby."" He said that he didn't drink, and his wife, Colleen, reiterated, ""No, no, he doesn't drink, he's a good man."" These are questions and allusion that I never saw lobbed at white couples.When it came time for the couple to make some medical decisions-How did they feel about freezing extra embryos? Did they want to use the more expensive incubator?-Fundani asked the medical professionals to leave the room and instead asked me, the outsider anthropologist, what I thought they should do. I was, and am, not a medical professional; I couldn't offer medical advice and was clear about that. He asked why the extra cost for freezing? I explained why freezing costs money-liquid nitrogen, storage space-but also why it can be beneficial to have frozen embryos rather than ""start from scratch."" He seemed satisfied with my explanations-and my limitations as someone without 1 I conducted fieldwork in three clinics in urban centres of South Africa. The racial homogeneity was and is not the case for all clinics across the country; however, fertility medical staff remain predominantly white. For instance, at the time of my fieldwork in 2015−2016, all the physicians in Cape Town were white. medical training. After the couple left, I spoke with the medical staff about the situation. ""We should have a translator here next time,"" mused Estie. Estie thought it was an issue of language. I thought it was an issue of trust, and one that went both ways. In my reading, Estie did not trust Fundani and Colleen. Their racial difference marked them as suspect and having questionable motives for parenthood and family relations, and she suspected they lacked in resources to pay for treatment and care for a potential child. In response, Fundani and Colleen clearly did not trust Estie, nor the other medical staff. In my reading, they felt the mistrust and in turn worried that were being potentially duped-that the clinic staff were after their money rather than helping them with their problem. Ironically, I believe that Estie's line of questioning came from a place of concern with providing what some medical programmes refer to as ""culturally competent care"" (see Jenks 2010) .One often thinks of mistrust in medical institutions as arising from specific and infamous moments of unethical research. For instance, in the introduction to their special issue on public trust and expert knowledge, Camporesi, Vaccarella, and Davis (2017) reference the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in the United States, where doctors knowingly withheld treatment for six hundred black men. In South Africa, we have fresh in our minds the apartheid-era Project Coast and the plans (recounted in the late 1990s Truth and Reconciliation Commission) of biological warfare against the black population using, but not limited to, the dissemination of anthrax, the purposeful deployment of cholera in high-density neighbourhoods, and the use of sterilizing oral contraception (Fassin 2015) . And yet the public are also comprised of people, each with their individual tales of doctor-patient interactions, and many like Fundani and Colleen.The need for a thinking about race and the institutions of life sciences has become ever more urgent. The world has changed immensely in the mere weeks since Russell set out her call for collaboration between bioethics and life sciences on the lessons of race. In those weeks, COVID-19 has, as of this writing, emerged in nearly three million confirmed cases, and claimed the lives of at least several hundred thousand. 3 I, along with nearly a third of the world, am under lockdown, connected to friends, family, and news of the world via WhatsApp and Zoom. While our intimate connections are increasingly framed as threats in themselves, the information connections flourish, allowing for a different kind of threat. State health officials and researchers' peer-reviewed work sits side by side with the ramblings of the U.S. president and other dubious sources. Our present condition flattens credibility, confusing questions of validity and expertise. In South Africa, where I write and reside, I have read online that drinking hot tea can kill the virus. There is an ongoing theory about its source involving the Chinese state and 5G installations. A member of parliament wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa asking for clarification on why Bill Gates had been in Cape Town earlier in the year (for a charity tennis match), citing rumours that the billionaire had come to discuss secret vaccine trials in Africa.Like many rumours and theories, the latter comes with scaffolds of present and historical truths. In early April, two French scientists discussed on television whether to test a COVID vaccine on Africans. After public denouncements, they attempted to clarify that they merely wanted to ensure that Africa was included in vaccine trials. As Fiona Ross (2020) writes, ""We do not come to this disease as tabula rasa."" This is true in more ways than one. Many South Africans come to COVID with durable legacies (see Stoler 2016) of apartheid-era Project Coast and contemporary enduring and daily experiences of racism. Many South Africans know well the biopolitical stratifications of life and how medicine has often worked alongside those stratifications, if not sedimented in them.When the virus first came to South Africa, many suggested that it only affected white people. This was bolstered by the fact that the first cases were all white people, those coming from holidays abroad. As Adia Benton (2020) describes, ""Viruses move in bodies, and the freedom of certain bodies, certain people, to move across borders needs to be acknowledged."" This is an acknowledgement to counter the common narrative that viruses know no border, no class, no race. Viruses, this narrative goes, reduce us all to mere biology: deracialized, decontextualized biology. The statistics would beg to differ. In the United States, early figures from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show that 33 per cent of COVID hospitalizations were among black patients, despite them comprising 18 per cent of the population in the catchment area. Health disparities, an effect of racism and economic stratifications, underly the differing co-morbidities of hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung disease (CDC 2020). This is certainly in the minds of South Africa's political and public health leaders, who have implemented one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Efforts to slow the spread approach dry tinder: a population largely impoverished by decades of white supremist rule, many immunosuppressed from HIV/AIDS, one of the highest rates of tuberculosis, and living in high-density neighbourhoods. The understanding that the social emerges in biology, or what Margaret Lock (1993) referred to as ""local biologies,"" has gained greater traction in recent years. Epigenetics research now suggests the enduring impression of social stratification in genetic expression (Krieger 2000; Kuzawa and Sweet 2009 ). Legacies of racism may now be etched in bodies in ways surprisingly material and frustratingly durable (Meloni 2017) .These twinned legacies-mistrust of scientific expertise and institutions and enduring racial health disparities-are of course interrelated. They come from moments that make headlines and moments that do not. I do not know if Fundani and Colleen ever came back for IVF treatment or if they ever became pregnant. They certainly understood the roots of the treatment they experienced at the clinic and, I surmise, felt they weren't getting proper care as a result. Regardless of the ontological status of race in that moment, whether it came in the form of racialized culturalism or scientific racism, the impacts of it were immediate. The current global pandemic brings the need for bioethicists, social scientists, and life scientists to work collaboratively and reflexively to recognize the complicated place of race, both historically and in the present, to ever greater urgency. Simultaneously to that, we also need to reflect on whether we (and here I include anthropologists like myself) deserve any such trust to have these conversations and to have them well. Many disciplines, life and social sciences alike, have legacies that long need understanding, reflecting, and ideally upending in order to move forward with this critical work.","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-05",1

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were > 1,500,000 accumulative cases universally, with a ~ 5.9% case mortality reported in April 2020 [3] . One of the most significant challenges is the absence of a specific vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 [4] . Repositioning of approved drugs is therefore required as the fast track in the fight against COVID-19 infection [5] [6] [7] . Since January 2020, several clinical trials have tested antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malarial drugs for treating COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] . Among these drugs, remdesivir (GS-5734) is the most promising drug candidate to combat COVID-19 [11, 12] . Consequently, remdesivir has been recently declared to have a positive influence in a clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 [13] . Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog antiviral drug, targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 and, in turn, prevents viral replication [11] . Prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 replication could also be achieved by targeting the viral main protease (M pro ) (also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro )) and papain-like protease (PL pro ). Because of the essential role of M pro in the viral life cycle, numerous experimental and in silico studies have attempted to identify small molecules, natural products, and repurposed drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Until now, the outcomes of the initiated clinical trials for protease inhibitors have not yet been released [18, 24, 25] . Therefore, the present study was set to investigate eighteen drugs in clinical development as potential M pro inhibitors using in silico drug discovery techniques. The investigated drugs included anti-influenza drugs, anti-malarial drugs, anti-HIV drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-HCV drugs, anti-Ebola drugs, and anti-genitourinary infections drugs. Molecular docking calculations were first performed to predict the binding poses of the investigated drugs against SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The binding affinities and features were highlighted. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 50 ns were executed on the predicted docked drug-M pro complexes, and a molecular mechanical-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach was utilized to evaluate the binding energies (∆G binding ). Post-dynamics analyses, including structural and energetic aspects, were executed to obtain insight into the stability and affinity of the drugs as potential M pro inhibitors. The presented results are promising and proposing prospect inhibition for obtainable therapeutics against COVID-19.Eighteen repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment were retrieved in SDF format from the DrugBank database before molecular docking calculations [26, 27] . Omega software was utilized to generate the 3D structures of the drugs [28, 29] , and their geometrical structures were then minimized with the MMFF94S force field utilizing SZYBKI software [30] . The 2D chemical structures of the investigated anti-COVID-19 drug candidates are depicted in Table 1 .For molecular docking and molecular dynamics calculations, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ; PDB code: 6LU7 [18] ) was taken as a template. Ions and water molecules were removed. H++ server was employed to investigate the protonation state of M pro . As well, all missing hydrogen atoms were added [31] . For molecular docking calculations, the Autodock protocol was utilized to prepare the pdbqt file of M pro [32] . The pKa for SARS-CoV-2 M pro amino acid residues was estimated under physical conditions of salinity = 0.15, pH 6.5, external dielectric = 80, and internal dielectric = 10.Autodock Vina software was used to perform all molecular docking calculations [33] . All docking parameters were conserved to the default, except the exhaustiveness parameter was set to 200. The binding site was realized by a docking box around the active site with XYZ dimensions of 25 Å × 25 Å × 25 Å and a spacing value of 1.00 Å. The center of the grid was positioned at − 13.069, 9.74, 68.49 (XYZ coordinates) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro .AMBER16 software was utilized to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the docked structures of the investigated drugs inside the active site of M pro [34] . The minutiae description of the applied MD simulations was demonstrated in Ref. [7, 14] . Concisely, M pro was described using AMBER force field FF14SB [35] , while the general AMBER force field (GAFF2) was utilized to describe the drugs [36] . The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach with the assistance of Gaussian09 software was applied to assign the atomic partial charges of the investigated drugs [37, 38] . The drug-M pro complexes were solvated in a cubic water box with 15 Å distances between the edges of the box and any atom of drug or drug-M pro complexes. The solvated drug-M pro complexes were minimized for 5000 steps, gradually heated from 0 to 300 K over 50 ps, and equilibrated for 1 ns. The NPT ensembles were adopted, and drug-M pro complexes were simulated for 50 ns. Pmemd.cuda implemented in AMBER16 was utilized to perform all molecular dynamics simulations. CompChem GPU/CPU cluster (hpc.compchem.net) was applied to carry out molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. 2D and 3D of the drug-M pro interactions were visualized using the Discovery studio module of Biovia software (Dassault Systemes of France).The binding energies of the investigated anti-COVID-19 drug candidates with SARS-CoV-2 M pro were estimated using molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach with modified GB model (igb = 2) implemented in AMBER16 software [39] . For the MM-GBSA calculations, binding energy was calculated according to uncorrelated snapshots collected every 10 ps over the production run. The binding energy (ΔG binding ) was evaluated as follows:where the energy term (G) is estimated as: E vdw and E ele are van der Waals and electrostatic energies, respectively. G GB is the electrostatic solvation free energy calculated from the generalized Born equation and G SA is the nonpolar contribution to the solvation free energy from the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). A single-trajectory approach was used, in which the coordinates of each drugreceptor, receptor and drug were extracted from a single trajectory. For all investigated drugs, entropy contributions were neglected.Several repurposed drugs alone or in combinations have been subjected to clinical trials to treat COVID-19 [8, 40] . The mechanism of action of most of these drugs is to target the viral replication process or block viral entry into the host cell. Among these drugs, sixteen approved and investigational drugs were originally developed to treat influenza, HIV, HCV, and other respiratory infections. Besides, two approved anti-malarial drugs were proposed for clinical investigation as prospective anti-COVID-19 drugs. Thechemical structure, original usage, and mechanism of action of these eighteen anti-COVID-19 drug candidates are summarized in Table 1 .The efficacy and safety of these drugs as promising anti-COVID-19 drugs are still under evaluation. In the present study, binding affinities, features, and stabilities of these anti-COVID-19 drug candidates were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) using in silico drug discovery techniques. Table 1 DrugBank code, 2D chemical structure, chemical description, original usage, and mechanism of action of the repurposed drugs in clinical investigation to combat COVID-19 Molecular docking is used as a fundamental tool in the drug discovery pipeline [41] . In the present study, Autodock Vina software was applied to perform all molecular docking calculations and predict the binding modes of the repurposed drugs with SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The predicted binding affinities and features of the investigated drugs towards M pro are listed in Table 2 . The 2D and 3D representations of interactions of the inspected drugs with the key amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 M pro are illustrated in Fig. S1 .As can be seen from data in Table 2 , the docking scores of the investigated drugs with SARS-CoV-2 M pro ranged from − 5.8 to − 8.3 kcal/mol. Inspecting the drug-M pro interactions revealed that most of the drugs share a similar binding pose inside the active site of M pro , exhibiting a fundamental hydrogen bond with GLU166. Further interactions, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and pi-based interactions, were also noticed between the drugs and the proximal amino acids inside the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (Fig. S1 ). It is also worth noting that a small group of the examined drugs could not form such a In Silico Evaluation of Prospective Anti-COVID-19 Drug Candidates as Potential SARS-CoV-2 M… fundamental hydrogen bond with GLU166. This is returned to the preferability of these drugs to form a parallel hydrogen bond with HIS164 or HIS163, as in the case of chloroquine and triazavirin (Table 2) . Several studies have indicated the vital role of the catalytic CYS145 residue in suppressing the protease activity [42, 43] . As shown in Table 2 , seven out of the eighteen examined drugs exhibited a potential hydrogen bond with the catalytic CYS145 residue with bond lengths in the range of 2.06 − 2.99 Å.Among the examined drugs, HIV protease inhibitors demonstrated higher binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M pro , compared to the other antiviral and antimalarial drugs. For instance, TMC-310911 showed the highest binding affinity against M pro with a docking score of − 8.3 kcal/mol. Structural insights into the binding mode of the TMC-310911 with the M pro demonstrated that the sulfone moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of GLU166 residue with a bond length of 1.89 Å ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). While, the carbamate moiety of TMC-310911 interacts with the backbone atoms of SER144, and CYS145 via hydrogen bonds of lengths 3.02 and 2.34 Å, respectively ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). The strong interaction of TMC-310911 with the conserved residue GLU166 of M pro has been recently reported with a docking score of − 7.1 kcal/mol [25] .The other four examined HIV protease drugs ─namely lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and tenofovir alafenamide─ demonstrated promising binding affinities against M pro with docking scores of − 8.0, − 7.7, − 7.5, and − 7.5 kcal/ mol, respectively, forming two, four, five, and four hydrogen bonds with the key amino acids of M pro , respectively (Fig. 1) . Inspecting the binding mode of ritonavir with the M pro revealed that (i) the C=O of the carbamoyl moiety demonstrates a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of GLU166, with a bond length of 2.38 Å, (ii) the thiazole ring interacts with the imidazole ring of HIS163 via a hydrogen bond of length 2.01 Å, (iii) the C=O of the urea group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of GLY143 with a bond length of 1.83 Å, and (iv) the OH group participates in a hydrogen bond with GLN189 with a bond length of 2.63 Å ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ).In agreement with the current results, the higher potency of ritonavir, compared to lopinavir, has been recently reported with SARS-CoV-2 M pro [44] .Interestingly, remdesivir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor developed for Ebola-virus, demonstrated the second-highest binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a docking score of − 8.2 kcal/mol. The other examined anti-Ebola drug ─namely galidesivir─ showed a satisfactory binding affinity with a docking score of − 7.1 kcal/mol with M pro .For anti-influenza drugs, relatively weak binding affinities were observed with SARS-CoV-2 M pro , with docking scores of − 6.2, − 6.1, − 5.8, − 5.8, and − 5.3 kcal/mol for umifenovir, baloxavir marboxil, triazavirin, oseltamivir, and favipiravir, respectively. Besides, the anti-malarial, HCV, and anti-informatory drugs showed relatively weak potency towards M pro (docking scores of − 6.2, − 5.8, − 6.7, − 6.3, and − 6.4 kcal/mol for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, methylprednisolone, ribavirin, and azithromycin, respectively). In summary, the results of molecular docking calculations suggested HIV protease drugs and remdesivir as promising SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors.It has been demonstrated that solvent effects, conformational flexibilities of drug-receptor complexes, and dynamics must be applied to improve the reliability of the predicted ligand-protein binding energies. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with MM-GBSA binding energy calculations were carried out for the repurposed drugs complexed with SARS-CoV-2 M pro .Eighteen repurposed drugs in clinical development to treat COVID-19 were further inspected using MD techniques over a simulation time of 10 ns, followed by MM-GBSA binding energy calculations. The evaluated MM-GBSA binding energies for the investigated drugs with M pro are listed in Fig. 2 .What is interesting about the data in Fig. 2 that five out of the studied drugs demonstrated considerable binding energies (ΔG binding < − 40.0 kcal/mol), while the rest of the drugs were noticed with relatively weak binding energies ranged from − 10.5 to − 36.0 kcal/mol. The single most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was the significant-high binding affinities of TMC-310911 and ritonavir towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro with binding energies (ΔG binding ) of − 59.6 and − 54.4 kcal/mol, respectively.Overall, the MM-GBSA//10 ns MD binding energies demonstrated the promising potentiality of TMC-310911, ritonavir, remdesivir, lopinavir, and darunavir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro .To increase the reliability of the predicted binding affinities, the top potent drugs (ΔG binding < − 40.0 kcal/mol with M pro ) were further subjected to longer MDs of 50 ns, and the corresponding MM-GBSA binding energies were consequently estimated (Fig. 2) . According to the calculated MM-GBSA//50 ns MD binding energies, TMC-310911 and ritonavir showed promising binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M pro with ΔG binding of − 52.8 and − 49.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculated values of G drug , G receptor, and G complex for the TMC-310911 and ritonavir in complex with M pro are listed in Table S1 . Compared to TMC-310911 and ritonavir, remdesivir showed a lower binding affinity with M pro (ΔG binding of − 42.7 kcal/ mol). The estimated ΔG binding over the 50 ns MD for lopinavir and darunavir with M pro were observed to be higher than − 40.0 kcal/mol (ΔG binding of − 35.6 and − 34.8 kcal/ mol, respectively).To reveal the nature of interactions of TMC-310911 and ritonavir with M pro , MM-GBSA binding energy decomposition was performed over the 50 ns MD simulations. The evaluated energy components are listed in Table 3 .It is apparent from data in Table 3 Considering the promising binding affinities of TMC-310911 and ritonavir with M pro , further investigations were carried out to inspect the drug-M pro stability over the 50 ns MD simulation.Post-dynamics analyses were performed on the collected trajectories over the 50 ns MD simulations for TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro complexes. The post-dynamics analyses involved root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), binding energy per-frame, center-of-mass (CoM) distance, and hydrogen bond length.To get a more in-depth insight into the stability of the drug inside the active site of M pro , the correlation between MM-GBSA binding energy and time was investigated. The MM-GBSA binding energy per-frame for TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro complexes is plotted versus time in Fig. 3 .As shown in Fig. 3 , there was outright stability for TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro over the generated MD The stabilities of TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro complexes were further investigated by measuring the hydrogen bond lengths and center-of-mass (CoM) distances between the drug and the proximal amino acid GLU166 residue over the 50 ns MD simulations (Fig. 4) . As can be concluded from data in Fig. 4a , TMC-310911 and ritonavir demonstrated high stabilities inside the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with average hydrogen bond lengths of 2.03 and 2.07 Å, respectively. Besides, the measured CoM distances were approximately constant around 7.2 and 10.1 Å over the 50 ns MD simulations for TMC-31091-M pro and ritonavir-M pro complexes, respectively (Fig. 4b ).The root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) throughout the 50 ns MD simulations were estimated to delineate the structural changes of drug-M pro complexes. The RMSD's of backbone as a function of time with respect to the starting structure of TMC-310911-and ritonavir-M pro complexes are plotted in Fig. 5 .It can be seen from data in Fig. 5 that the RMSD values of TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro stayed beneath 0.35 nm for the course of the MD simulations. The RMSD results indicated that TMC-310911 and ritonavir are tightly bonded in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro , and they do not impact the overall topology of M pro .Overall, the post-dynamics analyses provided evidence on the high stability of TMC-310911-M pro and ritonavir-M pro complexes, demonstrating their potentiality as prospective anti-COVID-19 drugs.Several clinical trials have recently been launched to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. In the current study, the potencies of eighteen repurposed drugs in clinical development were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 M pro using combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques. Molecular docking calculations revealed the high binding affinities of TMC-310911 and ritonavir towards M pro with docking scores of − 8.3 and − 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculated MM-GBSA binding energies for TMC-310911 and ritonavir with M pro over the 50 ns MD were − 52.8 and − 49.4 kcal/mol, respectively, demonstrating their high potencies as M pro inhibitors.

However, local differences in income, culture, environment and socio-economic factors will need to be put into consideration while adopting the WHO guidelines. The health capacities of different countries, regions, states and local governments will also need to be acknowledged. Similarly, the cultural beliefs of a people in relation to health and well-being is a further vital element in deciding how best to sustainably manage a pandemic such as the COVID-19. These considerations necessitate the need to develop a region-dependent template for implementing the WHO's recommendations.Moreover, researchers have identified concerns with respect to the vulnerability of developing countries to the COVID-19 pandemic. These countries experience inadequate health facilities [2] , poverty, high rates of unemployment and poor standards of education. These factors contribute to the difficulties confronting the management of the pandemic.As a result of the aforementioned challenges, a number of COVID-19 research projects have been tailored towards recommending the best strategies for reducing the level of the virus in developing economies [3] [4] [5] . Although these projects have been inspired by the huge socioeconomic and developmental gaps between developing and developed countries, none of them derive their recommendations from the basis of the health cultural beliefs of a developed economy. This paper aims at three key objectives. Firstly, it discusses the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria, and then elucidates the prevalent health cultural beliefs in the country. On the basis of these beliefs the paper then recommends a community-informatics strategy for the sustainable management of the pandemic in this country.The ubiquity of Internet-ready smart devices has played an important role in undermining the impact of digital divides in developing countries. For example, according to the African Infotech Consulting (AIC) report, ""in 2016 alone, smartphones gained penetration in Nigeria at about 30 percent while feature phones had a 70 percent entry"", and the number of smartphone users in the country was projected to increase to about 34 million in 2018 [6] . This development offers an opportunity for grass-roots computing or community informatics. Community informatics is a useful tool for the management of an infectious disease or virus such as COVID-19. Due to the social distancing policies in place during the pandemic, it has become even more difficult for governments to effectively reach out to the people for purposes of awareness, testing, treatment, enforcement of guidelines, provision of palliatives and so on. In order to support shared decision-making among stakeholders and to drive the participatory management of COVID-19 in Nigeria this paper recommends the Online GeoHealth Community Structure (OGHCS) as a framework that integrates the requisite stakeholders and resources for the effective management and control of COVID-19. A key function of OGHCS is to provide the required tools to reduce these burdens while providing a virtual community structure that is similar to the physical community structure in terms of trusts and community weaving.In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 reviews the infection clusters as well as the preparedness of Nigeria towards the pandemic; Section 3 discusses the health cultural beliefs in Nigeria while Section 4 discusses the importance of community informatics in rural communities, Section 5 recommends a community informatics strategy and some policies for managing the virus. Section 6 concludes the paper.As Nigeria lifts the local lockdowns and progress towards the lifting of international travel, there is a need to focus on the regions and states that still have higher incidences of COVID-19. Higher levels of caution and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) need to be applied to these regions than in any other part of the country. In this section, we look at the basic reproduction number, technical definition of hotspots, the actual areas in Nigeria that could be considered as hotspots, and then the recommended interventions for these red-flag areas.Basic Reproduction Number, R 0The R0 of an infectious disease is the number of secondary infections that occur as a result of one infectious person introduced into a completely susceptible population [7] . This number is a major metric that determines the rate of spread of an infectious disease. This parameter is a function of transmissibility, average contact rate and the duration of infection. A region or suburb with high R0 mathematically defines an infectious disease hotspot. The mathematical definition of R0 is given by:where τ is the probability of getting infected per contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual, c is the contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, while d is the duration of infectiousness of infected individuals. Hotspots usually have a high contact rate. This is the typical feature of highly crowded places such Lagos and some parts of Abuja.Hence, areas with high population density usually characterise a hotspot for an infectious disease. The goal of every intervention is to reduce R0 to a value less than one, (R0 < 1). Once this happens, the epidemic is bound to cease.Epidemics are often characterised by clusters. This means that the rate of infection will not be equally distributed across the country. According to the report of the Nigerian Presidential Task Since the outbreak of COVID-19, much research time has been invested in technologies for combating the virus [8] . However, little attention has been paid to the unique elements of different communities or societies where these technologies could be applied. We are of the opinion that to realise an effective technology for combating a socio-ecological threat like the COVID-19, a community-centric design approach should be followed. This idea is premised on the fact that each community has its own socio-cultural uniqueness and this impacts on how healthcare works in such communities. Among major concerns in the management of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 in developing countries are the scarcity of the health workers and the poor state of health infrastructure in these countries, particularly in rural areas [9] . For example, even though 60% of Nigerian citizens reside in rural areas, these areas suffer gross shortages of health professionals and vital health facilities [10] . These factors, therefore, raise apprehensions towards potential impacts of possible rural community transmissions. Since these shortcomings within the Nigerian healthcare sector have been an age-long problem, some residents of the country patronise private hospitals for healthcare while those who cannot afford a private health facility have resorted to other means of medication. Among other factors, these could result in loss of trust in government guidelines towards the management of a pandemic such as coronavirus.To provide an objective measure for comparing the health cultural beliefs of different societies, this section discusses health cultural beliefs in Nigeria based on five themeswordof-mouth as a dominant channel of information acquisition, the prevalence of patent medicine vendors, religious and spiritual beliefs, the culture of patriarchy, and reliance on traditional medicine. Amongst other factors, these contributors influence how the majority of Nigerians respond to government guidelines, as well as COVID-19 related conspiracy theories.Nigeria's rural areas are characterised by poor infrastructural developments, high rates of illiteracy and unemployment [11, 12] . The information gap between urban and rural communities in Nigeria has been widened due to the inability of rural populations to afford urban-centred channels of information such as social media which are commonly used by the government and other agencies in disseminating vital information across the country [13] . Due to this information deprivation within rural populations, word-of-mouth communication from influential, educated or respected individuals suffices as an important channel of information acquisition among rural communities [13] . This factor makes misinformation more likely in rural areas than in urban areas. Enital et al conducted a survey to assess the knowledge, perception and readiness of Nigerians to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial enitan2020assessment.The results of this study show that 80.0% of the respondents indicated that they are unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 20.0% indicated that they were willing. This is in contrast to the latest data of a survey conducted by Morning Consult showing that a higher proportion of Americans (80%) are willing to get the vaccine [14] . This difference in the American-Nigerian responses is most likely due to the gap in public health awareness between the two countries.Many Nigerians rely essentially on owner-operated retail drug outlets, also known as proprietary and patent medicine vendors (PPMVs), for their health needs. Statistics show that in 2005 an estimated 200,000 PPMVs were operational in Nigeria [15] ; this is much higher than the 2,639 registered retailed pharmacies in the country in the same year and outnumbers all other categories of health workers in the country [16] . Apart from the fact that there are few registered pharmacies in Nigeria, they are often geographically concentrated in urban areas, whereas patent medicine stores are mainly in rural areas [17] . This makes it more attractive for the PPMVs to operate and makes them an important alternative for the people to leverage on for their health needs [18] .Nigeria has experienced a continuous proliferation of places of worship due to the deep religiosity of the majority of Nigerians and their significant belief in spiritual powers as a means of receiving help in every sphere of their lives [19, 20] . For example, the number of Muslims in Nigeria is far greater than the number of Muslims in any Arab nation [21] . The number of Christians in Nigeria is second only to Brazil which has the largest number of Christians in the world [21] . As a result of this prevalence of religious organisations in Nigeria, they form a huge part of people's beliefs and behaviours. These religious bodies organise programmes which they claim are targeted at meeting people's needs such as healing, financial breakthroughs, deliverance and so on. Some religious leaders in Nigeria make their followers believe that their misfortunes are due to spiritual causes, therefore many sick people, especially those who cannot afford expensive hospital bills, depend on supernatural interventions for their healing [22] . in Nigeria [25] . He has been reported to claim that the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria was designed to sequester the population for the government's intention to deploy 5G across the country for obnoxious reasons [25] .The patriarchal nature of Nigerian society has contributed to the way women and young adults make their medical decisions. [26] . Akeju et al presented a study on healthcare seeking practices among pregnant Nigerian women as well as the socio-cultural factors that influence these actions [26] . The authors report that some of the participants reveal that women who made independent healthcare decisions were considered to be arrogant, disrespectful and in the word of one female participant, ""too forward"". In research by Onah and Horton to study the male-female differences in household custody of financial resources and decision-making in south-eastern Nigeria, the authors report that qualitatively, women seek permission from the male household head before any expenditure on healthcare [27] . The following observations underscore the extent to which men, especially household heads, can influence government plans in curbing coronavirus. For example, a male household head who does not trust the COVID-19 vaccination programme is culturally empowered to prevent members of that household from accessing the inoculation even if they are willing to be vaccinated against the virus.The WHO defines traditional medicine as ""the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness"" 5 . The use of traditional medicine is a prevalent practice in developing countries because people feel safer with cures indigenous to them, which may also be cost effective [28] . According to the WHO's estimate, up to 80% of the African population depends on traditional medicine [29] . The popularity of traditional medicine in Nigeria has been attributed to its natural origin. Oreagba The cohesive and homogenous nature of communities in developing countries differentiates it from the diverse and heterogenous nature of communities in developed countries. While developed nations are being innovative in how to harness the diversity which they enjoy, developing countries have communities with well-defined cultural attachment and value system. Deviation from this well-established cultural cohesion is difficult in developing countries. This difference in cultural attachment also affects how individuals in each of these settings trust whom they give and receive information from.In Nigeria, the southern part of the country is more exposed to developed community system than the northern part, which has a stronger attachment to their local community. This difference is reflected by how they receive and give information during vaccination programs including Polio and HIV. A case to buttress this difference is the boycott of the polio vaccination by the three northern Nigeria states of Kaduna, Kano and Zamfara in 2003 [36] .The cultural leaders, who double as religious leaders in the north, played a greater role in this boycott than the political leaders. This is unlike the developed countries of UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand where direct interactions between the government and individuals are well established as opposed to the local communities. Hence, there is a block effect in information assimilation in developing countries than in the developed countries.Technologies (ICT) in addressing societal needs. It is pertinent to realise that major constraints such as Internet coverage, power outage and low level of education are challenges that affect the deployment of ICT in local developing communities. Besides, the development of these information gathering and dissemination systems must take into cognizance the cultural beliefs of the local users. The questions that are asked and the mode of collecting this information must consider the local beliefs of the people otherwise the local community will not be comfortable with the system. In this paper, we posit that effective monitoring and intervention through ICT in rural settings should have a different approach. The conventional health information systems (HIS) deployed in district hospitals are not suitable as most of the rural communities prefer to visit patent medicine shops [37] that are closer to them. Hence, more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 informal reporting hierarchy should exist unlike in the developed communities. This peculiarity shows that the deployment of ICT systems in rural communities should not assume a direct connection between individual patients and the HIS but should recognize a feeder line from the patent medicine practitioners who are closer to the rural dwellers. In Nigeria, unlike in most developed countries, patent medicine shops are private but government licensed medicine shops. These healthcare providers bring healthcare closer to the local people as an alternative for standard hospitals and pharmacies. The information provided to and by these medicine shops will be very relevant in monitoring and control of COVID-19 in Nigeria.It is important to stress that community informatics (CI) in both developing and developed countries have similar uses. The application is most relevant to the rural communities whether in developed or developing countries. However, the engagement with the local community and the support from the central government is stronger in developed countries. This assertion can be seen in the implementation of com-munity informatics in the United Kingdom [38] . In this work, they applied CI to drive and facilitate social change within the local communities in the UK.This section presents both technological and policy recommendations for the management and control of the virus. It recommends OGHCS for a participatory and sustainable control of the pandemic as well as suggests strategies for preventing possible spread of the virus in the identified hotspots.Online GeoHealth Community Structure for Management of CommunityConsidering the dominant health cultural beliefs in Nigeria, we recommend a grass-root computing technique for the management of COVID-19 in Nigeria. For an effective application of community informatics strategy, there is a need for trust building and community weaving among members of a community. As such, the paper recommends the OGHCS as a framework that integrates the requisite stakeholders and resources for the effective management and control of COVID-19.OGHCS is inspired by the online GeoHubNet community structure proposed by Ozuomba et al as shown in figure [39] . GeoHubNet is designed to manage and organise a community for informatics applications; it has been considered as a tool for realising an online community for participatory development [39] ; and also as a tool for ICT-based community policing [40] .GeoHubNet helps in organising online communities according to some geopolitical divisions such as nation, state, region or city geo-communities. Figure 1 represents a state-wide GeoHubNet. Inside this structure are regional geo-communities representing citywide, senatorial or local government geo-communities within that state. Within each regional local community in the state are local groups, institutions and individuals who are members of the online geocommunity. Each regional geo-community has a set of facilitators that moderate the interconnection and interaction of the members in that regional community. The facilitator also conducts regional community network weaving. All the regional community facilitators in a state make up the HubNet.It is easy to imagine that a nation-wide GeoHubNet is made-up of state-wide geo-communities, which themselves are a GeoHubNet of regional geo-communities. Realising a community informatics social network that follows this methodology can be likened to a transformation from a physical to a virtual community. In the case of OGHCS, the HubNet is the local community organization that champions the pandemic management programme.Nigeria's current epidemic preparedness index has been rated as 38.9%, which is higher than the African and global averages [41] . NCDC, the leading public health agency in Nigeria, has done well in terms of point-of-entry screening for travellers coming into the country.Furthermore, the agency has been in charge of testing, contact tracing, training of response teams in all the 36 states of the nation and increasing awareness in the population [42] through SMS, press conferences and publications both on its websites and on social media.In order to coordinate and oversee the country's multi-sectorial inter-governmental efforts to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of the virus, a presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19 was established on March 9, 2020 [43] . Despite these commendable efforts by the NCDC and the federal government of Nigeria there have been serious concerns around the capacity of the country to effectively manage local and community transmissions [44] . These concerns are a major motivations for OGHCS. OGHCS seeks to integrate all the resources required for management of a pandemic on a single platform. The major stakeholders involved in OGHCS will include NCDC, PTF, national and state response teams, community members, PPMVs, age groups, religious institutions, volunteers, law enforcement agencies, community leaders, security officers and health workers. PPMVs, community leaders, security officers, religious leaders, health workers and so on. Each geo-community GeoHubNet has a representative in a wider community; for example a state-wide GeoHubNet of facilitators from lower GeoHubNets; from the state-wide HubNet representatives are selected into the nation-wide GeoHubNet. This creates a hierarchical framework for managing the pandemic through training, sensitisation, provision of support and understanding of the through state of the pandemic in the country. An important advantage of this framework is that trust from community members is higher since the government reaches out to them with people with shared culture.For a community informatics application, OGHCS requires a number of technologies. These technologies are to enhance data collection, information dissemination, data analytics, community weaving, disease mapping, training and so on. Technologies that are suitable for this purpose are presented as follows:Social networks: This is the virtual implementation of a community network similar to the way it is structured offline. This is for the purposes of community weaving, coordination and information sharing amongst the members of a community and between different community HubNets, either vertically or horizontally. Moreover, social networks allow for user generated content (UGC) which is a rich source of unbiased data for analytics.Database and content respository: This is a tool for data collection and storage. Data analytics tool: Tools that support real-time analyses and summarisation of data relating to the virus are required for future research and insights.The general goal for interventions by governments is to shrink the epidemic curve while for individuals, the goal is to avoid contracting the virus. In the absence of vaccines and confirmed drugs, the required effects of interventions are shown in Figure 2 . For each of the hotspotLGAs, the peak of the epidemic should be reduced and spread out over time. The target is to achieve the blue curve instead of the red curve.Firstly, the government should implement high levels of restrictions within these hotspots.The closure of large social gatherings should be implemented including high enforcement of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as facemasks. These restrictions will reduce the force of infection and bring down the expected peak. Individuals should reconsider non-essential travel into these LGAs. Alternative destinations for goods and services should be used. Again, testing resources should be focused in these LGAs. Contact tracing and testing should be implemented with full force within these territories. It is very important to increase public awareness, messaging and re-orientation about public health measures in these areas. These activities are important because all interventions are only as good as people's compliance with them. Various models have attributed different levels of compliance to different interventions in order to measure how effective those interventions are. In addition to public awareness, the government should also provide palliatives that are commensurate with the economic losses that will be suffered by these areas due to lockdown in economic activities. Businesses should be exempted from taxes and some salary relief given to companies that would be completely shut down. Without the palliatives, it will be difficult to achieve a high level of compliance for a prolonged time, which is required to reduce the daily incidence to a single digit or make R0 < 1.Considering the prevalent health cultural beliefs of a people is important for the sustainable management of a socio-ecological threat such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper discusses the health cultural beliefs in Nigeria and suggests a community informatics strategy for managing the virus while following the WHO's advice on social distancing. In addition to its potential for community weaving and trust building, community informatics application can be deployed to collect and report information about population density, possible hotspots, super-spreader events and ultimately for contact tracing. Just like community policing for tighter security, community intelligence on the behaviour of citizens at the local level can help to alert the government about the required local intervention before an outbreak occurs.Although we have presented the hotspots as reported by official sources, a community informatics platform will enable the gathering of citizen-based information that can predict how these hotspots might change in the future. It is therefore advised that the government of Nigeria should leverage the rural structures including the patent medicine shops to gather timely information in order to expedite a response. These structures will remain valuable even when a vaccine becomes available as they will form part of the vaccine distribution chain.","Nigeria","abstract","2021-01-28",1

[1] [2] [3] As many of the cases are asymptomatic, without laboratory testing, positive cases will not be identified and sources of infection could not be traced, WHO recommends ""test, test, test"" as a very important means of mitigation and control of the pandemic. Thus, affordable and user friendly 4 laboratory test kits, mainly rapid tests which are more realistic for low-income countries that could be managed by minimal trained personnel and resources should be considered for this context. 5, 6 Many rapid diagnostics that can detect SARS-CoV-2 have been and are under development, both in-house and commercially. [7] [8] [9] Despite its relatively low cost and simplicity of rapid laboratory test kits, their quality is under scrutiny that exposed and weakened the health systems and forced the countries and diagnostic companies to tousled for rapid tests, but prioritized as of its availability near to the patients. [10] [11] [12] The health system and laboratory diagnostic capacities in Africa were questionable in detecting outbreaks as early as possible, and the 2,030 sustainable development goal (SDG) begs the question of realization with big gaps at the diagnosis stage and so many people failing to get diagnosed, though many targets were accomplished. 13, 14 Likewise, as of 20 October 2020, the number of COVID-19 laboratories in Ethiopia was not more than 46, with a longer turnaround time of results, which was not in line with the speed of the virus escalation. 15, 16 In addition, the current recommended ""gold standard"" test for COVID-19 is based on real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). It has limitations in its sensitivity and the procedure is relatively tedious and is prone to contamination, it also requires state-of-the-art-laboratory equipment with costly supplies and skilled professionals. 17, 18 These challenges forced scientists to develop accurate, reliable and rapid COVID−19 diagnostic methods; however, evaluating their performance and introducing quality rapid test kits that can help to curve the COVID 19 pandemic by identifying, screening and tracing the source of infection is necessary. Thus, this study was done which aimed to compare and evaluate the diagnostic performance of selected SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test for the detection of the novel coronavirus against the currently established RT-PCR in Ethiopia.A multicenter cross sectional study was conducted from May to July 2020 in Addis Ababa COVID-19 isolation and testing centers: EPHI national influenza reference laboratory, Ekka Kotebe general hospital, Yekatit 12 hospital medical college, Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public HealthResearch and Emergency Management (AAPHREM) center. These sites were amongst the first national COVID-19 testing and treatment centers and samples come from other referring health facilities of Addis Ababa. [19] [20] [21] Overall, 540 sequentially ordered clients were screened with symptoms of COVID-19 in the study period. Among these, 200 clients who were volunteer to participate, gave written informed consent and assent for participation and having sign and symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever BT≥ 37.5, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing during presentation to the health facilities were include. 22 Critical patients who were unable to communicate were not included. The study participants were recruited as per the current WHO and Ethiopian COVID-19 management guideline through trained public health professionals. [22] [23] [24] The rapid test kits include in this evaluation study were selected considering affordability, FDA approval or listed for approval for emergency use authorization and user friendliness as minimum criteria. 25 From ten local pharmaceutical distributors communicated, only three companies were interested and availed the test kits for the evaluation. Accordingly, three SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test kits: EGENE (A), CTK BIOTECKs Onsite (B), and ACON Biotech (C) were selected for performance evaluation to detect novel corona virus against RT-PCR method. For each rapid test kit, we receive 200 samples from the companies' through their local representatives found here in Ethiopia. However, these pharmaceutical companies had not had any involvement with the research methodology design, analysis and write up of the research manuscript. SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay which can detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The test cassettes consists of: a colored conjugate pad containing SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens conjugated with colloidal gold (SARS-CoV-2 conjugates) and a nitrocellulose membrane strip containing an IgG line, an IgM line and the control line (C). 8,28Participants' socio-demographic characteristics were captured by using a pretested data collection tool. Nasal/throat swabs and blood specimen were collected by using viral transport medium (VTM) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14 acid (EDTA) coated vacutainer tubes according to the national SOP with strict bio safety measures. 16, 29 The collected swab specimens were sent immediately to molecular laboratories (EPHI) national influenza reference laboratory and Addis Ababa Public Health Emergency Management Center Laboratory (AAPHREM) through triple packaging for testing.The molecular RT-PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system and Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt real time PCR plat forms. 23, 30 RDT was performed by three IgG/IgM rapid test kits (Nantong Egens Biotechnology EGENE labeled as A, CTK's Onsite COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, CTK BIOTECH labeled as B and ACON Biotech SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test labeled as C) following the manufacturer's instructions. The results were interpreted by two independent readers. [26] [27] [28] Study participants' PCR results were communicated through the established national emergency operation center, because the country have one channel of result communication for COVID-19, to manage the cases in a centralized manner, while RDT results were communicated at spot.SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay which can detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The test cassettes consists of: a colored conjugate pad containing SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens conjugated with colloidal gold (SARS-CoV-2 conjugates) and a nitrocellulose membrane strip containing an IgG line, an IgM line and the control line (C). It was performed following the respective manufacturers' instructions and results were read at 10 to 20 minutes and did not read results after 20 minutes. Data collectors were trained on how to collect the necessary data using the data collection tools and additional written guide was made available to them on interpreting each of the study variables. The molecular laboratories: EPHI national influenza reference laboratory and AAPHREM where the laboratory testing conducted are WHO and (Ethiopian National Accreditation Office (ENAO) ISO15189:2012 accredited, respectively. 24, 31 RDTs contain inbuilt control feature, C line. Positive and negative controls were tested to ensure the proper performance of the assay. 7 We used a calibrated micropipette for sample allocation.Data were double entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23, Vassarstats and MedCalc statistical software. Sensitivity and specificity of the RDTs were calculated and the performance agreements to RT-PCR were assessed using Kappa statistics. Cochran's Q test was used to assess whether there is difference in performance among the rapid test kits and RT-PCR. P-values <0.05 were considered for statistical significance P-value< 0.05.To conduct this research, ethical approval was obtained from Addis Ababa University college of health sciences Institutional review board IRB (protocol # 029/20/Lab), Eka Kotebe hospital IRB protocol # Eka-150-5-4), and Addis Ababa Health Bureau IRB protocol # A/A/ H11127/227. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the concerned institutions: EPHI and Federal ministry of health COVID-19 task force (they registered it and give a permission to conduct the research work). During data and sample collection the data collectors inform each study participant about the purpose and anticipate benefits of the research project and also informed on their full right to refuse, withdraw or completely reject partly or all of their part in the study.Finally, we obtained written informed consent from adult participants and parents or legal guardians of study participants under the age of 18 years to participate in the study and to use their files and records for the study. All participants' identifiers were removed and only codes were used throughout the study to keep confidentiality. Moreover, this work was performed as per the Helsinki declaration.In this study, 200 study participants ranged from 1 month to 95 years with median of 27±13.75 years were included. The majority was male and 33 had co-morbidity The recent ongoing global pandemic poses serious public health problems. Following its unprecedented urgent situation lead many companies for the development of a large range of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2, including rapid test kits. In view of that, as of 15 August 2020 there are more than 777 SARS-CoV-2 rapid IgG/IgM test kits in the global market. 25 However, there is no documented evidence for its diagnostic performance done in resource limiting setting like Ethiopia, yet. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative diagnostic performance of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 rapid IgG/IgM assays: EGENS (A), CTk Onsite (B) and ACON Biotech (C) SARS-CoV-2 IgG/ IgM rapid test using human blood specimens against RT-PCR of respiratory specimens.The evaluated SARS-CoV-2 rapid IgG/IgM assays have a heterogeneous comparative diagnostic performance with overall sensitivity of 61.18% (95% CI: 49.96-71.37%), 74.12% (95% CI: 63.28-82.74%) and 83.53% (95% CI: 73.57-90.38%) and a specificity of 96.52% (90.81-98.88%), 94.78% (88.52-97.86%) and 94.78% (88.52-97.86%) for test kit A, B and C, respectively, which was a lower finding and not in line with the respective manufacturer claim of sensitivity 96.80%, 88.24% and 99.1% and a specificity of 100%, 100% and 98.2% of assay A, B and C, respectively. The difference might be DovePress due to the number of samples and that the manufacturing company did not perform in real life of field work, as we did in different health facilities. [26] [27] [28] Test kit A has much lower sensitivity performance, whereas test kit B and C have a comparable diagnostic sensitivity performance with a study done from by Nicol et al, having an overall sensitivity of 80% and a study done by Porte et al, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 93.9% (CI95% (86.5-97.4)) and 100% (CI95% (92.1-100) ) respectively, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.9, which is concordance with Ckappa value of 0.8. 32, 33 In terms of comparative diagnostic specificity, this study revealed a 96.52% (90.81-98.88%), 94.78% (88.52-97.86%) and 94.78% (88.52-97.86%) with test kit A, B, C respectively which was in line with a study done by Van Elslande et al, of a diagnostic specificity of 96.1% for IgG and also it showed an agreement with Jääskeläinen et al, a specificity of 95.1%. 34, 35 This study revealed as 92%, 91% and 93% of positive predictive value of A, B and C test kits respectively, which was in-concordance with a study done by Irene Cassaniti et al, having a PPV of 87.5% using Viva Diag COVID-19 IgM/IgG test of a very poor sensitivity among emergency patients and documented by Krüttgen et al, have a comparable result with our current study with a specificity and predictive value, with a specificity of 96.2%, 88.7%, 100%, and 100% of the four commercially assay. However, the study was focused only IgG and only 75 study sera, in our cases we evaluated both IgG/IgM and also our sample size was 200. 36, 37 Onsite CTK Biotech assay had comparable performance with a study done by Pallett et al, of a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.2% (95% CI (81.6-93.1)) from 120 of 136; and a specificity of 94% (95% CI (87.46-97.8)). It indicate a reputable and almost similar finding across different geographic cases. 38 This study has a higher sensitivity than Tollånes et al, study. 39 It may be due to the number of study participants they used were less than what we have used. In the contrary, we get a lower comparative performance result with a study done by Roche with a diagnostic specificity and sensitivity 99.81% and 100% respectively using 5300 blood sample. The difference may be the sample size and they did the serological test after two weeks of confirmed positive PCR results, in our context we tried to test without knowing their status as presumptive as. On the other hand, the third test kit, ACON Biotech SARS-CoV-2 IgG/ IgM rapid test, have showed a comparable diagnostic performance with Assure Tech. Assure COVID-19 IgG/ IgM rapid test device and Biohit Healthcare (Hefei) Biohit SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody test kit done at different site. 40, 41 The sensitivity of the test performance increase with clients after the clinical onset of seven day, which is concordance finding with different study groups done by Cassanitietal., Xie J. et al, Jeffrey D.Whitman et al, it indicates that these test kits be better if we used for clients with chief complains of COVID-19 at the peripheral health facilities. We get relatively better specificity, which is expected countries having relatively low prevalence. 36, 42, 43 RT-PCR is the current established gold standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 using respiratory specimens. However, it has limitations related to technical procedures, limit of detection, being prone to contamination and the tendency of negativity of test results after 10 days of clinical onset. In this study, we have been working to come up with alternative test methods having relatively minimal cost, easy to perform and deliver results within short turnaround time. Accordingly, the current finding showed that rapid IgG/IgM SARS-COV-2 point of care tests have a pivotal role for patient screening in resource scarce countries with limited number of established RT-PCR laboratories and it urges future research implication for the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. 44 On top of this, many low income countries have very low testing performance per population. 45 Thus, the availability of rapid and reliable screening test with alternative sample source for the virus detection has been marked as a critical opportunity to support the control of the pandemic and to curb the number of cases worldwide. 44, 45 Furthermore, this might initiate researchers to conduct further studies and forward evidence based direction for policymakers on how to decide and when to re-open societies; and for program managers to develop testing algorithms and to design discharge protocols. 34, 37, 44 Readers should consider the following points while inferring our results as limitations. For the negative results, we did not collect second time specimens for confirmation. Moreover, we did not determine the SARS-COV-2 viral load amount in nasal/throat swabs and its limit of detection that might influence the performance of these rapid test kits.Even though, the evaluated three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM test kits showed a heterogeneous performance, the two test kits could be good alternative assert prevalence screening tool and could be used in combination of RT-PCR to detect more infected clients in resource limited countries like Ethiopian. This might help to minimize further spread of this deadly and gripped virus by testing and identifying potential source of infection.Getting respiratory swab specimens are not easy from critical patients and their viral load become probably low and consequently their PCR result could be undetectable, which leads to false negativity. Hence, rapid test kits could be good alternative due to its relative easy to perform with in short turnaround time. Nonetheless, considering our study finding reinforces the need for the available rapid test kits should be evaluated prior to use in the particular population. We also recommend further studies on SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing among Ethiopian isolates for designing and validating more sensitive and specific rapid test kits.The whole study of the research process was summarized and depicted at Figure 1 .Some of the data set like name of the presumptive and personalized data used and/or analyzed during the current study is not publicly available, to maintain privacy but can be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and are associated with various natural hosts. Four CoVs are currently endemic in the human population, CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and CoV-HKU1. CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E were initially identified as causes of upper respiratory tract infections in the 1960s using classical culture methods (3, 4) . More recently, advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of CoV-NL63 (5) and CoV-HKU1 (6) . Infections by these endemic CoVs may involve the upper respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract; infections range from being completely asymptomatic to causing mild, self-limiting disease and, less commonly, severe illness such as bronchitis and pneumonia (7) . Interestingly, hospitalized children with CoV-associated LRTI more frequently had coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and a higher abundance of Haemophilus influenzae than children hospitalized for non-CoV-associated LRTI or asymptomatic healthy CoV carriers (8) , suggesting that viral and bacterial coinfections might trigger severe CoV infections.Three other CoVs have, however, caused outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerging in 2002, was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with an overall fatality rate of approximately 10% with no fatalities reported in children (5) , the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans since 2012 mostly in the Arabian Peninsula with a fatality rate of 20% to 40% in adults and about 6% in children (9, 10) , and the recent SARS-CoV-2 that appeared first in China at the end of 2019 has since caused a global pandemic (11) . Although progress is rapidly being made, no specific antiviral vaccines are available to prevent any human CoV infections. Understanding the epidemiology and morbidity associated with common human-adapted CoVs may assist in informing treatment and mitigation strategies for severe illness from novel CoVs of zoonotic origin, although similar viruses may undergo different selective pressures in order to maintain fitness and host adaptation (12) , making viral transmission patterns across species and their interactions with other potential coinfecting or superinfecting pathogens hard to predict (13) .Due to impaired humoral and cell-mediated immunity, children living with HIV (more so if not on antiretroviral treatment) have an increased risk for severe illness and mortality from virus-associated LRTI, including those due to RSV and influenza virus (14, 15) . There are, however, limited data on the role of other respiratory viruses, including CoVs in children hospitalized with pneumonia, and only a few studies with limited numbers specifically included participants living with HIV (16, 17) . A study in the United States involving immunocompromised children, the majority of whom had hematologic malignancy or solid tumor, found that these children were at higher risk of CoV-associated LRTI that necessitated oxygen use than were nonimmunocompromised children. In that study, younger age, underlying pulmonary disorder, and the concomitant presence of RSV were also associated with severe CoV-associated LRTI (18) .The aim of this study was to determine the burden and clinical features of CoV infections in children living with and without HIV hospitalized for pneumonia. Furthermore, as we have previously done for other respiratory viruses (19) (20) (21) , we probed, using a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of an investigational 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9), whether PCV9 could prevent CoV-associated hospitalization and thereby infer that pneumococcal infection may contribute to hospitalization for CoV-associated pneumonia.During the follow-up period included in this analysis, from all the participants in the initial trial, 347 (162 PCV9 group and 185 placebo recipients) children living with HIV and 448 (202 PCV9 group and 246 placebo recipients) without HIV had at least one episode of pneumonia tested for CoV infection. Similar proportions of samples were tested from PCV9 recipients and placebo recipients (22) . Of the tested children, 69 (19.9%) living with HIV and 34 (7.6%; P , 0.001) without HIV tested CoV PCR positive (Table 1) .Five children living with HIV had the same virus detected for long periods, including three children with CoV-OC43 detected 32, 38, and 70 days apart; one child with CoV-HKU1 identified twice 74 days apart; and one child in whom CoV-OC43 was identified twice 219 days apart. One child living with HIV had three CoV-associated admissions; the child initially tested positive for CoV-OC43, then 5 months later CoV-NL63 was detected, and after 3 months CoV-OC43 was detected again. Six children living with HIV had two distinct CoVs identified at two different admissions.When assessing the CoV-associated pneumonia episodes among children randomized to placebo, children living with HIV compared to those without HIV were more likely to have oxygen saturation of ,90% and stay in hospital for longer than 2 days. The percentage of CoV-associated pneumonia episodes with CoVs detected as single viral infection was similar among placebo recipients living with HIV compared to those without HIV (Table 2) .Bacterial cultures were performed in 94.8% of CoV-associated pneumonia admissions. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from blood specimens of two children living with HIV collected at the same admission at which CoV-NL63 was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), one PCV9 recipient (serotype 23F) and one placebo recipient (serotype 6A).Considering children with CoV-associated pneumonia, those living with HIV had a higher case fatality risk (30.4%, n = 21) than children without HIV (2.9%, n = 1; P = 0.001). This was similar to the case fatality risks for children hospitalized for pneumonia in whom CoV infections were not detected (27.0% living with HIV versus 1.7% without HIV). The median age of the 21 children living with HIV who died was 3 months (range: 1 to 15 months) ( Table 3) . CoV-OC43 was the only virus detected in eight of the fatal cases. A coinfection of CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 was detected in a 2month-old fatal case. Among children living with HIV, the case fatality risk in those with episodes where CoVs were the only viruses detected (32.1%) was similar to that in episodes with coinfections by CoVs and other viruses (22.6%; P = 0.35). Escherichia coli was isolated from blood of three children (all living with HIV), and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was identified in 10 (62.5%) children with HIV. Seven (36.8%) of the children living with HIV who died had levels of C-reactive protein of $40 mg/liter, and 11 (64.7%) had procalcitonin levels of $0.5 ng/ml (Table 3) .Overall, PCV9 recipients had a 33.9% (95% CI: 2.0% to 55.4%) lower risk for CoVassociated pneumonia hospitalizations than placebo recipients. In children living without HIV, PCV9 vaccination was associated with a 64.0% (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.2%) reduction in hospitalization with CoV-associated pneumonia, including reductions of 90.9% (95% CI: 29.5% to 98.8%) and 87.5% (95% CI: 0.1% to 98.4%) for CoV-OC43-and CoV- HKU1-associated hospitalizations, respectively. No vaccine efficacy was observed for pneumonia episodes without viruses identified (Table 4 ). No significant protection of PCV9 against hospitalization for CoV-associated pneumonia was observed in children living with HIV (Table 4) .The results of this study suggest a possible interaction between endemic human CoV infection and Streptococcus pneumoniae in children without HIV (23) . In the context of a double-blind placebo-randomized trial, we demonstrated that at least 34% of children hospitalized for CoV-associated pneumonia were also probably coinfected by Streptococcus pneumoniae which might have precipitated their hospitalization. This is supported by in vitro experiments that have shown that CoV-NL63 infection resulted in an increased adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to virus-infected epithelial cells (24) . The imputed rate of coinfection with pneumococci in children with CoV-associated pneumonia from our study provides a conservative estimate of this possible interaction as only 9 pneumococcal serotypes were included in the vaccine and vaccine efficacy, even against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal pneumonia, is not 100%. The high calculated vaccine efficacy estimates for CoV-OC43-and CoV-HKU1-associated disease needs to be contextualized within the wide uncertainty bounds of this estimate. Furthermore, we report on the prevalence and clinical features of endemic CoV-associated pneumonia in children living with and without HIV. CoVs were detected among 19.9% of the hospitalized children living with HIV and in 7.6% of children without HIV. CoV-associated mortality was 30.4% in children living with HIV with 38.1% of these fatal cases having CoV-OC43 as the only virus identified; mortality rates did not differ between children with CoV detected as single infections and those with other viral coinfections.Although our study was not designed to establish whether CoV infections caused more severe disease in children living with HIV, among children with CoV-associated (14, 19, 25) . The increased morbidity and mortality in children living with HIV could have been, however, due to increased susceptibility to pneumococcal and nonpneumococcal coinfections, such as P. jirovecii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, or other viral infections (8, 18) . Other respiratory viruses were, however, not found at higher rates in children living with HIV infected with CoV compared to those without HIV. The high rate of P. jirovecii detection in fatal cases in children living with HIV also suggests that CoVs may lead to secondary P. jirovecii activation. Nonetheless, the higher case fatality rate and the fact that all eight fatal cases with CoV as the only respiratory virus detected were children living with HIV suggest a possible association of CoV causing severe disease in these children.In the current study, of the children living with HIV who died, 36.8% and 64.7% had high levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, respectively. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are normally detected in patients with bacterial infections compared to those with viral infections alone (26) . However, high levels of these two markers may also be suggestive of unrecognized bacterial coinfections in patients with established viral etiology for pneumonia (27) . Recent reports have described clear associations for raised C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels with severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (28) , including in fatal SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases (29) , further underscoring the complexity of host-novel pathogen interaction. Our results together with other data from seasonal CoVs (8) and SARS-CoV-2 suggest a role in bacterial coinfection in those CoV-infected patients who develop severe forms of disease.Recurrent CoV-associated pneumonia episodes were detected in children living with HIV. This could be the result of extended viral shedding since these children have compromised cell-mediated immunity, which is necessary for termination of viral shedding, or due to viral reactivation or reinfection. Nonetheless, in these children initial immune response to infection was not enough to stop infection. Under the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, studies of extended viral shedding among children living with HIV are warranted.To date, there are only a few reports on secondary or superinfections in SARS-CoV-2 patients. A meta-analysis of 28 studies found that the overall bacterial infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients were 7.1%, suggesting that bacterial coinfections are relatively uncommon (30) ; the bacteriological testing method used was, however, not specified in the majority of the studies (14 studies), and four studies used blood culture, a known poorly sensitive method to detect bacterial infections. These results do not discard a role for pneumococcal superinfections, particularly in PCV-underserved settings, as a report from Spain of five SARS-CoV-2 patients showed coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (31) . The findings of these recent studies relative to our study underscore the complexity of extrapolating from established human-adapted viruses with relatively low case fatality rates to a novel zoonotic virus with a relatively high case fatality rate that has been thus far predominately described as a primary viral pneumonitis. Another restriction of using endemic CoV as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 is that the tropism of the endemic viruses is mainly the upper respiratory tract while SARS-CoV-2 has propensity for both the upper and lower respiratory tract.CoVs were normally detected in conjunction with other respiratory viruses in both children living with and those living without HIV, which is similar to previous reports (32) . Considering all the respiratory viruses tested in the current set of samples, there were no differences in the frequency of multiple detections in PCV9 recipients (26%) compared to placebo recipients (27%) in both children living with (25% versus 21%) and without (27% versus 30%) HIV (22) . In the absence of a control group of non-LRTI children, the relationship between CoV infection and disease cannot, however, be definitively established, and this constitutes a limitation of our study. Actually, a case-Seasonal Coronaviruses and Pneumococcal Coinfection ® control study on the etiology of childhood pneumonia in South Africa and the PERCH study were unable to attribute the detection of endemic CoV as causes of pneumonia requiring hospital admission, since the prevalence of CoV infection was similar in cases and controls (2, 33) . The PERCH study was, however, not designed to quantify the importance of coinfections, and caution is needed to directly compare those findings with our observations where interactions with Streptococcus pneumoniae might have led CoV to be associated with pneumonia. Our results suggest that CoV infection likely predisposes to superimposed bacterial infections, as previously shown for other respiratory viruses, so although not directly attributable as the cause of pneumonia, as shown by the previous studies using a single-pathogen model approach, it does not exclude CoVs from being in the causal pathway of the disease. An alternate explanation could be that if, for instance, other respiratory viruses interfere with CoV infection, CoV would appear more frequently in the PCV9 group, even in the absence of a biological interaction with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our vaccine efficacy point estimates for CoV single infection-associated pneumonia and overall CoV-associated pneumonia were very similar, suggesting an interaction between Streptococcus pneumoniae and CoV in the absence of other viral infections.In the hypothetical scenario of a perfect vaccine against CoV, it would be interesting to explore this key question on whether there is a biological interaction between CoV and Streptococcus pneumoniae by investigating if the incidence or severity of pneumococcal pneumonia would be affected by the viral vaccine.A limitation of our study is that the children living with HIV in this cohort were not treated with antiretroviral treatment due to lack of availability for children in the public sector in South Africa 20 years ago, which may have contributed to their clinical course and may differ from that of HIV-infected children currently treated with antiretrovirals. The fact that the study was single-center and that children enrolled into the trial might access health care differently than the general population limits the generalization of the results to other settings.CoVs are classified into four groups, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta; only alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans. The beta group is further composed of A, B, C, and D subgroups (34) . While CoV-229E and CoV-NL63 are alpha viruses, CoV-OC43, the most common CoV identified in our study, and CoV-HKU1, together with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, belong to the beta group (35) . Although seroprevalence studies suggest that exposure to the four common CoVs is widespread during childhood and that approximately 90% of adults are seropositive for at least one CoV (36), this humoral immunity may not be cross protective against the novel CoV species. In vitro studies have, however, shown that CD4 1 T cells from SARS-CoV-2-naive donors responded not only to common CoVs but also to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting possible cross-reactivity (37, 38) . The role of preexisting SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in clinical outcomes remains to be determined.It has been suggested that infection by SARS-CoV-2 in children causes milder clinical symptoms than in adults (39) . In this analysis we show that pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protected children living without HIV against CoV-associated pneumonia hospitalization, and this preventive strategy should be explored in the current pandemic.Population. We undertook a post hoc analysis of children who participated in an efficacy trial of PCV9 in South Africa as described previously (20, 23) . Briefly, 39,836 children were recruited from March 1998 to October 2000 and randomized (1:1) to receive 3 doses (6, 10, and 14 weeks of age) of either PCV9 or placebo, including 2,577 children living with HIV and 37,259 without HIV (23) . Hospital-based surveillance for all-cause hospitalization among study participants was undertaken until October 2006. All hospitalized children were evaluated by study doctors and underwent HIV testing according to study protocol (23) . Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained from children hospitalized with LRTI for identification of select respiratory viruses (20) and archived from February 2000 onward. In the present study, only NPAs collected from 1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002 from children ,2 years old admitted with pneumonia diagnosis (defined as presence of alveolar consolidation on chest X-ray, or clinical diagnosis of LRTI without wheeze on chest auscultation, but with rales and/or bronchial breathing) were analyzed. If a child had recurrent pneumonia hospitalizations, only NPAs collected at least 28 days apart or with different viruses detected were included in the analysis.Viral testing. Samples were investigated using immunofluorescence assay for RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) I to III and adenovirus and by nested PCR for human metapneumovirus as described previously (20, 21) ; real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was later performed to detect four human CoVs, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E, as well as human bocavirus, human rhinovirus (hRV), and WU and KI polyomaviruses using the primers and probes as previously detailed (22) . In this analysis, we describe the epidemiology of CoV-associated pneumonia in the study cohort, including exploring differences in hospitalization rates between those who were randomized to receive PCV9 and those who received placebo. We have previously used this randomized placebo-controlled trial as a probe to establish that by protecting against pneumococcal disease, there was also a decrease in hospitalizations for virus-associated pneumonia, specifically influenza virus-, RSV-, human metapneumovirus-, and polyomavirus-associated pneumonia (19) (20) (21) . The rationale of this approach is that the difference in incidence of any disease between PCV9 recipients and placebo recipients that could potentially be associated with vaccine-serotype pneumococcal infection would indicate a role of vaccine serotypes (40) . As an example, we have previously reported that PCV9 recipients had a 45% lower incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia in which influenza virus was identified, and as such we concluded that at least a similar proportion of the influenza-associated pneumonias among the placebo recipients was precipitated by coinfection with PCV9 serotypes (20) . This is particularly important considering the lack of a sensitive diagnostic tool to diagnose bacterial pneumonia, including the sensitivity of blood culture being only ,5% for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia in children (41) .Statistical analysis. Regression analyses were performed to compare the prevalence of CoVs and the clinical features between children living with and without HIV. Multiple regressions were controlled for age at hospitalization, detection of a virus previously tested, and year of sample collection. Using the concept of vaccine-probe studies (20) , we explored whether there was any association between receipt of PCV9 and the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia associated with CoV infection by estimating vaccine efficacy (VE) based on the formula VE ð%Þ ¼ incidence rate in the unvaccinated2incidence rate in the vaccinated incidence rate in the unvaccinated Â 100All randomized children were included in the intent-to-treat analysis from the day they received their first dose of study vaccine. The first episode was included in the VE calculation for an individual participant, and P values of #0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using STATA version 13.1 (College Station, TX, USA). Ethical considerations. The main efficacy trial and subsequent post hoc analyses were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) of the University of the Witwatersrand.

The combined impact of direct virus injury and dysregulated hyperimmune response with the aberrant release of various cytokines in COVID-19 infected subjects adds to the complexity of management [2] . Various research adopted the use of various immunosuppressive agents to modulate the host's immune response in COVID-19 infected patients. As an example, some evidence suggests that lymphopenia is a risk factor for COVID-19 infectionthe former being the mode of action of mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors. However, more recent experimental studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors carry an anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [3] . This targeted review aims to cover most of the current evidence of the effect of different maintenance immunosuppressive agents in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) during COVID-19 infection and proposes a line of management.There is still some debate regarding the ideal management of glucocorticoid therapy in COVID-19 infected organ transplant recipients. Most clinicians opt to continue glucocorticoids [4] . This practice is supported by the RECOVERY trial demonstrating reduced mortality with dexamethasone therapy in hospitalized nontransplant COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support [5] . On the contrary, some studies showed evidence of possible harm of corticosteroid treatment in SARS patients [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The potential risk of glucocorticoid therapy in COVID-19 patients include immune suppression, impaired viral clearance and higher plasma viral load and epithelial shedding. On the other hand, the key side effects of glucocorticoids including diabetes, psychosis and avascular necrosis of femoral head is a time-dependent function and unlikely to make an impact unless long-term maintenance dose changed significantly or compounded by co-morbid events [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Somewhat surprisingly, some transplant nephrologists prefer glucocorticoid-sparing maintenance immunosuppression in case of COVID-19 infection [6] .Published cases of SARS-CoV-2 in KTR showed variable mortality and morbidity outcomes of high dose steroid therapy combined with reduced or discontinued calcineurin inhibitors and antiproliferative immunosuppression [12] [13] [14] [15] . The benefit of glucocorticoid therapy is possibly dependent on appropriate dosing and timing, and current evidence shows that its benefits outweigh risks [5] .Several guidelines recommend withdrawal of CNI maintenance immunosuppression in case of SARS-COV-2 infection [16, 17] . Given its strong immunosuppressive effect, CNIs may result in an aggressive life-threatening COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, CNIs have been proposed to have an antiviral effect and both cyclosporine A and tacrolimus were found to inhibit the in vitro replication of various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV at low non-cytotoxic concentrations [18, 19] . A genome-wide analysis identified immunophilins as interaction partners of CoV proteins. Inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A was found to block the replication of all types of CoVs, including SARS-CoV [20] . Moreover, tacrolimus treatment and knock down of FK-506 binding proteins blocked SARS-CoV replication in vitro [18] . CNIs may also have a role in ameliorating COVID-19 induced cytokine storm. CNIs inhibit T-cell activation and suppress cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-a and interferon-c) that mediate the cytokine storm [21] . The available data are not strong enough to advocate the use of CNIs as a treatment for COVID-19 infection. However, the data may suggest continuing at least a low dose CNI maintenance immunosuppression in KTR [22] . We are awaiting the results of the Spanish clinical trial to evaluate methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus in patients with COVID-19 lung injury (TACROVID) trial to find out whether tacrolimus may have a therapeutic role in COVID-19 nontransplant patients [23] .Some clinicians suggest that switching from tacrolimus to cyclosporine A may be a suitable option in COVID-19 infected KTRs [24] . According to a published case report, a 45-year-old male KTR who was solely on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) maintenance immunosuppression, was cured from COVID-19 infection after switching from MMF to cyclosporine A, the latter justified by the authors to have an invitro anti-viral effect [25] . A small cohort showed better outcomes in KTRs switched from tacrolimus to cyclosporine A compared to KTRs treated with CNI dose reduction [26] . However, due to limited number of patients enrolled, these findings need to be interpreted cautiously. Clinicians should be aware of drug interactions among medications used to treat COVID-19 and transplant immunosuppression. Protease inhibitors (such as lopinavir/ ritonavir) are enzyme inhibitors that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme 3 A (CYP3A). The coadministration of these drugs with CNIs may result in higher CNI blood levels and increased CNI toxicity. CNI dose reduction and prolonged dosing intervals may be needed in KTRs treated with lopinavir/ritonavir [27, 28] . Chloroquine therapy, although with no proven benefit in COVID-19 patients yet still used in this cohort, may result in up to three-fold increase in cyclosporine A levels [29, 30] . This interaction is not seen with tacrolimus [28] .A common practice is to withdraw MMF in KTRs with active infections including COVID-19 [31] . However, there is evidence that MMF and MPA inhibit replication of corona viruses in vitro [32] [33] [34] [35] , including SARS-CoV-2 [36] . On the other hand, in vivo studies suggest that MPA may cause more harm than benefit in case of Middle East respiratory syndrome-corona virus (MERS-CoV) infection [11, 37] . To date, it is advised to reduce the dose or discontinue the use of anti-proliferative medications in severe COVID-19 infection [1] .Belatacept blocks the costimulatory B7-CD28 signal needed for T-cell activation and represents an alternative agent to CNI-based maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. It is thought that it may mitigate the cytokine storm resulting in mild clinical course of COVID-19 infection [38] . A valid concern is that it may impair the T-cell mediated antiviral immune responses [39] . The clinical course of COVID-19 infected KTRs on belatacept varied from mild to severe requiring ICU admission and the effect of its use in KTRs remain poorly defined [38, 39] . mTOR inhibitors mTOR inhibitors have been proposed to encompass a potential anti-COVID-19 effect by hindering the effect of IL-37 and IL-38 in the inflammatory state [3] . Furthermore, previous studies have revealed the association between obesity and the mTOR pathway [40, 41] . Obesity, a known risk factor for COVID-19, stimulates chronic hyperactivation of mTOR activity in multiple tissues [40, 42] . In humans, high ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) activity and overphosphorylation of translation suppressor 4-Eukaryotic binding protein (4EBP), both have been described in obesity [42, 43] . Additionally, accelerated adipogenesis and obesity have been reported in mice presenting a disrupted 4EBP gene [44] . Hence; it has been suggested that targeting the mTOR pathway carries a potential for obesity treatment, thus mitigating the risk of COVID-19. Consistently, S6K knockout mice are found resistant to obesity owing to an impaired biosynthesis pathway downstream of mTORC1 [40] .Remdesivir is the first anti-viral agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19. The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) study showed equivocal results regarding remdesivir vs. placebo in COVID-19 infected subjects, hence; it is recommended to be used in combination with dexamethasone. The reason for coadministering remdesivir and dexamethasone in critically ill patients, is that the former may prevent the steroid-related delay in viral clearance proven in some studies [7, 45] . Therefore, for critically ill patients requiring supplemental oxygen, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines recommend in addition to dexamethasone, treatment with remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg IV for one day followed by 100 mg IV once daily for four days or until hospital discharge [46] . However, side effects of remdesivir including increased level of serum transaminase and accumulation of drug vehicle cyclodextrin in patients with kidney dysfunction need to be considered and closely monitored [46] . Favipiravir is a Japan-based antiviral agent metabolized in the liver by aldehyde oxidase, hence; drug-drug interaction with CNIs is less of a concern. Data supporting favipiravir efficacy in KTRs infected with COVID-19 remain limited. A phase 2 preventive trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in COVID-19 patients was granted by the FDA in August 2020.Despite not FDA approved, to date, there are more than 15 peer-reviewed published articles showing high efficacy of the anti-parasitic agent ivermectin in prophylaxis and treatment of all stages of COVID-19 infection [47] . In vitro, ivermectin administered to Vero-hSLAM cells 2 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed 5000-fold reduction of viral RNA after 48 h [48] . Its anti-viral effect is thought to be mediated through the inhibition of importin a/b-mediated nuclear transport of SARS-CoV-2 proteins [48] . Proposed dose is 0.2 mg/kg for 4-5 days. Caution is advised when using ivermectin with CNIs, the former being a known cytochrome P450 inducer, potentially altering CNI drug levels.Few studies have shown the potential effect of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, in controlling cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 [49] . Blocking formation of cytokines may reduce overall inflammatory response and severity of infection, another potential way to tackle the effect of the virus [49] . The dose is 4-8 mg/kg administered as a single 60-min intravenous infusion every four weeks [50] . Current data support the use of tocilizumab in severe critically ill cases requiring oxygen supplementation.Bamlanivimab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that targets spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and aimed to block the attachment and entry of the virus into human cells [51] . On 9 November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients. Bamlanivimab is not yet approved for severe hospitalized cases considering possible worsening of clinical condition [52] . The FDA authorization was based on the results of the 'blocking viral attachment and cell entry with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (BLAZE-1)' trial, a phase-2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial published in October 2020 in New England Journal of Medicine [51] . The study included 465 non-hospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms [51] . Bamlanivimab was administered to patients within three days of the first t positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test. According to the administered dose of bamlanivimab, patients were divided into four groups (G-1: 700 mg dose, G-2: 2800 mg dose, G-3: 7000 mg dose and G-4: placebo group). By day 3 and 11 of the first administered dose, all groups including placebo, showed a continuous trend toward viral clearance. G-2 had the biggest difference from placebo and lowest viral count as compared to G-1 and G-3. Authors concluded that the drug is safe and potentially effective in mild-moderate COVID-19 patients [51] . With no published data on transplant patients yet, it has been used off-label in some transplants centers in the US with promising results.The main argument that supports performing plasma exchange for COVID-19 patients is the elimination of COVID-19 viral particles. COVID-19 viral particles have a diameter of 60-140 nm, large enough to be eliminated with double filtration plasmapheresis [53] . Additionally, removal of cytokines that mediate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is a valid rationale [53, 54] . While undergoing plasma exchange, replacing with convalescent plasma is a theoretical promising therapeutic modality [53] . Some studies have adopted this theory in management of COVID-19 infected patients on immunosuppression [55] . Plasma exchange is used for seven to 14 sessions with potential favorable outcome [56] .Ronco et al. [57] , reviewed the potential beneficial role of extracorporeal therapy in sepsis, cytokine storm and COVID-19 infected patients. In COVID-19 patients, it has been postulated that extra fluid, cytokines and endotoxins removal by extracorporeal therapy all have a potential survival benefit [58] . Proposed approaches for cytokine removal include direct haemoperfusion using a neutro-macroporous sorbent; plasma adsorption on a resin after plasma separation from whole blood; hollow fiber filters with adsorptive properties; and high-dose continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) with medium-or high cutoff membranes [57] . Controversial results have developed from diverse set of definitions as regards to timing of CKRT initiation and, hence; leading to biased conclusions. The effect of early vs. delayed initiation of RRT on Mortality in critically ill patients with AKI (ELAIN) randomized controlled trial defined 'early' as 8 h following diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 2 (group 1) and 'late' as 12 h following diagnosis of AKI stage 2 (group 2) [59] . The authors found significantly lower mortality rate within 90 days in group 1 as compared to group 2 [59] . In contrast, Barber et al. [34] failed to show a benefit of 'early' start of CKRT. The latter study defined 'early' as 12 h after development of AKI stage 3. Not only were the aforementioned studies diverse in definitions of timing but also for AKI staging, making the comparison invalid. In COVID-19 patients, it has been postulated that levels of IL-6 > 24.3 pg/mL and D-dimer >0.28 lg/L were predictive of development of severe viral pneumonia (93.3% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity) [58] . The half-life of the inflammatory mediators and cytokines is only a few minutes [58] . Moreover, once the inflammatory cascade has begun, end-organ damage already has taken place with newly generated cytokines less relevant to clinical outcomes [60] . If we only have few minutes to hit the target, then few hours delay in starting CKRT is certainly a target-miss. In addition, the late and late start of CKRT is both representing established failures. We are in need to uniform our definitions of 'early' vs. 'late' initiation of CKRT to standardize the way of practice hoping to land on an informed decision.With the upcoming availability of COVID-19 vaccines, urgent understanding is needed whether to adjust immunomodulation therapy post-immunization [61] . There are six major types of COVID-19 vaccines currently under development worldwide. These vaccines are developed from different viral components including protein subunit, recombinant, live attenuated, inactivated, nucleic acid-based and virus-like particles, and hence all acting differently [61] . On the horizon and expected to be available by the publication of this article, the two promising vaccines developed by US Moderna and BioNTech-Pfizer claim more than 94% efficacy and were developed by a unique novel technology [62] . Both vaccines depend on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), at different sequence, carrying signals to the recipient's immune system to develop immunity to coronavirus infection [62] . Additionally, the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca using the genetically altered adenovirus with addition of coronavirus protein to enhance host's immune response showed a 90% efficacy. Reported side effects in immunocompetent hosts include pain at injection site (60%), fever (50%), headache (42%), fatigue (28%) and arthralgia (24%) [62] . However, no SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial has enrolled immunocompromised subjects [62] . The current standard of practice for immunization is to administer inactivated or killed vaccines (such as flu vaccines) without any interruption in the immunosuppressive regimen. Xia et al. [63] , in a phase 2 trial, reported favorable outcome and mild side effects of an inactivated Chinese vaccine used in immunocompetent hosts against SARS-CoV-2. In case of mRNA/DNA vaccines, theoretical concerns for their use in immunocompromised subjects include a hyper-inflammatory response and autoimmune syndromes related to increased type-I interferon [64] . These effects have been previously observed in animal models with mRNA vaccines, but not in humans [65] . Another concern is the attenuated or absent response to the mRNA/DNA vaccines in this immunocompromised cohort for about 1-6 months after initial induction therapy. Safety and immune response to these novel vaccines in immunocompromised hosts remain unclear and unpredicted. What we understand is that patients might benefit from vaccination before undergoing solid organ transplantation [62] .The National Health Service (NHS) of England guidelines recommend physicians to exercise caution when starting patients on immunosuppressive medications during the pandemic and to use the lowest possible dose of immunosuppression [46] . The British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) recommends for transplant recipients who are well and on immunosuppression therapy to continue with their medications with appropriate social distancing and infection control measures [66] . Despite theoretical evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality for patients on immunosuppression, to date, various studies have shown immunosuppression per se carry no significant added risk [67, 68] . Apparently, major risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection are older age, male gender, obesity and comorbidities of chronic lung disease, diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. For now, adjusting immunosuppressive medications in transplant candidates is highly dependent on many factors including but not limited to severity of the disease, transplant date and apparent risk of rejection. Current evidence remains scarce and limited to observational and case report studies. A proposed algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1 . Most centers adopt reducing or holding antiproliferatives in critically ill patients or in the setting of leukopenia as the first step. Given the possible CNI-anti-COVID effect, many centers keep CNIs at a low dose (target trough levels tacrolimus 4-7 ng/mL or cyclosporine A 50-100 ng/mL). Based on the RECOVERY trial, dexamethasone is initiated at 6 mg QD PO or IV for 10 days (prednisone may be held in the meantime) [5] . For critically ill patients, the NIH guidelines recommend the addition of remdesivir (to dexamethasone) at a dose of 200 mg IV for one day followed by 100 mg IV once daily for four days or until hospital discharge [46] . Italian and Chinese guidelines have included tocilizumab as a treatment option for selected patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [69, 70] . Some protocols involve and reserve remdesivir, plasma exchange, convalescent plasma in severe cases [49, 55] . Bamlanivimab is FDA authorized and considered for mild-moderate COVID-19 infected cases [51, 52] . Ivermectin is used off- label in few centers in the US [48] . Further studies are needed to determine the impact of specific immunosuppressive agents on the course of COVID-19 infection.Dr Tibor F€ ul€ op is a current employee of the United States Veterans Health Administration.

It was first discovered in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 [1] and on 11 th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic due to the rapid increase in the number of cases outside China [2] . In Ethiopia, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 13 th March 2020 [3] .COVID-19 virus is transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, direct contact with an infected individual, or indirect contact with a surface or object that is contaminated with respiratory secretions [4] . Although not common, coronaviruses can also be transmitted from animals to humans [5] . During the early phase of the pandemic, the WHO suspected the zoonotic source of the virus and recommended precautionary measures to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to humans [6] . The disease is clinically presented with fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and other flu-like signs and symptoms including runny and stuffy nose, sneezing, and sore throat. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild to moderate (81%) disease, approximately 15% develop severe disease that requires oxygen support, and 5% have critical disease with complications [7] [8] [9] .Currently, there is no effective treatment and vaccine for the virus. However, active case finding and isolation, quarantine, frequent handwashing with water and soap or alcohol-based sanitizers, social distancing, avoiding travel/travel restrictions, use of facemasks, and avoiding public gatherings are the measures of choice to prevent and mitigate the effect of the pandemic [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the effectiveness of such measures depends on public awareness and strict obedience to those recommendations.Food and drinking establishments are potential hotspots for COVID-19 spread because many people share food, talk loudly, and drink alcohol in enclosed spaces [15] . The high interactions between guests and staff could lead to high transmission rates. Furthermore, the transmissibility of COVID-19 virus from asymptomatic patients could lead to a higher probability of work-related transmission as people with mild or no symptoms could continue to work or travel [16] . Thus, waiters working in different food and drinking establishments have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or easily spread the virus in the community.Although waiters are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the infection [16] , information regarding their level of knowledge of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors is scarce. Most studies conducted so far have focused on the general public ignoring this vulnerable population group [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, the current study was intended to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors of waiters in Southwest Ethiopia.Ethical approval was obtained from Mizan-Tepi University Institutional Review Board (IRB) before the commencement of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after explaining the study's purpose, risks, and benefits. Moreover, participants were assured the participation is entirely voluntary and personal information is not disclosed to third parties.A cross-sectional study was conducted among waiters working in hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, and bars found in Mizan-Aman, Jemu, and Masha towns in Southwest Ethiopia from June 1 to 15, 2020. Mizan-Aman, Jemu, and Masha are the administrative centers of Bench-Sheko, West-Omo, and Sheka zones, respectively. Mizan-Aman town is located 585 km from Addis Ababa, while Jemu and Masha are found at 625 km and 6132 km from Addis Ababa, respectively. The areas are commonly known by gold mining and cash crop production, such as coffee and different spices. As a result, there are high social mobilities in the areas that make a conducive environment for the spread of the COVID-19 virus.The source population was all waiters working in food and drinking establishments that were found in Mizan-Aman, Sheka, and Masha towns. Waiters on duties in the selected hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, and bars during the data collection period were randomly selected for interview.The sample size was calculated using a formula for single population proportion by considering the following assumptions: 5% margin of error, 95%confidence level, and expected proportion of waiters with good preventive behavior to be 50%. A proportion of 50% was taken because there were no previous similar studies in Ethiopia. After adding a 10% contingency for non-response, the final sample size was determined to be 422.A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. First, lists of all food and drinking establishments found in the three towns were obtained from the respective town administration. Then, the sample size was proportionally allocated to each town depending on the total number of food and drinking establishments in each town. Finally, simple random sampling technique was use to select establishments from each town using computer generated random numbers. At establishment level, one waiter per establishment was selected for interviews. If more than one eligible individual presented in selected establishments, one person was randomly selected using the lottery method. All waiters in an establishment were listed on separate slips of paper of the same size and shape. Then, papers were folded carefully, and finally, a blindfold selection was made.The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed from related studies and guidelines [20] [21] [22] [23] . The tool consisted of five parts: participants' characteristics (age, sex, marital status, religion, occupation, ethnicity, and the number of people living in the home), knowledge of COVID-19, perceived self-efficacy regarding prevention measures, COVID-19 preventive behaviors, and risk perception regarding COVID-19.COVID-19 preventive behavior was measured using 10 items. Respondents were asked to rate how often they had been practicing the preventive measures recommended by the WHO during the pandemic on five-point scales: (1) never, (2) rarely, (3) sometimes, (4) frequently, and (5) always. During analysis, each item was recoded into ""not practiced or inadequate practice"" if subjects scored never, rarely, or sometimes and into ""adequate practice"" if scored frequently or always. Finally, respondents who scored adequate practice for at least 60% of the items were considered as having ""good preventive behavior""; otherwise ""poor preventive behavior"". A 60% cutoff point was achieved based on a study done in Iran [24] .Knowledge of COVID-19 (etiology, mode of transmission, symptoms, prevention methods, and treatment or vaccine) was measured using 15 items that were answered on"" yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"" responses. The correct answers were coded with 1 and the incorrect answers were coded with 0. Finally, participants who scored � 59% were categorized as having ""poor knowledge"", 60%-79% as ""moderate knowledge"", and �80% as ""good knowledge"" of COVID-19 based on Bloom's cut-off point [25] .Self-efficacy to practice commonly recommended COVID-19 prevention methods was measured using 4 items that were responded on a five-point scale: (1) certainly not, (2) probably not, (3) perhaps not to perhaps yes, (4) probably yes, and (5) most certainly. The respondents were asked if they were able to carry out the recommended measures. A mean score was computed and a score at mean or less indicates low self-efficacy, while a score above the mean indicates high self-efficacy.Risk perception regarding COVID-19 was measured using 12 items of five Likert scale: (1) strongly disagree, (2) disagree, (3) neutral, (4) agree, and (5) strongly agree. The items were stated in a way that a higher value indicates higher risk perception. The cumulative risk perception score (range 12-60) was computed [22] . Based on the mean score, risk perception was categorized as high if scored above the mean score and low if scored at the mean or less.The reliability (internal consistency) of the questionnaire was checked based on the results of the pretest. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.703 for practice, 0.682 for knowledge, 0.679 for risk perception, and 0.764 for self-efficacy items.Data were collected by health care professionals who had a bachelor's degree qualification, and prior data collection experiences. The data collectors and supervisors were trained on the data collection tool, the objective of the study, how to ensure confidentiality of information, and how to prevent transmission of COVID-19 during the interview. To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during data collection, the data collectors used necessary personal protective equipment (PPE).The collected data were manually checked for completeness, entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were done for different variables and bivariate binary logistic regression analysis was done to select candidate variables for multivariable binary logistic regression analysis at p value < 0.25 [26] . Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to control for the effect of possible confounders, and variables with p value < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 preventive behavior. Model fitness was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, and multicollinearity was checked using variance inflation factor (VIF).From the 422 total sample size, 416 participated in the study, resulting in a 98.6% response rate. The mean age of respondents was 27.26 (SD = ±8.35) years and more than half were aged 18-25 years. More than half (54.1%) of the study participants were female. The majority (84.1%) of the participants were single, and 44% of the participants had attended primary school. Three hundred thirty (79.3%) study participants were living with one or more persons ( Table 1) .All study participants heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. The main sources of information were television (99.5%), followed by short messages from telecommunication (60.8%) and radio (58.9%) (Fig 1) . The majority (84.4%) of the respondents know the cause of the new coronavirus disease. Three hundred twenty-eight (78.8%) study participants mentioned direct contact with infected people as a mode of transmission for the virus. Nearly three-fourths (72.8%) thought that contact with contaminated animals and 60.6% thought that touching contaminated objects/surfaces represent modes of spread for COVID-19. Furthermore, cough (86.6%), fever (83.2%), and shortness of breath (48.1%) were the commonly known symptoms of COVID 19. Regarding preventive methods, about 82.7% know frequent handwashing with soap and water or using alcohol-based sanitizer helps prevent COVID-19. Also, 75.5% of the respondents know that keeping social distance prevents COVID-19 ( Table 2) .The mean cumulative score of knowledge was 10.32 (SD = 2.37), and the minimum and maximum scores were 3 and 15 respectively. Regarding compressive knowledge of COVID, 30.8% of the respondents had poor knowledge and 27.6% had good knowledge (Fig 2) . About 27% of the respondents never keep physical distance, while only 5% keep physical distance always. About 18.8% and 19.2% of the respondents wash their hands with water and soap or with sanitizer frequently and always, respectively. Only 6% of the respondents using facemasks at work or outside their home always, and about 6.7% and 4% were using gloves frequently and always, respectively ( Table 3 ). The overall proportion of study participants with good COVID-19 preventive behavior were only 21.2%. The common barriers reported were the difficulty of maintaining social distance at work due to the nature of their work, shortage of facemasks and gloves, and high efforts needed to implement prevention measures (Fig 3) .Two hundred twenty-two (53.4%) of the participants had a high-risk perception towards COVID-19, while the remaining 46.6% had a low-risk perception. Besides, 53.1% of study participants had high self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 preventive methods. In simple binary logistic regression analysis, sex, marital status, educational status, number of people living in the house, risk perception, and perceived self-efficacy had a p value � 0.25; hence, they were candidates for the multivariable binary logistic model. However, age and knowledge about COVID-19 were excluded from the multivariable model because their p-values were greater than 0.25 in the bivariate binary logistic regression analysis. The number of people living in the home was excluded from the model because the model best fit when this variable removed from the model. In the final multivariable binary logistic regression model, sex, educational status, risk perception, and perceived self-efficacy were significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive behavior (p <0.05) ( Table 4 ). The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among females was 2.33 times higher than their counterparts (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.38-3.94). The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among waiters who had no formal education was about 0.39 times lower compared to those who attended at least secondary education (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.88). The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among waiters who had high-risk perception toward COVID-19 was 2.56 times higher compared to those who had low-risk perception toward COVID-19 (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.51-4.32). The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among waiters who had high perceived self-efficacy was almost twice as high as those who had low self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 prevention methods (AOR = 1.1.75, 95% CI: 1.05-2.90).After the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Ethiopia on March 13 th , 2020 [3] , the government started responding to the pandemic aggressively. A state of emergency was declared to counter and control the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact. During the periods of the state of emergency: land borders were closed, schools and universities remained shut, all gathering of more than four persons were forbidden unless specially permitted, all vehicles (public and private) and railway, and light railway allowed to operate only at 50% and 25% of passenger capacity, respectively. Moreover, hotels, restaurants, and cafeterias didn't allow service to more than three patrons at a single table and should ensure that tables that are being used by patrons simultaneously are at least two adult strides apart [27] . However, still date a full lockdown has not been declared in Ethiopia. Hotels, bars, restaurants, and cafeterias are not completely closed during the pandemic in Ethiopia; hence, the risk of the spread of the virus is high because they are visited by many people who interact among themselves and with employees. Therefore, every staff must strictly follow the basic protective measures.This study aimed to assess knowledge of COVID-19 and the practice of preventive behaviors among waiters in southwest Ethiopia. The finding of this study showed that the majority of the respondents knew the cause of COVID-19. It was revealed that a significant proportion of participants know the mode of spread of the virus (inhalation of droplets from infected people, direct contact with infected people, contaminated animals, and contaminated objects/surfaces). A few participants thought that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquito bites. A study conducted in Nigeria also reported a similar misconception [28] . Furthermore, the majority of the respondents know common symptoms of COVID-19 disease and its prevention methods. The main source of information for study participants was from television. It was also identified that only 21.2% of the study participants had good COVID-19 preventive behavior. This finding is almost similar to a study conducted in Myanmar [29] . However, this finding is lower than a study conducted in Northwest Ethiopia, and Pakistan [30] [31] [32] . This variation could be due to the differences in socio-economic characteristics of study participants or it might be due to disparity in access to media. The current study was conducted in remote areas of the country where access to the internet and electronic media is relatively low. Also, it might be due to barriers related to the nature of the work, shortage of facemasks and gloves during early phase of the outbreak. The low COVID-19 preventive behavior among waiters has a great public health implication; if waiters are infected with COVID-19, there will be a high risk of spreading the disease to the community because they frequently come in contact with many people due to the nature of their work.The odds of good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods among females was higher compared to males. Most of the time females are more careful of themselves and others around them. Other studies also indicated that males are less likely to practice COVID-19 prevention methods compared to females [33, 34] . Thus, behavioral intervention programs had better consider women as change agents in adopting a particular preventive behavior in the family and the community as well.This study identified that a higher score of COVID-19 preventive behavior is associated with higher risk perception. This finding is consistent with findings from other studies [4, 14] . This could be due to individuals who perceive they are at high risk might engage in preventive behaviors. This may imply it could be possible to enhance the desired behavior by proper risk communication about the disease.The educational status of participants was also associated with COVID-19 preventive behavior. The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among study participants who had no formal education was lower compared to those who attended at least secondary education. Similarly, a study conducted among visitors in Jimma University Medical Center in Ethiopia showed that proper handwashing with soap and water or sanitizer was negatively associated with lower educational status [35] . This could be because educated people are in a better position to have access to COVID-19 related information. Moreover, they could easily comprehend instruction/recommendations made by health personnel, media, and other relevant bodies.The odds of good COVID-19 preventive behavior among subjects who had high perceived self-efficacy was higher when compared to those with low self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 prevention methods. A similar claim was forwarded by a previous study conducted elsewhere [33] . This is substantiated by the theory of self-efficacy which states that self-efficacy influences every human endeavor; by determining the belief a person holds regarding his or her ability to perform a particular action [36] . Thus, enabling people to enhance their self-efficacy through various individualized approach could bring the desired behavioral changes.Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, it is difficult to establish cause-effect relationships. Also, since data were collected through self-reports, there might be a risk of desirability bias. Furthermore, due to the fact that the study design is purely quantitative, we cannot explain the reasons for the observed effect and their meanings in that particular context.A significant proportion of waiters knew common symptoms of COVID 19, route of transmission, and its prevention methods. However, good COVID-19 preventive behavior was very low. It was recognized that being a female, higher schooling, having a high-risk perception, and having a high perceived self-efficacy were positively associated with good COVID-19 preventive behavior. Thus, all concerned bodies working on the prevention and control of COVID-19 should give attention to this population to enhance compliance with recommended preventive behaviors through addressing these significant predictors. Since widespread infection among waiters with COVID-19 has an important public health implication, law enforcement bodies shall employ a compulsory mechanism to monitor the implementation of all recommendations.Supporting information S1 Dataset.

The global burden of disease attributable to COVID-19 is enormous [1] [2] [3] . It is challenging to control the pandemic because of the high epidemic potential of the disease and the lack of potent vaccines to ramp up the herd immunity of populations. Thus, COVID-19 has spread to almost all countries of the world including Nigeria [3] . The first case was confirmed in Nigeria on 27 February 2020 [2] and by day 120 (25 June 2020), the cumulative cases had risen to 22,614 [2] . There was a suspicion that the reported confirmed cases did not reflect the true situation because of the low level of testing.COVID-19 testing rate in Nigeria has been considerably low compared to other African countries and countries with similar population size. This has been attributed sometimes to delays in kits and reagent supplies during the border closures although, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) claimed that the strict adherence to COVID-19 protocol and guidelines was partly responsible for the low level of testing [2] . However, the number of testing centres has now increased and the COVID-19 testing capacity has improved tremendously across the country.Nigeria is a low-income country with a fragile health system. The control strategies instituted against COVID-19 spread in the country appeared insufficient as the number of daily cases continued to record new highs. With densely populated cities and towns, infectious diseases spread would be challenging to contain. In this study, we attempted to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria using the 120-day data for confirmed cases. In addition, we compared the disease spread patterns, death, and the fitted model with seven other countries. Two research questions were consequently addressed: (i) How does COVID-19 spread and mortality compare with other countries in the first 120 days? (ii) Given the prevailing testing regime, interventional efforts and all other things being equal, what is the 3-month projected cumulative cases of COVID-19?The cross-sectional study was conducted in Nigeria using data from February 27 to June 25, 2020. Nigeria has a population of about 200 million, many international land borders and a few international airports. As at the time of writing this report, situation assessment showed that the compliance with the government directive on precautionary measures against COVID-19 was low in Nigeria [2] .The secondary data utilised for this study was extracted from the World Bank Database on COVID-19 [1] . Seven other countries (Ghana, Egypt, Cameroun, South Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Mexico) were purposively selected from Africa, Asia and South America. These countries were selected because they experienced the outbreak of COVID-19 almost concurrently as Nigeria and the magnitude of the cumulative confirmed cases was relatively similar to that of Nigeria on the World COVID-19 table as at the time of data extraction for this study. Additionally, the countries were similar in terms of their economic development being classified as Low-Middle Income countries by the World Bank. The extracted data were restricted to the first 120 days of the outbreak of COVID-19 in these countries. The population figure, population density [4] and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 as at day 120 of the outbreak in the selected countries are represented in Table 1 .Data were presented with charts and line graphs. Four classes of regression model were used to fit the cumulative data on COVID-19. These are: linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential models. The equations representing each model are presented in Table 2 .Further, the model with the best fit was used to predict a 3-month (30 September 2020) cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.The data as presented in Fig. 1 shows an increasing trend in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria, from day 1 through day 120. There was a consistent increase in the number of cases after the relaxation of lockdown measures. During the lockdown, the growth rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria was 5.85 (95% CI: 5.41,6.29; R 2 =0.728; p< 0.001) and this increased to 8.42 (95% CI:8.41,8.43; R 2 =0.625; p< 0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed. Figure 2 shows the cumulative daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the first 120 days after the outbreak in eight countries. The pattern of Nigeria's cumulative daily confirmed cases aligned with three (Ghana, Egypt and Cameroun) of the seven countries, particularly within the first 97 days. The trajectory of the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria aligned perfectly with Ghana's pattern and slightly differs from the pattern exhibited by Cameroun after the 97th day. There was a clear difference in the pattern observed between Nigeria and Mexico, Bangladesh, South Africa and Indonesia respectively.The distribution of deaths associated with COVID-19 within the first 120 days after the outbreak shows that the observed pattern for Nigeria was nearly the same with six of the seven countries compared. In particular, the Nigeria's pattern was identical to other countries in Central and West Africa (Cameroun and Ghana) (Fig. 3) .The summary of the model and estimated parameters are shown in Table 3 . Across all the eight countries included in the analyses, the Cubic Polynomial Model (CPM) was identified as the best fit to model COVID-19 data. The CPM perfectly fits the Mexico data with an R-square of 100%. The R-square for Nigeria was 99.9%, an indication that 99.9% of the variation in the cumulative daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria can be explained by the model with time as the main covariate. The predictive models for Nigeria are: Linear: N x = − 4937.222 + 16 4.210x, Quadratic: N x = 1748.194 − 164.581x + 2.717x 2 , Cubic: N x = 151.233 − 9.415x − 0.475x 2 + 0.018x 3 , Exponential: N x = 2.245 exp (0.090x) ( Table 3) .The data as presented in Fig. 4 depict the observed and predicted cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the selected countries as at day 120 of the outbreak. The trajectory of observed COVID-19 cumulative cases in Nigeria deviated from the exponential and linear models but perfectly fits the quadratic and cubic regression models. The exponential model fits the data for South Africa and, to some extent, Egypt in the first 70 days of the outbreak in these countries. The simple linear regression model did not fit the data for any of the studied countries.The observed and estimated values of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria using both quadratic and cubic polynomial models are presented in Fig. 5 The goal of this paper was to assess the COVID-19 spread and attendant deaths in Nigeria and selected countries during the first 120 days of outbreaks. First, our analysis showed the spread of the pandemic increased following the relaxation of lockdowns. Both spread and mortality patterns in Nigeria compared closely with other African countries (Ghana, Cameroun and Egypt). Lastly, the findings suggested that different predictive models fitted the data for different countries.In this study, the COVID-19 data in Nigeria showed an increasing trend. The epidemic curve for Nigeria differed from the typical propagated epidemic curve that would have been expected for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with person-to-person mode of transmission. COVID-19 reproduction number appears to gain traction with time as estimated to be from 1.4 to 2.5, 3.6 to 4.0, and 2.24 to 3.58 from earlier studies [3, [5] [6] [7] . This indicates that the infection rate continues to increase. Therefore, the observed pattern found in our study agrees with the known pattern of spread of the disease. We also found that a higher number of cases was reported after the relaxation of lockdown than was reported during the lockdown period. The increased spread of the disease after the relaxation of lockdown could be due to poor adherence to the recommended preventive measures in Nigeria. This may be expected because when restrictive measures are lifted, exposures to disease risks become higher. Consequently, an increased number of infections is likely to follow. This is in tandem with evidence from developed countries As at day 120 of the outbreak in the respective countries Table 2 The four predictive modelsLinear N x = a + bx + ε 1QuadraticCube polynomial N x = f + gx + hx 2 + jx 3 + ε 3Exponentialwhere a, c, f and k are intercepts; b, d, e, g, h, j and m are slopes which are estimated by least square estimation, x is the time-point and ɛ's are mutually uncorrelated random errors with mean (0) and common variance (σ 2 ); df is the degree of freedom where the transmission dynamics and effectiveness of control measures have been rigorously studied [8, 9] . However, another plausible explanation for the increase in the number of confirmed cases could be the improved testing capacity in the country which coincided with the lockdown relaxation. Compared with Ghana and South Africa, the testing capacity in Nigeria was generally low. While Nigeria had only 2755 persons tested for COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people, the estimate was 16,206 and 76,067 for Ghana and South Africa respectively [10] . We found a similar pattern in the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon possibly due to similarity in the capacity for testing in the first 120 days of the disease outbreak. Conversely, a difference was observed in the pattern exhibited by Nigeria compared to four of the seven countries investigated (Mexico, Bangladesh, South Africa and Indonesia). As at day 120 in these four countries, the total COVID-19 tests per 1 million population was strikingly higher than that of Nigeria over the same period [1, 10] . Only Indonesia had a population size that was similar to that of Nigeria while the other countries had a considerably lower population than that of Nigeria. Mexico, Bangladesh, South Africa and Indonesia had environmental factors such as temperature and humidity that were comparable to that of Nigeria [11, 12] . Thus, the reasons that could explain the differences in disease spread pattern between these countries and Nigeria is not immediately clear except for the differences in COVID-19 testing rate. The implication is that community We further found that the distribution of COVID-19-associated deaths observed for Nigeria was comparable to six of the seven countries investigated and aligned perfectly with the Cameroun and Ghana patterns. COVID-19-related death trajectory in Mexico may be explained by the higher number of observed COVID-19 cases recorded within the study period compared to other countries. The similarity in COVID-19 deaths between Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon may be attributed to other factors different from the COVID-19 testing capacity and case management capabilities.Cubic Polynomial Model (CPM) was identified as the best fit model among the four models used in this study. Next to the CPM is the quadratic model (QM). The CPM and QM have been identified in some previous studies as the best predictive models for some infectious diseases including Ebola and COVID-19 [13, 14] . None of the country data was suited for the exponential model except South Africa, which was suitable for the first 70 days of the outbreak. A similar observation was reported previously on the suitability of the exponential model for fitting the epidemic curve of infectious diseases [15] . Nonetheless, differences in the levels and modes of testing across countries could be responsible for South Africa's exemption. In South Africa, a community testing approach was instituted early unlike in other African countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon. In addition, the marked differences in atmospheric and environmental conditions between countries may constitute potential explanatory variables [11, 12] .In our study, the predicted COVID-19 cumulative case for 30 September 2020 using QM and CPM was 93,988 and 155,467 respectively. This is premised on the assumption that the present COVID-19 testing capacity and the level of compliance with the preventive measures to mitigate the spread is sustained. The wide gap between the two estimates could be linked to differences in the equations governing the use of QM and CPM, which implied that different parameters were used for the estimation. In this study, the model with the best fit differed across countries indicating variations in the epidemiological contexts, transmission dynamics and control efforts. Although some of these countries shared similarities in demographic and developmental profile, there were potential differences in other factors such as testing capacity, risk profile, enforcement of containment measures and the level of exposure to infected individuals.The public health implication of our study is that there is a need for adequate emergency preparedness. The identified trajectory of COVID-19 infection in Nigeria is an impetus for increased surveillance, enhanced testing capacity and proactive planning for clinical management of cases as well as psychosocial management of discharged cases. Also, the preventive measures may have to be strengthened for containment of disease spread in Nigeria and the other countries.The Nigeria data was premised on testing suspected cases who reported at the testing centres or symptomatic individuals who called the NCDC response team lines at their various homes for help. The differences in the scale of testing and the environmental conditions in different countries should be considered in interpreting our findings. This is because evidence suggests a relationship between weather conditions and transmission risks of COVID-19 [11, 12] . Inaccessibility to data on socio-demographic profile and health history of the COVID-19 patients and survivors limited the opportunity to perform further statistical and mathematical modelling.The spread of COVID-19 is increasing daily and the projection provides insight into what the situation could be in days ahead in Nigeria. Thus, enhanced emergency preparedness and contingency plans to mitigate the COVID-19 spread are urgently required. There is a need to increase testing capacities both at State and Local government levels as current testing is limited. Improvement in COVID-19 control measures and strict compliance with the COVID-19 recommended protocols are strongly recommended. Preparation should be made for the case management of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.Abbreviations SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; WHO: World health organization; NCDC: Nigeria centre for disease and control; ECDC: European centre for disease prevention and control; R 2 : Coefficient of determination; FCT: Federal capital territory; CPM: Cubic polynomial model","Nigeria","abstract","2021-01-12",1

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes viremia by entering the blood through the lungs [3] , and then the virus targets the lungs, heart, and renal and gastrointestinal tract as they express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2) [4] .Lung involvement by vascular pathway can occur through number of mechanisms including the dysregulated iron homeostasis causing oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction [5] that may promote the sequences of viral infections [6] . Furthermore, anemic hypoxia induces pulmonary vasoconstriction, with an increasing fibrin formation in lung microvasculature [7] ; lymphocyte infiltration and sequestration in the lungs [8] . SARS-CoV-2 virus also affects ACE receptor in different tissues including both lymphocyte and lung [4] which leads to marked systemic increase of inflammatory cytokines and mediators that may be even categorized as a ""cytokine storm"" [9] .Clinical symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. Most cases had good prognosis [10, 11] . Patients can have severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple-organ failure, which can lead to death. Mortality rate of 2.1% has been reported [12] .The characteristic chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia have low specificity due to their similarity with many other conditions. Though final diagnosis cannot be made based on CT imaging features alone, merging clinical and imaging results can significantly improve the accuracy of diagnosis [13] .CT imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and monitoring of disease progress [14] [15] [16] . Multiple research studies described the characteristic imaging findings of COVID-19, including ground-glass opacities (GGO) (57 to 88%), bilateral involvement (76 to 88%), and peripheral distribution (33 to 85%) [17] [18] [19] [20] .Other imaging features like consolidation, cavitation, and interlobular septal thickening also are reported in some patients. However, these imaging manifestations of COVID-19 are nonspecific and are difficult to differentiate from other pneumonia [21] [22] [23] .Therefore, the aim of this study is to learn from the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19 clinical features, laboratory results, and high-resolution CT manifestations by disease severity to provide important reference values for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.This retrospective analytic study was conducted following the amended Declaration of Helsinki. Our institutional independent ethics committee approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients. This multicentered study included 128 patients (men 79 and women 49 with mean age ± SD 49.07 ± 15.89 years; range 13-65 years) from April to July 2020.In inclusion criteria, we included patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 infection.In exclusion criteria, we excluded patients with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 infection as well as patients with a verified additional simultaneous acute illness or other preexistent medical disorders.Clinical data were documented, including age, gender, and disease severity. Present history, symptoms and signs, and blood routine outcomes were also recorded. There were three clinical categories according to the severity of disease: ""mild, moderate, and severe types."" Patient clinical symptoms ranged between fever, dry cough, muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, dyspnea (chest distress), hyposomia, sore throat (pharyngalgia), and diarrhea ( Fig. 1 ).All available laboratory investigations of the patients were analyzed: complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin and hematocrit level, platelets count, differential white blood cell count, lymphocyte concentration, transferrin level, and level of C reactive protein. Axial unenhanced chest HRCT image shows multifocal, scattered, peripheral, patchy ground-glass opacity in both lungs, and poor definition of area surrounding lesions and associated halo sign at left lung (red arrows)Each patient underwent chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) examination. Inspiratory phase of chest HRCT examination was achieved during a single-breath hold at full inspiration. The CT scanner models from the hospitals involved in this multicenter study were listed as following: Philips 256-slice Brilliance iCT, Toshiba 16-slice Aquilion, Siemens 16-slice Somatom Emotion. The scanning parameters are as follows: tube voltage 120 kV, tube current 110 mA, pitch 1.0, rotation time ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 s, and slice thickness 5 mm, with 1 mm or 1.5 mm section thickness for axial, coronal, and sagittal reconstructions.Four radiologists with 15-20 years of experience blinded to clinical data individually scored the CT images.The distribution features and the shape of abnormal attenuation, as well as the involved lung lobes, were documented. If there were any common associated diseases of the lung, such as obsolete pulmonary tuberculosis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, and tumor, they would be recorded if any.The following CT performances features were judged and documented depending upon the following features: ground glass opacification; presence or absence, bilateral or unilateral, site, lobes involved, frequency, pattern ""associated consolidation, reverse halo/atoll sign, crazy paving, mosaic attenuation,"" morphology, presence of centrilobular nodules or not, presence of tree-in-bud sign or not, presence of solid nodules or not, presence of air space consolidation or not, presence of lymphadenopathy or not and its station, presence of pleural thickening or not, presence of pleural effusion or not, presence of mucoid impaction or not, presence of bronchial wall thickening or not, presence of smooth interlobular septal thickening or not, presence of pulmonary cavitation or not, presence of pericardial effusion or not, and if the patient has endotracheal intubation or not.The CT signs were analyzed quantitatively using a radiologic scoring system, and according to the performances of CT images, the cases were classified into six stages ranging from grade 1 to 2 for mild grades of the disease, 3 to 4 for moderate grades of the disease, and 5 to 6 for severe grades of the disease, and a total score was eventually recorded. The classification method was mainly according to the previous CT presentations using a CORAD radiologic scoring system of the method previously reported [24] . CORADS 1: COVID-19 is highly unlikelyThe CT is normal or there are findings that indicate a noninfectious disease like congestive heart failure, sarcoid, histoplasmosis, malignancy, usual interstitial pneumonia ""UIP,"" or fibrotic Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ""NSIP."" Mostly these are suspicious CT findings but not extremely typical. Unilateral ground glass, multifocal consolidations without any other typical finding, and findings doubtful of COVID-19 in underlying pulmonary disease are the abovementioned suspicious CT findings which are not extremely typical. Results were statistically evaluated by SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chikago, IL, USA). ANOVA (F test) was used for parametric data and Kruskal-Wallis tests was used for nonparametric data. Chi-Square (χ 2 ) and Monte Carlo tests were used for qualitative variables. Spearman correlation was applied. P value < 0.05 is considered significant.Of the features, twenty radiological features and fifteen clinical and laboratory features were nominated to form the predictors based on the results shown in (Table 1 ). One hundred twenty-eight patients had RT-PCR test findings established to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.Of the 128 patients enrolled in this study cohort with COVID-19 symptoms, 79 (61.7%) were male and 49 (38.3%) were female (mean age ± SD 49.07 ± 15.89, range 13-65 years) ( Table 1 ). The mean time interval between symptoms onset and baseline CT was 5 ± 3 days (range, 2-8 days).Radiological classification revealed that most of the patients were reported in grade V (55 patients, 43%). COVID severity was distributed as mild grade (19 patients, 14 .8%), moderate grade (43 patients, 33.6%), and severe grade (66 patients, 51.6%) ( Table 2 ). Comparison between degrees of severity of COVID-19 regarding demography and pulmonary lesion characteristics revealed that severe COVID-19 symptoms was significantly reported among old age patients (P = 0.003) (Fig. 3) .Demographic, clinical, pulmonary, and laboratory findings in different disease stages Patients' age was significantly higher in severe cases (52.89 ± 13.37). Male to female ratio was nearly equal in mild cases (7.0 to7.8%) and nearly doubles in severe cases (35.2 to 16.4%) ( Table 3) .Clinical symptoms were considerably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 except fever (body temperature 37.5-39.0°C) despite being nonsignificant, but it was higher in patients with moderate COVID-19 in contrast to other groups. Fever (88.3%), cough (76.6%), and muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue (70.3%) were the most common presenting symptoms (Table 3) .For lab investigations, low lymphocyte and white cell counts were observed in 64.1% and 25% of patients, while high Creactive protein was observed in 91.4% of patients. Low WBCs was reported among 25% of the whole studied patients. Severe COVID-19 patients revealed a significantly higher percentage of low WBCs (31.8%) than mild COVID-19 (10.5%) and moderate COVID-19 (20.9%) patients. Lymphopenia was 4) . Furthermore lymphocytes and WBCs were significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (P < 0.001) ( Table 4) . RBCs, Hb, and HCT were significantly lower with increasing disease severity (Table 4 ). High C-reactive protein was detected in 91.4% of patients. Transferrin and CRP were significantly higher in moderate and severe COVID-19 than mild grade (P = 0.002 and < 0.001, respectively) ( Table 4 ).There is significant positive correlation found between CT score and transferrin (r = 0.356, P < 0.001) and CRP (r = 0.429, P < 0.001),and significant negative correlation was found with WBCs (r = − 0.245, P = 0.005), lymphocytes (r = − 0.586, P < 0.001), RBCs (r = − 0.2488, P = 0.005), Hb (r = − 0.342, P < 0.001), and HCT (r = − 0.377, P < 0.001). Weak significant negative correlation was found between CT score and platelets count (r = − 0.176, P = 0.047) ( Table 5 ).Pulmonary opacifications were principally sited in the peripheral zone. The sums of involved lung lobes and segments were higher in patients with severe grades than in patients with moderate and mild grades. Bilateral involvement (89.8%) was more predominant than unilateral involvement (10.2%). Lower lobes have higher rates of involvement than the others. The right lower lobe was most often affected (Table 6) (Fig. 5) .The most common CT features were pulmonary GGO in 118 patients, i.e., 92.2% which is distributed as mild 9 patients ""7.0%,"" moderate 43 patients ""33.6%,"" and severe 66 patients ""51.6%"" and air space consolidation in 83 patients, i.e., 64.8% which is distributed as mild 4 patients ""3.1%,"" moderate 25 patients ""19.5%,"" and severe 54 patients ""42.2%."" Bilateral ground glass opacity and air space consolidation significantly increase with increasing disease severity. Other common findings were bronchial wall thickening in 54 patients, i.e., 42.2% which is distributed as mild 12 patients ""9.4%,"" moderate 20 patients ""15.6%,"" and severe 22 patients ""17.2%"", and smooth interlobular septal thickening in 82 patients, i.e., 64.1% which is distributed as mild 3 patients ""2.3%,"" moderate 29 patients ""22.7%,"" and severe 50 patients ""39.1%"" ( Table 3) .Pleural thickening and effusion were reported in 21 patients (16.4%) and 20 patients (15.6%), respectively. Lymphadenopathy was reported in 39 patients (30.5%). Air space consolidation and pleural effusion were significantly higher among patients with severe COVID-19 than other degrees (P < 0.0001 and 0.013, respectively) ( Table 6 ) (Fig. 6 ).The SARS-CoV-2 infection is well known as a global health hazard. The disease is extremely infectious. It is assumed that infection is transmitted by means of large-particle respiratory droplets produced by coughing or touching contaminated surface [25] . To stop spread of the pandemic, it is critical to detect and make a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia early and to immediately isolate and treat the patient [26] . There are many publications of several studies of COVID-19, which included explanations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory features of this disease. The current study analysis involved 128 patients with established cases of COVID-19. All clinical features, imaging, and laboratory findings were collected and statistically analyzed as soon as a patient's diagnosis is confirmed. Particularly, the CT manifestations of COVID-19 disease can provide significant reference values for diagnosis of disease severity which is essential for treatment of patients and can minimize fatality and disease progression in this pandemic situation.Consistent with outcomes of previous studies [10, 11, 27, 28] as well as ours (61.7% male, and 38.3% female), COVID-19 was more frequently found in men than in women. Furthermore, we found that male\female ratio in mild cases was 9\10 (nearly equal), while in severe cases, it was 45\21 (nearly doubled). In his study, Dai et al., 2020, stated similar results with a greater total number of men (58.1%, 136/234) than that of women (41.9%, 98/234) [29] . A potential description for this finding may be protection provided by the X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity [11, 30] . Furthermore, physiologically, female have lower blood indices (e.g., Hb, HCT, and RBCs) than male with lower iron levels. Low iron seems to afford a protective mechanism from infection by restricting iron utilization by the virus [31] and improve the inflammatory condition [32] . Blood indices such as Hb, HCT, RBCs, and transferrin level showed significant changes with increasing disease severity which affects male more than female, suggesting occurrence of dysregulated iron homeostasis alongside the course of COVID-19 disease. It was shown that SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences may form a complex with porphyrin, affecting the 1-β chain of heme of the hemoglobin with subsequent dissociation of the iron [33] .In the current study, Mean ± SD of Hb content in mild stages of the disease were significantly higher (P1 < 0.001) compared to sever stage (13.37 ± 2.19 vs 11.96 ± 2.45 mg/dl respectively), and the median was 12 in both stages. For HCT% Mean ± SD in mild stages of the disease were significantly higher (P1 < 0.001) compared to sever stage (40.69 ± 5.22 vs 35.87 ± 8.71% respectively), and the median were (43 vs 36.5 respectively). There are several reported cases where autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurred during the worsening of symptoms of Covid-19 infection [34] [35] [36] . Reduced Hb level with the associated reduction of oxygen carrying capacity of the blood together with CT diagnosed lung parenchymal pathology explains the significant dyspnea associated with increased disease severity. The COVID-19 disease severity significantly increased with old age and was milder in younger age which was in concordance with several other studies [37] [38] [39] . This can be explained by poor health outcomes and the physiologic changes of aging which begin early in life with the drop in production of new T cells due to thymus gland involution, followed by deterioration of the immune system and increased susceptibility to infection [40] . Seventy to eighty percent of the circulating lymphocytes are composed of T lymphocytes [41] .In his study, Han et al. 2020 stated that the wide-ranging initial clinical symptoms which are fever, dry cough, and fatigue were common. Ninety-four of 108 (87%) patients had fever (range, 37.3-38.5°C), which was followed in frequency by dry cough (60%) and fatigue (39%) [26] . Furthermore Dai et al., 2020, reach to similar results in his study with fever and cough as the chief symptoms. However, some patients presented primarily with atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [29] . Similar to the previous results, the patients enrolled in the current study presented with fever (88.3%, range, 37.5-40°C), cough (76.6%), and muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue (70.3%) as the most common presenting symptoms, while diarrhea represent 10.9% (Fig. 7) .In the current study, laboratory results displayed the characteristics of viral infection in most of our patients, such as normal (71.9%) or decreased (25%) WBCs count (patients with normal and decreased WBCs count represent 96.9%) and decreased lymphocyte count (64.1%) and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein CRP level (91.2%) due to inflammation. Our results are in line parallel with previous studies; in his study, Han et al.'s laboratory results showed normal or reduced WBC count (100%), reduced lymphocyte count (60%), and elevated CRP (99%) [26] .Seventy to eighty percent of the circulating lymphocytes are composed of T lymphocytes [41] , which explain the significant lymphopenia frequently noted in COVID-19 [42] [43] [44] and was associated with poor outcome and increases degree of severity in patients with COVID-19. In addition, in sever COVID-19 infection peripheral T lymphocytes are further reduced due to lymphocyte sequestration in specific target organs [8] , lymphocyte affection through ACE2 receptor, which may be a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 infection [45] , and lymphocyte affection by pro-inflammatory cytokines production especially IL-6 [3] .In the present study, lymphopenia was significantly reported in 64.1% of all patients, and it was distributed as 0% for mild COVID-19, 69.8% for moderate COVID-19, and 78.8% for severe COVID-19 patients. For lab investigations, lymphocytes and Hb were significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (P < 0.001).High-resolution CT can depict millimeter-size lesions and play an important role in early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [17, 46, 47] . In a study of 41 patients, Huang et al., 2020, stated that 40 patients (98%) had bilateral while 1 (2%) had unilateral involvement. They stated that the characteristic chest CT signs for patients with severe symptoms admitted to the ICU were bilateral, multiple, lobular, and subsegmental areas of consolidation, whereas findings for patients with mild symptoms not admitted to the ICU were bilateral GGO and subsegmental areas of consolidation [10] . In a study of 99 patients, Chen et al., 2020, stated that 74 patients (75%) had bilateral pneumonia, with just 25 (25%) having unilateral pneumonia [11] . In a study of 51 patients, Song et al., 2020, reported that pure GGOs were detected in 77% of patients and that they showed principally bilateral, posterior, and peripheral distribution [18] . Such data are related to our results with 83.6% of our patients having bilateral distribution and 8.6% having unilateral distribution with slight difference between our results and the previous literature that could be explained by the difference in patient population number included in each cohort study. The typical CT manifestations of COVID-19 were in concordance with Wang et al., 2020, and Kanne et al., 2020, which are bilateral, basal, and peripheral ground glass opacities (GGOs), i.e., 92.2% and consolidation in nearly 58.6% of patients [44, 48] . Although consolidation associated with round opacities and septal thickening are more common in COVID-19 according to Parekh et al. 2020 [13] , our finding revealed GGO with higher non-round opacities (74.2%), which can be useful in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other patterns of lung pathology (Fig. 8) .Chen et al., 2020, reported 14 patients (14%) had many areas of mottling and GGO, while Lei et al., 2020, reported a patient with numerous peripheral GGO in both lungs [11, 20] . In a study by Chan et al., 2020, six of seven patients had multifocal patchy GGO on CT, principally around the peripheral parts of the lungs [49] . Overall, according to Bai et al. 2020 , compared to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, parenchymal opacities in COVID-19 pneumonia were more likely to be peripheral (80% vs. 57%), and have GGO (91% vs. 68%). COVID-19 patients were less probably to have central and peripheral distribution (14% vs. 35%) [13, 24] . In the present study, 63.3% of our patients have diffuse GGO opacities while 27.3% have peripheral and 1.6% have central distribution. Cheng et al., 2020, in his study, found mixed GGO and consolidation in patients with positive RT-PCR test results, the most frequently detected opacification in patients with COVID-19 was GGO (100.0% [11/11] ), which appeared mainly in the peripheral zone and most often involved lower lung lobes and segments. This strongly suggests that GGO is the most common imaging manifestation among patients with COVID-19, which is useful in diagnosing and isolating cases while they are in the early stage of the disease. It is worth mentioning that the appearance of the GGO was round or oval rather than patchy [10] . Equivalent to previous studies, GGO patterns were found in 92.2% of our patients.Comparable with the outcome of a former study by Chan et al., 2020, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were not detected. In our study, pleural effusion (15.6%) and lymphadenopathy (30.5%) were found which could be explained by the limited number (five patients) of population in Chan et al.'s study [49] (Fig. 9 ).In the current study, CT findings of GGO found that lesions were found in 92.2% of our patients, 90.6% have peripheral distribution, and 88.3% were located in the lower lobes. The lesions involved one lobe in 15.6% and two or more lobes in 76.6% of the patients. In the current study, the lower lobe was the most affected part (14.1%) in single lobar affection. This was in agreement with Han et al.al. (2020) who stated that in primary CT findings, when the lesions involved two or more lobes, it were essentially distributed in the peripheral zones of the lung, while in single lobe involvement, it was usually in the right lower lobe [26] . This finding may be related to the anatomy of the right lower lobe bronchus, which is thick and short, making it easy for the virus to attack it. Regarding the diffuse radiological characteristics of the studied patients with more tendency to basal lung affection and the correlation between lung CT score and lab investigations (WBCs, lympho-cytes%, RBCs, Hb, HCT, platelets, transferrin, and CRP), these results suggest additional blood involvement in COVID-19 lung pathophysiology. Furthermore, Han et al., 2020, found that COVID-19 pneumonia is common in adults (mean age, 45 years) but infrequent in children and infants [26] . In his study, Cheng et al., 2020, the youngest patient in the present study is a 25-year-old male [28] . In the current study, the mean age ± SD is 49.07 ± 15.89, range 13-65 years. The youngest patient is a 13-yearold-male and the oldest is a 85-year-old male. Our patients' age categories were 3.1% (< 15 years), 33.6% (15 < 45 years), 43% (45 < 65 years), and 20.3% (≥ 65 years).COVID-19 demonstrations are more widespread GGO than consolidation, which is in harmony with clinical findings [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . There is a wide-ranging CT signs of viral pneumonia. Even though not all cases of viral pneumonia have the classic imaging patterns, most cases have similar manifestations on imaging and are related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary viral infection [56] .Han et al., 2020, found that fairly characteristic manifestations were halo sign (64%), crazy paving pattern (40%), and air bronchogram sign (48%) [26] . Why are GGO and the halo sign early CT manifestations? The pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear. It may that inflammatory cytokine storm causes pneumonia with early pathologic finding diffuse alveolar damage. Since the hyaline membrane is between the alveolar walls, exudation and edema in the alveoli are not obvious, perhaps initiating GGO on CT images [10] .Dai et al., 2020, stated in his study the characteristic signs on CT images. The atypical attenuations were highly commonly located in bilateral multiple lung lobes and disseminated in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs with frequent signs, for example, interlobular septal thickening, air bronchus sign, pleural thickening, solid nodules, and reticular/mosaic s ig n. A d di ti on a ll y, a fe w ca s es of m ed i as ti na l lympadenopathy, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion were detected [29] . According to Bai et al. 2020 , in contrast to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, parenchymal opacities in COVID-19 pneumonia state that COVID-19 patients were less likely to have air bronchograms (14% vs. 23%), pleural thickening (15% vs. 33%), pleural effusion (4 vs. 39%), and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs. 10.2%) [13, 24] .Reversed halo sign and pulmonary nodules associated with COVID-19 have not been formerly described with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Lung abnormalities in SARS are more frequently described to be unifocal [57] . Our study agree with those distinguishing CT manifestations; 83.6% of our patients have ground glass opacities GGOs which were the most frequently seen in each CT stages with different CT manifestations; reverse halo/atoll sign (92.2%), mosaic attenuation (63.3%), consolidation (58.6%), bronchial wall thickening (42.2%), and crazy paving (20.3%). GGO assumes rounded shape in (25.8%). In addition to the characteristic GGO, another CT manifestation was also recorded; centrilobular nodules/tree-in-bud sign 30.5%, solid nodule(s) 29 .7%, bronchial wall thickening 42.2%, interlobular septal thickening 64.1%, and mucoid impaction 20.3%. The frequency of pulmonary cavities 2.3%, pleural thickening 16.4%, pleural effusion 15.6%, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (30.5%), and pericardial effusion (1.6%) was relatively small. These CT performances of COVID-19 were in line parallel to the earlier studies [17, 26, 28, 29] . Our results suggested that each clinical, laboratory and imaging (especially CT) finding had their characteristic signs and performances, making it feasible for physicians and radiologists to quickly make the final diagnosis and staging of the COVID-19 pneumonia.There were limitations to this study that should be declared. First, the number of study cohort is small; a larger cohort study would be useful to further explore the details of imaging findings. Further research with use of a more sample size is necessary to explore the applicability of the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19, so further studies that include long-term follow-up CT examinations are needed to investigate the entire course of the disease and to evaluate disease progression/ regression after treatment efficacy. Second, lung tissue biopsies or even autopsy to investigate the relation between CT findings and histopathologic appearances were not available. Third, the patients performed the CT scans with different machine type, due to the multiple centers in the study. The heterogeneity of the CT data might influence the results of the study. As a final point, this was a retrospective study. A further longitudinal research was needed to provide dynamic CT assessment for pulmonary lesions and to obtain the data of long term pulmonary function changes.In conclusion, the commonest clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia were fever, cough, and muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, while the most frequent laboratory abnormalities encountered were low lymphocyte and WBCs and high CRP. Review of chest CT shows that bilateral pulmonary GGO and air space consolidation predominantly located in the peripheral zones mainly the right lower lobe were the typical radiological findings with more lobes involvement indicate aggravation of the disease. This study highlighted the importance of HRCT imaging features combined with clinical and laboratory assessment for accurate and quick diagnosis and staging of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","Egypt","first author","2021-01-08",1

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) reports, mainly in high-income settings, varied widely (0.4%-57.1%) with a pooled prevalence of 11% and 7% by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology testing, respectively (Gómez-Ochoa et al., 2020) .Studies examining seroconversion in HCW cohorts, particularly in resource-limited settings, are scarce. One UK study reported 20% seroconversion among HCWs within one month of follow-up (Houlihan et al., 2020) . Silent (subclinical or asymptomatic) seroconversion was reported in a limited number of non-HCW (6/9, 67.0%) (Hung et al., 2020) and HCW cohorts (11/25, 44.0%) (Hains et al., 2020) . Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriage reached up to 68.2% (Mostafa et al., 2020) and 86% (Mandić-Rajčević et al., 2020) among HCWs, contributing to the ongoing community and nosocomial transmission, and challenging the overwhelmed healthcare systems.Serological testing can help in diagnosis of suspected cases with negative RT-PCR test results and in early identification of asymptomatic infections (Long et al., 2020) . Antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 appear within two weeks and peak three to four weeks after infection, (Seow et al., 2020) thus can help detect cases otherwise undetectable during the acute phase. Universal regular screening of HCWs enables prompt detection, isolation, and management of cases, including asymptomatic infections, hence, protecting HCWs and patients.In Egypt, 110767 total COVID-19 cases have been detected through the national symptom-based testing using PCR and 6453 deaths have occurred as of 15 November 2020 (Ministry of Health and Population, 2020). By mid-October 2020, it was estimated that 3,576 COVID-19 cases (1.6%) and 188 deaths (5.3%) have occurred among 220,000 Egyptian physicians (Alarabiya News, 2020) .To understand the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection among a cohort of HCWs in a resource-limited setting, we conducted a prospective investigation including baseline and follow-up screening and risk assessment of HCWs (SARAH: NCT04348214). The baseline screening phase of 4040 HCWs in Ain Shams University (ASU) medical campus, including 12 university healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt has been described previously (Mostafa et al., 2020) . The infection proportion among HCWs at baseline (positive IgM, or IgG, or PCR) was 4.2% (170/4040, 95%CI 3.6-4.9). The baseline seroprevalence (positive IgM and/or IgG) was 1.3% (n=53/4040, 95%CI 1.0-1.7). In this paper, we describe the follow-up screening phase. We present the incidence of seroconversion after 21 days of follow-up using rapid serological tests and the associated risk factors among HCWs who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by IgM, IgG, and PCR at baseline. We also report the follow-up test results of the 170 HCWs who were infected at baseline.We conducted a prospective cohort study in 12 ASU healthcare facilities, where follow-up procedures took place between 14 May and 10 June 2020, after 21 days from the baseline screening (World Health Organization, 2020a) . The baseline study design, setting, participants, tools, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f procedures, and findings have been previously described (Mostafa et al., 2020) . Baseline screening was conducted between April 22 and May 14 2020 and included an online survey plus laboratory testing to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Follow-up screening also included an online survey to assess the occurrence of symptoms and exposure to a confirmed case during the follow-up period plus laboratory testing to assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.All HCWs who participated at baseline were informed about the follow-up screening procedures and schedule, for which they had provided written informed consent during the baseline recruitment process. They were all invited to participate at the follow-up phase with no exclusion criteria, i.e. follow-up screening targeted all hospital staff regardless of their baseline test results, the type of care they provided (clinical or non-clinical), presence of symptoms (asymptomatic HCWs were included), or place of work within the healthcare facility (no units/wards were prioritized for follow-up screening). This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee, Faculty of Medicine, ASU (FMASUP18b/2020).Participation was voluntary and all HCWs on-the-job were informed and scheduled for follow-up screening through formal announcements by their healthcare facility administration. Also, all participants received phone call reminders to attend their scheduled follow-up appointments and were re-scheduled within a period of three days to provide flexibility according to their workload if needed. At each of the 12 healthcare facilities, HCWs visited the two workstations dedicated for follow-up screening procedures. Teams consisting of the hospital management, infection control focal points, nurses, technicians, and administrative staff coordinated the screening activities.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Workstation 1. Online survey: HCWs completed the follow-up survey through available PCs with internet connection or their cellphones to reduce the screening time and unnecessary contact with shared surfaces. Staff were available to interview HCWs who needed assistance in filling the survey. Data were entered using the assigned study ID to facilitate anonymous linkage with laboratory results.Workstation 2. Laboratory sampling: At follow-up, a 5-ml venous blood sample was collected by venipuncture into a plain vacutainer for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. For those who tested positive for serology, an appointment was scheduled for RT-PCR, where combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected in a single tube containing viral transport medium for detecting viral RNA by RT-PCR (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a). Swabs were transported to the laboratory in ice boxes at 4C.Questions were adapted from relevant World Health Organization protocols and interim guidance (World Health Organization, 2020b; World Health Organization, 2020c) . Details of the questionnaire development and data on background characteristics were previously described (Mostafa et al., 2020) . The follow-up survey consisted of two sections including questions on exposures and symptoms that occurred in the period since baseline screening:J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Section 1: HCWs were provided an exhaustive list of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and were asked to report the occurrence, type, and severity of symptoms since baseline screening: fever <38C, fever ≥38C, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, sore throat, dry cough, cough with sputum, runny nose/nasal congestion, sneezing, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, other respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort/pain, diarrhea, headache, confusion, loss of appetite, change/loss of taste or smell, skin rash, conjunctivitis.Section 2: HCWs reported community and nosocomial exposure through close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and when and where the contact had occurred. In the nosocomial exposure section, we asked about direct care provision for a confirmed case, face-to-face contact within 2 meters and the duration of contact.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies was done using the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay Artron® One Step COVID-19 IgM/IgG Antibody Test, the same method used at baseline (Artron Laboratories Inc., Canada). The assay has estimated sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 100% , respectively by Lassaunière et al. (Lassaunière et al., 2020) and 94.4% and 98.2% respectively by Zhang and Zheng, 2020 (Zhang and Zheng, 2020) . RT-PCR testing was done only for seropositive cases at follow-up, using the same baseline technique previously described (Mostafa et al., 2020 ; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a).Case definition: Seroconversion was defined as having a positive test result at the follow-up phase for IgM and/or IgG among HCWs who tested negative for all three tests (IgM, IgG and PCR) at baseline (n=3870) (Figure 1 ).For describing the study sample, we calculated median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables or counts and proportions for categorical variables. To calculate the incidence proportion and the hazard of seroconversion, the number of IgM and/or IgG positive HCWs was divided by the number of participants and person-days of follow-up, respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression modelling was used to determine the independent determinants of seroconversion and to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Effect estimates with confidence intervals and exact P-values are provided. All analyses were done using SPSS version 25.Between 14 May and 10 June 2020, 2282 (59.0%) HCWs returned for testing at follow-up out of the 3870 HCWs who tested negative at baseline for IgM, IgG, and PCR ( Figure 1 ). The median follow-up period was 25 days (IQR 21-27). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (positive IgM and/or IgG) was 100/2282 (4.4%, 95%CI 3.6-5.3) and the daily hazard was 0.21% (95%CI 0.17-0.25) over 48746 person-days of follow-up. Of the 100 seroconverted HCWs, 59(59.0%) tested positive only for IgM, 6 (6.0%) tested positive only for IgG, and 11 (11.0%) tested positive for both IgM and IgG. Twenty-one (21.0%) tested positive for both PCR and IgM, one J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (1.0%) tested positive for both PCR and IgG, and two (2.0%) had all three tests positive ( Figure   1 ).The overall follow-up group's description is presented in Table 1 Only 36/100 (36.0%) seroconverters reported being symptomatic during the follow-up period;3/36 (8.3%) reported severe symptoms (Table 2) . Experiencing symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection were more frequently reported during follow-up than at baseline (Figure 2) , such as sneezing, muscle pain, change/loss of smell, shortness of breath, change/loss of taste, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, and conjunctivitis. Symptoms that were not reported at baseline, but only at the follow-up stage among seroconverters were chest pain, other respiratory symptoms, vomiting, wheezing, and dizziness ( Figure 2 ). The incidence of seroconversion was 4.0%(64/1596, 95%CI 3.1-5.1) among asymptomatic and 5.3% among symptomatic HCWs (36/686, 95%CI 3.7-7.2).Overall, HCWs reported contact with a confirmed case more frequently at follow-up (1131/2282, 49.6%) than at baseline (1098/4040, 27.2%) Also, a higher proportion of exposures at home/residential area (5/39, 12.8% vs 2/68, 2.9%) and providing direct care to a confirmed case J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (29/100, 29.0% versus 22/170, 12.9%) were observed among seroconverters at follow-up than among infected HCWs at baseline (Supplementary Table 2 ).In the bivariate analysis, a higher risk of seroconversion was associated with the following factors:older age, female gender, marriage, lower level of education, working as a nurse or non-clinical care, presence of a pre-existing medical condition, exposure to a confirmed case at home/residential area, and a duration of contact >15 minutes with a confirmed case during health care provision (Tables 1, 2). The pre-existing medical conditions that were associated with a higher risk of seroconversion were diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and pregnancy Table 3 ). Seroconversion risk was not associated with the history of contact with a confirmed case, provision of direct care to a confirmed case, the interaction with a confirmed case within 2 meters, being symptomatic, or the severity of symptoms (Tables 1, 2) . When analyzed separately, the following symptomst were associated with a higher risk of seroconversion: fever <38°C, muscle pain, joint pain, sneezing, shortness of breath, other respiratory symptoms, loss of appetite, change/loss of taste, change/loss of smell, and conjunctivitis (Supplementary Table 4 ).In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, the risk of seroconversion among HCWs of older age was a double to triple the risk among those aged 18-29 years. HCWs with lower educational levels were also at about double or triple the risk of seroconversion compared with HCWs with university or higher education. HCWs who reported contact with a confirmed case within the workplace were at a lower risk of seroconversion compared with those who reported contact at home/residential area (adjusted HR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28-0.82). During health care J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f provision, it is the longer time of exposure rather than the close contact within 2 meters that increased the risk of seroconversion. Exposure to a confirmed case for >15 minutes doubled the risk of seroconversion as compared to exposure for <5 minutes (adjusted HR 2.20, 95%CI 1.18-4.10). Having chronic kidney disease and being pregnant were independently associated with seroconversion (adjusted HR were 4.42, 95%CI 1.03-18.96 and 3.52, 95% CI 1.05-11.85, respectively). Out of an exhaustive list of symptoms, change/loss of smell was the only symptom that predicted seroconversion (adjusted HR 3.17, 95%CI 1.48-6.78) ( Table 3) .Apart from this follow-up group of HCWs (n=2282) who tested negative for all three tests (IgM, IgG, and PCR) at baseline, 73/170 (42.9%) participants who tested positive for one or more of these three tests at baseline returned for follow-up. Details of their baseline and follow-up test results are described in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1 . Notably, 30/45 (66.7%) who were PCR-positive only at baseline did not develop antibodies (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 1) .The median follow-up period for this group was 26 days (IQR 25-29).The incidence of seroconversion for SARS-Co-V2 in this HCW cohort was 4.4% (5.3% in symptomatic and 4.0% in asymptomatic HCWs) using rapid serological IgM and IgG tests among those who tested negative (IgM, IgG, and PCR) for SARS-Co-V2 at baseline and returned after 3 weeks for follow-up screening. Seropositivity at follow-up (100/2282, 4.4%) was three-fold the seroprevalence observed at baseline (53/4040, 1.3%). During the follow-up phase, cumulative infections in Egypt have also increased by a similar rate, approximately tripling from 10,829 to May to 10 June 2020 and ended just 10 days before the peak of the first wave. The highest number of daily cases (1774) detected through the national symptom-based PCR testing was recorded on 20 June. After that point, the daily number of cases in Egypt started to decline reaching the rate detected at the launch of baseline screening about 6 weeks later (Figure 4) . The same mitigation measures adopted at ASU Hospitals and nationally continued during the follow-up phase. This suggests that infections among HCWs might continue to reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.Approximately two-thirds of the seroconversions in the current study were silent. Asymptomatic infections were also high (68.2%) in this HCW cohort at baseline (Mostafa et al., 2020) . Similarly, 6/9 (67%) of the quarantined diamond cruise ship infected passengers remained asymptomatic for 14-days, although they seroconverted and had a high viral load (Hung et al., 2020) . Subclinical seroconversion has been reported after 3 weeks among 11/25 (44.0%) asymptomatic HCWs in a pediatric dialysis unit in Indiana, USA; one HCW seroconverted on day 21 despite three negative PCR test results (Hains et al., 2020) . In Norway, serology testing of household members six weeks after the index case had a positive PCR test revealed that detecting seroconversion might more accurately identify attack rates in households than intermittent PCR testing (Cox et al., 2020) .These findings reinforce the need for expanding regular universal testing using a combination of PCR and serology in finding cases and tracing contacts, particularly in settings with high rates of asymptomatic infections, to enable prompt isolation and management.Consistent with our baseline screening findings, (Mostafa et al., 2020) most seroconverted HCWs were nurses (54/100, 54.0%). However, being a nurse was not an independent determinant of seroconversion. Also, more infected HCWs providing non-clinical care tested positive at followup (33.0%) than at baseline (16.5%); HCWs' exposure to COVID-19 patients through community transmission during the follow-up phase when cases were soaring in Egypt may be a plausible explanation for the increased proportion of positive tests among these HCW groups. A metaanalysis of COVID-19 in HCWs reported that those working in hospital nonemergency wards and nurses were the most commonly infected personnel (Gómez-Ochoa et al., 2020). Among this Egyptian HCW cohort, reporting exposure to a confirmed case doubled from a quarter at baseline to half of the overall participants at follow-up. However, the proportion reporting contact with a confirmed case among the infected HCWs remained the same (about two-fifths).Nosocomial exposure does not seem to be associated with seroconversion in this Egyptian HCW cohort because two-thirds of those who seroconverted did not report any obvious epidemiological link with a confirmed case. Also, the incidence of seroconversion among HCWs reporting household exposure was five-fold that reported from exposure at the workplace. However, among a cohort of patient-facing HCWs in London, UK, a much higher seroprevalence (25%) at enrolment and seroconversion rate (20%) within one month of follow-up were reported with a peak of HCW cases between 30 March and 5 Aprila rate at least twice that of the general population, (Houlihan et al., 2020) indicating the possibility of nosocomial rather than community transmission at that stage of the epidemic in London. Nguyen et al also reported that highest infection rates among their UK HCW cohort study were around London and the Midlands . The difference in the magnitude of infections among the UK and the Egyptian HCW cohorts may depend on how much overlap occurred between study timeframes and the epidemic curves in the two countries.A weak or even lack of seroconversion after initial PCR positivity was reported among some COVID-19 patients during variable periods of follow-up, leaving these individuals susceptible to infection or relapse (Papachristodoulou et al. 2020) . For example, 22% of 27 patients did not develop a serologic response after 60 days of follow-up in Germany; (Fill Malfertheiner et al., 2020) 20% of 173 Chinese patients did not develop IgG after two weeks of onset; (Zhao et al., 2020) 6% did not show any antibody response two weeks after hospital discharge and 30% of 175 patients showed very low neutralizing antibody titres in Shanghai, China; and one of 14 (7%) HCWs had not seroconverted after 17 days of follow-up in the UK. (Houlihan et al., 2020) Among this Egyptian HCW cohort, 66.7% of 45 seronegative HCWs who tested PCRpositive only at baseline did not seroconvert after three weeks of follow-up. Furthermore, there was weak IgG seroconversion among the seropositive group at baseline after 3 weeks of followup: only 2/20 (10.0%) developed IgG, 11/20 (55.0%) cleared IgM without developing IgG, and 6/8 (75.0%) cleared IgG antibodies. However, the sensitivity of the rapid serological test used in this study was low (83.3%), thus high false negatives rate may have been encountered. The identification of false-negative results among HCWs and the current variation in performance of point-of-care serological assays requires caution in interpreting IgG results. (Pallett et al., 2020) Per 1000 tested, Deeks et al. assumed that if the sensitivity of IgG/IgM was 91.4% at 15 to 21 days, at a prevalence of 5%, 4 cases (3 to 7) would be missed. (Deeks et al., 2020) Despite this concern, our findings have important implications for the level of long-term immunity and vaccine development in settings with predominantly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.HCWs ≥50 years old had approximately a three-fold risk of seroconversion compared with HCWs of younger age groups. Also, older HCWs were reported to have higher IgG titres in an Italian HCW cohort (Calcagno et al., 2020) and a higher seroprevalence in Idaho, the USA (Bryan et al., 2020) . Having chronic kidney disease was associated with a four-fold risk of seroconversion among HCWs in the current study. Being older than 40 years and having chronic kidney disease were independent determinants of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test among 587 primary care patients in the UK (de Lusignan et al., 2020) . Pregnant HCWs were at a four-fold risk of seroconversion in the current study compared to nonpregnant HCWs. Pregnant women in the USA were reported to be at risk for severe COVID-19 illness and its complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b). 28 Change/loss of smell independently predicted seroconversion among HCWs in this study at follow-up and seropositivity at baseline. Similarly, recent loss of smell was associated with a three-fold increase in the risk of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 in a community-based cohort in the UK (Makaronidis et al., 2020) . Also, a meta-analysis reported that olfactory dysfunctions were found in 41% of 8438 COVID-19 patients from 13 countries (Agyeman et al., 2020) . Being a highly specific symptom of COVID-19, it could guide early testing and case isolation.Approximately two-fifths of the HCWs in this longitudinal study were lost to follow-up and some did not return for their PCR appointments. HCWs were redistributed among newly established isolation wards/hospitals during the follow-up phase that preceded the peak of the epidemic in Egypt, therefore, many were not able to return for follow-up. Also, some HCWs were quarantined or self-isolating. Second, in contrast to the baseline phase, PCR testing was not conducted universally for HCWs at follow-up; instead, it was restricted to those with positive serology. This decision was taken as a precautionary measure to preserve the PCR stock and meet the expected increase in testing needs, given the foreseen rise in hospital admissions at that stage of the epidemic in Egypt. As a result, some infected HCWs who were in the early stage of infection may have been missed using serological tests alone. PCR is costly and requires certain skill in sample collection.These challenges may affect the quality and sustainability for universal regular testing of HCWs.To avoid critical delay in diagnosis, management, and quarantine, using serological tests (in isolation or combined with PCR when possible)especially rapid point-of-care tests that are continuously being developed with higher accuracy to meet the parallel development in vaccines (Pallett et al., 2020; Pickering et al., 2020; Amanat et al., 2020 )-may be a more reasonable assay choice for high-throughput use, less workload, and a faster turnaround time in resource-limited settings. Third, despite the published study reports addressing the performance of the used serological assay testing kits (Zhang and Zheng, May 21, 2020; Artron Laboratories, Inc. Oct. 28, 2020) , the commercial manufacturer voluntarily withdraw the test from the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notification list of commercial manufacturers distributing serology test kits under the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests and hence, included in the FDA removal list on 25 May 2020. This action may be due to not providing the necessary documentation in a timely manner, as could be concluded from the dates of reports publishing. The two reports documented sensitivity of 94.4% and 93.3%; and specificity of 98.2% and 100% (Zhang and Zheng, May 21, 2020; Artron Laboratories, Inc. Oct. 28, 2020) . Based on the evidence we have; the used testing kits has an acceptable level of validity that most probably did not jeopardize the validity of our study results. ","Egypt","abstract","2021-01-20",1

The UK reports that the new variant has increased transmissible rate of about 70 % besides increase in reproductive number by 0.4. 22 The UK variant was also found to have impact on diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 as the deletion mutations in 69-70 can cause negative result from S-gene in RT-PCR assay. [23] [24] [25] [26] Mutations in the RBD of spike protein or other surface structures can alter the antigenic property of new SARS-CoV-2 variant that could lead to reduction in neutralization activity of antibodies and thereby resulting in higher risk of reinfection or decreased effectiveness of vaccines. 27 Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the mu- The binding free energies based on MM-GBSA approach 28, 29 have been presented for configurations corresponding to minimization run and low temperature simulation (30 K and 1 atm pressure). The results corresponding to low temperature have been used since the entropic contributions are less significant in this condition. Further we will be able to compare the results from force-field methods to interaction energies computed using approaches based on quantum mechanics (QM). The binding free energies for the RBD domain of the spike protein with the ACE-2 receptor 30 are given in Table 1 . In particular, two cases namely wild type and mutant variants of the spike proteins were considered as receptors. As we see, the binding free energy for mutant (using the configuration from the minimization ) are lower by about 20 kcal/mol when compared to wild type spike protein (will be referred as set-1).The trend remains the same even in the case of calculations using trajectories corresponding to low temperature simulation. Now the difference between the binding free energies for mutant when compared to wild type with ACE-2 receptor is about -21.0 kcal/mol (will be referred as set-2). Interestingly, the binding free energies obtained in this set of calculations are quantitatively lower when compared to results from minimization run. It has to be attributed that the low temperature simulation allows the system to sample configurational phase space which corresponds to minimum free energies. The binding free energies have the contributions from van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between spike protein-ACE-2 receptor and the polar and non-polar solvation free energy contributions. 28, 29 The latter two terms account for the change in free energies associated with protein-protein complex formation in aqueous solvent like environment. The effect of solvent is to screen the charges on the amino acids and so the polar solvation free energy contributions generally are positive. 31 The electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions are contributing to the stabilization of the complex formation. The overall, electrostatic interactions are against the complex formation as the sum of electrostatic interaction and polar solvation free energies are positive.The values are respectively 102 and 77 kcal/mol for wild type and mutant variant of the spike protein with ACE-2 receptor (we refer to the results corresponding to set-2) and the complexes will be referred as wt-spike:ACE-2 and mt-spike:ACE-2 respectively. Therefore, the protein-protein complexation is driven by hydrophobic interactions between the residues in the spike protein with residues in the ACE-2 receptor. The van der Waals interactions are as much as -146 and -142 kcal/mol for the wild type and mutant variant of the spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. Interestingly, the N501Y mutation has lowered the van der Waals interaction (by about 4 kcal/mol while benefited due to increased electrostatic interaction by about 25 kcal/mol). The non-polar solvation contribution to the binding free energies are almost comparable in both cases even though its overall effect is to stabilize the complex formation.We have analysed the residue-wise contributions to the binding free energies and this analysis has been carried out for both the spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor. Since our focus is to investigate the effect of mutations on the binding free energies in the complex formation, we have only presented the results for the spike protein. As we discussed earlier, we have only considered two mutations occurring in the RBD domain namely N501Y and A570D. The latter mutation occurs in the N-terminal domain which is located far away from the interfacial region involved in the protein-protein interaction (Refer to Figure 1a ).So, it is expected that the latter mutation has no or less significant effect on the proteinprotein interaction and the former one is supposed to have major contribution to difference in binding free energies between the wild-type and mutant variants of the spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. Figure 2a shows the residue wise contributions to the binding free energies from the residues of the spike protein and both wild type and mutant variants were considered. The numbering of the residues has been done as if they are in the whole spike protein even though we have studied only the RBD domain of this protein (322-580). In order to see the residues that are dominantly contributing to difference in binding free energies, we have computed ∆∆E Res(spike) (wt → mt). One would expect major contribution from 501 residue as this corresponds to mutation site located in the interfacial region. However, the contributions from many other residues are not less significant which has to be attributed to the fact that the mutation occurring in 501 position also alters the distance between the other residues of the spike protein and ACE-2 receptor residues and so the interactions are altered significantly. How ever the major changes are observed for two residues 417 and 501. As expected the ∆∆E Res(spike) (wt → mt) has stabilizing contribution (i.e. negative in magnitude and amounts to -7.7 kcal/mol) to the complex formation. It is also worth noticing that in the wild type variant, the 501 residue has destabilizing contribution to the complex formation (refer to the positive value for ∆E Res(spike) for this residue in the case of wild type in Figure 2a ). The contribution due to residue 417 is rather positive which suggests that this residue contributes to destabilization of complex formation in the case of N501Y mutant. In addition to stabilizing contributions from residue 501, there are other residues such as 486, 489, 493, 496, 500, 502 are stabilizing the mutant N501Y with a contribution < -1 kcal/mol. Further to address the stability of the two protein-protein complexes (i.e wt-spike:ACE-2 and mt-spike:ACE-2), root mean square displacement (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMFS) and hydrogen bond analysis were carried out using the trajectories corresponding to 50 ns production run. The results for RMSD are given in Figure 3a and 3c while the RMSF results are given in 3b and 3d. The first configuration in the production run has been used as the reference for computing RMSD and the values are presented for the spike protein and the ACE-2 protein separately. The RMSD values are shown to fluctuate over a larger range for the spike protein when compared to ACE-2 receptor which indicates the former biomolecule undergoes larger conformational flexibility than the latter. It is expected behaviour as the RBD domain of the spike protein only has been studied in this work and the conformational stability (or structural stability) is reduced as we do not include the whole spike protein in trimeric form. 32 Another interesting observation is that both the spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor in the case of mutant variant are associated with the larger RMSD values suggesting that conformational fluctuations are increased due to mutation N501Y. We have seen that this mutation is associated with lowering of the binding free energies but it is interesting to see it also contributes to larger conformational flexibility.The increased conformational flexibility has been attributed to the increased ability for the spike protein to escape from the neutralizing potential of antibodies. 33 Finally we have analysed the interaction energies of the key residues using electronic structure theory to further validate the results from force-field based approaches. We have identified the pair of residues from the spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor appearing within a cut-off distance of 8Å . The pair of residues separated by distances larger than this may not contribute to the stabilization of the protein-protein complex. So, they have not been considered for this analysis. In the case of configuration corresponding to minimization runs there were about 53 such pairs and the interaction energies between them and the total sum were obtained using two different approaches. In the first method, the energies of the three systems namely residues from spike protein, ACE-2 receptor and their complexes were obtained in aqueous solvent environment and the difference in energies of the complex and subsystems (i.e. spike protein and ACE-2 receptor centered residues) gives the interaction energies of the pairs of residues of protein-protein complex in aqueous environment. The interaction energies between the pairs of residues located on the spike protein and ACE-2 receptor were obtained from the expression as shown in equation 1. In particular, we employed M06-2X/6-31+G* level of theory 34 and for solvent description SMD solvent model 35 has been adopted.The interaction energies of the protein-protein complex were computed as sum over the interaction energies between the pairs of residues and the values are presented in Table 3 . Table 3 .In the second method, the interaction energies were obtained using counterpoise correction method by employing M06-2X/6-31+G* level of theory. The values obtained using this method are presented in Table 3 as ∆E BSSE(raw) and ∆E BSSE(cor) . In particular, the former one gives the ∆E as the mere energy difference between the complex and subsystems. However, the latter case the energies are corrected for basis sets superposition error 36,37 using counterpoise correction method. 38 Moreover, M06-2X level of theory has been often used to estimate the interaction energies in even weak intermolecular complexes where the major contributions are due to van der Waals type interaction. 39 Even density functional theory with dispersion correction is known to perform reasonably well to describe such interactions. 39 However, we have used M06-2X level of theory to describe the interactions between the pairs of residues in the interfacial region of protein-protein complex. All the electronic structure theory calculations were carried out using Gaussian09 software. Since this approach, considers vacuum like environment to estimate the interactions be-tween the residues, it tends to overestimate when the residues are oppositely charged or when a single residue is charged while the other residue is neutral. Using this approach, the sum over interaction energies computed for wt-spike:ACE-2 complex is -243.7 kcal/mol while for the mt-spike:ACE-2 complex is -304.3 kcal/mol (we are referring to BSSE corrected values). The ∆∆E spike:ACE−2 corresponding to N501Y mutation using the counterpoise correction method is about -60.6 kcal/mol which also explains why the B.1.1.7 mutation is more contagious when compared to wild type. As we mentioned this approach underestimates the interaction energies as the solvation effect is not accounted for. However, one can add to this the solvation free energies (i.e. ∆GSolv aqueous ) which are computed in the first step and the sum has been presented as ∆∆E1 aqueous in Table 3 We have also analysed whether the increased stability of the mutant may be a cause for the retainment and propagation of this specific variant. The free energy of the spike protein also will be able to can shed light into this aspect. So, we have also calculated the free energy of the both wt-spike and mt-spike proteins and listed in Table 4 . Both total intramolecular energy (total energy of the protein due to bonded and non-bonded interactions between its residues) and solvation energies (both polar and non-polar contributions) are also shown.As can be evidenced the results corresponding to minimization run, the stability of mutant variant is increased by about 4.7 kcal/mol (i.e. the free energy of the mutant is lowered by this much value). The results from low temperature run also shows the same trend and suggest that mutant variant is more stable when compared to wild type by about -10.4kcal/mol. The study also demonstrates one should be able to estimate the relative stability of spike proteins of different mutants to analyse whether it will be retained as the virus evolves. three dimensional structure for the wt-spike:ACE-2 complex is based on the homology models build using the template structure reported for the complex in the PDB ID 7A91. 42 The structure for the complex was build using SWISSMODEL server. 43 There are structures with better resolution reported for the ACE-2 receptor however, we chose this as template file as we wanted to propose the structure for the spike protein with residues in the range 322-580.The structure obtained from homology modeling has been used for preparing the input files for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations. The complex has been solvated with sufficient number of water molecules and neutralized with counter ions. The solvated complex structure for the wt-spike:ACE-2 complex has been energy minimized and followed by this low temperature simulations (at 30 K and 1 atm pressure) were carried out. Finally, MD simulations in ambient conditions (300 K and 1atm) were carried out. A similar protocol has been followed for mt-spike:ACE-2 complex except that before processing the PDB structure for the MD input file preparation, the two aforementioned mutations were introduced in the spike protein using Mutagenesis module of PyMOL software. All the finite temperature simulations were carried out isothermal-isobaric ensemble by using AMBER16 software. 44 The time step for solving Newton's equation of motion was set to 2fs. The time scale for the production runs for the wt-spike:ACE-2 and mt-spike:ACE-2 complexes was set to 50ns. This set of simulations were carried out to study the stability of the complexes during a long time scale. In addition, the trajectories were used for computing various properties like RMSD, RMSF and hydrogen bond analysis. In particular, we were only analysed the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the spike protein and ACE-2 receptor. The low temperature simulation and the structure corresponding to minimization run were used for computing the binding free energies using molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area approach (MM-GBSA). Even for the trajectory corresponding to finite temperature simulation at 300 K and 1 atm pressure the binding free energies were computed and the trends in them reflected the results corresponding to above two sets (even though quantitatively the values were in the higher side). The reason for using the configurations from the low temperature simulation is to avoid the need for computing the entropic contributions and in addition it allows us to directly compare to the energetics obtained from subsequent QM calculations. For the QM calculations, only those pairs of residues located in the interfacial region and are separated by a distance of 8Å were considered. Further, the residues were capped with hydrogens to meet with the valency requirements for carbon and nitrogen atoms after cutting along the peptide bonds. increased virulence and we attribute this to the more stable complex formation between the spike protein:ACE-2 receptor. We have also found the increased interaction between the certain pairs of residues (such as TYR449-ASP38, TYR453-HIE34 and TYR501-LYS353) andincreased number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds to be responsible for this. We hereby, demonstrate that the computational modeling can provide valuable insight on how the mutations can modulate the protein-protein interaction in the spike protein:ACE-2 complex.Finally, we have also shown the mutant variant of the spike protein is stable by -4. to -10 kcal/mol when compared to wild type suggesting that it may be retained in the virus evolution.This work was supported by the grants from the Swedish Infrastructure Committee (SNIC)for the projects ""In-silico Diagnostic Probes Design"" (snic2020-5-2).

As observed previously with monomeric RBD (35), the protein was more 261 heterogeneous and formed high molecular weight aggregates than mammalian cell expressed There are currently multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have been given emergency use approval 270 and others with encouraging Phase I data (55) are in advanced clinical trials. However there 271 remains a need for cheap, efficacious, COVID-19 vaccines that do not require a cold chain. We 272 previously designed a thermotolerant, monomeric, glycan engineered RBD (residues 332-532) 273 that elicited neutralizing antibodies. In the present study we sought to improve the 274 immunogenicity without negatively altering biophysical and antigenic characteristics of the 275 designed immunogen. We therefore designed a trimeric mRBD by fusion with the hCMP 276 trimerization domain at the N-terminus of mRBD. Relative to other trimerization domains 277 such as foldon and GCN4 derivatives (40, 56), this forms a trimer that is stabilized by 278 intermolecular disulfides and hence will not dissociate, even at high dilutions. A fusion of 279 hCMP with HIV-1 gp120 has been extensively tested in guinea pigs, rabbits and non-human 280 primates as an HIV-1 vaccine candidate and showed promising immunogenicity without any 281 apparent adverse effects (45, 51, 52) . This trimerization sequence has sequence identities with 282 the corresponding ortholog of 81 and 91% in mice and guinea pigs, consistent with the much 283 lower hCMP titers in guinea pigs. Thus, the hCMP titers in humans are expected to be 284 negligible, given 100% sequence identity with the host protein. Like our previously described 285 monomeric mRBD, hCMP-mRBD shows remarkable thermotolerance. Lyophilized hCMP-286 mRBD was stable to extended storage at 37 °C for over four weeks and to transient 90 minute Reference-free 2D classification using single-particle analysis 514 The evaluation of micrographs was done with EMAN 2.1 (58).

Literature survey revealed that quinoline derivatives had shown potency as antiviral agents against several viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Zika virus, H1N1 influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, vaccinia virus and respiratory syncytial virus [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . On the other hand, several authors report the antiviral potential of chloroquine as a therapeutic option against COVID-19, this quinoline derivative presented an EC 50 of 1.13 μM in vitro and it caused a negative conversion of the virus in more than 100 patients who participated in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China (in vivo) [14, 15] . In the in vitro study recently carried out by Liu et al. [16] have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prevent the virus from entering the cell and block the transport of the virus between cell organelles at the later cellular stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, chloroquine has been shown to have higher efficacy [16] . On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine ( Fig. 1 ) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [17] . A clinical trial using hydroxychloroquine has been conducted in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The first results show a significant reduction in viral carriage and the use of hydroxychloroquine added to Azithromycin was significantly more efficient for virus elimination [18] .In view of the therapeutic properties of quinoleine derivatives, the investigation of their molecular geometric structure, spectroscopic and electronic properties are fundamental to know the influence of different groups on structures in order to discover the relationship of these groups with their biological properties. In this context, DFT calculations have become a tool very reliable in predicting properties of molecules with great precision [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .Since the quinoline derivatives have shown high potential for the development of new antiviral drugs, herein, we have designed novel 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative i.e, 5-((1Himidazol-1-yl)methyl)quinolin-8-ol (DD1) (Fig. 1) . This new 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative was synthesized and characterized by using FT-IR, UV-visible, 1 H-and 13 C-NMR, ESI-MS and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Then, theoretical B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations were performed to explore its structural, electronic, topological and vibrational properties in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions [26, 27] .Thus, with the optimized structures in the different media additional calculations by using the same level of theory were carried out to calculate atomic charges, stabilization energies, bond orders, molecular electrostatic potentials, vibrational frequencies, 1 H and 13 C NMR chemical shifts and Hirshfeld surface analysis. Due to the importance of this derivative, calculations of frontier orbitals also were performed in order to predict the reactivities and behaviours of DD1 in the different studied media. Finally, the molecular docking mechanism between DD1 ligand and COVID-19/6WCF and COVID-19/6Y84 receptors were studied to explore the binding modes of these compounds at the active sites.All organic solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received or dried using standard procedures; all chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Merck or Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. Analytical thin layer-chromatographies (TLC) have been performed on pre-coated silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60 F 254 , Merck, Germany), and chromatograms were visualized by UV-light irradiation. NMR spectroscopies were recorded in dry deuterated DMSO on a Bruker AC spectrometer at 300 MHz for 1 H NMR and 75 MHz for 13 C NMR; δ is expressed in ppm related to TMS (0 ppm) as internal standard. Splitting patterns are designated as follow: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet). Coupling constants (J values) are listed in Hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were obtained using an API 3200 LC/MS/MS system equipped with an ESI source and the samples were diluted in methanol.An equimolar mixture of the 5-(chloromethyl) quinolin-8-ol hydrochloride (0.57 g, 2.5 mmol), paraformaldehyde (0.075 g, 2.5 mmol), and 1H-imidazole (0.17 g, 2.5 mmol) in EtOH (30 mL) was refluxed for 4-5 h. After cooling, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was purified through silica gel column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (ratio 5:5). Green single crystals were obtained by slow evaporation at room temperature. The X-ray intensity data for DD1 were collected at 296 K on a STOE IPDS 2 diffractometer equipped with an X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 1 mA, using Mo-Kα radiation of wavelength 1.54178 Å. The hemisphere of data was processed using SAINT [28] . The 3D structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares method on F 2 using the SHELXL program [29, 30] . All the non-hydrogen atoms were revealed in the first difference Fourier map and were refined with isotropic displacement parameters. At the end of the refinement, the final difference Fourier map showed no peaks of chemical significance and the final residual was 0.0641. The molecular and packing diagrams were generated using DIAMOND [31] .The theoretical initial structure of DD1 was taken from the CIF file determined in this work by X-ray diffraction. Then, the optimizations were performed in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using the functional hybrid B3LYP and the 6-311++G** basis set with the Revision A.02 of Gaussian 09 program [26, 27, 32] . In this type of molecule the used method performs the better correlations in geometries and frequencies, as was observed by us for other species [19] [20] [21] [22] . The integral equation formalism variant polarised continuum model (IEFPCM) method and the solvation model were used for the optimizations in solution by using the same level of theory [33] [34] [35] . Atomic charges and topological properties were computed with natural bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) calculations [36] [37] [38] while the GaussView program was employed to graphic the mapped molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) obtained from the Merz-Kollman (MK) charges [39, 40] . In the vibrational study, normal internal coordinates and transferable scaling factors were used to calculate the harmonic force fields in the different media with the scaled quantum mechanical force field (SQMFF) methodology and the Molvib program [41] [42] [43] . In the assignments only those potential energy distribution (PED) contributions  10% were considered while the correlations in the Raman spectra were improved transforming the predicted spectra in activities to intensities, as suggested in the literature [44, 45] . The 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra in aqueous and DMSO solutions were predicted with the Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method [46] with the hybrid B3LYP/6-311++G** method while the electronic spectra at the same level of theory were also predicted by using Time-dependent DFT calculations (TD-DFT) and the Gaussian 09 program [32] . The Moldraw program was used to calculate the volumes variations that experiment DD1 in aqueous and DMSO solutions [47] .The gap values and the chemical potential (μ), electronegativity (χ), global hardness (η), global softness (S), global electrophilicity index (ω) and nucleophilicity indexes () descriptors were calculated from the frontier orbitals with the same level of theory and by using known equations [19] [20] [21] [22] . In this new derivative is useful to predict the reactivities and behaviours in the different media taking into account the presence of donor (OH) and acceptors (O and N) groups in the structure of DD1 [48, 49] . The molecular docking mechanism between DD1 ligand and COVID-19/6WCF and COVID-19/6Y84 receptors were studied by using AutoDock Vina free software program [50] .The details of the X-ray crystal data and the structure solution as well as the refinement of the title compounds are given in Table 1 Table 2 ). The hybrid B3LYP/6-311++G** method has optimized the structures of 5-((1H-imidazol-1yl)methyl)quinolin-8-ol (DD1) in all media with C 1 symmetries where the structure in gas phase compared with the corresponding experimental determined by X-ray diffraction together with the definitions of rings can be seen in Figure 4 . R1 corresponds to pyridine ring, R2 to phenyl ring containing the OH group while the imidazol ring is defined as R3. In Table 3 are presented total energies uncorrected and corrected by zero point vibrational energy (ZPVE), dipole moments and volumes of DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) Method. The three calculations evidence a higher stability of structure in gas phase while in aqueous and DMSO solutions the energy values increase notably being slightly less stable in water than DMSO solvent. Perhaps, the higher dipole moment and volume values of DD1 in water justify its lower stability in this medium. In both solvents there is a contraction in the volume when dissolving is performed but, the value is higher in DMSO solution probably due to its higher stability and low dissolution (-1.6 Å 3 ). Thus, the solvent effect can be observed in graphics of orientations and directions of dipole moment vectors because the magnitude is higher in water ( Figure S1 ). Due to the difference observed in the properties of DD1 in both solvents it is necessary to calculate the solvation energies in the two solvents. Hence, the corrected and uncorrected solvation energies in both solvents calculated from the energies ZPVE can be seen in Table 4 . The results shown in Table 4 have evidenced most negative solvation energy of DD1 in water, as expected because this new derivative is most stable in DMSO. Hence, the G c value for the water was obtained from the difference between G un # and G ne, that is, -471. probably are protonated and charged because previous studies on some antiviral, antihistaminic and alkaloids species have evidenced that in aqueous solution the forms hydrated or cationic present a higher value as compared with the neutral free base or hydrochloride species [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] , as can be observed in Table S1 . If now the (G c ) values of DD1 in aqueous solution are compared with reported for antiviral species in aqueous solution from Table S2 [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] we observed that DD1 has the lowest (G c ) value than the antiviral agents, perhaps due to the three rings present in its structure because the number of acceptors and donors is less than the other ones. From previous studies, we observed that the differences in the solvation energies with another smaller basis set do not present greater differences with those calculated with a higher level of theory [22, 61, 65] . Table 5 show comparisons of calculated geometrical parameters of 5-((1H-imidazol-1yl)methyl)quinolin-8-ol (DD1) in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions with the corresponding experimental determined by X-ray diffraction by using root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values. These calculations were performed at the same level of theory. The results shown in Table 5 As was above mentioned, the high solvation energy values of DD1 in both media could be attributed to that the acceptors (N and O) and donor (OH) groups are protonated and charged and, for these reasons, the calculations related to involved charges on the atoms of those groups are important for this new species as drug candidate [48, 49] . Thus, three types of atomics charges, Merz-Kollman (MK), Mulliken and natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated on the O15, H16, N17, N21 and N28 atoms of DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method [36, 39] . These results are summarized in Table S3 while comparisons among them can be observed in In Table S4 are shown the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) and bond orders (BO), expressed as Wiberg indexes for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations. Regarding first the MEP values, there are not significant differences in the values on those five considered atoms of DD1 in the three media and, only the expected tendency in the values due to the electronegativities values are found, that is, O > N > H. But the higher MEP value is observed on N28, as compared with N17 and N21. When the mapped surface for DD1 in gas phase by using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method is graphed from the GaussView program in Figure S4 [40] the different colorations show clearly the nucleophilic and electrophilic regions that presents DD1. Thus, the region on N28 shows higher electronic density and strong red colour indicating nucleophilic sites while on the O15 and N17 weak orange colours are observed and, as a consequence, these places are weak nucleophilic sites. The strong blue colours is observed on the H16 linked to O15 of OH group. This region is a strong electrophilic site because the H16 is the most labile H atom than the other ones. The aromatic H atoms of pyridine, phenyl and imidazole rings shows ligth blue colours due to that these sites are weak electrophilic regions.When the bond orders (BO), expressed as Wiberg indexes for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions are analyzed from Table S4 and Figure S5 , it is observed a low BO value for the H16 atom because this atoms is the most labile while the N21 atom is most strongly linked in DD1 in water than in gas phase and DMSO solution. Then, the BO values for the N17 and N28 atoms are practically the same in the three media. These parameters together with the NPA charges show that the N21 atom of imidazole ring play an important role in the properties of DD1 in the three media.The NBO program allows examining all possible interactions between 'filled' (donor) Lewistype NBOs and 'empty' (acceptor) non-Lewis NBOs, and estimating their energetic importance by 2nd-order perturbation theory Analysis of Fock Matrix in NBO Basis [36] .These energies values for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions were calculated by using the functional hybrid B3LYP method and two 6-311++G** and 6-31G* basis sets which are presented in Table S5 . Here, when the calculations were performed with the higher basis set only was obtained for DD1 in water while for DD1 in gas phase and in Table S6 . Whereas in Figure S6 is shown the molecular graphic only for DD1 in gas phase showing the intra-molecular O15-H16···N17 interaction. The same interaction is also observed in gas phase and in DMSO solution. The new RCP is named RCPN1 while RCP1, RCP2 and RCP3 correspond to the RCP of pyridine (R1), phenyl (R2) and imidazole (R3) rings.·Table S6 shows that the distance between the H16 and N17 atoms that forming those intra-molecular bonds is higher in water than the other ones, as expected because the permittivity of water is higher in this medium (78.355) than the corresponding to DMSO (46.826) and gas (vacuum). Higher parameters are observed in DMSO and lower in water confirming that the stability is higher in DMSO because DD1 has higher solvation energy in water.Previous studies performed for DD1 in the different media have evidenced interesting properties for this new quinoline derivative and, probably its high solvation energy value in aqueous solution could support its use as antiviral drug candidate. For these reasons, calculations of frontier orbital, gap values and chemical potential (μ), electronegativity (χ), global hardness (η), global softness (S), global electrophilicity index (ω) and global nucleophilicity index (E) descriptors are very important to predict reactivities and behaviours of DD1 in the three studied media [19] [20] [21] [22] 51, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Table S7 shows those parameters for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method compared with the hydrochloride form of antiviral adamantadine in water and with both S and R forms of chloroquine in water by using the same level of theory. The differences between HOMO and LUMO, named gap, shows lower values in DD1 in the three media and, hence, a higher reactivity is expected for DD1 and, in particular, in DMSO solution while the R form of chloroquine is the less reactive than the other ones. A higher global electrophilicity index (ω) and a lower global nucleophilicity index (E) predicted for DD1 in DMSO could justify its higher reactivity in this medium. Comparisons of these parameters with reported for antiviral agents in the same medium and with the same basis set suggest that DD1 could be a very good antiviral drug candidate.The experimental infrared spectra of the title compound DD1 in the solid state was recorded using reflectance (ATR) mode and its comparison with the corresponding predicted in the gas phase and aqueous and DMSO solutions by using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method are given in Figure 5 . The predicted Raman spectra of DD1 in the three media can be seen in Figure 6 .Here, the theoretical Raman spectra were corrected from activities to intensities by using recommended equations [44, 45] . The optimized structures in the three media present C 1 symmetries and 28 atoms, hence, for this species are expected 78 vibration normal modes. All vibration modes present activity in the infrared and Raman spectra. The scaled quantum mechanical force field (SQMFF) methodology and the Molvib program were used, together with the normal internal coordinates and transferable scaling factors, to calculate the harmonic force fields of DD1 in the three media at the same level of theory [41] [42] [43] . Then, the vibrational assignments of bands observed in the experimental infrared spectrum to the vibration modes were performed considering potential energy distribution (PED) contributions  10 %. In Table 6 are summarized observed and calculated wavenumbers for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous solution by using B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations together with the corresponding assignments. In the region of higher wavenumbers the assignments in gas phase are practically the same than in aqueous solution and, only the C2-H7 and C1-H6 stretching modes corresponding to pyridine ring are predicted interchanged in solution in relation to the gas phase. Later, assignments for some groups are discussed below. The weak IR bands at 2794w, 2750w and 1890w could be attributed to the dimeric species because the calculations were performed in the gas phase to the isolated molecule where the forces packing in the solid phase were not considered. Figure S7 shows the predicted IR spectra in the three media and the increase in the intensities of some bands in solution.Assignments O-H group. The OH stretching vibrations are generally observed around 3500-3300 cm -1 [63] . This absorption is strongly influenced by the chemical environment, in particular when OH group are involved in the intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bond [66] [67] [68] . De Freitas et al. [66] reported the OH stretching vibration of the 8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxaldehyde isonicotinoylhydrazone at 3396 cm -1 . On the other hand, Benković et al. [69] reported the stretching of the OH groups, involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of the group C=N, of hydrazones with hydroxyl group in position 2 of phenyl ring at 3142 cm -1 . In the present study, the broad and very weak IR band at 3490 cm −1 have been assigned to stretching modes of OH involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bond for DD1 (Figs. 5 and 6 ). Note that in solution this mode is predicted to lower wavenumbers due to the hydration. In general, the OH in-plane deformation vibration for phenols lies in the region 1440-1260 cm -1 [70] , Arunagiri et al. [71] reported the in-plane deformation vibrations of two OH at 1242 and 1220 cm -1 . In this work, the observed in-plane deformation vibrations of OH for DD1 in gas phase and aqueous solution are predicted at 1180 and 1172 cm -1 , respectively while the out-of-plane deformation or torsion mode of OH for DD1 in gas phase is predicted at 569 cm -1 and, in solution it is predicted shifted at 492 cm -1 due to the hydration, as observed in similar compounds containing this group [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] .in the region 3100-3000 cm -1 in aromatic compounds [55] [56] [57] [58] 60, 72] . For the title molecule, a series of infrared absorptions between 3168 and 2989 cm -1 were assigned as CH stretching modes of the quinolone, imidazole and benzotriazole rings. The C-H in-plane deformation vibrations are observed in the region 1500-1058 cm -1 and are usually of medium to weak intensity [55] [56] [57] [58] 60, 65, 72] . In the present work, the bands due to C-H in-plane bending vibration interact somewhat with C-C stretching vibrations, hence, they are assigned to IR bands between 1472 and 1054 cm −1 . The out-of-plane CH deformations are predicted and assigned between 999 and 715 cm -1 [55] [56] [57] [58] 60, 65, 72] . The assignments of these vibration modes in solution are slightly different from those predicted in gas phase, as can be seen in Table 6 . In our case, the strong IR bands at 823, 791 and 696 cm -1 together with the band of medium intensity at 927 cm -1 are assigned to CH out-of-plane deformation vibrations.Assignments CH 2 groups. These vibration modes are influenced by the medium because in solution are predicted at higher wavenumbers than in gas phase. Thus, the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes are predicted in gas phase at 2943 and 2911 cm -1 while in solution are predicted at 3004 and 2962 cm -1 , respectively. The remaining deformation, wagging, rocking and twisting modes are observed at higher wavenumbers in aqueous solution. Probably, the proximity of this group with the imidazole ring justifies these differences.Assignments skeletal groups. The C=N stretching vibration is reported at 1613 cm -1 by Sheeja et al. [72] . Here, the C5=N17 and C23=N28 stretching modes are predicted in gas phase at 1563 and 1474 cm -1 while in solution at 1578 and 1333 cm -1 . Note that the C23=N28 stretching mode in solution is predicted coupled with the C23-N21 stretching mode. The aromatic C=C-C stretching vibrations of aromatic ring are very much important and occur in the region 1200-1650 cm -1 [19] [20] [21] [22] [55] [56] [57] [58] 60] . In DD1, the IR bands in the range 1687-1457 cm -1 are assigned to C=C stretching mode in aromatic rings while the C-C stretching modes are predicted by SQM calculation between 1367 and 1001 cm -1 . Then, these modes are assigned in those regions, as predicted by calculations. Here, the C18-N21 stretching modes in both media are predicted couples with one of torsion modes of pyridine ring between 728 and 725 cm -1 , that is, practically in the same region. Hence, we can see that that mode is not influenced by the medium. The assignments of other groups in the 360 and 25 cm -1 region such as, deformations and torsions of three rings were not performed because the infrared spectrum was recorded only until 400 cm -1 .Calculations of harmonic force fields for DD1 in the three media by using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method have allowed to compute the scaled force constants which are very important parameters that explain the forces of different bonds. Thus, these constants are obtained when the harmonic force fields are transformed from Cartesian coordinates to normal internal coordinates with the SQMFF methodology and the Molvib program [41] [42] [43] .The results for DD1 in the three media are presented in Table 7 . Thus, due to the proximity of CH 2 group to ring R3 the stretching modes are influenced by the medium because in solution are observed higher force constants values than in gas phase.However, the deformations of those groups practically are practically similar in the three media.The experimental ultraviolet-visible spectrum of DD1 in DMSO solution recorded between 200 and 400 nm region can be seen in Figure S8 The experimental 1 H-and 13 C -NMR spectra of DD1 were obtained by using TMS as an internal standard and DMSO-d 6 as solvent (Figs. S9 and S10) . In Tables The (Fig. S11) . These values are in good agreement with the proposed composition for the title compound.In this section, the Hirshfeld surface analysis of the DD1 molecule were carried out with the help of Crystal Explorer 3.1 program [73] . In this section, the molecular docking analysis of 5-((1H-imidazol-1-yl) methyl) quinolin-8-ol Table 8 , also between DD1-6Y84 docking mechanism as 2D and 3D were shown in Fig. 9 . In addition, the positions of DD1 within the receptor (6Y84) were shown in Fig. 10 . The best binding was determined with -7.2 (kcal/mol) energy between DD1 ligand and 6Y84 receptor according to the affinity energies with two hydrogen bonding. But one active hydrogen bonding was observed GLN127 active residue and H2 atom with 2.33 Å bond distance as seen Fig. 9 . Furthermore, from the Fig. 9 van der Waals, π-cation, π-donor hydrogen bond and π-alkyl interactions could be easily seen. At the last of the tables, the obtained inhibition constants and the number of hydrogen bonding for DD1-6Y84 interactions were given. Secondly, the molecular docking mechanism between DD1 ligands and the 6WCF receptor was investigated and evaluated. 6WCF is Crystal Structure of ADP ribose phosphatase of NSP3 from SARS-CoV-2 in complex with MES [82] . The active sites of PDB:6WCF were detected as PHE132, ILE131, GLY130, ALA129, ASN72, THR71, SER128, LYS55, ALA52, GLY51, GLY47, GLY46, LYS44, ASN40, and ALA38. As mentioned before, the grid parameters were determined to include the active region as follows : centre_x=-4.969, centre_y=8.796, centre_z=-5.972, size_x=62, size_y=84, size_z=42, spacing=0.375. The same grids were used in both ligands and the docking scores were tabulated in Table 9 and additionally between DD1-6WCF docking mechanism were indicated as 2D and 3D in Fig.   11 . Figure 11 . The molecular docking results of the DD1 compound with 6WCF protein, surfaces around ligand (a) and 2D forms (b).Furthermore, the positions of DD1 within the 6WCF receptor were indicated in Fig. 11 . As seen from the Table 9 , the best binding was determined with -6.2 (kcal/mol) energy between DD1 ligand and 6WCF receptor with two active hydrogen bonding (Fig. 10) . The bond distances between ALA129-N5 and SER128-N6 were determined as 2.35 and 2.70 Å, respectively. Additionally, from the Fig. 12 van der Waals, carbon hydrogen bond, π-π-T shaped and π-alkyl interactions could be easily observed and at the last of the tables, the inhibition constants and the number of hydrogen bonding for DD1-6WCF interactions weregiven. The inhibition constants were computed with the help of Ki=exp(ΔG/RT) equation,where, ΔG, R and T are the docking binding energy, gas constant (1.9872036×10 -3 kcal/mol) and room temperature (298.15 K), respectively. From the molecular docking results, it is concluded that DD1 molecule can be considered as potential agent against COVID-19/6Y84-6WCF receptors.In this work, a new chloroquine analogue, 5-((1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)quinolin-8-ol (DD1)with potential antiviral agent against COVID-19/6Y84-6WCF receptors has been synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 ","Morocco","first author","2021-01-27",1

In Ethiopia as of October 2, 2020, a total of 120,630 cases were identified with 1 864 deaths reported (1) . In the absence of a directed therapy and expanding vaccine service for the disease, working on mechanisms to halt the progression of the disease in order to improve disease outcome is the best strategy in addition to promotion of disease preventive mechanisms. To that aim studies to identify important clinical and laboratory biomarkers that can predict disease severity and outcome have been conducted. So far different clinical, laboratory and radiologic markers that can predict disease severity have been identified with varying results in the face of changing behavior of the disease and geographical disparity. Therefore, understanding predictors of disease severity and outcome are crucial to provide early preventive measures for a better outcome especially in economically developing country setup where intensive care setup might not match the increasing demand in the service.Different laboratory markers are implicated as an indicator of disease severity, progression and outcome. Deranged cell counts, like anemia, polycythemia, leukopenia and leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance and decreased platelet count are found to be associated with severe disease and worse outcome in hospitalized patients (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Similarly raised liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were identified in severe and critical patients (6, (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .Raised inflammatory response of the body as manifested by raised laboratory values of various interleukins and C-reactive proteins are also reported (4, 7, (16) (17) (18) . In addition, raised coagulation markers like fibrinogen and prothrombin time are identified in severe and critical patients (2, 4) .Electrolyte imbalance in both directions, hypo-and hyper-levels were reported for sodium, potassium and calcium levels among patients with severe disease and worse outcome, hypothesized to result from the effect of the disease on the body system or the medication side effects (19) (20) (21) .There is limited study that assessed the role of laboratory markers in predicting disease severity and outcome in the African setup. Since the number of infected cases and mortality rate is reported to be lower than those reported in the non-African setup, understanding the disease predictors in our setup is crucial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify laboratory biomarkers that predict disease severity and outcome among COVID-19 patients admitted to the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia from July to October 2020.An institution based retrospective cohort study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The follow up was made from July to October, 2020. The source population was all cases of COVID-19 admitted at MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using RT-PCR, as reported by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health and who were on follow up from July to October, 2020 (22) .All consecutively admitted Severe COVID-19 patients during the follow up period with complete clinical and laboratory data were included in the study. With these criteria, a total of 429 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis.All COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the center from July to October, 2020 and with complete baseline clinical and laboratory data were included.Data was extracted from patients' admission, follow up and discharge charts using a pretested electronic data abstraction tool that is adopted from the WHO CRF form. Data extractors were trained on the tool and appropriate infection prevention and control measures were followed.Data was summarized using frequency tables and percentages.To identify predictors of COVID-19 disease severity, Robust Poisson regression model was used. Variables significantly associated with disease severity at 25% level of significance in the Univariate analysis were were considered in the multivariable model. In the final model; adjusted RR, P-value and 95% CI for RR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant predictors of disease severity.To assess the presence of statistically significant association between COVID-19 disease outcome (death) and the explanatory variables , Binary Logistic regression model was used. Univariate analysis was done to screen out independent variables to be used in the multivariable Binary Logistic regression model at 25% level of significance. The adequacy of the final model was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test and the final model fitted the data well p-value = 0.876). For the Binary Logistic regression, 95% confidence interval for AOR was calculated and variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with disease outcome.All analyses were performed using STATA software version 14 (College Station, TX).Among the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had severe disease and the rest 247 (57.6%) had non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate) at admission. Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive.More than half of the participants were younger than 50 years (60.8%) and males (64.1%). One hundred eighty eight (43.8%) had a history of one or more preexisting co-morbid illness. The majority had hypertension (25.2%), Type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) (19.8%), Asthma (6.1%) and cardiac disease (5.6%). Other co-morbid illness including chronic diseases of the lung, kidney, liver and neurology constituted less than 1% of the total cases.The complete blood count of the study participants showed that more than one-third (36.1%) had polycythemia and only 23 (5.4%) were anemic. Close to one-third had deranged white blood cell count (WBC), with 61 ( Three hundred forty seven (80.9%) of the patients had a raised urea value and 62 (14.5%) had raised creatinine. Raised liver enzymes level of Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were recorded on 43.6%, 24.5% and 18.2% of the patients, respectively.However; only age group, WBC and Na level were found to be significantly associated with disease outcome in the multivariable binary logistic regression model at 5% level of significance.Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of dying among patients who were 50 years and older was 2.767 times compared with those less than 50 years of age (AOR= 2.767, 95% CI= 1.099, 6.067, p-value=0.031).The laboratory markers that are found to be significant determinants of disease outcome were WBC count and Na level. After being adjusted for other factors, having deranged laboratory markers (both lower and raised values) of WBC count and Na level were associated with 4 3.889, 14.375) 3.435 (1.439, 8.198 In this study, we assessed the effect of clinical and laboratory markers on COVID-19 disease severity and outcome among 429 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia from July to October 2020. In this study, we identified the markers of disease severity and outcome. Timely identification of biomarkers of COVID-19 disease severity and death would help to provide targeted intervention and patient management. Among the 429 patients studied, 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate) and the rest 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission. Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive. Age group, NLR, SGOT, Sodium and Potassium were found to be significant predictors of COVID-19 disease severity. In addition, the following factors were significantly associated with the COVID-19 disease outcome; age group, white blood cell count and sodium level.On the robust Poisson regression model, age group, sex, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, fever, sorethroat, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, Hct, WBC, NLR, platelet count, urea, creatinine, SGPT, SGOT, ALP, Na and K were found to be significant predictors of COVID-19 disease severity on the crude analysis. But after controlling for the above variables, age group, fever, fatigue, NLR, SGOT, Na and K were found to be predictors of COVID-19 disease severity at 5% level of significance.Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, being 50 years and older was found to be associated with a 1.779 times increased risk of developing severe disease. Age is implicated to be associated with severe disease and outcome in different studies conducted globally (23) (24) (25) (26) . Similar finding is also reported from studies conducted in our country (27, 28) . The reasons behind could be the increased possibility of weaker immune defense mechanism and co-morbid 1 1 illnesses making older individuals prone to different illnesses with severe progression and worst outcome.Symptoms of fever and fatigue were found to be significant predictors of disease severity showing a 1.252 and 1.414 times increased risk of having severe disease as compared to patients with no such symptoms, respectively. Having symptomatic disease, other than symptoms used in disease classification, in general is reported to delay disease recovery and also found to be associated with more severe disease category (28, 29) .NLR of greater than three is associated with a 4.769 times increased risk of developing severe disease as compared with those with a value of three and less. As an indicator of the body's systemic inflammation, a raised level of this inflammatory biomarker above three indicates the body's stress. With more stress, as in severe and critical patient states, the level increases to even higher level. Therefore, this biomarker is an indirect indication of the body's stress level due to the severity of the disease. This is also similar with findings from other studies where NLR was found to an important predictor of disease severity and outcome (3, (5) (6) (7) (8) .Having a raised SGOT of 41 and above was associated with a 1.358 times increased risk of having severe disease as compared with those with value of a normal range. Different mechanisms are pointed to the possible effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus on liver; the virus could directly affect the hepatocytes or the liver could get injured indirectly through enhanced inflammatory response due to the raised immune markers and drug toxicity that are meant to treat or halt the progression of the disease resulting in liver damage and thereby an increase in liver enzymes (30) . Raised in liver enzymes associated with more severe disease category is also reported in other studies (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .The risk of developing severe disease among patients with deranged values of Na and K level (both hypo-and hyper-levels) was 1.321 and 1.269 times than patients with a normal values of Na and K, respectively. Electrolyte imbalances in any disease condition can result from fluid losses from the body through different routes, renal damage and effect of medication that is administered to treat the disease and/or concomitant illnesses. It is also implicated to be due to the decreased activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is claimed to be a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This is also demonstrated in other studies, where both increased and decreased levels of Na and K are found to be associated with severe disease states (19) (20) (21) .Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of dying among patients who were 50 years and older was 2.767 times compared with those less than 50 years of age. Similar to the above finding where age is associated with more severe disease condition, it is also implicated to be associated with severe disease outcome.The laboratory markers that are found to be significant determinants of disease outcome were white blood cell count and sodium level.After being adjusted for other factors, having deranged laboratory markers (both lower and raised values) of white blood cell count was associated with a 4.253 times higher odds of dying compared to those with normal values. Both leukopenia and leukocytosis are found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Having decreased white cell count increases the potential to develop serious infection and expansion of an already existing pathogen thereby leading to the development of critical disease stage in any infection. Similarly, although a raised white cell count is an indication of a strong immune system responding to external threat, it also implies that the body is under a lot of stress from the pathogenic organism.Similarly, having deranged laboratory markers (both lower and raised values) of Na level was associated with a 3.435 times higher odds of dying compared to those with normal values for this marker. As discussed above, hyponatremia and hypernatremia that can result from different underlying disease conditions or from the medications given to treat the disease are found to be associated with severe disease and worse outcomes as demonstrated by different studies as well (20, 21) .In this study we have assessed laboratory markers that can predict disease severity and outcome. Accordingly, NLR of above three, raised SGOT and deranged Na and K levels (both hypo-and hyper-states) were found to be significant predictors of developing severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, deranged values of WBC and Na levels were significantly associated with worse outcome of the disease. Therefore, assessing and monitoring these laboratory markers at the earliest stage of the disease could have a considerable input in halting disease progression and death.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-04",1

In eight months, more urgently needed. To this end, modelling this epidemic is necessary. The dynamical behavior of the COVID-19 spreading was analyzed [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , which focused on the cases in China [1] [2] [3] , Japan [4], South Korea [5] , Iran [6], Italy [7] and 10 India [8] . The effectiveness of IPCMs was evaluated [9] [10] [11] [12] . Among these, the effectiveness of the quarantine of Wuhan was assessed by calculating the contact rate of latent individuals with the SEIR model [9] . The conclusion is that the quarantine and isolation effectively reduced the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and successfully delayed the date of peak infection. Simi- 15 larly, the impact of the disease control measures in Wuhan was studied [10] , with the non-constant transmission rates with a modified SEIR model. In addition, two simple approaches to data analysis were adopted to evaluate the influence of the intervention measures [11, 12] . Specifically, the second derivative of the function of the cumulatively diagnosed cases was calculated [11] to show the ef- 20 fect of the massive interventions in China, and a stochastic model that predicts the cumulative number of the laboratory-confirmed patients was introduced [12] to simulate the evolution process of the epidemic under intervention measures.It is noted that their estimation of the transmission parameter was made under many assumptions on the model of epidemiology, e.g., the number of exposed 25 cases in the incubation period. Further, the asymptomatic and infected cases of incubation result in inaccuracy in the reported daily number of confirmed 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof cases. Therefore, the aforementioned approaches to evaluating the epidemic situation are over simplified and not accurate, as shown by the recent data of the epidemic. 30 Since the COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, it is necessary to model the dynamics of COVID-19 to predict its future trend. The existing epidemic models can be divided into two categories, i.e., the first-principle model [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and the data-driven model [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The first-principle model is able to clearly show how and why an input has an effect on the output. Building such a 35 model necessitates some specific knowledge that is however difficult to acquire.For example, to predict the status of one person via an epidemic model in a network, we have to know the statuses of those who have contacted him/her, and determine the probability with it the person is infected by them. In addition, the interventions from the human, e.g., precautions from individuals, isolation of 40 suspect cases, and development of ascertainment infections, need to be explicitly specified in advance. Otherwise, the prediction may be far away from the true case [20] .The data-driven modelling is sometimes preferable, which builds the relationship between the system inputs and outputs without explicit domain knowledge. 45 An exponential model was obtained with the number of the daily cumulative cases at the early phase of the outbreak in China and gives the basic reproduction number [21] . Similarly, another data-driven model was developed [22] , which is matched with the mean and standard deviations of the number of the reported daily cumulative cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship with a 50 gamma distribution and gives also the basic reproduction number. The end time and the total numbers of the infectious cases and the mortality cases of COVID-19 in China were predicted by different types of data-driven models, i.e., the logistic model, the Bertalanffy model and the Gompertz model [23] .The social media search indices (SMSIs) were taken into consideration, which 55 were fitted by the data of the confirmed cases via a model of subset selection [24] . In Castorina [25] , a generalized Gompertz law was found to predict the maximum number of the infected individuals in China, Singapore, South Korea and Italy. In Li [26] , the Gaussian distribution theory was utilized to analyze and predict the transmission of COVID-19. Besides, prediction algorithms were 60 also provided [27, 28] are not stationary and conventional linear and nonlinear models would fail for long term prediction. Therefore, a large class of mappings with rich functions and operations is chosen as the model class and the evolutionary algorithm is utilized to obtain the optimal model for long term prediction. The resulting models on the DGR, the CRR and the cumulative mortality rate (CMR) pre-95 dict that the peak and inflection point will occur on 4 November 2020 and 15October 2020, respectively; the virus shall cease spreading on April 28, 2021; and the ultimate numbers of the COVID-19 cases and mortality cases will be 785529 and 17072, respectively. The approach is also benchmarked against other methods and shows better accuracy of long-term prediction.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces SA with the epidemic and data descriptions. The epidemic analysis and long-term prediction are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The conclusions are drawn in Section 5.SA is located in the southernmost region of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 2500 km along the South Atlantic and the Indian Oceans.With a total area of 1221037 km 2 , SA is the 24-th largest country in the world.The interior of SA consists of a vast, in most places almost flat, plateau with an altitude of between 1000 m and 2100 m, with a generally temperate climate. It is 110 to the north by the neighboring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini, and surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho [30] .According to the Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data in 2020, the population of SA is estimated at 59308690, which ranks 25-th in SA is a developing country with a mixed economy. In 2019, its GDP was worth 350 billion US dollars, ranking 42-th in the world. It has been being 120 burdened by a relatively high rate of crime, poverty, and unemployment, and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality. In 2015, 71% of net wealth were held by 10 percent richest of the population, whereas 60% of the poorest held only 7% of the net wealth with the Gini coefficient of 0.63 [32] .The health system of SA comprises the public sector and the private sector.The public health services are divided into primary, secondary and tertiary through health facilities that are located in and managed by the provincial departments of health. The health care system of SA owns more than 400 public hospitals and 200 private hospitals, and consumes about 8.8% of the 130 GDP in this country. Nonetheless, the vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are estimated at 56% and 46%, respectively. Moreover, 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system, which is the preferred government health provision within a primary health care approach. However, only 21% of doctors work in it [33] . In addition, SA has an estimated seven million people 135 living with HIV, more than any other country in the world [34] . Thus, the health care in SA is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.The COVID-19 spread to nearly all the countries after it broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The first known patient of COVID-19 in SA was con- Table 1 . The total population in 2020 is 59308690 [36] . 165 The cases are plotted in Fig. 1 shown in Table 2 . Note that the length of each phase is the same as that of SA.Since the COVID-19 spread in China was mainly confined in Hubei province before April 2020, the population size of Hubei province is used and 59270000 from the Institute of National Statistics of China (INSC) [38] .175 Let x(i) be the number of CICs at the i-th day, i = 1, 2, · · · , N , and define the number of DNCs and DGR as CMCs at the i-th day, i = 1, 2, · · · , N , and define the CMR as Z(i) = z(i)/x(i), i = 1, 2, · · · , N . Let W (i) = y(i) + z(i), i = 1, 2, · · · , N , be the number of cumulative removed cases (CRCs) at the i-th day, i = 1, 2, · · · , N , and define the CRR as w(i) = W (i)/x(i), i = 1, 2, · · · , N . Let I(i) = x(i) − y(i) − z(i), i = 1, 2, · · · , N , be the number of ACs at the i-th day, i = 1, 2, · · · , N .With the SA and China data, we calculate their DGR, CCR and CMR. Toshow the effect of lockdown, these rates from the lockdown date are plotted in Fig. 2 where β denotes the effective contact rate, and γ represents the removal rate 200 that is the inverse of the expectation of infection duration for COVID-19. Here, the reason for choosing γ as 1 14 is given as follows. On the one hand, the WHO indicates that the recovery time of people with mild symptoms for COVID-19 is about two weeks [41] . On the other hand, the mild case (including the asymptomatic case) accounts for 96.79% ∼ 99.49% of the total infectious cases 205 in SA [42] .In the initial phase of the epidemic, the infectious population accounts for a small fraction of the total population, and thus S ≈ P . Substituting S = P inwhose solution is given byβ is estimated by the least square method aŝwhereÎ(t) is prediction from (5), I(t) is the recorded number; n 1 and n 2 respectively denote the first and last days in a phase, e.g., during the lockdown of level 4 in SA. β in SIR indicates the transmission rate of an epidemic.To measure the capacity of epidemic spreading, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which denotes the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected host in a completely susceptible population [43] , is introduced as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof followsTo obtain R 0 for COVID-19 in different phases, the incidence data of SA is Table 1 . It indicates that althoughR 0 is decreasing during 215 lockdown in SA, its drop rate, (R 0 (T k−1 ) −R 0 (T k ))/R 0 (T k−1 ), is also gradually decreasing, where T k denotes the time period of the level-k lockdown.The same analysis is carried out on China case, where S(0) = 59269999, I(0) = 1 and W (0) = 0.β andR 0 are given in Table 2 , which shows that the drop rate ofR 0 in China is higher than that in SA in the middle and later 220 periods of lockdown.Note that R 0 is obtained under the assumption that everyone is susceptible.If only a part of people is the susceptible host, the effective reproduction number,J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Applying the above approach to our data, R(t) is plotted in Fig. 3 , which shows that the epidemic of COVID-19 in SA is not stable and that R(t) is with However, Fig. 4 shows R(t) < 1 after the 34-th day of lockdown, which means 240 that COVID-19 in China is under control and will be extinguished. Therefore, the IPCMs in China work better than that in SA.It is found from above analysis that although R 0 in SA decreased over the quarantined.The SIR model was also applied to long-term epidemic prediction in China 255 and South Korea [2, 17, 20] . The recent data shows, however, that the prediction of the approaches [2, 20] is not accurate. We attempt to predict the epidemic trend in SA. The recent data in SA, however, reveals that the prediction accuracy is not satisfactory with SIR to be shown in Section 4.The long-term forecasting of COVID-19 in many countries has been well studied. Among these, the work for China has received considerable attention, including the exponential model [21] , the logistic model [23] and the Gompertz model [25] . To our best knowledge, however, no work on the long-term forecasting of the COVID-19 in SA is reported to date in the literature. 2020, it is found that the DGR, which is related to the DNCs and CICs, shows a tendency of periodic oscillation. In addition, the CRR, which is the sum of CMR and CCR, tends to rise, while the CMR basically keeps flat. As seen, the epidemic dynamics of DGR, CRR and CMR are nonlinear and different from each other. The evolution algorithm [45] has the great capability of learning the 275 unknown dynamics of a nonlinear coupled system and no need to specify the model structure a priori, which is however required by the existing long-term forecasting methods, thus it is adopted to train models for DGR, CRR and CMR for epidemic prediction in SA. Algorithm 1 outlines the overall process of modelling. The initial generation of population, f 0 = {f 0 1 , f 0 2 , · · · , f 0 q }, is randomly created. By iteratively performing genetic operators, i.e., selection, crossover and mutation, a series of new generations of population, f k , k = 1, 2, · · · , is produced. The optimal one, f * , is obtained [48] aswhere f k (i), i ∈ [m 1 , m 2 ], is the predicted value on the i-th day, and u(i) = 280 1 m2−m1+1 m2 i=m1 u(i) is the mean of u(i). Output u(i), i = m 1 , m 1 + 1, · · · , m 2 , is used to train the above model. This model is used to make prediction, i.e., substitute i = 181, 182, · · · , 200 to (10) to obtain X(i). It is depicted in Fig. 6 This model is used to make prediction for w(i), which is depicted in Fig. 9 .Consider CMR with the same procedure as above. The optimal prediction model is found with r 2 = 0.997 and 7) )))).(12)This model is used to make prediction for Z(i), which is depicted in Fig. 10 . To predict when the epidemic ends, CRC and AC are calculated into the future, respectively, byThey are plotted in Fig. 11 . It is observed that the predicted AC would be less than 10000 after August 18, 2021. We treat the rising inflection point as the point at which the curvature of the ACs changes of sign. It is predicted that Table 3 . The predicted epidemic curves of CICs and ACs are plotted in Figures 12 and 13 , respectively. It is seen that our approach is with a lower R and a higher r 2 , indicating our approach with a higher prediction accuracy.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Furthermore, a novel model is developed to forecast the long-term epidemic cases could be 785529, in which there would be 17072 people losing their lives.Using historical incidence data of SA, the experimental result illustrates the effectiveness of our approach, and the comparative experimental result shows a higher prediction accuracy of our approach than the others.

The epidemic was first proclaimed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] .Corona virus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. It may also be possible to acquire infection by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching our mouth, nose, and probable eyes [2, 3] .The disease is highly contagious, and its major clinical manifestations include fever, dry cough, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache, body aches, fatigue, chills, and shortness of breath. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that symptoms of corona virus may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days after exposure [4, 5] .People with certain health conditions have a higher risk of severe complications if they acquire the infection. These health conditions includes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma, heart conditions, immune system conditions such as HIV, cancer, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, pregnant women and old aged people [6] .The WHO declared that epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, and announced it as a pandemic in March 2020. As of June 2020, greater than 10.1 million cases of COVID-19 pandemic have been reported in 213 nations and territories, resulting in nearly greater than 501,874 deaths. Greater than 5.2 million individuals have recovered, though there may be a likelihood of relapse or reinfection [7] .As of June 2020, greater than 5,570 cases of COVID-19 pandemic have been reported in Ethiopia and resulting in approximately 94 deaths. Greater than 2,015 individuals have recovered, though there may be an opportunity of relapse or reinfection in Ethiopia. Out of 5,570 cases, 89.6% of the cases are of Ethiopian nationals and 11.4% of the total positive cases belong to foreign nationals. Fortunately, to date, the case fatality rate is only 1.7% [7, 8] .Currently, Ethiopia is suffering from the critical phase of the COVID-19 thus; there is a fear of rapid raise of infection. To date, majority of the COVID-19 infection is limited to the highincome society where the infected persons have a direct or indirect relationship with the infected countries (China, Arab Emirate, Japanese, Belgium, and Dubai etc.) [9] .A huge disaster might happen in case the COVID-19 is entered into the people who live in overcrowded conditions. This population is real not aware of the socio-economic and health consequences of COVID-19 pandemic and even do not have adequate resources to control and prevent this infectious disease. Also, the late or undiagnosed COVID-19 cases might create a complex chain of an infected person [10] .The Ethiopian government is considered all types of preventive measures to halt transmission. Accordingly, all of the schools, colleges, Universities, company, and offices have been already locked down for the security of the nation. All the international and national conferences and meetings have been cancelled until further notice. The use of public transportation from region to region has been limited, to prevent the global spread of coronavirus infection [11, 12] .In addition, the federal ministry of health in Ethiopia did substantial efforts to prevent and control the pandemic through different measures. Public education is considered as one of the most relevant measures that can help in the prevention and control of infectious diseases [13] .Besides, above all the governmental efforts, people need to be aware of all government advisories, messages, guidelines and do follow the prevention measure for their safety and wellbeing [12] . Despite these efforts, nearly all people neglect the benefit of social distancing, hands washing, stay at home, use of sanitizer and mask due to attitudinal and behavioral issues.The prevention and control measures against corona virus pandemic are proceeding in Ethiopia. To assure the final win against the battle, population compliance to these prevention and control measures are important, which is largely influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards corona virus in agreement with KAP theory. In addition, to facilitate the prevention and control of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, there is an urgent need to measure the population awareness of COVID-19 at this critical time. Hence, it is relevant to study these domains in the Sidama adult population. Considering the importance of all the above factors, it was aimed to measure the current level of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic and predictors among the adult population in rural Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia; 2020.This study was carried out in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia. Sidama regional state is one of the 10th regions in Ethiopia and located 275 km south of Addis Ababa, the capital city of country. The region has consisted of six town administrations and thirty districts with an overall of 576 kebeles (lowest administrative units in Ethiopia with approximately 1,000 households). Based on the Ethiopian Population Census Report 2007 estimates, the overall population of the region in 2020 has reached 5,493,516. The Sidama regional state has overall of 5,806 health professionals of diverse disciplines and 624 health posts, 127 health centers, two general hospital, 13 primary hospitals and 1 comprehensive and specialized hospital owned by the government. There are also thirty-two private medium and six non-governmental (NGO) clinics, and 73 private drug stores. The physical health service coverage of the region was 90.3%. The Hawassa city is the capital city of the Sidama regional state. The main crops grown in the area are enset (false banana), barely, khat, coffee, broad beans, cereals and livestock. Unimproved drinking water source, poor hygienic condition and frequent drought in the region results in high burden of the infectious diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and intestinal parasites and soil transmitted helminthiasis [14] .This community-based cross-sectional study was carried out using a quantitative method in Sidama regional state from May 1-30; 2020. The source and study population of this study were all adult population and all systematically selected adult population who resided in the Sidama regional state for 6 months. The study participants who had lived less than 6 months, serious diseases, mental health disorders and treated last one month prior to survey for any illness were excluded from this study.The minimum required sample size was estimated by using a single population proportion formula in consideration of the subsequent assumptions. The proportion (p) of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic is 50% using a conservative approach due to the lack of previous study done in Ethiopia, 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error. As a multi-stage sampling technique was utilized to choice study participants, a design effect of 1.9 was taken and a 10% compensation for non-response was added to the estimated sample size. Thus, the final calculated sample size was 1,278.A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The region consists of 30 rural and 6 urban districts. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 9 out of 30 rural districts. Initially, the 30 rural district administrations (RDAs) of the region were clustered into three major sub-groups based on their proximity to Hawassa city, the capital of regional state. The first cluster includes 10 RDAs that are found south of the Daye city, the second cluster includes 10 RDAs that are found between Daye and Yirgalem city and the third cluster includes 10 RDAs that are found north of the Yirgalem city. From the ten RDAs that are found south of the Daye city, three RDAs (Chabe, Girga and Bensa) were selected randomly for the study. Also, from the ten RDAs that are found between Daye and Yirgalem, three RDAs (Bona, Titicha, and Chuko) were selected randomly. Similarly, from the 10 RDAs that are found north of Yirgalem city, 3 RDAs (Gorche, Yiraba and Darara) were selected randomly taking into consideration their homogeneity. In 3 clusters, a total of nine RDAs were included for the study. The RDAs were further categorized into three agro-climate regions (lowland, midland and highland). From each agro-climate regions, 1 kebele was selected purposively based on its information potential and accessibility. Firstly, the total calculated sample size was apportioned to the kebeles comparative to their population size. The calculated sample interval (K = N/n) was K (which was differ from kebele to kebele). Lastly, study respondents were drawn using a systematic sampling procedure with sampling interval of K. The first HH head was drawn by using simple random sampling procedure. Then, sequential HH head were selected at a regular interval of Kth household until required sample size obtained. If head of HH lacking from the household for three successive visits and there were no other choices, the subsequent nearest HH head was involved.The dependent variables were KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic. The exposure variables were socio-demographic variables such as sex, age, religion, ethnicity, family size, monthly income quintiles, educational levels, occupation status, marital status and sources of information about the corona virus disease etc.The data were collected using a properly designed, structured and pretested intervieweradministered questionnaire in Sidama language (the local language of the study region). The survey tool or questionnaire was prepared initially in English language, converted into Sidama language and then retranslated back to English language. The comparison was carried out to assess consistency and accuracy between the two versions of survey tools (See S1 and S2 Files). Data collectors and supervisors were trained on the survey tool, data collection techniques, aims of the study, and ethical considerations by the research team for two days. Following the training, the survey tool was pre-tested on 5% of an overall calculated sample size among adult population in kebele which was not included in the actual study setting. At that instant, any inconsistency and non-accuracy documented between the two versions of survey tool were readjusted accordingly.The data collection process was managed by 20 clinical Nurses. Four BSc Nurses were cautiously supervised the data collection method. The survey questionnaire was modified from standard the Question and Answer about COVID-19 in the website of WHO weekly report and other previous study conducted on KAP towards the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERs CoV) [15, 16] .A structured study tool (questionnaire) comprised four parts. The first parts included socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the study respondents as aforementioned above in the study variables part. The second part comprised 12 questions about the knowledge of COVID-19. Knowledge questions were both in the form of a multiple response or in the arrangement of true, false, or no opinion (K1-K12). Correct responses had assigned 3 scores, whereas incorrect responses were assigned 1 score. A ""no opinion"" response had 2 scores. Finally, the overall knowledge point extended from 12 to 36. The study participants who had scored 31 and below were classified as having poor knowledge, 31 to 34 as having moderate knowledge, and above 34 as scoring high knowledge of COVID-19.The third part assessed the attitude concerning COVID-19. To assess the attitude of the adult population towards the COVID-19, 19 questions were tested (A1-A19). The responding and scoring systems were the same to the second part which was concerning knowledge (correct = 3, incorrect = 1, and no opinion = 2). The overall attitude point extended from 19 to 57. A score of below 47, 47 to 50, and above 50 was categorized as low, moderate, and high attitude towards COVID-19, respectively.The last part included 11 questions regarding the practice of COVID-19. Concerning the adult population's practice towards the COVID-19, 11 questions were tested (P1-P11), with the same grading system as earlier (true = 3, false = 1, no opinion = 2). Overall scores of below 21, 21 to 24, and above 24 were categorized as a weak, moderate, and strong practice towards COVID-19, respectively. This paper was prepared based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline and the STROBE checklist is delivered as supporting information (See S3 File).Data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and all analyses was done using SPSS version 25. All needed variables recoding and calculations were carried out before to the main analysis. The income quintile of the study participants used as a measure of the socioeconomic status of the study participants. The descriptive analyses were done to find out descriptive measures for the socio-demographic and other important variables. The knowledge, attitudes and practices scores of study participants based on their independent variables were compared using Chisquare test, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as required.The Spearman's correlation analysis was used to measure the association among mean attitude and practice scores. Data were analyzed using bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model. The variables with p-values < 0.25 on the bi-variable analysis were entered into a multivariable binary logistic regression model to find out predictors independently associated with KAP adjusting for other predictors in the model. The candidate variables were entered into the multivariable binary logistic regression model using the backward (Wald) stepwise regression technique. The basic assumptions of binary logistic regression model such as absence of outliers, multicollinearity and interaction between independent variables were tested to be fulfilled. The multicollinearity among the exposure variables was also evaluated using multiple linear regression model. For all variables as the variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 10 which indicates no evidence of multicollinearity. Fitness of binary logistic regression model was considered using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics in model and greater than 0.05. The existence and strength of association between KAP and the exposure variables were evaluated using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals. The statistically significant association between the variables of interest was confirmed when the 95% CI of the AOR did not embrace 1.Ethical clearance was got from the Hawassa University, institutional review board with a reference number of IRB/143/10. The informed written consent was obtained from the sampled study participants. The study participants with symptom and sign of COVID-19 were referred to nearby isolation centers for further investigation and treatment. The ethical considerations were addressed by proving the cloth face mask, sanitizer, alcohol and soap for the study participants.Socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the respondents have been summarized in Table 1 . From a total of 1,278, merely 1,214 study participants responded questions, making a response rate of 95%. The mean ± standard deviation [SD]) of the age of respondents was 34 ±10) years and (ranged, 18-80). Majority of respondents were within the range of 21-30 years and male 710 (58.5%). The mean family size of study household was 5 persons. According to this study, majority 1161/1214 (95.6) of the study participants were from Sidama ethnic group. Majority 1161/1214 (95.6%) and 1,024/1,214 (84.3%) of the study participants were followers of protestant Christianity and married, respectively. Majority, 977/1,214 (80.4%) of the study participants joined formal education. Almost all 1,206/1,214 (99.3%) of the studied households had access to news media such as TV and radio.The majority of study participants knew that cause of COVID-19 is a virus, symptom such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, and patients with certain conditions are at a higher risk for COVID-19 infection and death (73.0%, 83.0%, and 69.0%, respectively). Similarly, almost all of study participants knew that COVID-19 can be prevented through different mechanisms, the isolation of suspected cases should be for a minimum of 2-14 days, and vaccine were not available in market (98.9%, 60.5%, and 67.9%, respectively). According to our results, the majority, 533 (43.9%) of the adult population had good knowledge about the disease. The mean knowledge score was 32.4, indicating an overall 90% correct rate for knowledge questions (Table 2 ). Based on t-test and ANOVA analysis, the mean knowledge scores were significantly different among sex, categories of marital status, educational levels, main occupation, and the monthly income quintiles of the study participants. Government employees showed higher knowledge scores (33.7 ± 3.5) than daily laborer (31.5 ± 3.9) and house wife (30.9 ± 4) (p<0.05) ( Table 3 ).The The majority of study participants had washed hands often with soap, avoided shaking hands and stayed at home to prevent COVID-19 infection (93.0%, 81.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). The mean (+standard deviation [SD]) correct response score of the 11 questions concerning the rate of the COVID-19 practice was 21.5 (+ 3.8), indicating an overall 65% correct rate in the practices test. The majority, 542 (44.6%) of study participants had weak practice towards COVID-19 ( Table 6 ). The Spearman's analysis showed that a significant positive correlation among the mean attitude and practice scores regarding COVID-19 (r = -0.61, P<0.001). The higher the attitude scores were, the higher the probability of positive practices. Hence, a positive attitude toward COVID-19 was directly associated with a positive practice. The mean practice scores significantly varied across sex, marital status, education levels, monthly income quintiles, and the main occupation of the study participants. Study participants who were in highest wealth rank showed higher practice scores (22.4 ± 3.6) than lowest (20.6 ± 3.6) and middle rank (21.6 ± 3.8) ( Table 7) . Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 pandemic among adult population in Sidama regionResults of the bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analysis of knowledge towards COVID-19 are shown in Table 8 . Multivariable analysis of predictors revealed that odds of knowledge towards COVID-19 infections were 2.51 times increased in males sex as compared to those females (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.65-3.78; P = 0.001). The secondary education levels (AOR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.50-3.78; P = 0.001) and occupation status of government employees (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI = 1.92-5.02; P = 0.008) were positively associated with knowledge towards COVID-19 infections. The odds of knowledge towards COVID-19 infections were 2.41 times increased for the study participants who had a diploma and above educational level (AOR = 2.41, 95 CI = 1.31-4.43) as compared to those who had cannot read and write (Table 8) .Both bi-variable and multivariable analyses of predictors revealed that odds of attitude towards COVID-19 were 3.07 times higher in study participants who have good knowledge as compared to those who have poor knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.79-5.04; P = 0.004). In the multivariable model in which 7 potential confounders were adjusted, the odds of knowledge towards COVID-19 were 3.16 times increased (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI: 2.71-5.89) among study participants who had government employees as compared to the students (Table 9 ). Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 pandemic among adult population in Sidama regionMultivariable analysis of predictors revealed that odds of practice towards COVID-19 prevention and control were 2.56 times higher in respondent who had married as compared to those who had single in marital status (AOR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.54-4.16; P = 0.004). In addition, main occupation of the government employee (AOR = 3.01; 95% CI = 2.44-5.39) and education level of diploma and above (AOR = 2.48; 95% CI = 3.13-21.30) were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention and control practice. Moreover, the odds of practicing COVID-19 prevention and control were 2.62 times increased for respondent who had a highest wealth rank (AOR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.81-3.81) as compared to those who had the lowest wealth rank (Table 10 ). To the best of our evidence, this is the first study carried out in Sidama regional state to assess the KAP towards COVID-19 among the general adult population. Based on our results, the KAP towards COVID-19 score was significantly higher among males, highest wealth rank, married people, those who had higher education levels and government employees. According to the knowledge scores of the study respondents, an overall correct rate of 90% for the knowledge questions, verified that the majority of study respondents were good knowledge towards COVID-19 pandemic. This result is consistent with the previous studies findings from China and Iran general population concerning the KAP towards COVID-19; however, a poor knowledge about the isolation period of disease and patients with certain conditions are at a higher risk for COVID-19 infection and death was demonstrated among the general adult population of Sidama region [17, 18] . This high correct answer rate concerning knowledge toward COVID-19 among Sidama population might be due to the fact that its origins somewhat in their high exposure to the information delivered by the Ethiopian government and different media about the virus from the time when the start of the epidemic. Another reason might be the fact that study participants answered energetically to the severe circumstance of the pandemic and the enormous news reports, by gathering information from honorable sources.In our study the KAP towards COVID-19 are higher as compared to a study conducted in Northern Thailand about KAP towards COVID-19 among the bordered population in the early period of the epidemic [19] . Majority, 73.4% of the study participants had poor knowledge of COVID-19 prevention and control in Thailand; whereas in our study only 34.8% had demonstrated poor knowledge score. Also, 28.5% had high attitude towards COVID-19 prevention and control mechanisms; however, in this study 37.5% had high attitude towards COVID-19.In this study the proper/excellent skills to prevent and control the pandemic was 24.4%. In opposite to the current finding, studies conducted in Thailand among the bordered population in the early period of the epidemic reported a lower proper practice score (113.6%) [19] . This difference might be due to the fact that variation in the sample size, study population, area, and period. In Sidama region, the study was conducted at the time of the key phase of the pandemic after the population were wide-open to a lot of information about the COVID-19, its sign and symptom, isolation period, ways of transmission and prevention mechanisms, in Thailand the study was carried out in the early period of the outbreak. However, the studies conducted in Iran and China reported higher KAP scores towards COVID-19 than our study [17, 18] . This difference might be due to the fact that Iran and China surveys included urban study respondents. But, our study included study respondents from rural area. In addition, another reason might be due to the fact that 75.1% and 82.4% of Table 7 . Distribution of practice scores among adult population in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 pandemic among adult population in Sidama region the study respondents held an academic degree and associate's degree and above in Iran and China, respectively. This study found that good knowledge score about COVID-19 was positively associated with a positive attitude and good practice towards disease at the time of pandemic. This finding signify the importance of improving general public knowledge's about disease by public education program through the different channels which, in turn, would increase their positive attitude and good practice about COVID-19. This finding is in agreement with the studies done in Table 8 . Bi-variable and multivariable regression of association between socio-demographic and economic characteristics with the knowledge scores of COVID-19 among adult population in Sidama regional state, South Ethiopia, 2020. Our results of the socio-demographic and economic characteristics associated with KAP regarding COVID-19 are almost the same to earlier KAP studies about SARS and COVID-19 in China [18, 20] . According to these results, in order to improve public education support programs concerning the knowledge about COVID-19, more directed/focused methods for certain socio-demographic and economic groups such as female sex, lowest and second lowest wealth rank, farmer, house wife and those with lower education status are required.The overall attitude score towards disease was 82.5% in the study area among the adult Sidama population. This result was significantly lower among study respondents who have poor knowledge scores, divorced and widowed, lower educational levels, daily laborer and house wife. Based on this study results, the majority of the study participants agreed with providing health education is important to prevent COVID-19, to take vaccine if there is a vaccine, available information about COVID-19 in Ethiopia is sufficient and to avoid normal activities if they have one of the symptom of COVID-19 (97.9%, 85.2%, 71.7% and 75.4%, respectively).Earlier experience from the SARS virus epidemic revealed that all-embracing implementation of traditional public health measures in the lack of vaccine and antiviral management totally halt person-to-person transmission and the virus was final successful eradicated. In this closely associated virus, public adherences for such measures are important to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 by separating population to halt spread and to control the outbreak of disease. The firearm tools we have at hand are public adherence to the preventive measure such as frequent hands washing with soap, isolation of the suspected cases and quarantine, maintain social distance, use of mask in the crowded place and disinfecting frequently touched surface. All these important measures are presently being practiced at an unprecedentedly large scale in urban part [21] .Multivariable analyses of predictors revealed that odds of practice towards COVID-19 were 1.57 times higher in study participants who have positive attitude as compared to those who have negative attitude about COVID-19 (AOR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.20-2.04; P = 0.004). However, in spite of this positive association between higher attitudes with higher practice in current study, only 81.0%, 80.9%, 67.1% and 56.8% of the study respondents avoid shaking hands, Table 9 . Bi-variable and multivariable regression of association between socio-demographic and economic characteristics with the attitude scores of COVID-19 among adult population in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia, 2020.Attitude COR AORThe main occupation Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 pandemic among adult population in Sidama region stayed at their home, use cloth face mask and maintain social distance, respectively. Additional establishment and reinforcement from the Ethiopian government is needed for the converting of these positive attitudes into proper practice.Our study had several strengths. From these, the community-based nature of this study is representative of all adult population which is vital to develop important policy strategy for effective prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic. In the fact that we enrolled in a comparatively large number of study participants (n = 1,214) from different kebeles and presented proportion figures for knowledge, attitude and practice. Moreover, we tried to quantify and accounted for several potential confounders that can individually explain the association among the variables of interest. Irrespective of its strengths, this study has some fundamental limitations that might be careful while interpreting the results. Firstly, the cross-sectional nature of the study design does not precisely establish the cause and effect relationship. Secondly, the study might be liable to recall bias because, all part of the information was collected by the study participants self-report. Thirdly, there was limited studies conducted sufficiently to compare our result and the study samples were collected at the Sidama regional state in Southern Ethiopia in the present condition. Thus, it was challenging to generalize our findings across the general adult population. Upcoming studies could estimate the knowledge, attitude and practice of general adult population on a larger scale to be able to design proper interventions on a nationwide level.The results indicated that the majority of the study participants in rural Sidama regional state had demonstrated good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practice regarding COVID-19, however there are some negative attitudes and improper practice than expected to prevent and control the pandemic. Supplementary public education intervention and sensitization campaigns are needed for the study participants according to different factors (sex, marital status, occupation, educational levels and wealth status). Moreover, according to the significant positive association among knowledge, attitude, and practice in current study, public education programs, specifically aiming lower knowledge and negative attitude individuals about COVID-19, are vital for maintain proper practices. Confidently, by enhancing good knowledge and positive attitude through public health decision-makers, and the support of the Ethiopian government and the overall population, hopeful control and elimination of the COVID-19 can be expected.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find effective antiviral drugs to combat this disease.Transmissions ways and treatment results of COVID-19 paid much attention; consequently this latter was the subject of several papers [2, 3] . In this context, we can mention our previous work [4] in which we did a complete study on the properties of Niclosamide molecule using DFT calculations and molecular docking. Molecular docking is a fast and efficient method of drug discovery by testing whether existing antiviral molecules can effectively treat associated viral infections. Results reveal that the niclosamide could bind to the COVID-19 protein with high affinity and it can be a potent inhibitor against coronavirus [5] . Numerous clinical tests in China have exposed chloroquine phosphate, an aminoquinoline used in malaria treatment, to be efficient against COVID-19. In addition, hydroxychloroquine was less toxic and more soluble than chloroquine. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine increase the pH and award antiviral effects. Besides, hydroxychloroquine is favored over chloroquine due to its lower ocular toxicity.Several works were made to utilize the computational methods to screen molecules to find inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease [6] . In this context, the present work reports on the geometric optimization of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate by using the hybrid B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Then, their reactivity and behaviours were predicted at the same level of theory by using the frontier molecular orbitals. This analysis allows us to find the most reactive ligands against the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the sites of the nucleophilic and electrophilic regions of chloroquine derivatives can be clearly predicted by means of the different colors discovered on the molecular electrostatic potential surfaces mapped. All these calculations help us a lot in the biological part since the use of optimized structures of ligands is more precise in molecular docking calculations, which makes the program more reliable to be used in structure-based drug design. We proposed three crystal structures of COVID-19 viruses and we will test the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate compounds against these proteins via molecular docking calculations. Docking studies survey was made to examine and to compare the inhibition mechanism of these chloroquine derivatives against the novel coronavirus disease. So to conclude, this work aims to treat the activities of chloroquine derivatives against COVID-19 virus on the basis of certain important properties predicted by DFT method and specific molecular docking calculations.Theoretical results were determined by GaussView [7] and Gaussian programs [8] . The molecular geometries structures of chloroquine derivatives were optimised with the density functional theory (DFT). The quantum chemical calculations were done applying the functional hybrid B3LYP with 6-31G* basis set. Currently this functional correlation exchange is the most used in DFT theory. It is based on a linear combination between fractions of the exchange energy of LDA, HF and B (Becke1988). The reactivity of the chloroquine derivatives are predicted by using the differences between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals via TD-DFT approach. Density of states (DOS) plots was obtained by using TD-DFT Gaussian output via Gauss-Sum software [9] . The mapped molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) are determined at the B3LYP/6-31G* optimized geometry.The choice of our ligands was mainly based on their anti-viral activities. So, to test the biological activity of the hydroxychloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine sulfate against coronavirus diseases (Protein Data Bank [10] code: 5R7Y, 6M03 and 6LU7), partial flexible docking calculations (rigid protein-flexible ligand) analysis have been carried out using iGEMDOCK program [11] . Molecular docking analysis is a powerful tool for the detection of specific Covid-19 inhibitors, their binding requirements and the mode of ligand-protein interactions. It is a procedure that predicts the orientation of a molecule to another; it allows finding the orientation that maximizes the interaction even as minimizing the total energy score of the studied complex. In all the conditions of docking calculation, we used the settings as follows: population size is 800, the number 10 of generations is 80, and the number of solutions is 10. The docking results were viewed with the help of Discovery studio visualizer interface [12].The experimental and theoretical optimized bond distances and bond angles of chloroquine derivatives forms at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are collected in Tables S1 and S2 with Evidently, the adding of other atoms or groups in the structures of the hydroxychloroquine compound has an influence on their stability. This stability of the optimized structure was verified by the absence of any imaginary frequencies. In gas phase, the RMS Cartesian force values are found to be 0.0090 a.u and 0.0721 a.u for hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, respectively. These values are weaker in water, 0.0020 a.u for the hydroxychloroquine and 0.0015 for hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The maximum Cartesian forces values of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are equal to 0.0325 a.u and 0.2606 a.u, while the values decrease in water respectively to 0.0079 u.a and 0.0112 u.a.In this way, it can be concluded that the calculated values in water are slightly low compared to the values in the gas phase.The hydroxychloroquine sulfate possesses the strongest dipole moment (µ) compared to the hydroxychloroquine molecule. In gas, the dipole moment is of the order of 7.33 D and 11.04 D for hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, respectively. Whereas, in water, it is equal to 11.037 Debye and 29.853 Debye. These high values of the dipole moment allow the formation of the hydrogen bond interactions. Also, the dipole moment of the molecule can affect the interaction between the ligand and the receptor. Therefore, the analysis of the dipole moment gives significant information to find the suitable drug. The size of the dipole moment can reflect the polarity of the molecule. The greater dipole moment, the stronger polarity of the molecule, this promotes the diffusion and absorption of drug molecules.Optimized structures and numbering of atoms of the hydroxychloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine sulfate computed molecules are shown graphically in fig. 1 , obtained at B3LYP/6-31G* basis set. Their global minimum energies are found to be -1401.2376 a.u and -2101.4778 a.u in gas phase and -1401.2620 a.u and -2101.5608 a.u in water. Note that adding the sulfate group; the hydroxychloroquine molecule becomes more stable since the energy decreases. Their optimized geometrical parameters (bond distances and angles) of minimum energies have been determined by the above method and they are given in tables S1 and S2 with the experimental bond angles and bond lengths. DFT selected structural parameters of hydroxychloroquine are found to be in agreement with experimental data [13] . Concerning the hydrogen-carbon interactions, it varies in the range 1.084-1.103 Å.In fact, the stability comparison of the chloroquine derivatives is necessarily based on the minimum energy value found and the value of RMSD calculated. The hydroxychloroquine sulfate is initially made up of hydroxychloroquine. Of course, the adding of other atoms or groups in the structure of the hydroxychloroquine will change system properties and has an influence on their stability. Analysis of the results above has shown that adding the sulfate group makes the hydroxychloroquine more stable since the energy decreases. Also, the comparison clearly shows the increase in the dipole moment value which promotes the formation of the hydrogen bond interactions.The quantum theory AIM (Atoms-in-Molecules) is a model of quantum chemistry characterizing the chemical bond of a system based on the study of the topology of the electron density. This latter characterizes the distribution of electrons in space. The AIM approach allows us to better understand the nature of the non-covalent interactions revealed within the molecular system and precisely the strengths of the hydrogen bonds from the different topological and energetic properties. Among these properties, we can cite: the electron density (r), the Laplacian of the electron density  2 (r), the eigenvalues of the To study the different non-covalent interactions existing within the molecules, the reduced gradient of the RDG density is used.It is a dimensionless quantity and is written in the following form:We have represented, in Fig. 3 (A, B) , the reduced gradient of the density as a function of the electron density multiplied by the sign of the second eigenvalue of the matrix of Hessian. The topological analysis of the ELF function, published in 1990, was subsequently analyzed by Silvi and Savin Our goal in this work is to find the most reactive ligands against the COVID-19 virus. For these reasons, in this part, we have to determine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their properties like energy gap since they are used to provide information on the transfer of charges [19, 20] . Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are very important parameters for quantum chemistry [21] . These orbitals allow determining the manner the molecule interacts with other species. LUMO, related with the ionization potential, can be thought the most frontiers orbital having free places for accepting electrons. On the other hand HOMO, related with the electron affinity of the molecule, represents the capability to donate electrons. Therefore, studying frontiers orbitals of molecules can provide important information to explore the mechanism of action and determine the active sites [22] . Hence, the reactivity of the chloroquine derivatives is predicted by using the differences between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. it is found to be 4.500 eV (in ultimate value), while it is equal to 4.376 eV in water As everyone knows, the quantum chemical parameters of the molecule are very important for its practical application. Therefore, in this paper we calculated several quanta chemical reactivity using FMOs energies. Table 2 in water. This index represents the proportion of maximum charge that a system can acquire from its environment, or ΔNmax is maximum in water, which means that water retains more electrons in its environment than in gas.Passing to the hydroxychloroquine sulfate molecule, in gas phase the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO was found to be 4.347 eV with a chemical hardness value of 4.347 eV. It is lower in water in the order of Eg= 4.250 eV. By comparing the values of the energy differences of different phases (gas and solvent), we can conclude that the two ligands are more reactive and more stable in water. Based on the dipole moment values, we see that the dipole moment is greater in water, knowing that the larger the dipole moment, the stronger the intermolecular interactions. We also notice that the gap energy decreases by adding the sulfate group. In that case, the flow of electrons in the higher energy state is easy; therefore the molecule becomes soft and more reactive. So, from these results, we find that hydroxychloroquine sulfate is the most reactive antiviral compound compared to the other antiviral one since it has the highest transfer index and the weaker energy gap. The density of states (DOS) plots of chloroquine derivatives was also obtained in Fig. S3 by using Gauss-Sum software. These spectra describe the energy levels per unit energy increment and its composition in energy between -20 and 0 eV. The displaying analysis per orbital indicates that the red and green lines in the DOS spectrum represent the LUMO (ELUMO) and HOMO (EHOMO) levels, respectively. As expected, the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO for the two ligands is compatible with the values determined by the DOS spectra.Interactions between bio-molecules and drugs mainly include hydrogen and halogen bonds Experimental results have shown that this analysis is extremely trustworthy for drug design Between all the molecular docking conformations, the only one which confines totally atone which linked perfectly at the active place was extracted through discovery studio program for the elaborated interactions. The docking pictures of our ligands against 5R7Y, 6M03 and 6LU7 targets are given in Fig. S5 and their 2D plots are mapped in Fig. 7 . Also, we have plotted in Fig. S6 Table 3 .The implications of these results are discussed below.In this part, we explore the docking calculations of the hydroxychloroquine ligand that is interaction between the ligand and its receptor which linking to a site on its surface. This calculation allows ameliorating the identification of the interactions existing between protein and ligand. As given in Table 3 , the binding affinities values of hydroxychloroquine ligand are found to be -7.1 kcal.mol -1 (for 5R7Y), -6.6 kcal.mol -1 (for 6M03) and -6.1 kcal.mol -1 (for 6LU7).The binding mode of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is shown in Kcal/mol. The other complexes showed also an important total energy which makes them an important candidate to study. Therefore, from our study, it is confirmed that the addition of the sulfate group makes it possible to strengthen the interactions of the binding modes, as well as strengthening the inhibitors. These compounds discover reasonable and excellent antiviral activity against COVID-19 diseases. So, we can use these compounds as antibiotics to a greater extent.

The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs-32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God's punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a manmade virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. � 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23 .64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79-3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a newly emerging novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) that appeared in late 2019 disseminating to cause a global pandemic in 2020. It is related to the SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in the early 2000s in East Asia and the Middle East respectively. These viruses are of zoonotic origin with SARS-CoV2 thought to have originated in bats. They were not previously identified in humans [1] . Initially, most cases at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China had contact with live animals and seafood suggesting animal to human transmission. Later on, person to person spread was reported outside the epicenter [1] . On 31 st December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The causative virus of the disease was identified by Chinese authorities on 7th January [2] The WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11th March [2] .The symptoms of COVID-19 appear after 2-14 days following exposure and vary from asymptomatic, mild symptoms to severe respiratory disease [3] . The main symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 has a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) or <5% among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and MERS [4] both of which were not reported in Nigeria. Comorbidities among fatal cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis [4] . No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support where indicated [5] . Prevention of further spread is of high importance and people should practice frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, and covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing [6] . Until a vaccine is developed, community-based interventions such as school closure, avoiding congregations, adopting social distancing, and creating employee plans to work remotely can help slow the spread of COVID- 19 In northern Nigeria, Kano the most populous state in Nigeria recorded its first positive case on 11 th April, and as of 9 th June, there have been 1004 cases, 477 recovered with 49 deaths [9]. Lockdown was instituted in the state on 27 th April after ""unexplained deaths"" of 640 people within the span of 2 weeks [10]. Subsequently, handwashing, social distancing, and masking were made mandatory for all necessary activities in public places across the state.Kano metropolis is one of the largest in West Africa and also a hub for commercial activities with an estimated population of some 13 million [10]. It is also known for its predominantly Muslim population with many Islamic religious rites and practices requiring congregation and close human interactions e.g., prayers and pilgrimage. However, consequent to COVID-19, the Saudi-Arabian government stopped foreign Muslim pilgrims entering the country for the lesser pilgrimage (Umrah) in an attempt to curtail the spread of the disease. Furthermore, Nigeria directed prospective Umrah pilgrims to defer their plans as recommended to contain the coronavirus [11] . The nature of the virus transmission and control strategies has affected daily activities, livelihoods and liberties, as well as halting several religious obligations, traditional and socio-cultural practices among peoples in many parts of the world. In order to successfully control the pandemic, there is a need to fully understand their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP), and perceptions. Thus, in this study, we sought to explore the knowledge people have regarding COVID-19, modalities of prevention, attitude, risk perception, the practice of social distancing methods and respiratory hygiene in Kano, Nigeria. It also evaluates the predictors of good knowledge of COVID-19 as well as exploring issues of stigmatization and certain beliefs towards the virus.This was an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling.Study setting and sites. Kano is an urban metropolis located in the Northern part of Nigeria and the second-largest city in the country. The study was done in 3 major localities in Kano; Kano Municipal Local Government Area (LGA), Ungogo LGA and, Kumbotso LGA.The questionnaire was administered in three formats; the first was a paper hardcopy selfadministered questionnaire that was distributed in the urban area of Kano accounting for 32.8%, the second was by a trained research assistant interviewer administration in a semiurban locality32.4% and the last was administered as an online form accounting for 34.8% when social distancing was introduced and interviewer-/self-administration could not proceed as planned. The questionnaire was piloted on 25 random people to ensure the validity and practicability of the questions as conducted in similar studies [12] . Corrections were made and certain relevant questions were added later on as the epidemic progressed into a pandemic. The main survey questionnaire administration was conducted between 12 th March to 7 th April 2020.The questionnaire has 4-four components: the demographic data of the respondents, the knowledge of COVID-19, i.e. clinical presentation, risk factors, transmission and prevention, the attitude towards COVID-19 in regards to seeking medical attention and cultural and religious aspects e.g., closure of Mosques, the conduct of pilgrimage, funeral rites and weddings to prevent community transmission. The study started even before the first reported case in Kano and spanned to a point where a state lockdown was put into place. Some relevant questions were added as more information about the disease evolved.Coded data was imputed into MS Excel and scored. Open-ended questions were analyzed separately, scored responses were summed and used in calculating the total scores of knowledge, attitude and practice for each respondent. Cut-off marks were given that demarcate between respondents that had good knowledge, attitude and practice from those that did not. The demographic data was evaluated and summarized using the descriptive presentation. Quantitative data were presented as mean, standard deviation and inter-quartile ranges. Certain questions were analyzed using simple frequency tables. As in Mallhi et all [12] chi-square and student's t testing was used in identifying associations between variables and outcomes defined as good knowledge (GK), Good attitude (GA) and Good practice (GP) using score cut-offs of � 75%, � 86.5% and � 75% respectively. A logistic regression model was used to determine independent predictors of GK of COVID 19. The model was constructed using a forward stepwise approach using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for covariate selection. Covariates were imputed when significant at 20% in univariate analysis. The level of significance (α) was set at 0.05. Analyses was done using Stata version 11.0 (Texas, USA).Ethics approval was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Kano dated 9 th March 2020 with a reference number of MOH/Off/797/T.I/1985. The respondents were interviewed and confidentiality was maintained. All potential participants were provided information about the survey and only those who gave written consent were included in the study.A total of 1000 questionnaires were administered from 12 th March to 7 th April 2020, and 114 questionnaires were dropped due to non-response or substantial missing data. The total participants who responded were 886 persons with a mean age of 28.58yrs [SD: 10.25], median 26 yrs (IQR: 22yrs-32yrs) (Fig 1; Table 1 ). There were males (55.42%), singles (56.32%) while the rest were married or had been married previously. Of the 886, 355 participants had at least a child. Most of the participants were Muslim 93.68%, the others being Christians. Participants had Quranic education 7.2%, Primary school 6.5%, secondary 38.9% and tertiary education 57.34%; out of the latter, 353 respondents were students receiving University education ( Of the 886 participants, the other modes of transmissions mentioned included-breathing infected air (77.4%), animal-to-human (52.0%), animal to animal (20.4%), human to human (88.6%), environment to human (71.4%), contact with infected surfaces or objects (85%), contact with saliva, nasal secretions, excreta, feces, and fomites of an infected person(75.4%) and contact with live animal markets (34.3%).The Only about 57% of the respondents thought COVID-19 was preventable and 22.8%% mentioned coughing into one's hand as a preventive measure.Of the 886 respondents, the following agreed with these preventive measures: use of face mask (84%), coughing into one's hands (22.8%), coughing into one's elbows (67.38%), regular hand washing (89%), use of hand sanitizers (89.62%), travel restrictions to high-risk areas (72.3%) and avoiding touching one's face with hands (69%).In regards to attitude to religious norms, 689 [77.77%] agreed on the cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 209 [23.64%] admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing recommendations and another 38.4% insisted on attending funeral rites. The respondents (60%) attributed the pandemic as a form of God's wrath and 36% thought it to be a man-made virus. Fifty-four percent (54%) responded that it was a result of increasing contact between humans and animals. As regards to social stigma, about a fourth of the respondents [25.1%] said they would not associate with a person who was discharged after testing negative for the virus while 88% would report a suspected case of COVID 19 to the appropriate authorities. When rating fear on a Likert scale, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. � 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% of respondents stating they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In regards to respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, 51% said they regularly washed their hands and 60% said they avoided congested places. Two-thirds (66.6%) said they used their hand to cover their mouth when coughing though only 20% sometimes used facemask since the onset of the pandemic.Higher proportions of participants with GK were older, married or previously married and responded using a paper questionnaire. Tertiary education was negatively associated with GK while gender had no relationship to it ( Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were married or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19 and had modified their habits in the last 3 months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor (Table 4 ).This survey conducted in northern Nigeria with predominantly Muslim populations found that less than a third of the participants had GK, GA and GP towards control of COVID-19. It shows advanced or tertiary education and online administration of the questionnaire did not predict GK though current or prior marriage appeared to predict it. Similarly, a significant proportion persisted in their attitudes and practices towards Islamic religious and socio-cultural traditions despite social distancing recommendations. The survey also found one in four persons still harbored stigma towards affected persons even following recovery from the disease.We found that less than a third of the participants had good KAP scores despite half of them having tertiary education an unexpected ironic finding. The majority knew the causative organism was a virus that primarily affects the lungs and identified breathing infected air as a means of transmission. About half of them were aware of the zoonotic nature of the disease but fewer participants recognized contact with bats as a means of transmission. Only about a third said the disease originated from live animal markets. Half of our respondents said they got their source of information from social media perhaps a reflection of their educational background. About 43% said they also got their information from radio channels while a quarter said they got it from HCWs. This should be noted in planning subsequent community sensitizations and enlightenment. Similarly, overall knowledge of personal prevention such as hand washing with soap and water, using facemasks and avoiding touching one's face was good. Unfortunately, appropriate knowledge did not always influence good attitude or practice. However, most respondents [62.2%] agreed with the cancellation of Hajj pilgrimage, one of the fundamentals of Islam, to control the pandemic and prevent further spread of the virus. Nearly a quarter of respondents said they would go ahead, despite social distancing, to attend a wedding ceremony despite over half of them (58%) having GK. We also explored religious obligations and prayers that Muslims attend and found that 38%, 42%, 49% would still go ahead and attend burial rites, Eid prayer and Friday prayer respectively despite existing lockdown measures. These practices predispose the Muslim society to mass community transmission especially since funerals are promptly conducted following a person's death. However, it appears likely that the risk of transmission is present among those who perform the ritual washing of corpses of infected persons [13] .Additionally, the paper questionnaire respondents were more knowledgeable than online respondents with 90% of people that had GK having had paper questionnaires administered by a trained assistant. This could be due to keyboard psychology, a concept where people online do not feel the need to answer questions correctly due to a degree of anonymity that the computer offers. With the face-to-face interaction of paper-based questionnaire, respondents would be more likely to take time to fill it diligently.Gender did not have any effect on the degree of knowledge, but increasing age was found to be beneficial in unadjusted analysis. Single individuals were found to have poorer knowledge when compared to respondents who had were married or were ever married. In comparison to non-healthcare workers, HCWs had modified their habits in the preceding three months. Over two-thirds of respondents agreed to accept a vaccine if developed with 80% responding that they would pay for it if not publicly funded.The current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma and discriminatory behaviors against people of certain ethnic backgrounds as well as anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus. Stigma can undermine social cohesion and prompt possible social isolation of groups, which might contribute to further disease spread. This can result in more severe health problems and difficulties in controlling the pandemic [14] . More than a third of respondents stated certain races were more at risk of contracting the virus and a fourth harbored lasting stigma. More needs to be done to address such misinformation with correct health information as part of risk communications. It seems that every outbreak comes with its misconception and myths which is further propagated via social media. During the Ebola outbreak in which Nigeria was also affected, at least two lives were lost from drinking salt and water concoctions. This was believed by many to be a form of cure [15] . Across Africa, rumors have been rife that COVID-19 does not affect black people. Another myth was the overzealous intake of vitamin C and Chloroquine would prevent a person from becoming infected which remains unconfirmed [16] . Many conspiracy theories were adduced to COVID-19's origin particularly in northern Nigeria. Indeed, 36% said that COVID 19 is man-made, 60% said that it was a result of God's punishment, 18% said that it was an agent of bioterrorism and 54% said increasing contact between humans and animals was responsible. While the proliferation of computers, tablets, and smartphones in the West African sub-region provide channels for the rapid dissemination of information through the internet and social media, the risk of mixing facts with misinformation via these unregulated platforms remains a problem [17] . These findings all support the need for more communication, engagement of communities and local leaders in the promotion of adherence to strict social distancing methods. Religious leaders should be enlightened about the scale of the pandemic and its consequences. Knowledge of transmission of the virus should be communicated clearly and several misconceptions should be clarified and rumors promptly dispelled. Having COVID 19 survivors as 'champions' and 'exemplars' who talk about their experience will add to the strength of the argument that COVID 19 is real and affecting real people especially in conservative societies such as northern Nigeria.This study does have limitations given the pace of changing facts and information about COVID 19. Secondly, lockdown measures were instituted middle of data collection, hence the creation of the online format of the questionnaire which may have changed the respondents' approach to answering questions. Furthermore interviewer effect was not adequately controlled for in the analysis although the logistic regression would have controlled for confounding between imputed covariates. Thirdly, though the study provides essential insight into gaps in knowledge, attitude and practice, the findings, however, should not be generalized as the study was conducted in a sub-Saharan African setting. However, the sample studied is highly likely representative of the Nigerian population.Since the beginning of our work, several studies of variable sizes have been published on the knowledge, attitude and practice, and perceptions relating to COVID-19. Many of the studies were cross-sectional surveys and were conducted in various populations such as the general public, health care workers, pharmacists, dentists and undergraduate or postgraduate students [18] [19] [20] [21] . The modality for questionnaire administration varied from intervieweradministered, self-administered to online self-administration [22] similar to all the three approaches used in our survey. Most studies were conducted in industrialized countries revealing mass media played key roles in higher levels of knowledge, better attitudes and practices [18] [19] [20] 23] . Fewer studies have also been conducted in predominantly black African populations e.g., Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda [24] [25] [26] and also in countries with predominantly Muslim populations e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt and Saudi-Arabia [27] [28] [29] [30] , with a binational survey conducted in Egypt and Southern Nigeria [28] . As in our study, the results of the surveys generally showed lower levels of knowledge among respondents in developing countries with respondents being less satisfied with their countries' levels of preparedness towards control of COVID-19 [28] . As in our study, some reports also highlighted the problem of conspiracy theories, discrimination, stigma and xenophobic attitudes especially early in the pandemic and among HIV-infected populations [22, 26, 31] . Our study is the first conducted in a predominantly Muslim area of Nigeria and confirmed lower levels of knowledge. Uniquely the study also highlighted the levels of communal acceptance and likely compliance to intervention measures that restrict Islamic religious rites and practices e.g., Hajj pilgrimage, Muslim congregational prayer, etc. Overall most reviewed studies recommended the need for better and more reliable information and public education [32] .In conclusion Knowledge of COVID-19 is sub-optimal and knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study also highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19. ","Nigeria","abstract","2021-01-14",1

We also noted whether the study accounted for 125 asymptomatics, pre-symptomatics, both asymptomatics and pre-symptomatics, or none of these classes of 126 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f play in the transmission of the disease (He et al., 2020). When the study made predictions, we further recorded the date at which the predicted values of the number of cumulative cases will be observed, and the uncertainty 130 parameters around the predictions (95% Confidence Interval -CI or 95% Credibility Interval -CrI). The data 131 analyses considered three aspects. The first aspect was related to the geographical coverage (continents and 132 number of countries covered per continent) and topics addressed in the studies, whether the modelling was data-133 driven and include symptomatics, pre-symptomatics, or not; we used count and relative frequencies to describe 134 this trend. The second aspect was related to the modelling techniques and was also addressed using count and 135 relative frequencies after grouping modelling techniques in relatively similar groups. The third aspect was the 136 accuracy and precision of the predictions made by studies. Accuracy refers to how close a prediction is to the 137 true value but precision refers to how certain is the prediction (Stallings & Gillmore, 1971) . For this, we used 138 three parameters; the first is the ratio between the value predicted and the value actually observed on the day on 139 which the prediction was made. This ratio is a measure of accuracy of the prediction. A value close to 1 indicates 140 that the prediction was accurate. Values less or larger than one indicates underestimation or overestimation, 141 respectively. The second parameter which is a measure of precision was the ratio between the amplitude of the 142 uncertainty parameter (95% CI or 95% CrI) and the central value. For studies that used statistical methods, the 143 uncertainty parameter is the 95% CI. For studies which used Bayesian methods, the 95% CrI is the uncertainty 144 parameter. The uncertainty parameters indicate that given the observed data, the prediction has 95% probability 145 of falling within this range. This ratio is an estimate of the accuracy of the predictions. A value of 1 for this ratio 146 indicates that the amplitude is larger as the central value. Smaller values indicate more accurate prediction (i.e. countries out of the 44) of European countries with Italy (39 studies), France (25 studies) and Spain (22 studies) 160 being the countries where more studies were done. From our sampled studies, 40 focused on African countries 161 either at country level (9 in Nigeria, 7 in South Africa) or region level (i.e. west, east, north, south, or central), or 162 the whole continent level. Some studies did not focus on a specific country but on an entire continent or part of Confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) are essential measurements of precision in parameter 299 estimations. As an indicator of precision, the ratio of the amplitude of the 95% CI or 95% CrI and the predicted 300 value was calculated to also assess reliability of the predicted values. Overall, very few studies have reported CI 301 or CrI. Only 5.79% of studies (14 out of 242) have reported CI or CrI for the predicted number of cumulative (95%) (Fig. 6a) . This ratio seems relatively lower for statistical models compared to compartmental models,indicating relatively more precise predictions for statistical models (Fig. 6b) . However, this difference cannot be 305 confirmed statistically since the compartmental, and the statistical models were used for 4, and 13 predictions 306 respectively, that we judged not enough for a robust statistical significance test. More data would be needed to 307 better make this comparison. Including either asymptomatics, or pre-symptomatics or none of these classes in the 308 modelling does not seem to affect the precision of the predictions (Fig. 6c) . There was not enough information in 309 our dataset to compare this ratio between models parameterized on real data and models that were not 310 parameterized on real data (Fig. 6d) . This ratio decreases with the length of the period (in number of days) 311 covered by the data used for the estimation, although it was not significant (linear regression analysis: β = -312 0.001; p-value = 0.242, Fig. 6e ). The third parameter of reliability was based on the 95% CI or CrI provided for each prediction of the number of 322 cumulative cases. This parameter checked whether the true value (i.e. the value actually observed for the 323 prediction) is within the 95% CI or CrI provided for the prediction (Fig. 7) . Fig. 7 shows a graphical 324 representation of the cross-tabulation of the number of predictions that presented a 95% CI or CrI (20 in total) 325 and whether or not the value actually observed belongs to the 95% CI or CrI. This figure shows that 75% (15 out 326 20) of the values actually observed were within the 95% CI or CrI provided for the prediction. 65% of these (13 327 out 20) were predictions made based on statistical models (Fig. 7) . predicted over the actual number of cumulative deaths was lower or close to 1 (Fig. 8a) . One prediction largely 336 exceeded (more than 6 times) the actual number of deaths (Fig. 8a) . This ratio seems to be relatively lower (and 337 also lower than 1) for Bayesian models than for statistical models where this ratio was large than one, thus 338 suggesting relatively more accurate predictions with Bayesian models (Fig. 8b) , although these differences are 339 only suggestive due to the small size of the data. A greater number of predictions than we found in this study 340 would be needed for robust significance test. Whether the models included asymptomatic or pre-symptomatics 341 individuals does not seem to affect this ratio (Fig. 8c) . Nevertheless, there was a significant negative correlation 342 between this ratio and the number of days of the first infection in the target country, suggesting that the more 343 data used to make the estimates cover a large period of time, the more accurate the estimates tend to be (Fig. 8d) . Among the above nine studies, seven reported the 95% CI or CrI for their predications and they made ten 353 predictions of the number cumulative deaths (Fig. 9a) . For six of the ten predictions (60%), the ratio of the 354 amplitude of the 95% CI or CrI over the predicted number of cumulative deaths was lower than 1 (Fig. 9a) . Twopredictions had values between 4 and 7 for this ratio (Fig. 9a) . There was no evidence of difference for this ratio 356 among categories of models, nor according to whether the models considered asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic 357 individuals (Fig. 9 b, c) . There was also no correlation of this ratio with the length of period of time, the more 358 accurate the estimates tend to be (Fig. 9d) . ","Benin","first author","2021-01-12",1

The study area was at JMC. JMC is one of the oldest hospitals in Ethiopia, and the only teaching and referral hospital in southwest Ethiopia. It has an 800-bed capacity and a catchment population of over 15 million people. More than 400,000 patients can be served at emergency, outpatient departments, and various inpatient units per budget year.The volunteer HCWs who served a health institute for a minimum of 1 year, working in JMC, and ≥18 years of age during the study period were eligible to participate in the study.The survey populations were HCWs, such as clinical nurses, pharmacists, academicians, medical laboratory technologists, physicians, dental doctors, and midwives, working in JMC. The sample frame was HCWs who were on duty at JMC during the study period. The study participants were all HCWs who were on duty in the months of data collection and agreed to participate in the study. The response rate was low due to data collection was paper-based, and it can be the means of COVID-19 virus transmission. Therefore, the sample size was only 96 HCWs. The convenience sampling method was used based on the HCWs' availability at the work area and willingness to participate in the study.Data collection was done with well structured, pretested, and self-administered English questionnaire. The self-reported questionnaire included questions prepared on participant demographics, HH by ABHSs' knowledge, attitudes, practices, and challenges on performing it. It was developed by using the WHO guidelines and other references. [9] [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The data collectors were four trained health professionals. They were trained on the objectives of the study and the contents of the data collection checklist. The submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2021 :14 voluntary participants who agreed to cooperate with the study were asked for verbal agreement. Then, data collectors delivered a developed data collection checklist to the study participants when they were at the work area and collected it soon after filled. Strict supervision by the principal investigators was conducted during data collection to prevent selection bias.The study participants' knowledge, attitude, practice, and common challenges of HH by ABHSs were assessed and described using qualitative terms of self-evaluation. The self-reported questionnaires were developed from previous studies.The self-reported knowledge of the respondents about ABHSs for COVID-19 prevention was evaluated by using terms like agree, disagree, and not know the approved facts. Then, the respondents were categorized as knowledgeable and not knowledgeable. The study participant who agreed with the facts on the WHO guidelines on HH in health care (received 1 point) and replied correctly (agree) ≥50% of the knowledge questions were considered as knowledgeable. [9] [10] [11] [12] 15 The attitude questionnaire aimed mainly at studying the attitude of HCW towards methods of improvement of handwashing practice in their workplace. For attitude description, terms like strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree were used. The study participants who agreed or strongly agreed to the facts listed on the WHO guidelines (received 1 point) and replied ≥50% of the attitude questions correctly were considered as having a good attitude. Those who replied neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree with the facts listed on the WHO guidelines (received 0 point) and responded <50% correctly (agreed or strongly agreed) were considered as having a poor attitude. 9, 10, 17 For evaluation of self-reported hand hygiene practices or compliance, five questions were developed based on WHO's 'My five moments for hand hygiene (before patient contact, before clean/aseptic procedures, after the risk of body fluids, after patient contact, and after contact with patient surroundings). 9 Respondents were asked to choose from five options-always, often, sometimes, seldom, or never.The study participants who believe that they always practice ABHS for HH at the five essential moments (received 1 point) and correctly (always) replied ≥50% of the compliance questions were considered as compliant.And those who practice ABHS often, sometimes, seldom, or never (received 0 point) and responded <50% correctly (always) were considered as non-compliant. 17, 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] 25, 26 A higher score in each domain (knowledge, practice, and attitude) indicated greater knowledge, more frequent performance, and better attitudes.For the assessment of challenges to the practice of HH by ABHSs at the five essential moments in health care, according to the recommended handwashing practice, were evaluated. The questions were developed using related references were used. 14,23-26After the pretest, the questionnaires were revised for clarity and consistency. All filled questionnaires were checked regularly for completeness individually.Data entry, data checking, and data analysis were done with the program Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. The level of significance was set at 5% (p< 0.05). Descriptive statistics for socio-demographic characteristics, hand hygiene knowledge level, and hand hygiene practices of the respondents were reported. Categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages and presented in a table, figure, and paragraph.Before the commencement of the study, the written proposal was presented to Jimma University Institutional Review Board for approval. The Institutional Review Board evaluated the document and waived the requirement for the documentation of written informed consent and allowed investigators to obtain verbal informed consent. Then, before the administration of the questionnaire, the data collectors explained all pertinent information (purpose, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation, etc.) for study participants and allowed them the opportunity to ask questions. Then, verbal agreement to participate in the research was obtained from the volunteers, and data collected. The collected data were kept confidential and maintained locked throughout the study. Only the principal investigators and co-authors had access to the data. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Academician: Health professionals giving health services in JMC and/or academic activity at Jimma University Hand hygiene: a behavior of cleaning the hands with soap and water and by hand-rubbing using hand sanitizer without waterHandwashing: washing hands with plain or antimicrobial soap and water Knowledge: having an adequate understanding of hand hygiene.• Knowledgeable: earning a score of 50% and above on the knowledge questions indicating having a sufficient amount of knowledge • Not knowledgeable: earning score of less than 50% on the knowledge questions Practice: an act of performing a given procedure(s) according to a set standard.• Good practice: study participants who responded to the practice questions ≥50% in line with the recommended handwashing practice • Poor practice: study participants who responded to the practice questions <50% in line with the recommended handwashing practiceAttitude: the belief of the respondents towards the facts on the WHO guidelines on HH in health care.• Good/favorable attitude: those who agree and strongly agree to the facts and responded ≥50% correctly to the attitude questions • Poor attitude: who responded <50% correctly the attitude questionsOf the total JMC HCWs on duty in the months of data collection, 96 of them have participated in this study. Majority of the respondents were clinical nurses 27 (28.1%); followed by pharmacists 21 (21.9%), academicians 15 (15.6%), medical laboratory technologists 13 (13.5%), physicians 7 (7.3%), dental doctors 7 (7.3%) and midwives 6 (6.3%), respectively. Their mean age was 28.69±4.048 years (Table 1 ). Following the outbreak of COVID-19, 39 (40.6%) of them were taken training on the measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, all the study participants have been at the forefront of the fight against this extremely contagious infectious disease. All of them were using different COVID-19 prevention methods. None of them were using a single method only (Table 2) .To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs generally considered and practiced HH by ABHSs and handwashing with soap and water as an effective intervention. However, they had a different level of knowledge about HH by ABHS (Table 3) .To keep the quality, safety, and effectiveness of ABHS, the respondents had a different level of knowledge on storage condition selection before and after use ( Figure 1 ). According to the present study, most of the study participants got information about the use of ABHS to prevent COVID-19 and its storage condition from the mass media 71 (74%); followed by books and published journals 33 (34.4%), discussion with co-workers 26 (27.1%), presence of posters for HH in the work area 14 (14.6%) and seminars conducted occasionally at hospital level 11 (11.5%).According to the participants' reply to questions used to evaluate the attitude, the entire study participants had favorable attitudes toward HH by ABHSs (Table 4 ).Following the WHO's current recommendation, compliance with ABHS uses at the five essential moments for HH per a single care sequence by HCWs had a gap and needed a concern ( Table 5) .Most of the study participants (63 (65.6%)) are compliant with the ABHS duration of hand sanitizer recommended by the WHO (20-40 seconds). 15 The others were non-compliant to the WHO recommendation (<20 sec= 29 (30.2%), >40 sec= 4(4.1%)).The present study finding showed that the majority of the respondents reported difficulties that might hinder the frequent and effective use of ABHR according to recommended by the WHO (Table 6 ). Following its outbreak, the alarmingly spread of COVID-19 is becoming a major global threat. Mainly HCWs are one of the highly exposed groups and had the likelihood of acquiring this disease. During the study period, there is no treatment discovered and no vaccine supply in Ethiopia. So to stay safe, HCWs practice prevention measures as the best solution. Therefore, effective prevention can be achieved through increasing their knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 prevention and solving the challenges. The current study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, practice, and challenges of HCWs regarding COVID-19 prevention and control. The survey data of this study demonstrated that all of the enrolled HCWs were using different prevention techniques. Commonly, they used hand hygiene ( Table 2 ). The results might reveal that HCWs were practicing WHO recommended prevention techniques and had information on the global health crisis of COVID-19. 2, 19 The reasons for these positive results might include: the respondents' educational status, their exposure to a lot of information about COVID-19 through different media, their responsibility to adhere to scientifically accepted and evidence-based principles of infection control, and the time of data collection period were during the pandemic got the attention.The current study demonstrated that most of the HCWs were preferred and using ABHS with different justifications. The majority (93.8%) of the respondents had good knowledge about HH by ABHS uses to prevent and control the spreading of COVID-19 (Table 3) . These results support recommendations reported by WHO 15 The current study revealed that the answers to the following questions find comparatively more deficiency in the awareness of the respondents. The questions were using ABHS for HH is less time-consuming, efficient, convenient, and causes more skin dryness than handwashing with water and soap. Also, fewer than 75% of the study participants were aware of the standard storage condition recommended by the WHO (Figure 1 ). Therefore, HH education programs should be promptly re-viewed, and train-ing programs should be developed and implemented.In the present study, univariate (binary logistic regression) analysis indicated that HCWs' knowledge about HH by ABHS was not statistically associated with the sex difference (COR 0.552; 95% CI 0.105-2.894; P= 0.482) and years spent in a healthcare setting (COR 0.618; 95% CI 0.068-5.580; P =0.668). Multivariate analysis showed that HCWs who took training on COVID-19 prevention techniques were more than three times knowledgeable than untrained (AOR 3.65; 95% CI 0.41-32.56; P= 0.246) ( Table 7 ).In the present study, most of the respondents (74%) had a favorable attitude towards their knowledge and practice of HH, mainly by ABHSs and the requirement of ABHSs in the work area. A similar finding was reported by a study done in a tertiary hospital, South West Nigeria (2011). 17 The similarities might be due to the similar educational status and awareness of the study populations and similarities of the information. However, most of the respondents felt that their HH practice needed improvement. Some perception-related items that won relatively low scores should therefore be strengthened to maintain good HH.According to this study's results, univariate or multivariate statistical analysis (accordingly) showed that study participants' differences in sex (p=0.96), age (p=0.39), years spent in a healthcare setting (p=0.57), and current education level (p=0.35) did not have a statistically significant association with their attitude towards HH by ABHS (Table 7) . Although not statistically significant, respondents considered knowledgeable had a better attitude to ABHS than not knowledgeable (COR 0.676; 95% CI 0.118-4; P= 0.676).The results of the current study showed that the majority of study participants (76%) were in line with the WHO suggested procedures. It showed more compliance to ABHS use at the five moments for hand hygiene than with other studies conducted at the University of Gondar teaching hospitals (2019) 23 and in a tertiary university hospital in Istanbul (2014). 24 The reason for this discrepancy might be due to the difference in sample size and study time. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 may contribute to HCWs' awareness of ABHS use.Furthermore, self-evaluation of HH by ABHS showed that the lowest compliance was reported at using ABHS before touching a patient and before a clean procedure. This result of the present study (before touching a patient) was in line with the finding of a study conducted by Li et al (2015) in Inner Mongolia, China. 27 The similarity might be due to similar educational status and awareness of the study populations.The current study showed that compliance to HH by ABHS did not statistically vary with respondents' age, taking training, current education level (Table 7) . In univariate analysis, non-compliance with HH was not significantly associated with sex (COR 1.101; 95% CI 0.413-2.935; P= 0.848). This finding agrees with a study conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (2015). 25 It might be due to not a sufficient number of samples were used to identify the association.In multivariate analysis, there was a statistical association between compliance to the five moments of HH recommended by WHO and attitude towards HH by ABHS (AOR 2.974; 95% CI 1.093 −8.093; P= 0.033). As a result, those who had a positive attitude had more than two times more compliance than the others. But there was no difference in compliance due to knowledge of ABHS use and compliance to practice it accordingly (COR 0.286; 95% CI 0.053-1.526; P= 0.143). This finding is not consistent with a study conducted in the Central Gondar Zone public primary hospitals, where knowledgeable study participants are 6.74 times more compliant than those with poor knowledge. The difference might be due to the sample size issue and study time (COVID-19 pandemic time). A complex interplay of cognitive, socioeconomic, and technical factors may determine hand-washing practice among hospital-based HCWs. In this study, self-reported reasons for frequent lack of compliance to ABHS use included the following: lack of ABHS, increasing cost, experienced health risks, forgetting wearing the glove, and others. Lack of ABHS and increasing cost were the most common (Table 6 ). This finding is in line with a study conducted in Ruth K.M. Pfau Civil Hospital, Karachi (2019), 26 but higher than a result from the study conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Istanbul (2014). 24 The difference should be due to the more consumption of ABHS, in the healthcare setting and community, during the study period. During this study period, there was an outbreak and rapid prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic.According to the present study, most study participants experienced different health risks, commonly skin dryness, skin irritation, unpleasant taste, ocular irritation, cough, gastrointestinal disturbances, and others. This result agrees with a study conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (2015) 25 and Inner Mongolia, China (2015) 27 These risks become one of the reasons for not adhering to the WHO recommended ""My five moments for hand hygiene"" to use ABHS by 8 (8.5%) respondents.The present study characterized the HH knowledge, attitudes, and challenges of performing HH by ABHS and identified gaps that are essential to control outbreaks . It provided substantial evidence to facilitate the development and implementation of an action plan for strengthening the program for the proper use of ABHS to prevent the risks. These data also showed the need for training to enhance compliance with the use of ABHS. Furthermore, the data can be used for further analysis by the scientific community.This study is subject to limitations. As this study was not observational, this study has some limitations in terms of the self-reporting of HH performance and volunteer bias. What the study participants respond can be different from what they practice in real-life situations. Additionally, the number of study participants was not sufficient to distinguish statistically significant results and may be challenging to generalize the findings of the study.Most HCWs performed HH by ABHS to prevent and monitor the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Most of them had good self-reported knowledge and attitude toward using ABHS. There was no clear evidence showing a disparity in HCW's knowledge and attitude towards using ABHS for HH due to sex and years of experience difference. However, study participants considered as knowledgeable had a favorable attitude towards HH by ABHS. Additionally, those who took training on COVID-19 prevention techniques had more than three times knowledgeable than untrained. Also, most of the respondents adopted the HH practice by ABHS at the five essential moments recommended by the WHO. The level of compliance significantly depends on years spent in the healthcare setting. Furthermore, the lack of ABHS and the increase in its cost were reported as the most common reasons for not using ABHS as needed. Additionally, reported skin irritation, unpleasant taste, and skin dryness as ABHS health risks were reported and may contribute to the compliance problem. Generally, there were some knowledge, attitude, and practice evaluation items with relatively low scores that showed some room for improvement.The present study identified the vital gaps of HCWs' knowledge and attitude, and non-compliance on certain occasions, as well as challenges to the success of HH by ABHS according to WHO guidelines. They warranted some room for improvements. Therefore, the authors suggested multiple strategies (multimodal and multidisciplinary approach). So the regular and public bodies should catalyze local production and supply of low irritating ABHSs (containing emollients) according to the WHO guideline, systemic and advanced HH training programs to enhance awareness, promote compliance, and behavioral change toward HH.ABHS, alcohol-based hand sanitizer; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HH, hand hygiene; HCW, healthcare worker; JMC, Jimma Medical Center.The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.

The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In the past 6 months the virus has rapidly spread to all regions with a total of 9,347,168 confirmed cases and 478,888 deaths as of 22 June 2020 [1] .The first COVID-19 case was reported in South Africa on 5 March 2020. By 22 June, 2020, South Africa had the highest burden of COVID-19 cases in the African region with 101,590 reported cases and 1991 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths. The South African government declared a national state of disaster on 15 March 2020 and commenced a state of lockdown from 26 March 2020 in an effort to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the country [2] . During this period all international and inter-provincial borders were closed, as well as all schools and several economic sectors in the country. In addition to these changes, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as the mandatory use of fabric masks, contact tracing and community testing were implemented across the country. As of June 2020, the country adopted a COVID-19 risk-adjusted strategy with a phased reopening of selected economic sectors and schools. Due to the unprecedented nature of the situation, the uncertainties about the disease and the need to make informed policy decisions, modelling has taken centre stage in supporting key policy discussions surrounding COVID-19 in South Africa [3] . To date, the models that have been applied to the South African COVID-19 outbreak have focused on understanding the potential effects of interventions and policies based on SEIR-type models. These models are a common epidemiological modelling technique that divides a population into several compartments according to infection status (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed). Based on assumptions about the disease process, public health policies, demographic and mixing patterns among individuals in the population a set of differential equations governing how individuals in the population transition from one compartment to another, are defined and solved. Although these models are useful in understanding the effect of different factors on the transmission process and possible intervention strategies, they are sensitive to the assumptions made and require a deep understanding of the disease being modelled. The South African National COVID-19 Modeling Consortium [4] , for example, assumed the following in their SEIR model: 75% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, the time from onset to infectiousness is 4 days (2•0-9•0), a 5 day duration of infectiousness from onset of symptoms; a mean of 9 days (8•0-17•0) between the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission. Based on these assumption and model structure, it was predicted (June 12, 2020) that the number of detected cases (assuming the current detection rate of June 12) was 185,000 (89,500 -358,000) and 278,000 (132,000 -535,000) for the 29th of June and the 6th of July 2020, respectively. The observed number of cases corresponding to these dates were 144,264 and 205, 721, respectively.An alternative modelling approach, which is more robust and notably simpler (as it is not necessarily required to make assumptions about the transmission process) is that of phenomenological models. These non-linear epidemiological models have previously been applied to model other disease outbreaks such as Ebola [5] , Dengue [6] , Zika virus [7] and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Roosa and colleagues fitted the generalized logistic model, Richards model and a sub-epidemic model to the cumulative COVID-19 cases in the Hubei province of China and the rest of China (excluding the Hubei province) and produced a short-term forecast of 5, 10 and 15 days ahead [8] . The authors expanded on this work using the same modelling approach for the provinces of Guandong and Zheijang [9] . In recent analysis a similar approach was taken to estimate the key epidemic parameters for all 11 provinces in China as well as 9 selected countries [10] . All the aforementioned papers have only focused on modelling cumulative COVID-19 cases. It can be argued, however, that both COVID-19 cases as well as COVID-19 deaths are of key importance in modelling the burden of COVID-19.In using phenomenological models careful consideration needs to be given to the predictions emanating from all of the models fitted as such models could be used to support interventions on containing an epidemic. Generally authors select models on one of two key phenomenological modelling approaches: model selection and model averaging [7] . The former consists of selection of the model with the best goodness of fit to the data (and predicting the number of cases and epidemiological parameters of interest based on the selected model) and the latter uses information from a collection of models fitted to the data for prediction and estimation. The latter approach is a robust method to handle model uncertainty, particularly when there are several models which provide similar fits to the observed data. In the current paper and in the context of COVID-19 in Sub Saharan Africa we advocate the use of a sensitivity analysis approach for short (and long) term prediction of the number of cases.In this paper we present (1) South Africa's COVID trajectory to the first 100,000 (22 June 2020) cases and (2) fit a series of non-linear growth models, calibrated to COVID-19 cumulative number of reported case data from 5 March 2020 to 22 June 2020. The models are used to produce short term predictions of the number of reported cases expected for a period of 30 days ahead. These forecasts are generated at the national level as well as at the provincial level for the three highest burden provinces (Western Cape, Gauteng, and Eastern Cape). In view of the strong dependence of the number of detected COVID-19 cases and the number of tests performed, as well as the testing algorithm applied to the population, we also focus on the modelling of COVID-19 deaths, which may provide more reliable insight into the burden of the disease in South Africa. The short-term forecasts (for a period of 30 days ahead) of COVID-19 related deaths at a national level (and for selected provinces) are also studied.Modelling the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa implies modelling a dataset which is updated daily, which could affect the selection and the associated performance of the model on daily basis. Thus, while the selection of the best fitting model to the data could be critical, we illustrate the inherent analytical predictive problem of choosing a single model for predicting the future number of cases. Our point of view is that in a country such as South Africa (and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa), where there is uncertainty related to the true number of cases, a sensitivity analysis based on multiple models is necessary for both short and longterm prediction of the number of cases and epidemiological parameters of interest.Routine confirmation of cases of COVID-19 is based on amplification and detection of unique SARS CoV-2 viral nucleic acid sequences by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR), with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary [11] . A daily record of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths were extracted for the period 5 March 2020 to 22 June 2020, at national and provincial level from a publicly available data repository [12, 13] . Data from the first 110 days of the outbreak (until June 22, 2020) were used to fit the models.For the analysis presented in this paper, we follow the modelling approach presented by Roosa et al. [8, 9] and Sebrango et al. [7] and fit a set of nonlinear growth models to the total number of reported cases and deaths. We let Y(t) denote the cumulative number of cases (or deaths) at time t and μ(t) represent the expected number of reported cases at time t. For the purpose of this study, we considered five data driven non-linear growth models, namely; 3 parameter logistic; 4 parameter logistic; Gompertz and Weibull growth models, which are presented in Table 1 .The advantage of using the above models is that their mean structure μ(t) can be parametrized in terms of the growth rate, the final size and the turning point of the outbreak.For all the models, the parameter α denotes the final size of the epidemic (i.e., the total number of reported cases at the end of the epidemic), γ the per capita intrinsic growth rate of the infected population, k the exponent of the deviation from the standard logistic curve and η the turning point (i.e. the time in which the daily number of cases reach its peak and the half time of the outbreak). Specifically Wu et al. [14] state that when an epidemic follows an exponential growth at an early stage the Richards model may be more suitable and that when the growth rate slows down (after the turning point) logistic models may provide a better fit to the data.In line with approach adopted by [8, 9] , the unknown model parameters were estimated using non-linear least squares estimation. This is achieved by searching for the set of parameters that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed data and the corresponding model solution. All analysis was performed using R and SAS. For outcomes with a clear biphasic trajectory, piecewise forms of the growth curves were fitted. The optimal change point was chosen by iteratively comparing fit criteria of models with different change points, with the model with the smallest Akaike information criteria [15] selected. In provincial models, the first time point (day 1) refers to the date at which the first case was diagnosed in the specific province. To assess the accuracy of the models in predicting cases and deaths, we present the actual observed values in the forecasting period for both cases and deaths.For the analysis presented in this paper, our main interest is to use the available data from t = 1 to t = T and to forecast the total number of cases for the period T + 30 days ahead. We term the period 1 to T the estimation Table 1 Model formulation for the nonlinear models fitted to the COVID-19 outbreak data. Note that Y(t) is the daily expected cumulative number of cases and Y(t) = μ(t) + ε(t)Richardsperiod and the period from T + 1 to T + 30 the forecast (prediction period). To construct prediction intervals (within and outside the estimation period) we applied a parametric bootstrap [16] approach which was previously used to quantify parameter uncertainty and construct confidence intervals in mathematical modeling studies [17] . In this method, multiple observations are repeatedly sampled from the best-fit model in order to quantify parameter(s) and prediction uncertainty by assuming that the time series follows a Poisson distribution centered on the mean at the time points t i .The daily number of reported COVID-19 cases for the period 5 March 2020 to 22 June 2020 is presented in Fig. 1 . The growth of COVID-19 in South Africa appears to be rapid until 27 March 2020 where a total of 243 daily new cases were observed, followed by a decline in the rate of new cases. From the 28 March 2020 to 11 April 2020 the daily increase in cases was consistently below 100. From May 2020 onwards a consistent increase more than 1000 cases per day were observed with larger increments in June. The daily number of new reported COVID-19 cases and tests performed are presented in Fig. 2 . To date, a total of 1,353,176 tests have been conducted, corresponding to a testing rate of 22.816 per 1000 population. There was a significant correlation between the number of cases detected and the number of tests performed daily (Rho = 0.7759, p-value< 0.001).The cumulative COVID-19 cases are depicted separately for each of South Africa's nine provinces in Fig. 3 , where a high degree of interprovincial heterogeneity is observed. As at 22 June 2020 the province with the highest number of cases is the Western Cape with 52554 cases, followed by Gauteng and Eastern Cape with 22341 and 16895 cases respectively.The total deaths reported from the 27 March to 22 June 2020 is presented in Fig. 4 . In total 1991 COVID-19 related deaths were reported in this period with an overall case fatality rate of 1.96%. The first death was observed in the Western Cape (WC), followed by KwaZulu Natal (KZN), Free State (FS) and Gauteng Province (GP). Eastern Cape (EC) recorded their first death on the 16 April 2020. Initially WC contributed the most to the deaths as it was the epicentre. The other provinces curves' exhibit patterns that are indicative of irregular reporting, as increases occurred in steps.The models described in the previous section were all considered for modeling cumulative cases, with only models resulting in convergence further reported on in the tables. The Richards model, 3 and 4 parameter logistic models were fitted to the total number of reported COVID-19 cases at national level. The parameter estimates for the different models are presented in Supplementary Table 1 . As mentioned in the previous section, our main interest is to produce a short term forecast for the number of reported cases and deaths. As depicted from the short-term forecasts for the three models fitted to cases (see Fig. 5 , Table 2 ), all three models appear to fit the observed data (within the estimation period) well with the 3 parameter and 4 parameter logistic models providing very similar predictions over the 30-day ahead period. The Short-term forecasts of the total number of reported COVID-19 casesa province level analysisAs presented in Fig. 3 , the outbreak in different provinces does not follow the same pattern and at the time that this analysis was conducted (June 22, 2020) three provinces (Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Gauteng) were responsible for 90.3% of the total diagnosed cases in South Africa. In this section we present a similar modeling approach implemented to a province-specific COVID-19 cumulative case trajectory for the three highest burden provinces. Of the four models fitted to the Western Cape, namely the 3 and 4 parameters logistic, Weibull and Richards model, the model which provided the best fit to the data is the 3 parameter logistic regression model. Due to the significantly slower growth rate of the outbreaks in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng from March, 2020 until 22 June 2020, piecewise growth models were fitted to capture this change point. The model which provided the best fit to the Eastern Cape data is the 3-parameter logistic model with a change point in the growth rate at day 80 (8 June 2020). Similarly, a piecewise 3 parameter logistic model was fitted to the Gauteng data with a change point at day 87 day (1 June 2020). The 30-day forecast of COVID-19 cases, in 5-day intervals, is presented for each province in Table 3 As previously mentioned, the total number of cases is highly correlated to the total number of tests conducted and therefore can be a misleading indicator to the outbreak progression. For that reason, modelling the total number of COVID-19 related deaths is of interest. We considered all the models described in Table 1 in the modeling of COVID-19 deaths. However, only the 3PL, Richards model and Gompertz model resulted in convergence and are subsequently reported on. The parameter estimates and fit criteria for each of the models fitted are presented in Supplementary Table A2 . According to the AIC, within the estimation period, the Richards model provided the best fit to the cumulative COVID-19 deaths at the national level. As with the total number of cases, the Richards model seems to flatten out prematurely and therefore, although it fitted the data better according to the AIC, the 3PL forecasts are used in subsequent interpretation. The 30-day forecast of COVID-19 deaths, at 5-day intervals, is presented in Table 4 . The predicted number of deaths on the 26 June 2020 (5 day forecast) is 2336 (2219.4-2457.2), and the total deaths is expected to be 2700 (2534.7-2883.6) as at 1 July 2020. The 30-day forecast is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty with 3775 (3346.3-4435.1) deaths prediction. We notice that the 3PL model provides smaller predictions compared to the Gompertz model but higher predictions compared to the Richards models. Figure 6 shows the observed deaths and the predictions obtained from the fitted models, as well as the superimposed reported deaths for the period 23 June to 4 July 2020. It is clear from this graph that the model which most closely captures the trajectory of COVID-19 related deaths in SA, outside the estimation period, is the 3PL model. Due to the low COVID-19 death rate in South Africa, the distribution of the cumulative deaths at the provincial level posed a greater challenge in terms of modelling, and we were only able to fit models to the Western Cape COVID-19 deaths.The model predictions with observed deaths for Western Cape is presented in Fig. 7 . The 3PL model and the Richards model predictions are close and fit the observed data the best. Figure 7 indicates that the forecasts of the Gompertz model are closest to observed values beyond 22 June 2020. We can see that the trajectory of the Gompertz forecasts beyond the 30 day forecast window will overestimate the observed cases, assuming the actual deaths continue its observed path (Table 5) . In view of the existing healthcare challenges faced by South Africa, reliable and accurate short-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths are critical to ensure optimal resource allocation and should be a key aspect of the strategy to handle the COVID-19 epidemic in the country. This study modelled COVID-19 cases and deaths using publicly available data from 5 March 2020 to 22 June 2020. Five data-driven nonlinear growth models, namely the Richards; 3 parameter logistic; 4 parameter logistic; Gompertz and Weibull were considered. We observed that models for cases and deaths provide robust and accurate short-term forecasts for a period of 10 days ahead at the national level. However, given the rapidly changing growth rate as the country approaches the COVID-19 peak, as well as the changes to COVID-19 regulations and the reopening of the economy, it is crucial that these models are fitted daily as new data becomes available and that forecasts are updated and reported accordingly on a daily basis. In addition, we observed difficulty in fitting models at the provincial level, particularly for provinces which are relatively ""early"" in their COVID-19 outbreak. There were also convergence problems encountered when fitting the five models, resulting in us only reporting on the three specific models which converged to cumulative cases and deaths. It is important to note that all these models have limitations and may only be applicable in certain stages of the outbreak, or when enough data are available for stable estimation of parameters.Moreover, based on the results presented in this paper we recommend not to base the forecasting on a single model or to apply a modeling averaging technique to the results obtained from the different models. Rather we propose to use different models as a tool to estimate a realistic uncertainty interval of the predictions. As we have observed, models that have the best goodness to fit within the estimation period can predict poorly beyond the estimation period (which is the primary interest during the outbreak). At each forecasting date, a different model provides an accurate forecast and prediction intervals. However, if we use the prediction intervals obtained from all models, we will cover the observed values at both dates. Once again, we re-emphasize that we do not recommend using our modeling approach beyond a forecasting for 10 days ahead.Although the time for South Africa to reach 100,000 cumulative cases of COVID-19 was approximately 110 days since the first reported case, our forecasts reveal that the country should be prepared for an additional 47,449-57,358 cases within the next 10 days. This reinforces the need for the public to adhere to all the nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been emphasized, such as social distancing, washing of hands and the wearing of masks.A strength of the analysis presented in this paper is that it was conducted using readily accessible, publicly available data which is updated in real time. In addition, the statistical methods applied are relatively simple, intuitive and are not dependent on any assumptions regarding COVID-19 transmission dynamics which may be unknown (or the current knowledge can be misleading). Other researchers who modelled the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa using the SEIR approach [4] , predicted that the number of detected cases (assuming the detection rate of June 12) was 185,000 (89,500 -358, 000) and 278,000 (132,000 -535,000) for the 29th of June and the 6th of July 2020, respectively. The observed number of cases corresponding to these dates were 144, 264 and 205,721, respectively. These prediction intervals were substantially wider and further from the true observed values than those produced by our modelling approach. This advocates that a data driven approach, while unreliable beyond 10 days ahead, does provide more accurate forecasts in this period.A limitation, however, is that we can only predict laboratory confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 cases and reported deaths attributed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is possible that the true burden of COVID-19 in the country, considering asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic undiagnosed cases may be much higher than that observed. In light of these limitations, the modeling of COVID-19 deaths is crucial to gain greater insight into the COVID-19 burden in South Africa. However, due to the low numbers of deaths up to 22 June, as well as the way in which the death data was reported as was seen in the step-wise patterns observed in some provinces, modelling deaths using phenomenological models requires caution. While these model-based predictions of COVID-19 deaths reveal that approximately 1500 new deaths can be expected by 22 July 2020, it is important to interpret these numbers cautiously in light of the evidence of a high number of excess deaths in the country [18] .Based on the analysis presented in this paper, a web-based platform (https://www.samrc.ac.za/content/covid-19-forecasts) was developed in which the observed number of cases and deaths, as well as short-term forecasts are presented. In this way policy makers and the general public can consult the website and get a reliable understanding, supported by evidence observed in the data, about the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa. A detailed description of platform will be given in a future publication.We have shown the usefulness of non-linear growth models to provide short term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in South Africa. We focused on the short-term prediction of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths, and while the estimates of the turning point of the outbreak and final size of the epidemic are presented in the appendix, these parameters are not interpreted in the results. The rationale behind this decision, which was exemplified even in the forecasting of cumulative cases and deaths beyond 14 days, is that the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths are rapidly changing, as are the reporting and testing guidelines in the country. An area of further work involves a comprehensive assessment of the models applied for long term prediction and internal validation of the model.This study found that the phenomenological modeling approach provides reliable and accurate forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in South Africa for a maximum period of 10 days ahead. In view of the rapidly changing growth rate as the country approaches the COVID-19 peak, as well as the changes to COVID-19 regulations and the reopening of the economy, we recommend that these models are fitted daily to the latest COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths data.Durban, South Africa. 4 Smart Places Cluster, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, South Africa. 5 Human and Social Capabilities Research Division, Human Science Research Council, Pretoria, South Africa.","South Africa","abstract","2021-01-11",1

The causative agent of this infection was later named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2, 4, 5] . This led to the naming of the disease as COVID-19 [6] .The main clinical presentations of patients suffering from COVID-19 at that time included dry cough, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnoea, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bilateral lung infiltration on imaging, and abnormal radiological findings [7] [8] [9] [10] . Current findings have reported clinical features such as myalgias, fatigue, abdominal pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension [11] . COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 th March 2020 due, in part, to its rapid spread across the globe and relatively high mortality rate among specific populations [6, [12] [13] [14] . As a result, many countries instituted lockdowns to prevent further spreading of COVID-19 [15, 16] .There is strong evidence suggesting that COVID-19 has had adverse effects on the mental wellbeing of individuals worldwide [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Some of the mental health problems observed were illness anxiety disorder (IAD or formerly hypochondriasis), helplessness and horror, and the fear of COVID-19 associated stigmatization [22] [23] [24] [25] . Besides, some populations have reportedly experienced psychological impacts including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, stress, and mood swings due to the pandemic [18, 22, [26] [27] [28] [29] .Some studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between physical activity and mental health [30] . Physical activity plays a significant role in reducing the symptoms of mental health illnesses [31] . Lockdowns and restrictions to movement during the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the time that people spend resting, relaxing, and exercising [32, 33] . Many people experienced changes in their usual day-to-day routines, including physical activity, and that may have contributed to mental health disorders in most populations [34] .A literature search did not yield previous studies on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of students and other populations in Zambia. Thus, as an initial step,we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia (UNZA) and reported them vide infra. This was against a background that training of pharmacists in Zambia has over the years largely been utilising traditional face-to-face teaching and learning, including experiential learning in pre-clinical and clinical subject areas [48] . The restrictions and health risks imposed by COVID-19 presented unique challenges not only for the facilitation of learning in schools and universities but also to psychosocial wellbeing of the learners. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia.The study population was 410 pharmacy students, determined as follows: a sum of 90 secondyear, 140 third year, 126 fourth year, and 54 fifth-year pharmacy students, cumulatively.The sample size was determined using Yamane's formula; n = [49] . A margin of error of 5% and a population of 410 were used. A 10% loss or non-response was anticipated. However, 288 students responded representing a response rate of 70%. From the 288 pharmacy students, a total of 273 students managed to complete the questionnaire. 15 students did not complete responding to the questionnaire.Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire that was adapted from similar studies [39, 41, 50] . Firstly, the questionnaire was circulated to experts from the University of Zambia to allow for content and face validation. The modified questionnaire was pre-tested among 10 undergraduate pharmacy students at UNZA, who, later were excluded from the main study. Student's anxiety was measured using the generalised anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7)scale developed by Spitzer et al., [51] . The GAD-7 scale is used to categorize anxiety into four classes, namely; no anxiety, mild, moderate, and severe anxiety. Scoring of GAD-7 anxiety levels was done from 0 to 21 and categorised as follows; 1-4 no anxiety, 5-9 mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety, and 15-21 severe anxiety. The questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and mental health and physical activity impacts of COVID-19 on undergraduate pharmacy students from 1 st August to 30 th September 2020.Mental health: we evaluated mental health using the four levels of anxiety disorders from the GAD-7 anxiety levels as follows 1 if the score 15-25 (severe anxiety) 2 if the score 10-14 (moderate anxiety) Y = 3 if the score 5-9 (mild anxiety) 4 if the score 0-4 (no anxiety)In this case, both backward elimination and forward selection identified the same model.The baseline characteristics of respondents by levels of anxiety are shown in assumption. Since academic performance violates the PO assumption its effect was allowed to vary across the three binary models.We assessed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and physical activity of undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. We found that the factors associated with levels of anxiety among the students were reduced care from family, not changing attention to one's mental health, being in the final year of study, reduced time of resting and feeling helpless. Currently, COVID-19 has caused many negative impacts on the education sector and other sectors across the globe.Our study established that COVID-19 has affected the mental health of pharmacy students and reduced their time to do physical activity. reported that students experienced mental health problems associated with COVID-19. However, the prevalence of mental health problems reported in our study is higher than the ones reported in similar studies. This difference could be because our setting is resource-constrained. Also, the prevalence of anxiety in our study may have been higher since the pharmacy students experienced online learning for the first time.This is the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity among Zambian students and it has highlighted the need to pay attention to the mental health of students not only during COVID-19 pandemic but even beyond. Further, the study did not only indicate the prevalence of anxiety among pharmacy students due to COVID-19, but it also explored the factors that independently predict the anxiety levels among these students.Since we conducted the study among pharmacy students, the results cannot be generalised to other students doing different programmes. The online nature of the study meant that certain students had no access to the questionnaire and were, therefore, not part of the study. The study findings may not represent the future academic outcomes of undergraduate pharmacy students.This study found that the COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity of undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. Our study established that students experiencing anxiety associated with COVID-19 risk were more likely to have poor academic outcomes and progression. Institutions of higher learning and other stakeholders must, therefore, put in place measures to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and academic life of students. We will continue to monitor this and other post-COVID-19 effects on educational processes and outcomes in future.• Literature search indicates that students from various countries and pursuing different programmes have been experiencing anxiety associated with COVID-19.• COVID-19 has impacted the education sector and other sectors negatively.• This study adds valuable information to existing knowledge on the possible impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of students.• The study adds basic information on COVID-19 vs mental health and COVID-19 vs physical activity.","Zambia","abstract","2021-01-13",1

This was initially identified in a cluster of Pneumonia patients in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019 and had since spread to other continents of the world Chang et al. 2020 ). The causative virus was found to be closely related to a previously known Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hence the name SARS- CoV-2 (Wand et al. 2020) . Clinical symptoms include pneumonia, cold, dry cough, sore throat, fever, shortness of breath, respiratory tract infection, headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Chen et al. 2020) . Over twenty (20) million symptomatic and asymptomatic cases had been reported, with more than a million deaths (https :// coron aviru s.jhu.edu/map.html). The infection was reported to be severe in elderly patients and more critical in individuals with underlying health conditions like diabetics, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, cancer, etc (Wu et al. 2020) .As of the time of this report, no drug/vaccine has been proven to effectively cure/manage this infection. The current strategy in the management includes early diagnosis, isolation of infected individuals, and maintenance of personal hygiene, physical distance, and use of personal protective equipment. Attempts have also been made to reposition/ repurpose old drugs of promising antiviral potential in a bid to tackle this fast-spreading pandemic. Remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, etc. are among the drugs used in the management of this pandemic (Wu et al. 2020 ). More recently dexamethasone has been found to reduce mortality in severe cases of COVID-19 disease (Johnson and Vinetz 2020) .Phytochemicals are increasingly becoming the alternative therapeutic and pharmacological agent of great importance in drug discovery and development. They have limited or no side effects on administration, possess a novel mechanism of action, and great chemical diversity which enhances their therapeutic interaction with varied biological targets compared to synthetic drugs. Saponins are naturally occurring non-volatile and surface-active glycosides of triterpenes and steroids with a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, antitumor, antifungal, hypoglycemic, and cytotoxic activity. They are potential vaccine adjuvant due to their ability to stimulate and activate the immune system in mammals (Sun et al. 2009; Skene and Sutton 2006) . The sugar side chain in saponins could be responsible for their adjuvant. Similarly, saponins have been found to possess a novel mechanism of action on the virus which involves the destruction of viral envelop, loss of binding sites, and subsequent prevention of binding of the virus to host cell (Roner et al. 2007) . They have also found application in food, confectionery, beverages, cosmetics, preparation of pharmaceutical products, as well as industrial processes as surface-active and foaming agents. Rich sources of saponins include soya beans, capsicum peppers, spinach, horse chestnut, fenugreek, ginseng, etc. (Francis et al. 2002; Vincken 2007) . Moreover, much toxicity is observed when saponins are administered intravenously while lower toxicity is observed when is administered orally due to low absorption in the alimentary canal but it is rather hydrolyzed to sapogenins via enzymatic action (Guclu-Ustundag and Mazza 2007) .Tannins on the other hand are phenolic compounds of great antioxidant potential and antiviral properties, they are high molecular weight compounds (ranging between 500 and 3000 gmol-1) found in different parts of plants including leaf, stem, root, or bark (Serrano et al. 2009 ). This study aims at investigating the antiviral potential of saponins and tannins against SARS-CoV-2 M pro through molecular docking coupled with ADMET-studies, pharmacokinetic evaluation, drug likeliness among other analyses at a therapeutic dose.In this research, the inhibitory activities of twenty-seven (27) phytochemicals from Saponins and Tannins against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) PDB ID: 6LU7 were studied. The selected isolated phytochemicals from different species of plants have been reported to possess broad-spectrum biological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic activities, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anticancer, to mention a few. Their reported biological activities arouse our interest to investigate them as potential inhibitors of the novel SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) towards designing a new therapeutic agent. The sources, species name, and biological activities of the studied compounds are shown in Table 1 . Also, three standards (Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, and N3 inhibitor) whose completed randomized trials and inhibitory activities against the novel SARS-CoV-2 (M pro ) have been reported (Kaddoura et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2020) were used for comparison. The Saponins/Tannins used are Priverogenin A, Arjunic acid, Theasapogenol B, Euscaphic Acid, Camelliagenin C, Medicagenic Acid, Protoescigenin, Arjunolic acid, Asiatic acid, Protobassic acid, Arjugenin, Polygalacic acid, Primulagenin A, Soyasapogenol B, Tomentosic acid, Presenegenin, Punicalagin, Punicalin, Ellagic acid, Corilagin, Gallagic acid, Terflavin B. Catechin, Chebulinic acid, Hexahydroxydiphenic acid, Gallic acid, and Catechol respectively.Using conformer distribution with Molecular mechanics/ MMFF in Spartan 14 version 1.1.4, the most stable conformers of all the studied compounds were obtained. The conformers were optimized using equilibrium geometry density functional theory method (DFT) at B3LYP and 6 − 31 + G* as the basis set on HP Desktop computer, 2 terabytes hard disk, 64-gigabyte random accessed memory (RAM), Intel ® Core™i7-2600 CPU, 3.40 GHz processor, and 4 gigabytes dedicated video memory to generate important molecular properties and well optimized structures for molecular docking simulation.The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID: 6LU7) ( Fig. 1 ) was used as a target receptor in this study. The structure was retrieved from the protein data bank (RCSB) (http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb). SARS-CoV-2 M pro is the main protease of the novel strain of the 2019 coronavirus disease. It is a protein that mediates replication and transcription of the virus (Jin et al. 2020) , therefore, the protease is often the target of the potential inhibitors of the virus in the drug discovery and development processes. The resolution of 6LU7 (2.16 Å) approximately falls within the 2.0 Å recommended resolution for a protein of good quality (Hajduk and Tse 2005) . Water molecules and other unwanted complexes were removed from the downloaded protease to avoid undesired molecular interactions and to ensure that no molecule interfered with the potential binding site of the target protease during the docking simulation. The Ramachandran plot ( Fig. 2) which revealed the quality of the receptor under study was obtained using the Volume, Area, Dihedral Angle Reporter (VADAR) webserver. The binding pocket X, Y, and Z coordinates were defined as − 26.284, 12.603, and 58.96 respectively for the screening exercise using the grid box of the native ligand inhibitor (N3 inhibitor) complexed with the target receptor as a basis.Binding pocket, ligand interactions, and all amino acids in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro were established using the Computed Atlas for Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) (http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp /index .html?2011) (Tian et al. 2019) and Biovia Discovery Studio (2019). The obtained data were compared and validated with the previously reported experimental data for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro active site complexed with N3 native ligand (Jin et al. 2020) . AutoDock/Vina tool (Trott and Olson 2010) was used for the docking simulation. It is a reliable protein-ligand docking tool that uses the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm which significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode prediction (Azam and Abbasi 2013). AutoDock tool was used to generate the (.pdbqt) files using the grid size 58, 62, and 40 for x, y, and z axes, grid center − 26.284 × 12.603 × 58.960 respectively, and 1.000 Å spacing. The docking simulation was performed using AutoDockVina and the binding energies (∆G) (kcal/mol) of the docked ligands were obtained. The inhibition constants and inhibitory efficiencies of the docked ligands were calculated using (Eqs. 1 and 2). PyMol and Biovia-2019 discovery studio were used to view and analyse the docking results.where R = Gas constant (1.987 × 10 -3 kcal/mol); T = 298.15 K (absolute temperature); K i = Inhibition constant; ΔG = Binding energy.Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) web server http://www.pharm aexpe rt.ru/passo nline /) (Lagunin 2000) was used to predict the biological activities of the studied ligands.Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the selected compounds were predicted using ADMET SAR2 web-server, while drug-like The X-ray crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID: 6LU7) (Fig. 1) contains 306 amino acid residues complexed with an inhibitor (N3-(N-. It consists of 23%, 31%, 45% and 28% α-helix, β-sheets, Coil and Turns respectively. The resolution of the protease as revealed by X-ray diffraction was 2.16 Å, crystal dimension is a = 97.93 Å, b = 79.48 Å, and c = 51.08 Å with angles α (900), β (114.550), and γ (900) SARS-CoV-2 M pro active site is located in the cleft between Domain I and II and contains a Cys-His catalytic dyad. Amino acid residue at the active site is as follows Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, His41, Met49, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, Leu176, Pro168, His172, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Thr190, Ala191, and Gln192 (Jin et al. 2020 ).Recent developments in drug discovery have led to a renewed interest in the computational study which involves the use of algorithms and programs for predictions of therapeutic interventions in biological processes (Shoichet et al. 2002) . Molecular Docking is a structure-based drug design approach that predicts binding interactions between ligand and target receptor at the binding site (Ferreira et al. 2015) . It is an important virtual screening technique that could screen several thousands of ligands against the target as well as identify potential inhibitors of the target receptor with speed and accuracy (Dias et al. 2008) .To investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , AutoDock/Vina (MGL tools-1.5.6), PyMOL Console Edu, and Biovia Discovery studio 4.5 were used. The results obtained from the docking of selected saponins and tannins against SARS-CoV-2 M pro were as shown in Table 2 . Binding affinity is a reflection of the inhibitory activity of the plant extract against SARS-CoV-2 M pro . It is apparent from this table that most of the selected saponins and tannins had better binding affinities and inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 M pro compared to Remdesivir and Dexamethasone which are standard drugs used in the management of this pandemic disease. Binding affinity (BA) for the selected saponins range between − 8.3 k cal/mol and − 7.1 kcal/mol, while those of tannins range between − 9.0 kcal/mol and − 4.7 kcal/mol. It can be seen that selected tannins had far greater binding affinities compared to saponins, with Punicalagin (− 9.0 kcal/ mol) having the outstanding inhibitory activity. To validate the inhibitory effects observed through docking scores, the hit compounds among the docked ligands were subjected for further analysis.Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) profile of a molecule is an important assay in the early stage of drug discovery. ADMET data enhances the selection and identification of molecules with optimum safety profile at a therapeutic dose along the discovery process rather than at the final stage, as this helps in avoiding waste of time and precious resources on drug molecules that may eventually be discarded (Tsaioun and Kates 2010) .Considering the binding affinities and inhibition constants ( Table 2) which are expected to be within (0.1 µM and 1.0 µM), only nine (9) of the docked compounds qualified as hits and were subjected to ADMET analysis using ADMET SAR-2 web-server (Cheng et al. 2012) . Notably, only Ellagic acid, Arjunic Acid, Thesapogenol B, and Euscaphic Acid (coded C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4 respectively) showed excellent ADMET profile, their structures were shown in Fig. 3 , their ADMET properties were discussed in Table 3 and they were selected for further analyses. Although Punicalagin, Punicalin, and Priverogenin A had better inhibitory activities and binding affinities than ellagic acid, they were shunned on the basis of toxicity and the possibility of poor absorption and permeability across a biological membrane. As part of the drug ADMET profile, a drug molecule should have good human intestinal absorption (HIA), solubility (Log S) range between -1 and -5, should be a noninhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, and should be non-Ames toxic. Others include non-carcinogenicity, noninhibition of hERG, and no or low level of toxicity (Tsaioun and Kates 2010). C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4 (Table 3) were well absorbed in the human intestine, only Thesapogenol B (C-3) was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, although an oral drug does not necessarily need to cross the blood-brain barrier, only central nervous system target drug need to (Hughes et al. 2011) .It was also found in the prediction, that all the four (4) selected hit compounds were non-inhibitor of microsomal enzymes (Cytochrome P450), which is an indication of good metabolism of the drug in the liver (Stevens 2014). The potential of a drug molecule to cause mutation in DNA is revealed by Ames toxicity value and could be a major reason for excluding a drug molecule along the discovery process (Mccarren et al. 2011) . As shown in Table 3 , all the selected hit compounds are non-genotoxic and non-carcinogenic. Similarly, the hits possess type III acute oral toxicity values (slightly toxic) which could easily be converted to type IV (nontoxic) during hit-lead optimization. The human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium ion channel plays important role in cardiac repolarization, blockage of which may be caused by inherited mutation or some drug molecules, leading to long QT syndrome and eventual death (Sanguinetti and Tristani-firouzi 2006) . Interestingly all the hit compounds are non-blockers of the hERG potassium channel.Comparison of ADMET profile of the hits with the standard drugs revealed that Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, and N3 inhibitor had good ADMET profiles, but both dexamethasone and N3 inhibitor were found to be blockers of hERG potassium ion channel while Remdesivir is not. This result, therefore, suggests that the hit compounds have a similar ADMET profile just like Remdesivir, and could be developed further in the quest of finding a new therapeutic agent in COVID-19 management. It is important to note that the ADMET profile of dexamethasone revealed that it is a blocker of hERG potassium ion channel, therefore caution should be taken in its administration to COVID-19 patients. Evaluation of physicochemical and drug-likeness of the potential active compound is an important step in drug discovery. As proposed by Lipinski, an effective oral therapeutic drug must obey the 'rule of five' with not more than one (1) violation, this is due to the fact that an orally bioavailable drug must possess molecular weight (MW) ≤ 500 Da, hydrogen bond donor (HBDs) ≤ 5, hydrogen bond acceptor (HBAs) ≤ 10 and log P (octanol-water partition coefficient) ≤ 5 (Lipinski 2004) . These descriptors of oral bioavailability are important as they predict the permeability and absorption of such drug across a biological membrane such as an epithelium cell, partition coefficient value (log p) is especially important in predicting intestinal absorption of such drug (Aucamp et al. 2015) . Drug-likeness of the selected hits were evaluated with Molinspiration online (http://www.molin spira tion.com/) as shown in Table 4 , it is apparent from the table that none of the selected hits had more than one violation of the 'rule of five' which is an indication of good oral bioavailability and permeability. It is also interesting to note that all the selected hits and Dexamethasone (SD-2) had better drug-like properties compared to Remdesivir, and N3-Inhibitor (SD-1 and SD-3) with more than 1 violation. This result revealed that the selected hits (C-1 to C-4) possessed excellent drug-like properties and could be developed further as oral drugs.Oral-bioavailability of the selected hit compounds and standards Table 5 shows the oral-bioavailability profile of the selected hit ligands and standards obtained using the swissADME tool (Daina et al. 2017 ). The bioavailability radar (Fig. 4) revealed Table 4 Drug-likeness of selected hit compounds C-1 = Ellagic Acid, C-2 = Arjunic Acid, C-3 = Thesapogenol B, C-4 = Euscaphic Acid, SD-1 = Remdesivir, SD-2 = Dexamethasone, SD-3 = N3 Inhibitor Table 5 Oral bioavailability of the selected hit compounds C-1 = Ellagic, C-2 = Arjunic acid, C-3 = Theasapogenol B, C-4 = Euscaphic acid SD-1 = Remedesivir, SD-2 = Dexamethasone, SD-3 = N3 Inhibitor LIGAND C-1 C-2 C-3 C-4 SD-1 SD-2 SD-3 the oral-bioavailability profile of the selected hits and Standard drug in a catch sight. The pink area of the radar shows the optimum zone for each of the properties i.e., (POLAR, FLEX, SIZE LIPO, INSATU, and INSOLU). As shown in Table 5 , all the selected hits obeyed the recommended size of 500 gmol-1 for effective drug candidates as reported by Lipinski, compared to 602.6 gmol-1 and 680.79 gmol-1 reported for SD-1 and SD-3 respectively. The polarity (POLAR) of the selected hits were evaluated using their Total Polarity Surface Area (TPSA). A polar compound is expected to have TPSA value within the range of 20 and 130 Å2. The TPSA of C-2 and C-3 fall within the recommended range, while all the hit compounds have lower TPSA values compared to the value obtained for SD-1 and SD-3. However, SD-2 has the best TPSA value (94Å2), thus has the highest POLARITY property. The INSOLU (insolubility) requirement of the selected compounds and standards as depicted in their ESOL (Log S) and ESOL Class showed that C-1 and SD-2 are soluble; C-2 has a poor solubility profile while C-3, C-4, SD-1, and SD-3 are moderately soluble. Notably, C-1 has the most outstanding Table 6 shows the bioactivity properties of the four (4) selected hits and standards. The inverse relationship existing between binding energy and inhibition constant is as shown in Eqs. 1 and 2, indicating that the higher the binding energy the lower the inhibition constant. A potential hit compound is expected to have inhibition constant values ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 µM and not more than 10 nM for a drug (Stevens 2014) .Inhibition constant values of the hit compounds range from 0.70 to 1.37 µM. This observation revealed that all the four (4) selected compounds are qualified as hit with Ellagic acid (0.70 µM) being the most potent of all. Ligand Efficiency (LE), Fit Quality (FQ), and Ligand-efficiency-dependent lipophilicity (LELP) were also calculated according to Eq. 3-6. C-1 has the ligand efficiency (LE) value within the recommended value of (≥ 0.3), while both C-1 and SD-2 have LELP values within the recommended range of (− 10 and 10). Notably, all the hit compounds had FQ values within the recommended range (≥ 0.8), which is higher than the FQ values reported for all the standards (Hopkins et al. 2014 ). Table 7 shows the prediction of the biological activity spectra of the selected hits and standards using the PASS online web tool (Filimonov et al. 2014) . It shows predictions based on the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Pa is the probability that shows the similarity in structure of specific molecules in comparison to the molecules of the most active compound of similar activity. For this activity spectrum, the probability of validating the biological activity of a molecule (Filimonov et al. 2014) . It can be observed from Table 7 that all the selected hits (Ellagic acid, Arjunic acid, Theasapogenol, and Euscaphic acid) and SD-1 (Remdesivir) possess antiviral activities while (SD-2) Dexamethasone showed no antiviral activity within the spectrum. Also, Table 7 revealed that SD-3 had higher activity spectra for severe acute respiratory syndrome treatment and Protease Inhibition potential with Pa values of 0.698 and 0.665 respectively, which is an indication of its tendency to inhibit the SARS CoV-2 main protease. Notably, The Pa values observed for the hit compounds were greater than Pi, thus validating their biological activities. Therefore, all the selected hits possessed excellent antiviral activities and could be explored in the design and development of new drugs/vaccines in the management of the novel SARS-CoV-2 ravaging the globe.Identifying the binding site and evaluating the binding interactions of the ligands in the active pocket of the target receptor plays a crucial role in drug design. This eases the improvement of ligand affinity to the pocket during the lead optimization stage of drug discovery. The binding interactions of the selected hits and standards with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) are shown in Tables 8 and 9 . The binding affinities obtained from the docking of C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, SD-1, and SD-2 as shown in Table 8 are (− 8.4, − 8.1, − 8.1, − 8.0, − 7.6, and − 7.7 kcal/mol) respectively. C-1 (Table 9 ) formed a conventional hydrogen bond with Gln189, Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, His163, and Asn142, carbon-hydrogen bond with His172, pi-donor hydrogen bond with Met165, pi-alkyl interaction with Cys145. However, a close examination of the main active site of the target receptor (6LU7) revealed that its binding pocket (active site) was located in the cleft between domains I and II with This study evaluates twenty-seven (27) bioactive saponins/ tannins against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) via in silico studies (structure-based drug design). The compounds were screened using the reliable AutoDock/Vina tool, ADMET SAR-2, swissADME, Molinspiration web server, PASS software, among others. CASTp and VADAR web tools were used to establish the active site and Ramachandran plot of the target receptor (6LU7) respectively. The results obtained flourish Ellagic acid (− 8.4 kcal/mol), Arjunic acid (− 8.1 kcal/mol), Theasapogenol B (− 8.1 kcal/mol), and Euscaphic Acid (− 8.0 kcal/mol) as probable inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro due to their excellent binding energies, ADMET profile, drug-likeness, oral-bioavailability properties, PASS properties, Bioactivity, outstanding binding mode and molecular interactions with the target receptor. C-1 (Ellagic acid) share the same pocket and interact completely with the active site of the target receptor, while C-2, C-3, and C-4 (Arjunic acid, Theasapogenol B, Euscaphic Table 9 Binding mode and molecular interactions of the selected hits against 6LU7C-1 = Ellagic acid; C-2 = Arjunic acid; C-3 = Theasapogenol B; C-4 = Euscaphic acid Acid) respectively share the same probable allosteric pocket and interactions with SD-1 (Remdesivir), and SD-2 (Dexamethasone) whose randomized clinical trials against the target receptor have been completed. Although, it is widely accepted that computational drug-design plays a pivotal role in the world of drug design and development today. It is used in hit/lead identification and optimization towards the design and development of new therapeutic agents, however, the need for experimental work to buttress our findings is duly acknowledged, but lack of funding among other factors limited our scope. We hereby recommend that the fourhit compounds identified in this study should be developed further towards finding a reliable and effective drug/vaccine to arrest the new disease (COVID-19) terrorizing the entire human race.","Nigeria","first author","2021-01-06",1

In 1960, coronavirus (Covs) was identified as the cause of the common cold. At the present time seven types of Covs species can infect human beings. The four Covs species (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, CoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43) cause up to a third of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections. The remaining three species are highly pathogenic; SARS-CoV-1 discovered in 2002 as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome Covs identified in 2012 as the cause of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of Covs disease 2019 (COVID-1). 1 COVID-19 characterized by respiratory distress was first reported in December 2019, in the People's Republic of China. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease. 2 For example, the S protein in SARS-CoV-1 is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and has great potential to induce T cell response. These similarities help to develop treatment interventions.As of December 21, 2020, there were 75,479,805 cases and 1,686,267 confirmed deaths in the world. 3 SARS-CoV-2 has stronger infectivity than that of SARS-CoV-1 and poses an immense threat to the world population. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, spread by the inhalation of respiratory aerosols and direct human contact. 4 The serious pandemic situation has highlighted the need for safe and effective therapeutic and preventive measures to reduce the transmission of the disease. Since effective antiviral agents are still lacking, vaccination is the best approach for controlling the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. 5 Therefore, several countries have accelerated clinical trials to develop an effective and safe vaccine to curtail the current ongoing pandemic. The purpose of this review article is to provide an up-to-date status of various promising vaccine platforms.The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, singlestranded, non-segmented RNA genome of 29,903 nucleotides. The three pathogenic Covs species have several structural and immunological similarities. SARS-CoV-2 genome has 80% similarity to SARS-CoV and 50% to MERS-Cov and similar life-cycle shown in Figure 1 . The S protein in SARS-CoV-1 is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2. These similarities help to develop treatment interventions. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has two open-reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the non-structural proteins (nsps) and structural proteins. ORF1a encodes for polypeptide 1a (pp1a) that subsequently breakdown into 11 nsps. ORF1b initially translated into a polypeptide (pp1ab) next cleaved into 15 nsps by viral proteases. Another key nsp, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), is responsible for replication and transcription of the viral genome. 6, 7 Like all CoV, SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins which are the S, N, M, and E proteins. The S protein mostly serves for Covs vaccine development due to its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies and T cell response. S protein also mediates viral entry into host cells. S has two domains S1 and S2. The S1 has the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the S2 contains the fusion peptide, which is responsible for receptor binding and cell fusion, respectively. 8, 9 Lan et al reported the crystal structure of RBD of SARS-CoV-1 is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. Some mAbs targeting the RBD can neutralize both viruses, making it a promising target for vaccine development with a dual target. For SARS-CoV-2, studies with monoclonal antibodies have shown that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop robust neutralizing antibody responses against S protein and in particular the RBD. 10 In addition to S, N-protein-immunized BALB/c mice also induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, vaccination with vaccines expressing N resulted in no protection against SARS-CoV challenge as well as enhanced infection, which were characterized by increased pulmonary eosinophil infiltration. The M and E proteins have garnered less interest as vaccine targets due to lower immunogenicity, although the SARS-CoV patient sera was shown to be reactive to M peptides. 11Vaccination is one of the world's most successful health interventions, saving as many as 3 million lives every year. Vaccination is the cheapest and the most effective way of controlling disease, so efforts are directed towards vaccine designs against COVID-19 to avert the pandemic. Several vaccine candidates have been developed using the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. 12 As of December 10, 2020, over 214 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 from pharmaceutical industries and academic institutions were under development using different vaccine platforms. These vaccine platforms are recombinant viral-vectored vaccines, live attenuated viruses, protein subunit, inactivated vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines, and virus-like particles and are presented in Figure 2 . Among 214 candidate vaccines, 52 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials. 13 Currently, Ad5-nCoV (CanSino Biologicals), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), INO-4800 (Inovio, Inc.), BNT162/ mRNA (Fosun Pharma), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), CoronaVac (Sinovac), and ChAdOx1 (University of Oxford) have entered Phase III clinical trials. 11, 13 Protein Subunit Vaccines Subunit vaccines may possess antigens with strong immunogenicity that can induce the host immune system. Peptide epitopes isolation is essential for the protein of interest. The epitopes must have the potential to express a strong humoral and T cell immunity against the pathogen that may have a longlasting effect. 14 Most subunit vaccines require an adjuvant to induce an enhanced immune response. An adjuvant may increase the half-life of the vaccine or may decrease the immunomodulatory cytokine response. So, an adjuvant overcomes the limitation of the protein subunit vaccines. Research for the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV give positive inputs. 15 Different forms of S-proteins, including the full-length S protein, S1, and RBD, displayed a varying degree of neutralizing antibody responses and protection from the virus in several studies. 16 Vaccines Based on Full-Length S Protein Several institutions utilize the subunit vaccines platform to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, especially when using the S protein as an antigen. The spike (S) protein induces strong immunogenicity, which is the most promising antigen for COVID-19 vaccine development. S protein is the surface protein that mediates virus binding to the host ACE2 receptor for viral fusion and entry. Currently, several vaccine candidates used the S protein to induce an enhanced immune response. 17 The S protein-based vaccines developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses were effective to a large extent. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares a considerable genome sequence and sequence identity of different crucial enzymes with SARS-CoV, the vaccine approaches already built for SARS may facilitate the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. 18 NVX-CoV2373 is under development by Novavax from recombinant full-length S protein with saponinbased Matrix-M1 adjuvant that is Novavax's proprietary nanoparticle technology. Matrix-M induces leukocyte migration into the draining lymph nodes (LN) that increase T cell, B cell, NK, and dendritic cells in draining to LNs. NVX-CoV2373 produces high levels of S protein-specific antibodies that can block ACE-2 human RBD and wildtype SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after one dose. NVX-CoV2373 is in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United Kingdom in combination with the seasonal influenza vaccine. Novavax is currently conducting phase 3 clinical trials in the United Kingdom. 19, 20 Protein (RBD-Based) Subunit Vaccine Subunit vaccines based on recombinant antigenic proteins are essential for expressing long-lasting immune responses. RBD of SARS-CoV-S contains major antigenic epitopes that induce both neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. 21 The immunogenicity of RBD vaccines was better than the full-length S protein. SARS-CoV RBD did not cause immune damage in the animal model, while the full-length S protein could do. It is proposed that there are super-antigens in the region beyond the RBD of the full-length S protein. Therefore, the RBD-based subunit vaccine may be the ideal and safer alternative to develop a vaccine for Covs. 22, 23 Kentucky Bioprocessing Inc is developing an RBD-based vaccine candidate and undertaking phases I and II clinical trials (NCT04473690). Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical/Institute of Microbiology, the Chinese Academy of Science has a candidate vaccine that is currently in phase III clinical trial. 24 Vaccines Based on S2 Subunit SARS-CoV S2 subunit is responsible for fusion between virus and target cell membrane is proposed to be an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV. Several studies showed that S2 protein induces neutralizing antibodies, although their potency is lower than the RBD-based subunit vaccine. However, Zhang et al reported the immune responses against S2 fragment in BALB/c mice induced a specific cellular immune response. 25 Besides, Zhao et al purified S2-specific IgG from mice immunized with S2 proteins and found that anti-S2 IgGs could abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor-(s). Thus, the S2 subunit has a promising potential to be a target to develop a vaccine against divergent virus strains. Currently, several vaccines are under preclinical studies using this platform. 26 Inactivated vaccine platforms have been widely used over the past 70 years. Inactivated vaccines are produced by inactivating the viruses with chemicals, UV light, and heat. Inactivation of the organism makes a safe vaccine, especially for immunocompromised persons. However, these vaccines induce a weaker immune response than live vaccines and need several booster doses. These inactivated vaccines take a longer time to manufacture as the virus needs to be cultured in the lab and then inactivated. 27, 28 Nowadays, seven inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in clinical trials, and 12 candidates are in preclinical trials. 13 CoronaVac, formerly known as PiCoVacc, is an inactivated vaccine candidate developed by the People's Republic of China's leading vaccine manufacturers, Sinovac Biotech. CoronaVac vaccine is made by proliferating the viruses in cell culture followed by inactivation by formalin with alum adjuvant. Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses possess the RBD within the S protein as immune inducer. 28 CoronaVac was granted an emergency use authorization by Chinese authorities before the initiation of phase III studies. This authorization resulted in 90% of company employees immunized with the vaccine. The phase II clinical trial results by CoronaVac showed that it induced neutralizing antibodies 14 days after vaccination. The neutralizing seroconversion rate of CoronaVac was over 90% in 600 healthy volunteers and can trigger a positive immune response. Currently, CoronaVac is in phase III (NCT04456595) clinical trials. 29, 30 New Crown COVID-19 has been developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Sinopharm as an inactivated whole-virus, alum-adjuvant vaccine. The whole virus cultivated in vitro and infected cells was further inactivated using β-propiolactone and adsorbed to 0.5 mg alum. The phase 1 clinical trial was carried out using three doses (10 μg, 5 μg, and 2.5 μg) of antigen. The results revealed that the vaccine has better safety profiles and strong neutralizing antibody response in all three doses. There were no severe side effects. Phase II clinical trials were undertaken using a 5 μg antigen, and the results displayed New Crown COVID-19 vaccine can effectively generate antibody titer with fewer side effects. A booster dose is essential to produce enough immune response, with (21 days and 28 days) interval between the first doses. The booster dose triggers a better antibody titer as compared to the 14-day intervals. Generally, the New Crown COVID-19 vaccine candidate displayed acceptable safety and a better immunogenic profile, supporting its assessment in the ongoing phase III trials. A phase III (ChiCTR2000034780) clinical trial began in July 2020 and planned to enroll 21,000 participants. Phase III (ChiCTR2000034780) clinical trials are currently taking place in the United Arab Emirates. Sinopharm gave these candidate vaccines to thousands of people under emergency use conditions approved by the Chinese Government. [31] [32] [33] BBIBP-CorV is another inactivated vaccine candidate developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinopharm. In preclinical studies, BBIBP-CorV produced a better immune response in guinea pigs, mice, rats, rabbits, and non-human primates to protect against SARS-CoV-2. In the phase I and II trials, BBIBP-CorV was safe and well-tolerated at all three doses (2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg) on days 0 and 28. A robust immune response was observed in 100% of vaccine recipients. The phase III trial of BBIBP-CorV is ongoing in Abu Dhabi, UAE. 34 Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is India's first inactivated vaccine candidate developed by Bharat Biotech, Indian Council of Medical Research, and National Institute of Virology against COVID-19. The phase I and II clinical trials were conducted in 12 hospitals in different cities across the country. The vaccine produced robust immune responses, thereby preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bharat Biotech is also undertaking a phase III clinical trial with 26,000 participants from across 22 sites in India. 35 Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) controlled several infections disease outbreaks like yellow fever, mumps, measles, rubella, polio, and chickenpox. The highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara, recombinant adenoassociated virus, or an attenuated parainfluenza virus encodes recombinant forms of the S protein. 36 Cao et al evaluated the immune protection of a rAAV encoding RBD vaccine in a mouse model by intranasal inoculation, which induced strong mucosal immune responses and provided long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection. 37 Other groups reported that immunization of monkeys via the respiratory tract with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-CoV-neutralizing serum antibodies. Weingart et al immunized ferrets with rMVA-S and the immunized ferrets induced neutralizing antibody. After challenging with SARS-CoV, ferrets showed strong inflammatory responses in liver tissue, suggesting that vaccination with rMVA-S enhances hepatitis, which is not observed in the above infection model. It is suggested that we should not only use mice or monkeys as an animal model but also use ferrets as the infection model, because of their sensitivity to SARS-CoV. 38 LAVs associate with the risk of reversion by either mutation-or recombinationdriven processes, which cause dangerous outbreaks in unvaccinated populations. LAV vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in preclinical development. For example, Indian Immunologicals Limited is currently working together with Griffith University to develop a vaccine using codon deoptimization as a strategy against SARS-CoV-2.The vaccine candidate provides a long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2 following a single vaccination. 39 DelNS1-SARS-CoV2-RBD is an influenza-based vaccine strain with deletion of the virulent NS1 gene. It is attenuated by the deletion of a virulent element and the immune antagonist. It is more immunogenic than the wildtype influenza virus and can be given as a nasal spray. An attenuated version of the influenza virus was modified to encode the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on its surface. 40 Nucleic Acid-Based Vaccines (DNA or mRNA) Platform Nucleic acid-based vaccines offer a cost-effective approach to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. In the 1990s Wolf et al reported in vivo the encoded protein expression after administration of encoded nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) into mice. 41 This discovery was the start of the use of nucleic acids encoding antigens as a form of vaccination. While the instability of mRNA limited its use, plasmid DNA emerged as the promising platform even though the first clinical trial was disappointing. Advances in the delivery of vaccines have spurred new clinical trials to develop vaccines against Covid-19. Currently, several companies are developing nucleic acid-base d vaccines. 42, 43 mRNA VaccineThe mRNA-based vaccine is an emerging, non-infectious, and non-integrating platform with less risk of insertional mutagenesis. It is the most promising alternative due to its cost and safety profile in animal studies. The immunogenicity of the mRNA can be minimized, and alterations can increase the stability of these vaccines. Furthermore, the anti-vector immunity can be removed as the mRNA is the minimally immunogenic genetic vector, allowing repeated use of the vaccine. This platform has empowered the rapid vaccine development program due to its flexibility and ability to mimic the antigen structure and expression as seen in the course of natural infection. 44, 45 Currently, six mRNA-based vaccine candidates are in the clinical trials, and 19 vaccine candidates are in the preclinical trial for COVID-19. 13 mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine with a synthetic viral mRNA, which encodes the full-length spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and mimics the natural infection. The host body recognizes the synthetic viral mRNA and translates the viral protein shown in Figure 3 . mRNA is not stable, but through chemical modifications, mRNA is stabilized and packaged into an injectable form using a liquid nanoparticle. [44] [45] [46] The mRNA-1273 is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes a stable form of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The encapsulated mRNA-1273 then travels to the immune cells (lymph nodes) and instructs them to make copies of the spike protein on their surface as if SARS-CoV-2 infects them. Other immune cells learn about the spike protein and prepare themselves for the future response to SARS-CoV-2. 47 mRNA-1273 evoked neutralizing antibody titer levels observed in convalescent sera within their initial 45 participants. It is also generally safe and provided complete protection in a mouse challenge model. 48 Moderna has collaborated with Catalent since June 25, 2020 to perform large-scale, commercial fill-finish manufacturing of Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine at Catalent's biologics facility in Indiana, US. Besides, it is relatively safe as it is neither an inactivated pathogen nor the subunits of the live pathogen. mRNA used in vaccination is safe to use since it cannot become part of a person's chromosomes. 47, 48 Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with Grade 3 (severe) in 2%, typically pain at the injection site and fatigue, achiness, joint pain, headache, and redness at the injection site after the second dose. Moderna reported that the mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate passed its most important test, the 30,000+ participant phase III clinical trial (NCT04470427) by showing 94.5% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. The FDA DovePress advisory panel voted to recommend the approval of the mRNA-1273 vaccine for emergency use. 49 BNT162b1/BNT162b2 vaccines are codon-optimized mRNA vaccines that encode SARS-CoV-2 RBD and fulllength spike respectively. The mRNA is encapsulated in 80 nm ionizable cationic lipid nanoparticles that increase its delivery. The phase II and III clinical trials showed the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS−CoV−2−neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to the GMT of a panel of SARS −CoV−2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 showed less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. 50 The ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2, has enrolled more than 44,000 participants, from 150 sites in the US, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina. Most participants have received their second dose. The phase III trial BNT162b2 was 95% effective 28 days after the first dose. FDA granted Pfizer and BioNTech an emergency use authorization (EUA) of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. 51 THe LUNAR-COV19 (ARCT-021) vaccine contains a lipid-mediated delivery system called Lipid-enabled and Unlocked Nucleomonomer Agent-modified RNA (LUNAR). After administration, the vaccine enters the host's cells, where the mRNA translates into proteins. These proteins are from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and thus the host can induce an immune response against them and fight off an infection from the native virus. It is developed by Arcturus Therapeutics' on an RNA-based vaccine platform and enters phase I and II clinical trials in Singapore. 52 The most revolutionary approach to vaccination is the introduction of the DNA vaccine, which encodes antigen, and induces the adaptive immune response. The transfected cells express the transgene that provides a steady supply of the transgene-specific proteins, which is similar to the live virus. 53 DNA vaccines targeting S, M, and N proteins induce humoral as well as cellular immune response. Although the DNA vaccine platform is temperature stable and rapidly manufactured, their efficacy and immunogenicity in persons are not yet proven. DNA vaccine administration, vector mutations, and genome integration into the host gene are remaining issues. DNA vaccine platform was started in 1993 with promising results against influenza viruses, but the same results cannot be translated to humans yet. 54 INO-4800 is a DNA vaccine candidate developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals. It was designed to optimize the S protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The presence of humoral and T cell response in the preclinical trials suggest that INO-4800 can produce an effective immune response. The vaccine has entered phase I and II (NCT04336410) clinical trials. The clinical trial will evaluate the immunological profile, safety, and tolerability of the vaccine candidate. 55 Viral vectors vaccine is a promising prophylactic solution against a pathogen. These vaccines are specific in delivering the genes to the target cells, highly efficient in the gene transduction, and induce the immune response. Viral vectors vaccine provides prolonged time and enhanced antigenic protein expression and, therefore, has better prophylactic use as these vaccines trigger the cytotoxic T cells, which leads to the removal of the virus-infected cells. Viral vectors are grouped into replicating (measles virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) or non-replicating vectors (Adenoviruses (Ad) and poxviruses). Several vaccine developments rely on non-replicating Ads vector. These vectors are relatively safe, physically, and genetically stable, and do not integrate into the host genome. Ads vector can infect DCs and dividing or non-dividing cells. However, Ad vectors need high doses to induce the host immune response. 56, 57 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19): is a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that uses a non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus as a vector (ChAdOx1) and is modified to induce the S protein from SARS-CoV-2. AZD1222 is under development by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. This adenovirus is genetically modified so that it does not replicate in humans. 53 After vaccination, cells induce spike protein and the critical immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies that bind to spike glycoprotein and attack SARS-Cov-2 virus. Besides, the vaccine induces T-cells, which can attack the host cells if they get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Phase I and II studies show that the candidate AZD1222 vaccine given at a dose of 5 × 10 10 viral particles was safe and tolerated, however higher reactogenicity was displayed than the control vaccine. The reactogenicity decreased with 1 g paracetamol for the first 24 hours after vaccination. Generally, the two doses were enough to induce a potent submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2021:14 immune response in all the participants and had no severe adverse reactions. Phase III trials are currently ongoing in several countries. [56] [57] [58] [59] On June 29, 2020, the People's Republic of China's military received permission to use the Ad5-nCoV vaccine (Adenovirus vaccine) candidate developed by the People's Republic of China's CanSino Biologics Inc. as it was proved safe and efficient in the clinical trials (NCT04341389). Ad5-nCoV uses replication-defective human Ad5 as a vector and is modified to express the S protein. This vector was used for the Ebola vaccine (Ad5-EBO) development. Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate developed by the People's Republic of China's CanSino Biologics Inc. as it was proved safe and efficient in the clinical trials (NCT04341389). The phase I clinical trials showed four-fold in RBD and S protein-specific neutralizing antibodies and specific T cell responses. However, the pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity may antagonize both the antibody and the T cell responses before an immune response to the S protein develops. 60, 61 Coroflu (M2SR) is a unique influenza virus. It lacks a gene called M2 that limits the influenza virus to undergo only a single replication in cells. M2SR is modified by the insertion of the spike protein gene sequence of the SARS-CoV-2. It can enter into the host cell, thereby inducing an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. It is administered intra-nasally, mimicking the natural route of viral infection. The immune response is higher as compared to the intramuscular injections. It is in the preclinical phase. 62 LV-SMENP-DC vaccine: Dendritic cells are antigenpresenting cells which induce immune response via antigen presentation. Dendritic cells exist in the periphery and are active at engulfing and presenting exogenous antigens. LV-SMENP-DC vaccine is developed by modifying dendritic cells and T cell activation by the lentiviral vector to encode COVID-19 antigen. The subcutaneous inoculations of the vaccine present the cytotoxic T cells and generate the immune response. LV-SMENP is currently undergoing a phase I and II multicenter trial (NCT04276896) in healthy volunteers. 63, 64 On August 11, 2020, Russia approved the ""Sputnik V"" anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute. It is not clear if the completion of all phases of clinical trials were carried out. Phase III clinical trial for its effectiveness would be done after regulatory approval. Sputnik V uses a non-replicating viral vector ""adenovirus"" containing gene-specific spike protein like other vaccine candidates. The difference with other candidate vaccines is that Sputnik V uses two adenovirus vectors: Ad26 and Ad5, instead of a single serotype. In the first dose, Ad26 is given and, the second dose of Ad5 is administered after 21 days. This strategy has an advantage as, after the first dose, antibodies are produced against the Ad26 serotype. The second dose is of Ad5 serotype; therefore, the body is stimulated to produce an enhanced immune response. Phase I and II trial results of Sputnik V have shown antibody production in all the trial participants, though the sample size was small, and further studies will be carried out in the elderly. [65] [66] [67] [68] After the announcement of Sputnik-V, the Russian government received preliminary orders for greater than 1 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine from 20 countries. Now, Russia is manufacturing more than 500 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine. 68VLPs mimic the conformation of native viruses. VLPs contain almost all viral proteins, but lack a viral genome that causes disease transmission and non-structural proteins. Due to a lack of genetic material, VLPs cannot replicate in the host but can express both the cellular and humoral immune responses. VLP can be produced using a combination of structural proteins from various types of viruses and plants. Currently, several VLP-based vaccines are available such as HBV and HPV vaccines for prophylactic use. 69 Plants are an ideal platform for oral vaccine production. The genome for viral proteins is delivered to the plant using Agrobacterium bacteria. After infection, the gene of interest integrates into the plant genome and produce virus-like particles. Plant-based vaccines produced using Agrobacterium and Nicotiana benthamiana against influenza A viruses (A/ H1N1, A/H3N2), and avian influenza H5 (AIV) were effective, safe, and well-tolerated. This vaccine platform was displayed as a promising source of vaccine for Lyme disease, Newcastle disease, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and recombinant colicin M. Several studies proposed different recombinant VLP vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 viruses. 69, 70 Currently The RBD-HBsAg-VLPs-Covid vaccine based on the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 conjugated to the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) virus-like particles. 71, 72 Conclusion A vaccine is necessary to end the world's SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A successful vaccine is safe, effective, durable, and deployable to large populations. RNA viruses may mutate and this may make previously effective vaccines useless. Thus, development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV strains is crucial for protecting future SARS-CoV outbreaks. A broad spectrum SARS vaccine that is effective against all the Covses using ACE2 as their receptor can be applied immediately when we face the recurrent threat of Covs. Particularly, taking SARS-CoV-2 as an example, the virus might disappear before the vaccine is developed. Therefore, development of safe and broadspectrum vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-CoV-related viruses is of great significance for preventing humans from CoV infection. Most vaccine strategies aim to generate S-specific neutralizing antibodies. Vaccines based on RBD of S protein against SARS-CoV may efficiently cross neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Besides antigens, adjuvant can increase the immune response and reduce the amount of antigen needed for each dose of the vaccine.As of December 10, 2020, over 214 candidate vaccines are under development and 52 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials as shown in Table 1 and seven of them have entered phase 3 trials. Several of the candidates have been judged safe enough for use in humans and have shown All data are provided in the article or found from published papers as cited.","Ethiopia","first author","2021-01-19",1

Scientists, health officials and citizens have tried to anticipate and 22 explain why the epidemic initially (i.e., before novel interventions) unfolded differently among countries, 23 but only now has the relevant data reached sufficient global reach and temporal length to begin statistical 24 analyses. Existing studies that examine some of the factors that may contribute to differences among 25 countries together are generally applied to metrics such as mortality, daily and cumulative case numbers, 26 or effective reproduction number (1-4). These metrics are time varying and sensitive to reporting and 27 testing differences, and are therefore not easily comparable across countries. For instance, decreasing 28 testing would allow the reported cases to drop, making raw case reporting incomparable across countries.A key metric, R 0 , has the practical advantage of being reliably estimable (5) and comparable 30 across countries even if testing and reporting rates are different, so long as these rates are either 31 constant or change in roughly the same way over time. R 0 is the basic reproduction number that indicates 32 how many secondary infections are caused by an infected individual at the beginning of an epidemic (6).Without interventions, the portion of the population that is expected to be infected or immunized before 34 the epidemic ends would be 1-1/R 0 . For example, an R 0 of 3 implies that ⅔ of the population would have 35 to be infected or immunized by the end of the epidemic. R 0 for COVID-19 has variably been estimated 36 between 1.4 (7) and 8.9 (8), with a likely value of 2.5 (9). Many studies either implicitly assume or are 37 understood to imply that R 0 is intrinsic to the infectious disease (9), but it is increasingly acknowledged 38 that many non-interventive factors could affect heterogeneity in R 0 among local populations or countries 39 (10). Interventive responses that occur during the initial exponential phase of COVID-19 can be 40 understood as proximate causes of differences in R 0 across populations, but ultimately they are likely pre-41 adaptations anchored on existing social, demographic, and environmental factors. Later interventions 42 generally affect R e , the effective reproduction number at any given time during the epidemic (4).Covariates chosen belonged to seven categories: demographics, disease, economics, 62 environment, habitat, health, and social. All of these categories have been suggested previously as 63 possible factors for COVID-19 transmission. The most common factors previously studied were 64 temperature (11-24), pollution (13,25-31), precipitation/humidity (18,32,33), population density (34,35), 65 age structure (1,36,37), and population size (1,11,31). For these and additional covariates either 66 previously studied or only mentioned in the media, we rely on statistics measured at a national level. A 67 review of previously found effects on initial COVID-19 epidemic rates related to R 0 are documented in 68 Table 1 . We examined these categories simultaneously in order to better understand which group may 69 have a larger influence on R 0 and should therefore be investigated further at both the national and other 70 scales. This analysis is not meant to be exhaustive or definitive, but rather to help reveal baseline 71 epidemiological differences across countries, shape the direction of future research on COVID-19, and 72 understand infectious disease transmission in general.All data and code are available on a Github repository (38).The basic reproduction number R 0 (the dependent variable) is given by the formula (39) to fitting an exponential curve to early case numbers given that case numbers do plateau in reality. In 89 addition, the logistic growth model performs as well or better than more complicated models when 90 confronted with data (5,44). Mechanistic models with multiple compartments (45) and with time-91 dependent rates (46,47), may be more realistic for COVID-19 outbreaks that in some places exhibit 92 multiple peaks, but such models contain more parameters, require much more data, and are statistically 93 harder to infer reliably. Such complexity is also likely not necessary to describe the initial outbreaks, which 94 appear qualitative logistic ( Figure 1 ).Covariates 121 Next, we compiled data on predictors for each of the countries studied from seven categories 122 (demographics, disease, economics, environmental, habitat, health, and social) from publicly available 123 databases (Table 1 ). We chose covariates that are diverse, specific, and do not obviously covary; for 124 example, gross domestic product per capita was not used because it covaries with many other more 125 precise covariates. In addition, we chose covariates that are comparable across countries; for example,we chose nurses per capita over doctors per capita because in many countries, nurses are the primary 127 caregivers. For each predictor, we used the most recent available data, which ranged from 2000-2019.When appropriate, data reported in absolute numbers were divided by total population to obtain per 129 capita figures. Data with highly skewed distributions were log-transformed and all distributions were 130 centred and standardized before regression. Four additional covariates were examined but were 131 eliminated through sequential variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis based on the mixed effect 132 generalized additive model described in Section 2.3 (adapted from the 'rms::vif' package in 133 RStudio1.2.5033). The goal is to reduce the collinearity of the final covariate set, so that we can make 134 better statistical attributions to how each covariate affects R 0 . In the analysis, we eliminated the covariate 135 with the highest VIF and iterated the elimination procedure until a representative and epidemiologically 136 reasonable set was left (the set in Table 1 ). The eliminated covariates were: 1. population greater than 65 137 years old (50), 2. life expectancy at birth (50), 3. hospital beds per capita (50), and 4. mortality rate 138 attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (51).After compiling the variables, we fitted the generalized additive model (GAM) using the 'mgcv' 142 package in RStudio1.2.5033, to analyze the effects of the covariates listed in Table 1 , on the R 0 value 143 across the globe. The covariates are standardized for effect comparisons. The main advantage of GAMs 144 over traditional regression methods are their capability to model non-linear relationships (a common 145 feature of many datasets) between a response variable and multiple covariates using non-parametric 146 smoothers. The general formula of a GAM is: There are ongoing efforts to correct for these temporal biases based on delayed mortality rates (52,55), 169 but the results are currently not credible for smaller countries with poor reporting. At this point we must 170 rely on the reported case numbers, and use random effects to partially account for possible biases.We use the anova() function in R to compare the candidate models and see which one provides 172 the best parsimonious fit of the data. Because these models differ in the use of the random variables, 173 ANVOA will test whether or not including random effects leads to a significant improvement over using 174 just the given covariates without any random variables. For goodness of fits test, we use a chi-squared 175 test. The positive relationship between social media usage and R 0 observed here has not been 227 previously found for COVID-19. The trend may be proximally caused by the propagation of false 228 information on social media, for example in downplaying the potential danger of COVID-19, the 229 effectiveness of masks and social distancing, or propping up conspiracy theories on the disease (56).One study showed that more than 80% of online claims about COVID-19 were false at the beginning of 231 the pandemic (57). These proximal mechanisms, at least at the initial onset of COVID-19, seemed to 232 have overridden the potential benefits of social media as an accurate information spreader that allows contact rates and conforms with the main empirical trend (34). However, it is unclear why a low level of 256 city dwelling is also associated with a high R 0 , although the rise is relatively slight. In comparison to the 257 quadratic effects of youth and GINI inequality, the effect of city dwelling appears close to monotonic.Our analysis is based on coarse-grained country-level case data, without explicitly correcting R 0 259 estimates using temporal trends in testing, reporting, and mortality. The factors we analyzed hold across 260 regions within a country to some extent, but it can be argued that each factor or its substitute can be 261 measured more locally (10,65) and result in better statistical power. R 0 can also be estimated using less 262 phenomenological, more mechanistic models such as multiple-compartment (eg. susceptible-exposed-263 infectious-recovered-susceptible) (45), social network (66), or time-varying (46,47) models. However, 264 these approaches are more data intensive and not current available in many countries. Our country-level 265 analysis of R 0 serves as a coarse grain baseline for future analyses pending data availability. An 266 international perspective like the one we took here can help us understand COVID-19 in a broader 267 context, even though we sacrifice the ability to infer local causality.The factors influencing R 0 identified here reflect the naive or intrinsic factors that may determine a Ethics and consent: All authors have been personally and actively involved in substantial work leading 305 to the paper, and will take public responsibility for its content.Competing Interest Statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Ghana","abstract","2021-01-25",1

The impact of the pandemic is far-reaching and access to health commodities is not spared. Proper drug supply is critical for a robust healthcare system. It determines the extent at which the population are likely to have access to essential medicines and treatments. In Rwanda, the pharmaceutical sector heavily relies on imports [1] . In 2019, Rwanda spent around $ 97.6 million on drugs import alone, and it is expected to increase by $102.5 million in 2024 [1] . About 20% of these import expenses are expected to be reduced by the establishment of the first pharmaceutical factory in the country [2] . Public and private sectors preserve the drug supply chain in Rwanda. In public sector, the drug supply chain system allows public health institutions to obtain health commodities directly from central medical store and/or district pharmacies [3] . The Medical Production and Procurement Division (MPPD) under Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), performs the procurement, storage, and distribution of health commodities to public health institutions and it is regarded as central medical store. MPPD is the main supplier of all pharmaceutical commodities ranging from essential medicines to laboratory reagents. However, district pharmacies serve as the distribution point of pharmaceutical products to district hospitals and health centres. Public sector can also get an authorization from the Ministry of Health or/and district pharmacies that allow them to buy pharmaceutical commodities from private wholesalers in case they are not Open Access 14:12 in their stores. In private sector, many wholesale pharmaceutical companies import drugs directly from international manufacturers, and local drug compounding pharmacies. Community pharmacies and private health clinics or hospitals get medical commodities from these private wholesalers.With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, the drug supply system was interrupted leaving many stores from small local pharmacies to the big medical stores running out of stock. The reasons were limited importation of goods from abroad (mainly china and India), and the panic buying practice among the customers and some institutions when responding to the pandemic, and avoiding falling in possible health commodities shortage. The government of Rwanda restricted the movement of people crossing the borders, but allowed the passage of goods and cargo as a way to keep the continuous supply of goods including health commodities. However, since the demand is too high and no current local drug manufacturers to compensate the available gap, the drug shortage continues to be a major issue in some settings. Drug and medicines accessibility, availability and affordability should be the core of any drug management policy [4] ; however, it is unwarranted to consider that in a country with limited local manufacturing. This paper aims at providing the details on current situation of drug supply chain in Rwanda, and the efforts and shortfalls faced in times of COVID-19 pandemic.Despite Rwanda being affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic, different global institutions and bodies have recognized the efforts made to contain the spread of the virus. Maintaining the continuous supply of health commodities to COVID-19 patients as well as general population is the challenging issue that requires regular monitoring. However, Rwanda realized that it could only deal with such scenario through a properly coordinated and multi-sectoral approach [5] . Many factors influence the current efforts to maintain the country's drug supply amid the pandemic.At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multiministerial committee was established, and led by the prime minister. The team is not only dealing with the implementation of COVID-19 response and containment plans, but also ensures the continuous availability of essential health commodities to the COVID-19 patients, frontline workers as well as general population. Rwanda welcomed the support of several partners, and made advisory team of scientists to help the COVID-19 Joint Task Force (JTF) [6] . The panic practice of buying too many drugs and other health commodities that was adopted by Rwandese due to the pandemic was controlled. This was done by establishing the regulations that require pharmacists to serve customers with limited quantities per person and with proper judgements. The government endorsed the local manufacturing of COVID-19 response equipment ranging from hand sanitizers, to other personal protective equipment (PPE). The security of the country was maintained and all pharmacies, hospitals and many other essential businesses were greenlighted to continue the services but using 50% of the employees to avoid overcrowding. This allowed the patients on long-term treatments and chronic diseases to access drugs when needed. Rwanda is blessed with good governance and strong cooperation between its citizens and local leaders, and this has hugely contributed to good responses made to contain the virus and ensure medicine security is prioritized.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rwanda was among the Africa's fastest growing economies. Economic growth exceeded 10% in 2019, and the strong growth was expected in 2020. This was highly contributed by the large public investments in the implementation of the national strategy of transformation [7] . Many pharmaceutical companies are currently investing in the country, with ApexBiotech being the first company licensed by Rwanda Food and Drug Authority (RFDA) to start its operations, and it is currently in the final establishment phase [2] . In a bid to avoid the redirection of fiscal resources to the COVID-19 emergency response, the World Bank Group provided Rwanda with a credit of $ 14.25 million to fund the Rwanda COVID-19 Emergency Response Project [7] . Rwanda has a clear economic plan that attracts foreign investors, and pharmaceutical sector is facing a considerable growth in this case.Medicines were generally affordable in Rwanda prior to the pandemic. The prices of essential medicines and drugs in public sectors are lower compared to the international procurement prices. In private sectors, the prices are double, but still it is 30% below the international reference prices [8] . During the pandemic, the country faced an increase in drug and health commodities demand with limited importations, and this resulted in some prices of the pharmaceutical products being raised above the normal range. However, the Rwandan Ministry of Trade and Industry warned, inspected and fined any company that raised the prices of essential commodities including pharmaceuticals amid the pandemic [9] . The list of pharmaceuticals on high demandRwanda is currently privatizing the pharmaceutical sector. This is because the current regulations restrict MPPD from contacting and importing pharmaceuticals directly from international manufacturers. In this case, MPPD uses intermediate suppliers that import drugs and other pharmaceutical products from manufacturers and sell them with increased prices that make health commodities quite expensive for public sectors. Therefore, Rwanda Medical Supply (RMS) is in its introductory phase to replace MPPD [10] . RMS will serve as the central medical store that has its full authorization to negotiate prices and import directly from international manufacturers. District pharmacies will continue to serve as a distribution points and warehouses of RMS, and public health institutions will obtain all pharmaceutical products and medical equipment directly from there. District pharmacies will no longer be commercial entities, and this will reduce the pharmaceutical costs as well as public healthcare cost in general. The adaptation of the privatization policy will reduce the lead-time of pharmaceuticals as well as mitigate the country's drug supply shortage.Rwanda like many other African countries relies on China and India for their medicine security [11] . This has been a trending issue for years and with the COVID-19 pandemic, the scenario worsened. The pharmaceutical industry is among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the increase in demand with limited access to low materials. In Rwanda, drug supply chain is mainly challenged by lack of enough local drug manufacturers and high dependence on international manufacturers. Although the country has made it easy to start and operate businesses for both local and foreigners, there is a huge investment gap in pharmaceutical sector. Lack of capacity to manufacture good formulations because of skills gap on product development and formulation expertise, is not only the Rwandan challenge, but also for the whole East African Community (EAC) [12] . Even though, most of East African countries borders were closed during the pandemic, the trade of essential businesses like food and pharmaceuticals were waived, allowing Rwanda to continue the consumption of drugs manufactured in other EAC member states. However, due to the fact that Kenyan pharmaceutical sector was also challenged by limited access to low materials and the fight to satisfy its local market [13] , Rwanda pharmaceutical supply shortage persisted.Indian-owned pharmaceutical companies in Rwanda are the ones that dominate the market. They sell drugs to local wholesalers at reasonable prices and local wholesalers add some amount of money as a profit since they are commercial entities. This brings uncertainty in the drug market, and with COVID-19, many products became high-priced. During the time of COVID-19, all the big pharmaceutical companies, whether Indian or locally owned, were challenged by the export restrictions imposed by India and many other supplying countries [14] . This led to shortage of drugs and other health commodities in the Rwandan market. The prices of different drugs increased regardless of whether they are selling new stocks, or the stocks made before the pandemic. Some local pharmaceutical companies have shifted their tension from making their owned local products, to manufacturing hand sanitizers, facemasks and many other PPEs that are currently needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has led to complete shortage of some products that are usually needed by the population. Since other non-essential businesses were closed, Rwanda is also facing an upsurge in new pharmacy businesses, which increases the pharmaceuticals demand and competition in the market. [15] The delay of ApexBiotech pharmaceutical company to start its operation that was expected in April 2020 has also contributed to the existing medicines and drug shortage, as it was to reduce 20% of pharmaceutical import.Rwanda, like many other African countries, needs to strengthen the pharmaceutical sector. It is with no doubt that, Rwanda has made a tremendous work to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the country's drug supply; however, efforts are still needed to invest in local pharmaceutical production as a way to minimize import expenses in the country. Good policy on drug importation, production and distribution should be enforced to avoid any drug shortage that may be encountered in the Rwandan drug market. We also recommend that Rwanda should invest in herbal medicine research towards ensuring medicine security in the country. ","Rwanda","abstract","2021-01-20",1

With the rise of potential infections in the healthcare setups, disinfection of this medical equipment's should not be pardoned. [1] [2] [3] [4] Spaulding proposed three categories (critical, semi-critical and non-critical) as the basis for selecting the prevention practice or process to use (eg, disinfection) when caring for patients. This classification has stood the test of time and still serves as a good basis for setting priorities for any infection prevention program. 5 The guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classify stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer as both non-critical and semi-critical medical devicesdepending on the association it has with intact and nonintact skins. 6 Stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers are the commonly used medical equipment's to assess the health of patients. In practice, thermometer is used to assess the patients' body temperatures at least twice daily, and the common anatomical sites for measurements are oral, rectal, and axillary temperatures. It is well documented that this medical equipment's can harbor pathogenic microorganisms. 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] For instance, potential pathogens cultured from stethoscopes include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3, 20 Clostridium difficile, 8 Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 3, [10] [11] [12] Vancomycinresistant enterococci, 3, 15, 16 and Acinetobacter baumannii. 17 Huang et al reported that highly resistant bacteria, MRSA can potentially linger up to 9 days on stethoscopes. 21 Additionally, a review by Wolfensberger et al found that the diaphragms of the stethoscopes become colonized by bacteria quickly; acquiring more pathogens than any part of the doctors' hands except the fingertips. 22 In many low-income settings, acquiring patients' body temperatures using non-infrared thermometers are still predominant practices, and these devices travel among healthcare workers across the hospital. This entails that non-infrared thermometers are often exposed to body fluids, and travel without proper disinfection may advance the spread of cross-infection. [23] [24] [25] Rectal thermometers and reusable oral thermometers may possibly contact with body fluids, hence, wager contaminations, and therefore are unsuitable in this travel fast COVID-19 pandemic situation.The novelty of COVID-19 pandemic -along with its uncertainties -makes it critical for health authorities to develop appropriate medical equipment and environmental disinfection regulations to keep the safety for both patients and clinicians in the countenance of the current COVID-19 pandemic. 26 The oft-cited Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, advocating for non-critical medical equipment, such as stethoscopes, should be disinfected once daily or weekly. 6 The above standards might not be reflective on the current danger that a contaminated stethoscope may feasibly jeopardize patients' and physicians' safety -given the survival potential of coronavirus to thrive on different surfaces for an extended period of time. 27 It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on steel and plastic surfaces for 72 hours or more. 28 The analyses of 22 studies also reveal that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) persist on inanimate surfaces like metals, glasses or plastics for up to 9 days. 27 This poses concerns among patients contracting COVID-19 from contaminated stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers, even if this has not been directly documented yet -at least the theoretical risk of COVID-19 is anticipated to be existing, and just as same as how one cleans his hands regularly, cleaning anything that contacts the patients would be potentially beneficial to their safety -as evidence suggests that human-to-human transmission of novel human coronavirus and were explicated with incubation times, and its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or objects (such as medical equipment's). 29 In Ethiopia, physicians habitually carry their stethoscopes around their necks or in their pouches, and on occasions brings them to their homes, as well. While noninfrared thermometer kept in the wards; and in many occasions, they were used by multiple healthcare workers in different patients. These consequently augments the risk of transmission of infections from the hospitals to homes, and vice versa. Up to date, no specific guidelines have been available in the country solely on the disinfection of this medical equipment. 30 To our knowledge, there are no available studies on this aspect that determine the level of physician's stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometer disinfection at the national level. This study, therefore, describes the level of stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfection practices among physicians and determine its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, an attempt was made to identify factors associated with stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfection practices.A web-based cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Ethiopia from June 1 to 20, 2020 using Google form with a consent form appended to it. An internet-based survey was utilized due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the government's strict regulations on face-to-face interviews submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is located in the horn of Africa. It is one in the world with low medical doctor densities (0.769/10000 population), which is far below the minimum threshold density. The number of physicians increased to 8395 (in the year 2018) from a number of 1936 in 2003. Withal, there are 2528 specialist medical practitioners in Ethiopia. 31 The stethoscope and non-infrared thermometers are the customary tools that physicians use daily in the examination of patients in Ethiopia. Up to date, there is no regulation on the screening for multi-drug resistant bacteria and isolation practices for patients with MDROs. In addition, there is no specific guideline solely for reusable medical equipment processing. In many cases, alcohol-based solutions of iodine and 60-90% alcohols (ethyl or isopropyl) are the commonly used antiseptic solutions for disinfection of reusable medical equipment's including stethoscope and non-infrared thermometers, if they are not visibly soiled. In some cases, healthcare workers in Ethiopia used high-level disinfection (HLD) for non-infrared thermometers if they are contaminated by blood and body fluids.All medical -doctors, specialist medical practitioners (surgeons, pediatricians, orthopedics, and internist), residents, and interns -who are able to access and utilize at least an Email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Telegram, and by Tweeter, who consented to participate, and those working in healthcare facilities were eligible in the survey. In addition, physicians practicing in Ethiopia at the of data collection were eligible and included in our study. With exceptions, physicians who do not engage in direct contact with patients and those who work in any administrative areas were excluded.The sample size was determined using Epi Info™ 7.1.1.14 statistical software (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) using single population proportion formula with the assumption of 95% confidence level, 5% precision, considering the proportion of healthcare workers who had safe stethoscope disinfection (disinfection after every use) was 39.7%, 2 and considering 25% nonresponse rate. The calculated sample size was (n=460).An online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-administered structured questionnaires via Google form with a consent form appended to it. The study participants who were willing to partake in the present survey and could access the Google form link obtain an informed consent sheet as a pre-requirement before proceeding to participate in the actual survey. Explicit information about the aim, scope, and eligibility criteria along with the link was purveyed. The call for participation was dispatched thru Emails, Messenger, Tweeter, LinkedIn, and Telegram. Upon receiving the Google form link, the participants were auto directed to the information about informed consent and their voluntariness to participate. The informed consent and questionnaire was protected by a secured login and privacy policies. The confidentiality of the study participants was safeguarded throughout the data collection.An internet-based, self-administered closed-ended questionnaire was utilized. The online data collection tools were created using the Google Forms provided by Google ™ and were constructed using the English language. The tools consisted of four sections, with a total of 25 questions. The first section was analogous to the participants' socio-demographic characteristics -including age, gender, professional titles, working department, service year, type of healthcare facility, place of residence, and history of COVID-19-related training. The second section comprised six questions relating to stethoscope disinfection practices during COVID-19 pandemic, such as ""Have you ever disinfected your stethoscope?"", ""How often do you disinfect your stethoscope?"", ""Which stethoscope part you frequently disinfect?"", and ""Do you disinfect your stethoscope after examining your last patient?"" along with questions about reasons for not disinfecting their stethoscopes. The third section of the questionnaire encompassed four questions pertaining to topics about non-infrared thermometer disinfections. Finally, the last section composed of five questions about the physicians' awareness related to stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfections. The data collection tool was tested for internal consistency and the resulting Cronbach's Alpha value of 0.841 was obtained.In the physicians' self-report regarding stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfection practices, respondents were posed to specify their usual practices (during COVID-19 pandemic) by uttering to them ""How often do Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress 3247 you disinfect your stethoscope?"". Physicians who claimed that they have disinfected their stethoscopes after every use/after contact with patients were coded as ""1"" and labeled as ""disinfection after every use"", if otherwise ""0"". Similarly, physicians who have claimed that they have disinfected non-infrared thermometers after every use were coded as ""1"", and zero, if otherwise.The independent variables include gender, age, years of service, type of healthcare facility, availability of reminders about medical equipment disinfections in their respective working units (eg, poster), availability of disinfectant solutions in their working units, and awareness on stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfections.Completed questionnaires were extracted from Google Forms in Excel spreads and were exported to STATA version 14.0 for the analyses. Descriptive statistics were employed to illustrate the data. Multiple binary logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the outcome variables (stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfection after every use). All the independent variables were tested for potential multicollinearities before placing them in the multivariable logistic regression models. The multicollinearity effects were assessed with a cut of off point of variation inflation factor (VIF) of greater than ten. Finally, significant variables were discerned based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), and results were deemed significant if they reflect p< 0.05. To scrutinize the accuracy of the final formulated model, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the overall goodness of fit was used. Accordingly, the overall goodness of fit was 0.799 and 0.163 for stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfection after every use models, respectively.The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Madda Walabu University Goba Referral Hospital (Ref.NO 01/02/12594). The respondents penned the online questionnaires anonymously, voluntarily, and independently. The privacy and confidentiality of the study participants were also safeguarded throughout the data collection. An information letter was incorporated on the first page of every questionnaire which covered information about the study description, eligibility criteria, voluntary participation, and confidentiality. Also, the contact details of the investigators (name, phone number, email address, and their affiliations) for any inquiry were mounted on the top of the questionnaire. All participants were assumed to only proceed on the survey after reading the consent and acknowledging engagement. Accordingly, electronic informed consent was sought from the study participants as pre-requisites before they are able to annex the survey.A total of 422 (422/460, response rate of 91.7%) physicians filled the online forms. The study participants composed-62.8% medical doctors, 33.6% specialist medical practitioners, and 3.6% residents. Of these, 368 (87.20%) were males, 388 (91.94%) are currently working in governmental healthcare facilities, and 238 (56.40%) have less than 3 years of work experience. The mean age of the study participants was 30.13 (± 4.34) years (range: 22-55) and 228 (54.03%) were in the age group of 26-30 (Table 1) .As seen in Table 2 , the proportion of stethoscope disinfection after every use was 13.9% (95% CI: 10.9-17.6). A quarter of the physicians delineated that they never disinfected their stethoscopes. Fifty-four percent of them also reported spending only 20 or fewer seconds per stethoscope disinfection. The proportion of the physicians who reported about disinfecting the different parts of the stethoscope variegated as well (diaphragm, 39.51%; diaphragm, tubing, and earpieces, 28.40%; diaphragm and earpieces, 23.77%, earpieces, 7.72%; plastic tubing, 0.62%). Figure 1 exhibits the reported barriers to stethoscope disinfection. More than one-third (35.9%) of the physicians outlined that they cried out for access to stethoscope disinfectants when needed. Factors, such as forgetfulness (29.3%) and negligence (25.2%) were the frequently cited barriers to such. Nevertheless, 378 (89.57%) of respondents believed that stethoscopes necessitated to be disinfected after every use.The odds ratios for a unit change on each covariate are delineated thru the binary logistic regression model in 29-4.92 ). In addition, the availability of stethoscope disinfectants at the workplace significantly increased the odds of disinfection after every use (AOR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.29-7.10). Amid the participants, disinfection after every use was significantly greater among resident physicians compared to those of general practitioners (AOR: 4.61; 95% CI: 1.29-16.52). On the contrary, the odds of disinfection after every use were significantly lesser among those who reported using a shared stethoscope (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.92).Three hundred sixty-six respondents, 86.73% concurred that the non-infrared thermometers need to be disinfected after every use, to which 20.37% (95% CI: 16.-78-24.51) reported on disinfecting succeeding every use, and two fifths (40.53%) of physicians sadly reported that they have never disinfected any thermometers ( Figure 2 ). In this study, 141 (33.41%) of the respondents reported that they have disinfected the noninfrared thermometers the last time they used them ( Table 4 ).In multivariable analyses, the odds of disinfection after every use were significantly higher among female physicians as compared to the males (AOR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.21-4.36). Among the physicians, the odds of disinfection after every use were significantly higher in resident physicians (AOR: 7.10; 95% CI: 2.30-21.95) than those of general practitioners (Table 5 ).Upholding to the core values of nonmaleficence, physicians should be more diligent in providing safe domains for their patients. In this study, less than a fifth (13.9%) of the physicians disinfect their stethoscopes after every use, as needed; and a quarter (25.59%) of the respondents uttered that they have never disinfected their stethoscopes. This trend is similar to the antecedent studies done in different countries. 4,32-35 Evidence from the present study showed that the top three reasons for low disinfection practice among physicians in Ethiopia were lack of disinfectant in the work place, forgetfulness, and negligence. Overcoming these barriers through strengthening stethoscope disinfection culture and infection prevention and patient safety initiatives is needed.As the person-to-person transmission of novel coronavirus has been outlined in the hospital settings, 36 consistent and correct stethoscope disinfection should be observed after each use on patients. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Interestingly, technological advancements in the area of single-use aseptic diaphragm barriers provide a promising result for stethoscope hygiene. 42 Messina et al also propounded the utilization of pocket-held UV-LED devices which would be attached on the stethoscope diaphragms which will provide automatic disinfection of the stethoscope membranes. 43 On the downside, Alali et al connoted that despite the use of alcohol-based cleaner for stethoscope hygiene, physicians were ill-fated in eradicating all pathogenic microorganisms. 44 Often times, dialogues surrounding medical disinfections tend to focus only on critical equipment used for invasive procedures, like gastrointestinal endoscopes. However, essential medical equipment is easily neglected -such as non-infrared thermometers -but these can be prime sources of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). 45, 46 In resource limited settings, including Ethiopia surveillance for body temperatures using non-contact digital thermometers are still shortly supplied, and the use of non-infrared thermometers are withal customary -often assumed sanitary, unless visibly soiled. In this study, only a fifth of the physicians disinfected thermometers after every use, and a significant number of them (40.53%) never disinfected their thermometers at all. This finding has paramount implications in combating COVID-19, as contamination of routinely used devices in the healthcare settings are the possible sources of infections. 27, 29 A systematic review on the relationship between shared patient care items and HAIs manifested that potential pathogens and multiple resistant organisms present on noninvasive portable clinical items (NPIs) in routine, non-outbreak conditions -and in a variety of settings affirms the need to improve NPIs decontamination practices. 1 In multivariable analyses, stethoscope disinfections after every use were significantly associated with the availability of the disinfectants in the workplaces. Previous studies also identified deficiencies on access to disinfection materials as potential barriers to disinfections after every use. 32 In resource-limited settings, physicians often rely on clinical appraisals using the stethoscope, particularly the assessment of respiratory dysfunctions in COVID-19 positive patients, 33 and eventually, these can cause the contagion of physicians and patients. Considering the communicability of the virus, the use of ultrasound is now recommended by Buonsenso et al as essential in the safe management of the COVID-19 pandemic; après it can allow the concomitant execution of clinical examination and lung imaging at the bedside by the same doctor. 40 However, in resource-limited settings, this may not be applicable. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that ensuring the availability of disinfectant solutions may precede a positive influence on disinfection compliance. Patel et al also argued that, at this point, it is difficult to answer if the stethoscope is a necessary tool or an unnecessary evil during COVID-19 pandemic, but removing it altogether from the care of patients with COVID-19 does not seem practical. And suggested basic guiding principles such as use of personal stethoscopes, use disposable isolation stethoscope and cleaning of stethoscope after patient auscultation with predefined stethoscope cleaning protocols. 47 In this study, the odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use were significantly reduced among those who reported the use of shared stethoscopes. In our point of view, sharing stethoscopes are detrimental, and may pose risks to physicians. Similar conclusions about the sharing of personal items have been described by WHO. 29 We also believe that, if unavoidably stethoscopes are shared, it is paramount to disinfect the stethoscopes meticulously. Another fact but not of utmost significance, access to disinfectants in the workplaces increase the odds of non-infrared thermometer disinfections after ever use, which is in line with previous studies. 48, 49 Lastly, the present study clearly showed that providing trainings are beneficial and significantly increases the odds of disinfection after every use. Hence, public health authorities should focus on improving the awareness level of physicians through onjob trainings and expand reusable medical equipment culture in every healthcare setting. Additionally, achieving and assuring availability of personal stethoscopes for every physician in the era of COVID-19 must receive the highest priority. The Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) of Ethiopia should works towards the improvement of stethoscope hygiene culture in the country, along with intervention that are proven to be effective in stethoscope cleaning, including barriers, caps, and UV lights.This study has a number of limitations. First, recall bias may have affected our results. Second, external validation survey responses regarding direct observation on the physician's disinfection practices were not executed. Third, the potential for social desirability biases among survey respondents are present, although the low reported stethoscope and non-infrared thermometer disinfections after ever use suggest that responses may not reflect the physicians' actual behaviors. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of the survey does not allow the cause-and-effect relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Fifth, we our study did not assess questions, such as how the non-infrared thermometers are stored, what proportion of these thermometers are used for oral, rectal, axillary temperature measurement, and the type cleaning practices physicians employed based on site of used. And finally, this study should be generalizable for the physicians working in the healthcare facilities of this country.In summary, less than a fifth of the physicians disinfected their stethoscopes after every use, and a significant number of respondents reported that they have never disinfected their non-infrared thermometers. This study has reflected disturbing inadequate disinfection practices among physicians, whereby patient safety is of germane priority in the era of COVID-19. In this regard, physicians should be exigent and more vigilant in disinfecting these commonly used medical devices. Furthermore, this study provides empirical evidence on the association between the availability of disinfectants in the working units, and stethoscope disinfection after every use. With respect, measures should be taken by health authorities in upraising the current practices of disinfection through implementations of simple interventions, such as provisions of training Data are available from the corresponding author upon a reasonable request.We would like to thank all study participants take part in this survey.

IPV is widely accepted in many low-and middle-income countries, including Nigeria, because of traditional norms that support male dominance [3] . In Nigeria, the past-year prevalence of physical, sexual or emotional violence by a partner had been reported in rates as high as 69% [4] . Notably, violence against women in the home may also involve abuse of children as well as other household members [1, 5] . IPV is also associated with a multitude of poor mental, sexual and reproductive health outcomes [6] .Emergency situations, including epidemics, increase incidence of violence against women, especially IPV.The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increase in IPV due to the ways in which control measures were implemented. Studies have documented an upsurge in IPV around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (state of isolation or restricted access instituted as a security measure) [7] [8] [9] . For instance, the lockdown in the China province of Hubei was associated with more than a threefold increase in cases of IPV [10] . Another report documented 33%, 30% and 25% rise in IPV cases in Singapore, France and Cyprus, and Argentina respectively [9] . Reports from other countries including Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, and the US also substantiate a soar in IPV occurrence and demand for shelter during the COVID-19 lockdown [9, 10] .The situation of heightened IPV related to the lockdown is also apparent in Nigeria. In Nigeria, to control the spread of the virus, the Federal Government declared a total lockdown in two states (Lagos and Ogun) and the Federal Capital Territory, which lasted from the 30th of March, 2020 until the 2nd of May [11] . While the extent of the lockdown varied by state, all states imposed some level of lockdown ordering people to stay at home [12] . During this time of the lockdown in Nigeria, partner violence has been shown to have increased significantly, up to 56%. In the first two weeks of lockdown, IPV cases rose from 346 (March) to 794 (early April) [13] . The Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team reported that hotline calls more than doubled during the lockdown in the state. The response team added extra handlers on its hotlines to cope with the number of calls they are receiving [13] .During COVID-19 lockdowns, existing but limited evidence suggests that the increase in incidence of violence against women, especially IPV, may be because victims remain confined to their homes with perpetrators [8, 9] . The lockdown also meant limited options for women to seek immediate assistance or help (beyond hotline calls), given women's restricted mobility as well as the limited health, legal, and social service infrastructure available [8, 14] . In addition, COVID-19 lockdown may have decreased informal mechanisms of social support through family and close friends, where in Nigeria (and across the globe), most women are more likely to seek these types of informal support for help with IPV [4, 13, [15] [16] [17] . One other major factor attributed to the increase in IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic has included economic stress due to disruption of income and earning power, resulting in reduced access to basic necessities and services [8, 14] . Previous research has documented economic stressors experienced by males to be associated with increased IPV perpetration [18] .Understanding the specific scenarios of IPV women have experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown, including the types and severity of IPV, will be important to better support women experiencing IPV during the COVID-19 lockdown, as well as other similar events in the future. This paper aims to describe women's experiences of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on case reports in Nigeria given the high rates of IPV reported in the country.This paper draws on information retrieved from media coverage and reports from an organisation that respond to violence against women during the lockdown. Seven cases identified from: (1) an organisation serving abused women (n = 4), (2) media reports from the internet (n = 3) are reported. The seven cases reported came from three southern states of Nigeria. The organisation providing data on cases was one of the main one serving women in Southern Nigeria during the lockdown and had worked with victim-survivors prior to the lockdown.During the lockdown, the organisation shared COVID-19 palliatives (food items) to women in indigenous communities. The organisation also provided contact information for women in need of help to get in touch. Hence, women who experienced abuse during the lockdown were able to obtain support and linked with other sources of help. As part of their service delivery, the organisation usually obtains verbal consent for information provided by clients to be used for research purposes. Thus, informed consent is obtained by the head of the organisation and documented in client's record. The organization asked clients to consent to their deidentified data or information being used for research purposes. Data was accessed by asking the head of the organisation to discuss specific case summaries seen during the COVID-19 lockdown. Media reported cases, including 'Twitter' were identified using Google Search in May 2020. The searches were conducted using the different keywords such as: wife beating, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, physical violence, sexual violence, lockdown, COVID-19, coronavirus, Nigeria. The searches using different keywords returned similar results. Altogether in the electronic media, 7 distinct cases of domestic violence were identified. Only media report of IPV were considered for inclusion and analysis in the present study. Cases (n = 2) were excluded if it was uncertain that they occurred during the lockdown and if they were other forms of interpersonal violence such as; fighting between neighbours and non-partner rape (n = 2). All the cases narrated occurred in States within Nigeria.All cases were de-identified, no names were given and we changed details of employment, age, family information, and other related information of the case reports. The women who sought help from the NGO organisation were followed up by telephone calls. They were also encouraged to keep in touch to foster access to justice and promote safety. However, it could not be ascertained if all the cases reported from the media were followed up. Ethical approval was waived by the University of Ibadan/ University College Hospital (UI/UCH) research ethics committee. This study is a secondary data analysis and involved no direct contact with human participants. It is a review of media reports and records of an organisation serving abused women. Any possible linkage with the clients or organisation were deliberately removed.A case of IPV during lockdown was defined as any IPV that occurred between March 30 and May 2, 2020, which was the period of total lockdown in most states of the country. Experience of any form of IPV was documented which included:-physical (beating, hitting, choking), sexual (unwanted sexual intercourse, pressure to have sex without the partner's consent), psychological (abuse, humiliation, threat) or economic (refusing to give financial support for the family upkeep, forcefully taking wife's money/economic resources).Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The following data were extracted from the reports obtained: (1) Type(s) of IPV experienced during the lockdown (2) Trigger(s) of the IPV (3) How lockdown exacerbated IPV experience (4) Health consequence(s) of IPV (5) Coping strategies with IPV experience during the lockdown.Seven cases of IPV were identified through IPV service organizations and media searches. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. There were also reports of threats to evict women from their home, and in two cases, women were locked out of their houses in the middle of the night. Notably, losing housing security during a pandemic lockdown threatens women's ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19. It also has the potential to leave women with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women's income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women's social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. (See Table 1 for a summary of each case of IPV identified).This paper highlights the experiences of seven women experiencing IPV during the COVID-19 lockdown.While data indicate that in many countries there has been an increase in IPV associated with the COVID-19 lockdowns [7, 16, [19] [20] [21] , less is known about the scenarios of IPV occurring and how women's experiences of IPV may be intersecting with COVID-19 lockdowns or other restrictions. Our findings suggest that the lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women's security and ability to protect themselves from COVID-19 exposure. Women reported that social isolation and lack of access to formal services inhibited their ability to get support as a result of IPV during the lockdown. Additionally, economic stressors associated with the COVID-19 lockdown were noted by women as aggravating or resulting in IPV. While more research will be needed, these case summaries provide some initial insight to women's experiences of IPV unique to the COVID-19 lockdown.The case studies we reported suggest that perpetrators of IPV may be engaging in violence, or threats of violence that could increase women's risk for COVID-19 exposure, or use the COVID-19 lockdown as a platform to provoke fear and threaten women's overall security during the pandemic. Cases involved perpetrators threatening to kick victims out of the house and in two cases, the perpetrator locked the woman out of her house during the stay at home order. Such threats of homelessness may be especially fear provoking during the pandemic lockdown, where everything was closed and there was no opportunity to obtain transportation or to reach formal or informal support sources. Future research with larger samples, including quantitative surveys, will be needed to better understand whether these types of threats were common among women experiencing IPV during the COVID-19 lockdown. While we identified threats to women's housing security, there may likely be other types of scenarios where perpetrators used the COVID-19 pandemic or lockdown to provoke fear and threaten women's security. This is an important area for future research that is new to the literature on IPV, and has not been identified in previous work.Apart from the social stress of the pandemic, our findings suggest that economic stressors may underlie increased reports of IPV perpetration during theWe have changed details of employment, names, age, family information, and other related information to keep the identity of individuals confidential and privateMrs A is in her thirties and works in a hospital. She and Mr A had experienced disagreements before the lockdown, but it never involved physical violence, their disagreements were usually settled by family members or religious leaders Two weeks into the lockdown, the disagreements became more serious and involved physical violence. Mr A also threatened to take the children away from Mrs A. At a point, Mrs A was banished from their bedroom to the living room, a place she stayed for few days When the threats to take the children away became intense, Mrs A moved her children to her mother's place. The movement of the children aggravated her experience of physical violence. Mrs A was forced to rent a small place to save her life and consequently take her children back, but the landlord did not allow her to move in after learning that she is a health worker and feared contracting the COVID-19. Mrs A had no choice but to continue to endure the abuseMiss B was restricted by the ""stay at home"" order, which required her to remain in her boyfriend's house. One morning, the couple had an argument over food shortage in the house, and the boyfriend's drinking habit. After the argument, Miss B's boyfriend locked her up in the house and went out till evening. Miss B's boyfriend returned home drunk, and physically attacked Miss B. The physical violence resulted in a cut in her lips, black eyes, bruises and swelling all over her body. Her aunt had to take her to the health facility for treatment With the support of her aunt, Miss B reported the incident to the police, but they were told to go home and resolve her differences with her boyfriend, especially since the courts were closed and so there is no way to pursue the case legally. Miss B's aunt was not happy that the boyfriend was let off so lightly and so linked Miss B with an NGO which reported the case again to the PoliceMrs C got married in 2019 and is currently pregnant. Before the lockdown, their young marriage was filled with happiness and love, they both had busy work schedules. The two saw the announcement of the lockdown as an opportunity to have the honeymoon they could not have because of the high demand of her husband's work. However, Mrs C started to experience physical abuse when she would not accede to her husband's excessive sexual demands. During one of such events, Mrs C's head was hit on the floor and then on the wall. Her cries attracted neighbours attention, who then came out and saw her trying to jump to safety from the balcony of their one storey apartment. Mrs C stated that she wanted to go back to her 'father's house' . Mrs C also reported that her husband has stopped her from calling her parents or siblings. On one of the following nights, Mr C locked her out (till midnight) of the house for phoning her mother. He had warned her never to call her mother again if she ""liked herself""This was a sensational story reported on the television and all social media platforms in the country. After a few weeks of the lockdown, Mrs D was seen in a video clip running from her house onto the street dressed with just a cloth wrapped around her body. She was followed by Mr D, who was wearing a pair of shorts and singlet and was trying to coax her back inside their house. Mrs D was seen complaining out loud that she did not want to have sex again. She said that she was engaged in sex with her husband throughout the night, yet her husband insisted on her having sex again. She asked him if he wanted to snuff the life out of her. The neighbourhood was nearly deserted as everyone was lockdown in their homes and it was early in the morning. The few people on the street just looked onLate in the month of April, the story of Mrs E, a woman in her forties, was reported in the media. Mrs E has four children. She stated that the IPV began after she asked Mr E for money to buy foodstuff to stock up for the lockdown. Mr E refused to give her any money claiming he had bills to settle. Mrs E persisted on her request for money to feed the family. Mr E left the house, on his return he came back with a cutlass and threatened to kill Mrs E He beat Mrs E up so badly and tried to strangle her, but she escaped miraculously. Her friend informed a NGO about her situation who reported the incident to the Police. The Police arrested the Mr E and investigations are on-goingMrs F has been married for about 5 years and is a mother of four children. Mrs F's experiences of IPV became aggravated by the lockdown because she could not leave the house and thereby avoid Mr F like she used to do before the lockdown. One day in the last week of April, Mr F threw Mrs F out of the house in the middle of the night but Mrs F refused to leave because there was a curfew in the state and no movement was allowed after 7 pm. Her failure to leave the house resulted in physical abuse by Mr F. Thus, she sustained injuries to her face and arms. Fortunately, the neighbour's intervened and stopped the beating thereby reducing the injuries she sustained. In the morning, Mrs F moved to her aunt's house for safety, but the children remained with Mr F. The following day, Mr F locked up Mrs F's shop that he opened for her. He told the neighbours she was not to manage the shop anymore and asked them to inform him if Mrs F was seen in the shop. Mr F was notified a few days later when Mrs F tried to open the shop for business. Mr F beat Mrs F up again and broke her leg. Mrs F had to be rushed to the hospital. Mr F also demanded that she should come and take 'her' children away * It is common for perpetrators of IPV to use children as part of the ways in which they inflict abuse and attempt to make female partners feel degraded, in fear, or otherwise powerlessMrs G is a school teacher and mother who has been married for many years. In addition to teaching, Mrs G runs a small business to augment her teaching income. As a result of her hard work, she was the main contributor to the family income. Mrs G's husband also works in the education sector. The closure of schools and the business as a result of the lockdown reduced family income and thereby created a financial stress and food insufficiency in the house. Mrs G requested for financial help from a friend outside the country who sent her N30,000 (50 lb) by electronic money transfer. Mrs G asked her husband to collect the money from the bank on her behalf because she did not have an identification card needed to receive the transfer. After Mr G collected it, Mrs G requested for the money from her husband but he refused to give her claiming there was groceries at home and that he needed the money. The husband resorted to verbal abuse in front of their children and neighbours when Mrs G insisted on collecting the money. So she decided to leave the house with her children and stayed with a relative for a few days for safety COVID-19 pandemic due to disruption in income and earning power [22] . Our findings indicated that money worries and food insufficiency created tension that resulted in conflict and IPV. The association between economic stressors and IPV have been demonstrated in previous work, and thus, are well-aligned with our findings [18, 23, 24] . One study conducted among couples in India found that debt was associated with increased IPV perpetration by male partners [18] . Our findings suggest that the lockdown isolated women and reduced opportunities for them to disclose the abuse or to receive necessary support services or other resources. Notably, work sites and religious organizations which often offer critical emotional support and provide opportunity for a ""reprieve"" for victims were no longer available at this time leaving women nowhere to go for support [25] . A few victims went to the health facility to obtain care but were not able to receive all the support they needed. The early identification and timely management of cases may halt progression of abuse, provide opportunity for the development of safety plans and thereby reduce the consequences of violence [14] . In addition, more work may be needed to reinforce informal support for IPV, including neighbours or other community member intervention to stop IPV when it occurs in public. In Nigeria, IPV is accepted as a family issue that requires no outside interference [26] . Generally, the community only intervenes when IPV is life-threatening or there is likelihood of having legal implications as demonstrated in two cases.Many of the cases were reported by the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). NGOs provide guidance to victims and representatives who can link victims with the legal system [13] . Government agencies and ministries do not often support victims, while the Police often dismiss IPV incidents as a family mater which should be settled by the elders [26, 27] . In the absence of courts to provide restraining orders or family/friends victims can go to for safety, NGOs are very important because of their shelters and extensive supports to victims of violence. However, at the present time they are experiencing challenges in respect of staffing and budgetary constraints-all of which might further affect care to victim-survivors [28] .Victims of IPV in Nigeria and many low income countries are disadvantaged because of non-availability of shelters that can provide a safe space. In many states of Nigeria, there are no public shelters for victims of abuse, and where they exist, they are grossly underfunded [13] . NGOs and a few women societies provide the few shelter services available to women. However, there is constraint to their activities during the lockdown, because they are not included as essential service providers [7, 8] . Governments therefore need to make provision for shelters and referrals centers a priority to help victims of abuse, especially during emergencies when health care providers may be overburdened and unavailable.The failure of police officers to address cases of IPV is a cause for concern. The courts were closed because of the lockdown; therefore, the police did not wish to prosecute cases. Enforcing the laws to reduce the spread of the virus resulted in deployment of many law enforcement officers into the community, and as such were not readily available to take report of abuse [13] . Similarly, the need to decongest prisons during the lockdown may make the police not to arrest perpetrators of IPV [8] . The law courts need to be able to provide services during this and similar emergencies. When victims are confident that perpetrators will be prosecuted and there is no fear of reprisal attack, there will be improved reporting.IPV requires a careful combination of legal measures (e.g. arrest of perpetrators, prosecution by judiciary, safety orders), societal responses (e.g. community responses, advocacy, shelters) and heightened awareness by frontline care providers such as medical and social services, where victims can present with physical or psychological trauma, sexual and reproductive health complications, neglect or other squeal of abuse, including mental health services [25] . The use of the telephone or online platforms has been recommended as an effective and discrete method for victims to reach help on time at a time when face-to-face interaction is limited [29, 30] , but even this may be a challenge for some victims, hence there is a need to improve public awareness and response. Our findings suggest that all of these services need to be heightened during emergencies associated with increases in IPV, such as the COVID-19 lockdown. However, more work is needed to further understand how to better serve victims of IPV during these times of community emergency.Our case report has some limitations; the reported cases were small in number and mostly from the urban areas and thus, may not reflect the experiences of women in the rural areas. Generally, the rural areas have less access to public services such as police, law enforcement agencies and shelters The prevalence of IPV against women is usually higher in rural compared to the urban areas [31] and this may worsen during the pandemic. Also, the report of abuse from the media platform may be sensationalized. Despite this, these case reports provide initial insight into the types of scenarios experienced by women reporting IPV during the lockdown. Even with a small number of cases and less detailed information than would otherwise be obtained via other research methods (e.g. in-depth interviews), we still found common themes across these 7 cases, including new forms of violence that may be specific to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Future research studies will be needed that employ surveys or qualitative in-depth interviews and that recruit larger, more representative samples of women across various geographic locations in Nigeria to expand upon and confirm these findings.Even with the ease of the lock down, the social and economic impact of the pandemic are likely to continue for an extended period of time, hence the stress and risk factors for IPV are likely to continue. It is imperative for government and NGOs to support women during periods of emergencies to ensure they have access to health care services and judicial support. Also, family and community members need to be more involved and supportive of abused women during period of emergencies. There is need for more research and innovative approaches to support victims of IPV. ","Nigeria","abstract","2021-01-20",1

Although SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented in wild primates, it is considered a serious threat to great ape populations nonetheless (Melin et al., 2020) . Human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has twelve key amino acid residuals on its surface, critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Melin et al., 2020) . Apes, including chimpanzees, share those same key amino acid residuals, suggesting a similar susceptibility (Melin et al., 2020) . Furthermore, wild chimpanzees have been infected with another human-origin coronavirus, OC43, in Côte d'Ivoire in 2016 (Patrono et al., 2018) .During this outbreak, samples of OC43 taken from infected chimpanzees proved genetically identical to samples taken from asymptomatic humans with access to the park, despite quarantine before and after the visit (Patrono et al., 2018) .Great ape tourism is a popular activity that offers tourists the opportunity for tourists to learn from and engage with nature (Williamson & Macfie, 2014) . It also provides a source of income that can be used to further great ape conservation efforts (Litchfield, 2001) . When properly regulated, great ape tourism can benefit visitors, local communities, and hosting governments, and apes. However, tourism can also have negative consequences, in particular, increased disease risk to the apes (Muehlenbein & Wallis, 2014) , which could cause dramatic population declines (Leendertz et al., 2006) . To mitigate these risks, rules for great ape tourism by government agencies and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), include preventing sick tourists and researchers from going into the field, maintaining proper distance from apes, controlling the duration of ape viewing, and practicing good biosecurity and hygiene, but these rules can be difficult to enforce (Hanes et al., 2018; Nakamura & Nishida, 2009; Weber et al., 2020) , and with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, have already been reevaluated (Gillespie & Leendertz, 2020; IPS, 2020; Reid, 2020; Williamson & Macfie, 2014) . For example, tourists visiting the chimpanzees at Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania were closer to chimpanzees than stipulated regulations and some tourists were seen coughing near the chimpanzees (Nakamura & Nishida, 2009 During these 1-h excursions, tourists are assigned to groups of six to visit a subgroup from a community that contains over 120 individual chimpanzees. Although visitors and guides are usually conservation-minded (Bulbeck, 2005) , we hypothesized that they might engage in behaviors that could inadvertently expose the chimpanzees to reverse zoonotic pathogens. We also examined the number of tourists per group, their distance from chimpanzees, and the overall time spent viewing chimpanzees to assess compliance with current regulations.Our research adhered to the legal requirements of Uganda, as well as the Principles for Ethical Treatment of Nonhuman Primates formulated by the American Society of Primatologists. The Institutional Review Board at Hunter College reviewed this study and they determined that it was exempt from review because the research involved observation of public behavior. The tourists were informed that a researcher was present during their visit. The identities of tourists were not recorded.Kibale National Park, Uganda is a mid-altitude forested park approximately 795 km 2 (Chapman et al., 2005) . The park is managed by the Uganda Wildlife Authority. We collected observational data on visitors during tourist excursions to the Kanyanchu chimpanzee community. The community's home range is approximately 50 km 2 . This community is visited by tourists, whereas other habituated chimpanzee communities in the park are the subjects of long-term research (Wrangham & Ross, 2008 ).We collected data from June 14th to August 12th, 2018, for a total of 101 excursions over 52 days during the high tourist season (when the majority of tourist excursions occur). Excursions were led by staff of the Uganda Wildlife Authority and occurred three times daily: 8 am (morning), 11 am (mid-morning), and 2 pm (afternoon), each lasting 2-5 h, with 1 h for viewing the chimpanzees. Our sampling effort was distributed evenly among these different viewing times.Before excursions began, tourists presented their permits or payments and listened to a short safety briefing. This briefing included the following information: basic park information (history, species present, etc.), rules and regulations (no eating, flash photography, littering, etc.), chimpanzee specific information (community composition, typical behaviors, habituation process, etc.), and activity information (length of activity, what to wear or carry, etc.). Tourist groups were then divided and mandated to have no more than six people per group, including their guide and any interns, students, or researchers. Groups departed simultaneously, often from different trail entrances and remained in contact via radio. When chimpanzees were spotted, guides communicated through radios to ensure all tourists were able to view chimpanzees, occasionally leading to group ""merges.""Behavioral data on visitors including park guides (n = 15), interns (n = 10), and tourists (n = 459), were collected using a prescribed ethogram as well as additional relevant behaviors (Table 1) continuously during the track and ad libitum; in addition, any miscellaneous behaviors deemed relevant to disease transmission were recorded. Human behaviors were grouped into six categories: self-grooming, bodily functions, eating, forest interactions, interpersonal interactions, and miscellaneous potential concerns. Guide safety warnings to tourists during excursions were recorded under miscellaneous potential concerns to account for tourist behaviors that guides actively tried to end. All occurrences of a behavior in the ethogram by any individual were recorded during the excursion. The following visitor group metrics were also recorded: initial group size, group size if merged with other visitors, distance while viewing arboreal and terrestrial chimpanzees, and time spent viewing chimpanzees. Merging was defined as when two excursion groups met in the forest and remained together for longer than 5 min. A total of 15 park guides, 10 interns, and 434 tourists (N = 459) visited the chimpanzees during the chimpanzee tracks. ""Self-Grooming"" occurred during all excursions (100.0%), followed by ""Direct ForestInteractions"" (99.0%), and ""Bodily Functions"" (94.1%) ( Table 1) . Across categories, touching large tree trunks or branches was the most frequent human behavior, followed by hand-to-face contact Table 2 .The total number of groups embarking at any given time ranged Great ape tourism is a ""double-edged sword"" in that it simultaneously provides economic incentives for conserving apes while also putting them at risk for reverse zoonotic infections. Although visitors and guides are usually conservation-minded, we hypothesized that they might engage in behaviors that could inadvertently expose chimpanzees to reverse zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, our study quantifies potential modes of transmission from humans to chimps that could inform disease risk prevention strategies. Self-grooming and direct forest interactions were the two most common behavioral categories recorded. Each singular instance of hand-to-face contact or touching forest objects could lead to the deposition of infectious agents on fingers and fomites, respectively, even if the person is not clinically ill (Edemekong & Huang, 2019) . Using twigs as Q-tips or toothpicks, spitting, bleeding, coughing, sneezing, urinating, defecating, eating, and depositing food scraps on the forest floor, and handling or tasting forest fruits pose risks of depositing infectious agents into the forest as well, with heightened probabilities that chimpanzees will encounter them later. These observed high-risk behaviors support our hypothesis that apes could come into contact with zoonoses if measures are not taken to mitigate these behaviors.Knowing that nonhuman primates can be infected by many human respiratory pathogens and that great apes are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, it is important to consider the ways in which transmission of these agents might occur (Melin et al., 2020) .Airborne transmission and direct contact are modes of reverse zoonotic disease transmission (Epstein & Price, 2009 ). However, infection through fomites and the environment could also occur as has been suggested by other ape researchers (Gilardi et al., 2005) . Some pathogens can remain viable for days after they are deposited into the environment (Baek et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2011; Edemekong & Huang, 2019; Kampf et al., 2020) , which could facilitate transmission to chimpanzees long after infected people depart. Patrono et al. (2018) as they did in a study of mountain gorillas in Uganda (Gessa & Rothman, 2016) . We hope that the results presented herein will enhance the comprehensiveness of these guidelines.We note certain limitations to this study. Specifically, observations were recorded at only one tourism site in one country over a short period of time, such that their generality to other settings and seasons remains to be seen. Also, no biological samples were collected to document actual instances of infection. Nevertheless, to the extent that our findings from Kanyanchu prove representative of other great ape tourism sites, we suggest that future guidelines for ape tourism take into consideration the behavioral propensities of individual tourists, and actively discourage these high-risk behaviors.We thank the Uganda Wildlife Authority staff at Kanyanchu and Kanyawara for logistical support.

While there has been a decrease in global neonatal mortality rates, the smaller improvements seen in low-income settings are threatened by the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A modelling study of this threat predicted between 250000-1.1 million extra neonatal deaths as a result of decreased service provision and access in LMICs. A webinar and survey of frontline maternal/newborn healthcare workers in >60 countries reported a decline in both service attendance and in quality of service across the ante-, peri-and post-natal journey. Reporting fear of attending services, and difficulty in access, and a decrease in service quality due to exacerbation of existing service weaknesses, confusion over guidelines and understaffing. Similar findings were reported in a survey of healthcare workers providing childhood and maternal vaccines in LMICs. One study to date has reported data from Nepal describing an increase in stillbirths and neonatal deaths, with institutional deliveries nearly halved during lockdown.To our knowledge, this is the first and only study in Sub-Saharan Africa describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health service access and outcomes for newborns in two countries. We analysed data from the digital quality improvement and data collection tool, the NeoTree, to carry out an interrupted time series analysis of newborn admission rates, gestational age, birth weight, diagnosis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and mortality from two large hospitals in Malawi and Zimbabwe (n~7000 babies). We found that the indirect impacts of COVID-19 were context-specific. In Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, initial resilience was demonstrated in that there was no evidence of change in mortality, birth weight or gestational age. In comparison, at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, soon after the first case of COVID-19, the data revealed a fall in admissions (by 42%), gestational 4 age (1 week), birth weight (300 grams), and outside referrals (by 28%), and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality (2%). In the Zimbabwean hospital, admission numbers did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses' strike, which in itself was in response to challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.Our data confirms the reports from frontline healthcare workers of a perceived decline in neonatal service access and provision in LMICs. Digital routine healthcare data capture enabled rapid profiling of indirect impacts of COVID-19 on newborn care and outcomes in two tertiary referral hospitals, Malawi and Zimbabwe. While a decrease in service access was seen in both countries, the impacts on care provided and outcome differed by national context. Health systems strengthening, for example digital data capture, may assist in planning context-specific mitigation efforts.This study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement (Appendix 1).SMCH is a public referral hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. It has the largest of three tertiary NNUs nationwide with 100 cots and predominantly doctor-led care. KCH, Lilongwe, is one of four regional referral hospitals in Malawi and the NNU has 75 cots. In contrast to SMCH, care in the NNU is mostly nurse-led. Both units accept local and national referrals for specialist surgical care.All neonates admitted to each NNU over a 16-month period from 1 June 2019 to 25September 2020 (69 complete weeks) were eligible for inclusion. We applied no specific exclusion criteria.Data were collected prospectively using the NeoTree app. Health workers complete a digital form when a neonate is admitted to the unit (admission form) and when they are discharged or die (outcome form). The app guides assessment of the neonate and collects data on patient demographics, examination findings, diagnoses, and interventions. Pseudonymised forms are uploaded monthly to University College London servers (Zimbabwe data) and Amazon Web Services (Malawi data).5. Mortality: defined as an outcome of ""neonatal death"" on the outcome form. All other neonates, including those discharged, transferred to another facility or who left on parental request, were considered alive.The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or preparation of this manuscript.We included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Figure 1 shows the seven-day moving average of admissions to the NNU. • Solid vertical line: first confirmed case of COVID-19 in each country.• Period between dashed vertical lines: industrial action by doctors in Zimbabwe.• Counts based on all admission forms completed, irrespective of match status. The level change regression model, adjusted for the doctors' strike, showed no evidence of a change in admissions after the first case of COVID-19 (relative risk [RR] 0·83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·60-1·14; p = 0·25) but the scatterplot indicated this model fit the data poorly (model 1, Figure 2A ). An alternative model, .At KCH, the mean (SD) number of weekly admissions was 54·5 (10·8) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 38·0 (10·9) in the post-COVID-19 period. The level change model suggested a 42% reduction in admissions after the first case of COVID-19 (RR 0·58; 95%CI 0·48-0·70; p < 0·001) ( Figure 2C ).• Data points represent weekly mean gestational age or birth weight to avoid overplotting.• White background: pre-COVID-19 period; grey background: post-COVID-19 period.• Solid line: predicted trend from regression model; dashed line: counterfactual scenario.• SMCH models (panels A & C) adjusted for doctors' strike period, KCH models (panels B & D)unadjusted.• Data from all admission forms completed, irrespective of match status.We performed an interrupted time series analysis to examine changes in neonatal care provision at two tertiary NNUs in Zimbabwe and Malawi after the first cases of COVID-19. We found that admissions at SMCH did not change significantly after the first case of COVID-19 when considering this period as a whole, but there was a considerable decrease (~50%) in the number admissions in June to August 2020, coinciding with a nurses' strike. We did not find significant changes in gestational age or birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of NE or mortality at SMCH. Conversely, we found several changes in markers of neonatal care at KCH after the first case of COVID-19 in Malawi. The number of admissions fell by 42% and we noted a decrease in the gestational age and birth weight of admitted neonates (by ~1 week and ~300 grams, respectively), a 28% relative decrease in outside referrals, and a small but statistically significant weekly increase in mortality by 2% after the first case of COVID-19. Although this study is descriptive, we can speculate about explanations for our results based on existing literature and discussions with local health workers.We hypothesised that rates of NE would increase during the pandemic. NE is the clinical manifestation of disordered brain function and can have multiple aetiologies. 27 The term 'hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy' is reserved for cases where there is evidence of intrapartum asphyxia. 27 In LMICs, obstructed labour is a major cause of maternal mortality and can lead to intrapartum asphyxia with subsequent neonatal morbidity and mortality, including NE. 28 Therefore, the prevalence of NE might be expected to increase as a marker of delayed presentation to a health facility. It is reassuring that we did not find increased rates of NE at SMCH or KCH. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously as some neonates with NE may not have presented to a health facility at all.Some limitations should be noted. A limitation intrinsic to interrupted time series analysis is the possibility that another event occurred close to the first case of COVID-19 in either country causing spurious observations. Another potential threat to validity is changing data collection practices. For example, overstretched clinicians might not input data into the NeoTree app for all admitted neonates. However, this is unlikely as the NeoTree app is embedded into routine practice at SMCH and KCH and discussions with local collaborators suggest use of the app has continued without issue.The NeoTree app only collects data on neonates admitted to the NNU. Therefore, our analysis does not capture stillbirths or neonatal deaths that occur in the community. It is troubling to see a dramatic fall in admissions in both sites, raising the possibility that many unwell neonates did not attend a health facility and died at home. A recent study found that facility births decreased by over 50% during the lockdown in Nepal, and facility stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates increased significantly. 29 The NeoTree research team is currently collecting data on stillbirths at SMCH and KCH, but these data will still only represent stillbirths that occurred in a health facility. Given the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, it will be important to repeat our analysis over the coming months to further examine longer-term trends in neonatal care provision.The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific, with more significant and evident effects on neonatal care provision seen at KCH (Malawi) than SMCH (Zimbabwe).

A major area of concern, globally and in South Africa, was the sufficiency of ICU capacity for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Against an ICU bed availability of 3,318 (1,178 public and 2,140 private), the South African Portfolio Committee on Health highlighted a shortfall in ICU beds in the country; where the peak daily demand for ICU beds was projected to be between 4,100 beds (optimistic scenario) and 14,767 (pessimistic scenario) [1] . Based on the expected progression of COVID-19 in South Africa and expected utilisation rates of ICU in the management of COVID-19, projections suggested insufficient supply of ICU capacity in the public sector. Government adopted a two-pronged strategy including (1) the adoption of a lockdown strategy to flatten the curve in an effort to reduce the likelihood of demand exceeding the available health care supply and (2) initiatives to purchase critical bed capacity from the South African private sector for use by public sector patients.Intensive care services are very expensive and are one of the largest drivers of hospital costs, even in public hospitals where the cost per patient per ICU day has been estimated at R22,700 [2] . Discovery Health, the largest private medical scheme in the country, at the time reported that the average cost of all COVID-19 hospital admissions across its members was R84,708. The average cost of an ICU admission for its members was substantially higher -at R169,525 -and these admissions were also reported to have the ""highest variation in cost"" [3] . While public sector ICU capacity was projected to be limited, overprovision of ICU beds in the private sector was a key finding of the recent Competition Commission Health Market Inquiry [4] , presenting an opportunity for government to purchase additional services from private hospitals for use by public sector dependent patients.There are a range of health care interventions to manage the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst others, resources are required to carry out education, screening, testing, isolation and contact tracing programs, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health workers, treatment in general/high care wards; and in the most critical cases, treatment in ICU. Given the expected downturn in an already weak economy [5] coupled with the increased demand for government resources for economic relief and other measures, the ability of government to commit additional funding to a resource-constrained public health sector is limited. Within this context, it is imperative that available government resources are used fairly and efficiently, and that the costs and effects of potential interventions and approaches to care are assessed and weighed against the opportunity costs of their required investment. Traditional economic evaluations can be time consuming with lengthy turnaround times. The rapid pace at which the pandemic unfolded and the imperative it created for policy decisions to be made quickly required the turnaround times for research and analysis informing policy to be shortened substantially. The objective of this study was to assess the costeffectiveness of ICU management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private health sector in South Africa using a ""real time"", pragmatic and transparent health economic modelling approach. The results of this analysis can contribute towards evidence informed policy making and planning during COVID-19 surges when certain aspects of hospital capacity are expected to be breached.MOSAIC, a health economic modelling collective established to respond to the need for prompt policy guidance for the South African response to COVID-19, carried out this cost-utility/effectiveness analysis of ICU care. The study was conducted using the principles of the International Decision Support Initiative Reference Case for economic evaluation [6] . It considers two generalised strategies for the inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients: (1) general ward and ICU management (GW + ICU): admitted patients are managed in a combination of general wards and ICU, with escalation to ICU based on established clinical criteria for severity of disease; (2) general ward management: admitted patients are managed in general wards only. This approach enables an estimation of the added value of ICU care in comparison to a general ward only comparator. The latter is therefore a modelled ""do nothing"" strategy that provides estimates of the outcomes that could result from the severe rationing of ICU care during surges in COVID-19 cases. Costs are expressed as the cost per case admitted from the health systems perspective, in 2020 South African Rand (ZAR), including both public and private sector costs. Outcomes are expressed as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths. While the simple measures of ""deaths avoided"" or ""lives saved"" are useful and easy to interpret, they miss important treatment effects, such as improvements in morbidity, and they cannot be used to make comprehensive assessments of value for money compared to other treatment options in the health sector. In contrast, representing the impact of interventions as disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) averted allows consideration of health gains due to a reduction of both fatal and nonfatal disease burden; one DALY can be thought of as one lost year of healthy life. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) are calculated as the difference in costs divided by the difference in health benefits of the treatment strategies, and are compared to a cost effectiveness threshold (CET) derived from an estimate of the marginal productivity of the public health system in South Africa [7] . If the ICER is lower than the CET then the marginal opportunity cost of the treatment strategy (in terms of lost health) is expected to be lower than the health benefits of the treatment strategy, indicating that the treatment strategy is likely to represent a cost-effective use of limited resources [6] . The time horizon for the analysis was from admission to discharge or death; while estimates of ongoing morbidity post discharge were included within DALYs, no costs after discharge were estimated. The years of life lost (YLL) from COVID-19 mortality was informed by a secondary actuarial analysis and was not discounted.A decision analytic modelling framework was implemented in TreeAge Pro 2020 (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williams-town, Massachusetts, USA) and exported to Microsoft Excel for ease of stakeholder engagement and review, as depicted in Fig. 1 . The model and accompanying user guide are available at https://doi.org/10.25375/ uct.12382706.Within the model, patients are 'randomized' to each treatment strategy (GW + ICU versus GW); and on admission (to public or private hospitals), patients are modelled as severe or critical. Depending on these factors, patients incur admission costs and accumulate health outcomes as they transition to one of two absorbing states: recover or die. Recovered patients receive a morbidity loss over the duration of their disease and thereafter are assumed to return to their pre-COVID-19 health state, while morbidity as well as YLLs are captured for those dying. Further details of these costs and outcomes are provided within Table 1 .The model rests on 4 different types of variables: mortality rates based on severity of illness (i.e. severe versus critical) and approach towards disease management (i.e. GW + ICU versus GW); utilisation data including proportions of hospitalized individuals that are critical versus severe, proportion managed in public versus private hospitals and length of stay data for each patient type and management approach; unit costs per inpatient day in general wards and intensive care units specific to public and private hospitals; and DALY data including YLL, years lived with disability (YLD) and disability weights (DWs). A brief overview of each type of data is provided below. Evidence relating to disease progression and effectiveness of interventions has rapidly changed over the Mortality rates were extracted from the literature. A systematic search for articles published in English between 01/01/2019 and 30/05/2020 in Medline/PubMed was completed using the terms: ""COVID-19"" OR ""novel coronavirus"" OR ""SARS-COV-2"" OR COVID-19 OR 2019-COV OR ""2019 novel coronavirus"" AND ""clinical characteristics"" OR ""clinical features"" OR ""clinical outcomes"" AND ""death"" OR ""mortality"". Additional relevant articles were sourced through a manual search of bibliographies of included articles.As outlined in Fig. 2 , the results of the initial search were screened by title and abstract. The full texts of potentially relevant articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. When articles reported information from the same study sites but at two different time periods, only the articles with the updated statistics were included in this analysis. A total of sixteen observational studies (cross-sectional or cohort) and case series that reported the outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included within quantitative synthesis. Average weighted estimates of the case fatality rate among ICU patients Utilisation includes the proportions of hospitalized individuals that are critical versus severe and length of stay data for each patient type by type of management (utilization of ICU days by critical patients, utilization of general ward days for severe patients, and for critical patients before/after ICU). These variables were extracted from seven articles [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] identified in the abovementioned systematic search. Average weighted estimates for each variable were calculated. Finally, the proportion of patients using public versus private hospitals was based on the proportion of South Africans with private medical scheme membership [17] .The model considers the costs of inpatient care in public and private hospitals through the inclusion of unit costs per general ward day and per ICU day. These are multiplied against the abovementioned length of stay estimates to generate a cost per admission. Private sector unit costs are based on the tariff rates in the ""Guidelines on Public Private Collaboration in Response to COVID-19"" published by the Department of Health [18] . Public sector unit costs were calculated using the Health Systems Trust District Health Barometer (12th Edition -2016/17) datafile [19] which provides hospital-level estimates of expenditure per patient day equivalent (PDE) for all categories of public sector hospitals. These costs were inflated to 2020 prices using the Consumer Price Index [20] and a weighted average unit cost was calculated through weighting unit costs by the percentage of useable beds across levels of care. Because the HST-DHB data do not provide an estimate of the unit cost per ICU day, we estimated this by inflating the average weighted cost by the cost differential between ICU and general ward tariffs in the private sector.DALYs are calculated through the summation of YLL and YLD. YLL were informed by a South African actuarial analysis that utilised age-and co-morbidity adjusted mortality rates observed internationally and applied these to the South African population [21] . This resulted in an average estimate of 5.4 YLL per death in South Africa. A wide range on this parameter was tested in sensitivity analysis to reflect the relative uncertainty associated with transferring international mortality data to the South African context. At the time of analysis, duration of morbidity was unknown for COVID-19;assumptions were therefore made for these parameters. Disability weights for severe/critical COVID-19 patients were based on relevant estimates for similar conditions from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study [22] .Simple sensitivity analyses were run across all variables to assess the impact of changes on the ICER. Where possible, ranges for sensitivity analysis were based on upper and lower confidence intervals or interquartile ranges found within the systematic literature review. For the remaining variables, a 50 % increase/decrease was implemented, except for where this would move the variable out of feasible range (e.g. mortality rates can only fall within the range 0-1). Thereafter, threshold analyses were run to estimate the percentage change in variables that would render ICU cost-effective, using the published South African CET [7] as the cut-off for this determination. Finally, an additional scenario was modelled in order to incorporate the effect of administration of the steroid dexamethasone. This analysis entailed the inclusion of the cost of a course of dexamethasone (ZAR 160.85 for twenty 4 mg vials as per 2020 Essential Medicines List price), as well as rate ratio reductions in deaths from ICU (0.65) or from general wards (0.80) as provided in estimates from a United Kingdom based randomized controlled trial [23] .This is a modelled cost-effectiveness/utility analysis using published secondary data; no ethical approval was therefore required. As highlighted in the table, there are two key unknowns for this economic evaluation that both apply to the GW strategy. The first is the proportion of critical patients that would die if they did not have access to ICU. This unknown has been based on the high value found in the meta-analysis for critical patients dying from ICU (88 % mortality) with ranges for sensitivity analysis including 70 % and 100 % mortality. The other unknown is the length of stay for these critical patients, which is assumed to be the same as for critical patients managed in ICU.Other important unknowns include disability weights for COVID-19, with the DW for severe lower respiratory tract infection assumed for severe COVID-19 patients and the DW for severe pneumoconiosis assumed for critical patients, as extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study [22] . Duration of illness is assumed to be 0.5 months in those dying, 1.5 months in severe patients and 2 months in critical patients. Finally, YLL is based on international mortality rates per 100 000 population by age and co-morbidity applied to the South African demographic structure [21] . Used to assess value for money; if ICER < CET intervention potentially cost-effective [7] Cost-effectiveness Sensitivity analyses were run on all variables with the ranges for these analyses presented in Table 2 . The tornado diagram in Fig. 3 summarizes the results for the seven analyses that generated the largest changes to the ICER. All other analyses generated lower or negligible changes in cost-effectiveness. To guide an interpretation of these findings, ICERs are compared against the costeffectiveness threshold of ZAR 38,465 per DALY averted [7] . This represents the marginal productivity of the South African health system; interventions would need to generate an ICER lower than or equivalent to this value to be potentially cost-effective.As is shown in Fig. 3 , three analyses showed promise for generating a cost-effective ICER for the GW + ICU strategy: (1) length of stay in ICU in critical patients (shorter LoS improves cost-effectiveness); (2) cost per ICU day (less costly services improves costeffectiveness); and (3) proportion of critical patients dying from ICU (lower mortality improves costeffectiveness). Other important drivers of costeffectiveness include YLL (if more lost life years can be averted, ICU becomes more cost-effective) and the outcomes of critical patients managed in general wards (poorer outcomes improves the relative benefits of ICU). In effect, these analyses indicate that if ICU were less costly (either through reduction in the unit cost or the length of stay) or more effective (either through reduced mortality or targeting the service towards patients with higher potential years of life to lose), purchasing additional intensive care from private hospitals would be more likely to be a cost-effective use of government resources.The threshold analysis (Table 4 ) takes this one step further to estimate the exact percent change in variables needed to generate cost-effective ICERs. As is shown, five threshold values were found. To render additional purchasing of ICU cost-effective, we would need a 57 % decrease in the proportion of critical patients dying from ICU; 48 % decrease in the public sector cost per ICU day; 38 % decrease in ICU length of stay; 179 % increase in LoS in critical patients managed in general wards; or 89 % increase in YLL in those dying from COVID-19.Finally, we conducted a scenario analysis on the impact of dexamethasone on the cost-effectiveness of ICU through the inclusion of the price of a course of dexamethasone and rate ratio reductions in mortality as provided from a UK based randomized control trial [23] . The results from this scenario indicate a slightly improved ICER of ZAR 70,400 per DALY averted for the GW + ICU strategy.Based on the evidence available at the time of analysis (up to end of May 2020) and at base case values, this article presents the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies for admitted COVID-19 patients in South African hospitals. The policy relevance of these findings relates to decision-making during surges in COVID-19 cases when hospital capacity becomes constrained and hard choices need to be made around the rationing of care. During these surges, this analysis suggests that it may not be cost-effective for government to purchase additional ICU beds from private hospitals. In addition, if public sector resources (such as staffing) are severely constrained due to surges in COVID-19, the analysis suggests that better returns will be achieved through the provision of additional staffed and operational general ward beds within public hospitals. As shown in sensitivity analyses, these findings are driven by three key factors: (1) the high mortality in critical patients admitted to ICU; (2) the relatively low number of years of life lost in those dying; and (3) the relatively high cost of ICU services (which is a function of unit cost and length of stay).While intensive care is expensive, if it were effective at preventing deaths in critically ill COVID-19 patients, it would have generated more favourable results. However, our meta-analysis of evidence from nine available studies suggested that outcomes were poor [8-16, 24, 29, 30] . Approaches to decision making in the face of resource scarcities (also called ""priority setting"") commonly includes four fundamental values or ethical principles drawn from theories of distributive justice [31, 32] : (1) ""utilitarianism"" -doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people, either by saving the highest number of lives and/or saving the largest number of life-years, which is the basis of cost-effectiveness; (2) ""egalitarianism""providing equal access or equal treatment for equal need; (3) ""rule of rescue""providing urgent, life-saving treatments irrespective of the cost; and (4) ""desert"" -promoting and rewarding social usefulness [33] . Based on utilitarian or egalitarian approaches, there would be limited merit in government purchasing additional ICU capacity from private hospitals. However, justification for investing in ICU may be found through the application of other ethical principles such as the ""rule of rescue"". The latter calls on society to respond to the extreme risk faced by an identifiable individual, however it generally only holds when the numbers are small. The difficulty to face with COVID-19 is that while many of us align with a rule of rescue based response, the stark realities of resource constraints call on us to acknowledge that the allocation of government resources to purchase ICU capacity from private hospitals would have a high opportunity cost in terms of the competing uses of those funds.While the economic evaluation methodology can provide quantitative evidence to inform each of these ethical principles, and hence is a key input to any consideration [34] , experience globally suggests that a multi-ethical framework is more likely to result in a fairer allocation of resources. Moreover, because reasonable people should be expected to disagree on the relative merits of these ethical principles, priority setting needs to be vested within procedural justice, a key aspect of which is transparent deliberation [35] . Our real-time and open access approach to modelling provides one example of how such transparency can be facilitated.There are a number of limitations to this study and similar studies. The urgency to inform decision making and restrictions on primary data collection necessitated a reliance on secondary data while the ongoing emergence of new information required flexibility in model building. To address these concerns (1) a comprehensive systematic review was carried out to ensure that all of the available information was fed into the model and (2) an open access modelling framework [36] with a user guide [37] was developed to facilitate full exploration of uncertainty through sensitivity analysis and to allow for parameters to be quickly and easily updated as new information becomes available. A further limitation is that this analysis is static in nature and does not provide projections of the total need for ICU or general ward beds as the epidemic unfolds across South Africa during 2020 and 2021. The implication is that the findings are of relevance during surges in COVID-19 when capacity is breached, and hard choices need to be made regarding the rationing of both general ward and ICU care. The findings do not necessarily apply to COVID-19 ICU care during times when COVID-19 admissions are manageable.This rapid analysis provided key evidence on the costeffectiveness of alternative management strategies in the hospital care of critical and severe patients with COVID-19 disease in the South African setting. It has shown that ICU use for COVID-19 patients was unlikely to be costeffective on the margin, and therefore an expansion of ICU capacity during COVID-19 surges through government purchase of private services for use by public sector patients (at current prices and evidence of effectiveness) may not be the best use of limited health resources, whether from utilitarian or egalitarian ethical perspectives.There are few (if any) examples of decision analytic modelling and cost effectiveness analysis being conducted in ""real time"" to inform policy decisions in the South African public health sector. The rapid, pragmatic and transparent analysis employed by the MOSAIC group demonstrates a potential approach for further evidence generation for decisions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic response and South Africa's wider priority setting agenda.

A questionnaire survey was carried out among Moroccan Higher Education Institutions (HEI's). The questionnaire was self-administered via the Google Forms tool during the months of May and June. The research data and questionnaire are available in Mendeley data on: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h9vdjh8tk7/2 Due to the lack of a sample frame, we have resorted to a non-probabilistic sampling method. This kind of method is used for practical reasons of accessibility and reduced cost. Table 2 illustrates the profile and characteristics of students who participated in this survey. A total of 264 responses from students were received, including 187 women (70.80%) and 77 men (29.20%). Almost half of the respondents to our questionnaire are undergraduate students (46.2%). The responses are collected from students of 31 Moroccan educational institutions affiliated with 12 universities ( Tables 3 and 4 ). 25.67% of students indicate that they do not use any video conferencing systems and 17.05% among them do not use any online learning platforms. As an alternative, teachers refer to WhatsApp groups in order to interact with students, as they use YouTube videos for transferring knowledge. It is to highlight that Google meet and Zoom are the most video conferencing systems used in Moroccan HEI's. Additionally, Moroccan students use several online learning platforms such as; Coursera, Google Classroom, LinkedIn Learning, Moodle, and Udemy ( Table 5 ) .

To test the research model, we used the Partial Least Squares approach). Because of the exploratory character and the small size of our sample, we have used the PLS-SEM as an appropriate method to analyze hypothesis and research model. Fig. 2 summarizes steps of the structural equation modeling method under the Partial Least Squares approach [13] [14] [15] .For data analysis, we used the SmartPLS 3 software. Table 6 summarizes the convergent validity, according to several criteria: individual item reliability ( > 0.7), composite reliability ( > 0.7), factor loadings ( > 0.7) and average variance extracted (AVE > 0.5). Likewise, the discriminant validity is ensured thanks to the Fornell-Larcker criterion ( Table 7 ) , and the cross-loading criterion ( Table 8 ). In short, Fig. 3 shows the SEM-PLS estimation for the measurement and structural model. As indicated in Fig. 4 , the values of the coefficient of determination of the couple endogenous constructs; perceived usefulness, and e-learning system use are moderated, which are 0.499 and 0.447 respectively. In addition, the values of R ² of the e-learner satisfaction, and e-learning system success are substantial, which are 0.690 and 0.789 respectively. The size effect (f 2 ) values are all acceptable, except the effect of system quality and perceived usefulness on e-learning systems use ( Table 9 ) . The system quality and perceived usefulness have no significant effect size on e-learning system use (f 2 < 0.02).The predictive relevance (Q 2 ) values are all greater than zero, which makes it possible to conclude that the model has an acceptable predictive power [14] . Finally, the Goodness of Fit of the Model of this study is very strong (GoF = 0,674,868 > 0.36) [16] .According to SmartPLS outputs, it turns out that instructor quality contributes to the explanation of perceived usefulness, e-learning systems use, and e-learner satisfaction. Likewise, the system quality has a positive and significant effect on perceived usefulness, and e-learner satisfaction. On the other hand, social influence has a significant effect on e-learning systems use.In the same, the perceived usefulness contributes to the explanation of e-learner satisfaction.In contrary, learner computer anxiety has a significant and negative effect on e-learner satisfaction. Finally, the perceived usefulness, e-learning systems use, and e-learner satisfaction greatly contributes to the explanation of e-learning system success ( Fig. 5 ).The consent of respondents was obtained.

Patients who required intensive care support were older and had multiple comorbidity such as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, endocrine, digestive, and respiratory disease. Those in intensive care were also more likely to report dyspnea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and anorexia [12] .The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the East and Horn of Africa is expected to be far-reaching and more catastrophic than for high income countries, These pre-existing conditions such as the population size, status of health systems and health workforce are expected to worsen any health impacts from COVID-19 [13, 14] .Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, and home to close to 9% of the African population. Ethiopia respond to COVID-19 started early. On January, the government introduced passenger-screening protocols at Addis Ababa's international airport, and further preparation continued in January and February. The first report of a COVID-19 case in Ethiopia was on March 13, two days after the global pandemic was declared. National responses were scaled up soon after, and a state of emergency was declared on April 8 [15] . In response to COVID-19, the federal and regional governments in Ethiopia have been taking a series of policy actions. These include closing schools, restricting use of public transportation, banning large meetings, and suspending sporting and religious gatherings [16] .The following basic measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 have been recommended by the WHO and have been adopted by the Ethiopian Government, such as wash hands frequently using soap, maintain social distancing, stay informed and follow advice given by healthcare provider, stay at home. If you begin to feel sick and if you develop fever or cough or experience difficulty breathing, seek medical advice and call in advance the center. Even though COVID-19 case diagnosis and knowledge on prevention remain vital components of the control strategies, little is known about the knowledge, risk perception and perceived selfefficacy of the community in the context of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government is expanding its diagnosis system in order to increase accessibility of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment to regional and zonal levels. There is no study to date that has been conducted to assess the knowledge of the community on prevention, risk perception and evaluate the implementation of policies and regulations set for the prevention and control of COVID-19 by the community in Ethiopia. Evidence on this subject would contribute to the prevention, control of COVID-19 as well as on the management of its impact. Therefore, this cross-sectional survey is aimed to assess the predictors of adherence COVID-19 prevention measure among communities in North Shoa Zone, Ethiopia based on health belief model. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provided the theoretical base for this study. The HBM was developed by psychologists in the United State Public Health Service in the 1950s as a 6 way to explain participation in medical prevention and disease detection programs [17] . The model suggests that changes in preventive health behaviour are originally based on six factors, susceptibility: perceived personal vulnerability to or subjective risk of a health condition, seriousness: perceived personal harm of the condition, benefits: perceived positive attributes of an action, barriers: perceived negative aspects related to an action, health motivation refers to beliefs and behaviours related to the state of general concern about health and confidence is defined as the belief that one can successfully perform a behaviour that will then lead to a desirable outcome [18, 19] . The aim of this model is to increase the perception of individuals about a health threat and direct their behaviors towards health. Likewise, it focuses on a person's health related behavior and belief in predicting future actions. The perceived risk of people developing COVID 19 is considered to be the primary motive to change within the Health Belief Model, which assumes that the higher the perceived threat, the more likely an individual will modify his or her behavior to avoid that threat.The study was conducted from May 1-30 /2020 at North Shoa zone, Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. Debre Berhan town (the zone city) is located 130 kilometers far from Addis Ababa (the capital city of Ethiopia). The zone has 21 rural districts and 3 city administrations; 370 rural kebeles, 523,338 households; 370 health posts; and 740 health extension workers. The zone has 1 comprehensive, specialized referral hospital, 7 primary hospitals, 95 health centers, 389 health posts, 2 private hospitals, 34 private medium level clinics, 97 private primary clinics, 8 pharmacies and 1 private rural drug vendor (unpublished zonal health department report, 2020).A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed to identify predictors of adherence to COVID 19 prevention measures among communities using the health belief model.The sample size was determined by using single population proportion formula. The following assumption was made: margin of error was 5%, confidence interval was 95%, the proportion of adherence was 50%, design effect was 1.5 and non-response rate was 10%. In this study, a multi-stage sampling technique was applied. Initially, the zone was stratified into two strata: urban and rural districts. Thirty percent of the districts were selected from each stratum (seven from rural district and two from urban districts). In the second stage, a total of 27 kebeles were selected randomly. At kebele level, family folders (list of households taken from health extension workers) were used as the sampling frame and the required numbers of households were selected using systematic random sampling technique. The first household was selected by using a lottery method, and then every 6 th household was included in the study. If data collectors could not find both of the household heads with three visits, they shifted to the next immediate household.Data was collected by ""Google forms"". A structured questionnaire was adopted from a WHO survey tool for COVID-19 [20] . The questionnaire was prepared first in English and translated to Amharic and back translated to English before data collection process. The questionnaire had four parts: socio-demographics variables, health belief model constructs, adherence of the community towards COVID-19 prevention measures and knowledge of the community towards COVID-19. Health belief model constructs were a 5-likert scale item (1 = strongly dissatisfied, 5 = strongly dissatisfied), then during analysis strongly dissatisfied and dissatisfied merged to disagree and strongly agree and agree merged to agree. Similarly, the adherence level of the community towards COVID-19 prevention measures were a 5-likert scale item (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always). Higher scores indicate greater safety measure practice, while lower scores indicate less safety measure practice. Survey questions were tested for content validity and internal validity (reliability). The content validity of questionnaire was evaluated by public health and nursing expertise. Based on their endorsements, modifications to the survey tool were made. Moreover, the Cronbach alpha coefficients of HBM constructs were calculated. The reliability scores are presented in Table 1 .In addition, the reliability score (cronbach alpha) of adherence tool was 0.91. Based on these questions, mean scores of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and cues to action were calculated to classify the respondents into two groups; above the mean and below the mean.Data was collected by 27 health care workers. Google platform was used to collect data. The Universal Resource Locator (URL) address was sent to each data collector through their mobile telegrams. Training was provided for data collectors and supervisors on the objective of the study, data collection procedures, COVID-19 precaution, and ethical considerations.Data were checked for completeness and inconsistencies. The online datasheet was downloaded from the Google form in excel format and then exported to SPSS version 21 software for further analysis. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, Inter Quartile Range, percentage, and frequency distribution) were computed. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the data. Those independent variables which were statistically significant in the bivariate model (p-value < 0.05) were entered into the multivariable analysis. In the final model, a significant association was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05. The results were presented in texts and tables with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and the corresponding 95% CI.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Debre Berhan University. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. All the information obtained from the study participants were kept confidential throughout the process of study, and the name of the participant was replaced by code. Withdrawal from the study at any point if they wished was assured.Six hundred eighty three respondents were participated in this study. The majority, 390 (57.1%) of participants were male. The median age of the respondents was 38 (IQR 30-48 years). A high number of the respondents 492 (72%) were married. Three hundred forty eight (51%) of the respondents did not attend formal education. More than half of the respondents, 377 (55.2%) were from rural and 251 (36.7%) were farmers. Most of them, 566 (82.9%) had no chronic illness (Table 2) . The mean knowledge of the participants towards COVID-19 was 10 with (SD ±2.66). Nearly, half of participants (47.1%) had inadequate knowledge of COVID-19.Perceived sensibility. The overall perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 infection was calculated using the mean score. The mean score of perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 was 13.88 (±3.38 SD). Forty-five percent (44.8%) of the respondents were above the mean score, and they perceived themselves susceptible to COVID-19 (Table 3) . Perceived barriers of COVID-19 preventive measure. In our study area, the study participants pointed out their perceived barriers of COVID-19 infection prevention. As demonstrated in Table 4 , more than half of participants (55.6) do not have barriers of COVID-19 infection prevention.Perceived benefit of preventive safety measures of COVID-19. Our study participants also reported the benefit of preventive safety measures of COVID-19 infection. Consequently, nearly three-fourth of our respondents (72.0%) agreed with the usefulness of practicing the recommended safety measures to prevent COVID-19 infection (Table 5) . Cues to action to COVID-19. There were signals in the community to act upon the prevention of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, more than eighty percent of our respondents (84.3%) had cues to act on COVID-19 infection prevention.The overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was 44.1% (95% CI = 41.1, 48.2). Only nine percent of participants did not practice handwashing with soap and 42.2% of the respondents did not utilize sanitizers to clean hand ( Table 6 ).The odds of adherence to safety measures of COVID-19 were 1.60 times higher among communities who perceived that they were not susceptible to COVID-19 than their counterparts (AOR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.39). Members of the community who did not have a perception of barriers of COVID-19 measures was 3.36 times higher on poor adherence of COVID-19 recommended preventive measures as compared to those who had a perception of barriers of COVID-19 measures (Table 7) .COVID-19 pandemic has created fear circumstances of the human race globally. The impact progress to social activities, education, health services and other services were affected [21] . Ethiopia has implemented preventive guidelines recommended by WHO to protect human to human transmission of COVID-19, such as social distancing, ban on public gathering, religious gatherings, regular personal hygiene, use of face masks, cover the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, one per seat in public vehicles, temporary closing of schools, Colleges and Universities [22] . The achievement of the world's fight against COVID-19 depends upon people's adherence to the control measures [23, 24] . The battle against COVID-19 in Ethiopia is still in its infancy. The first confirmed case was announced on March 13/2020. The community's adherence to these control measures is largely affected by their health belief towards COVID19 and its preventive measure. Since Ethiopian society is vulnerable to COVID-19, this health belief on risk perception gap is potentially dangerous and should be addressed to mitigate the disease spread.The HBM implies that an individual's perception of his/her susceptibility to a disease, attached to his/her belief that the disease has potentially serious consequences (perceived seriousness) equals the perceived threat which leads to a behavior such as using safety measure and testing. If the person believes that behaviors such as using safety measure are beneficial and outweigh his/her perceived barriers, then he/she is more likely to adopt the new behavior. Cues to action are events, people or things that encourage people to change their behavior. Examples of agents of cues to action include family, friends, media, and health care providers. Other modifying variables include age, gender, ethnicity, personality, socioeconomic, knowledge and motivation [17] .Findings from this study showed that 102(14.9%) participants were had a chronic disease, whereas study done at Turkish showed that 54 (15.7%) participants had a chronic disease [25] .According to the current study, the mean knowledge score was 10 with (SD ±2.66). More than half 361(52.9%) of the respondents had adequate knowledge on COVID-19. A study done in Pakistan medical students showed that, 80% of participants had sufficient knowledge about coronavirus [26] . A study done in Bangladesh showed that, the mean knowledge score for participants was 10.77 (SD ±0.588). Around 82.85% of the participants were having adequate knowledge on COVID 19 and other finding, 61.2% participants had adequate knowledge to COVID 19 [27, 28] . A National Survey of Syrian indicated that, 75.6% Participants were shown a good level of awareness regarding COVID-19 [29] . Finding from Chinese resident, the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 10.8 (SD±1.6), around 90% of participants were knowledgeable [30] . Study done on quarantine population in Tigrie region, Ethiopia showed that, the mean knowledge score was 8.73 (±2.64). Less than half, 42.9% of the study participants were knowledgeable [31] . Regarding perceived susceptibility, forty-five percent (44.8%) of the respondents were above the mean score, and they perceived themselves susceptible to COVID-19 infection. While a cross-sectional study in Myanmar showed that, 77.2% were had moderate risk perception and 22.8% were had high risk perception [32] . Study done South Korea showed, a high proportion of the respondents were perceived the seriousness of COVID-19 [33] . Cross-sectional studies in America, 50% of study participants were perceived the risk of COVID 19 [34] .A worldwide cross-sectional study across the ten sampled countries, risk perception were varied between 4.78 and 5.45 [35] .Regarding to the perceived severity of COVID-19 infection, 572 (83.7) participants were perceived severity of COVID-19 infection. Study done in India 90% of the participants considered COVID-19 as a serious disease [36] . Study in Egypt and China, most participants were believed that COVID-19 is a life-threatening, so any member of the families have risk of infection [37] , whereas 80% of china's were believed that COVID 19 severely harms health [38] .In this study, more than half of participants (55.6) did not have barriers to implement to COVID-19 prevention measures, whereas study in Egypt, more than two fifths (22.7%) of study participants were believed that infection is associated with stigma [37] . In our Study, nearly three-fourth of the study respondents (72.0%) was agreed on the usefulness of practicing the recommended safety measures. The global based study conducted in ten selected countries showed that, the act of practicing recommended safety measure for the greater benefit of society is relevant [35] .The respondents' belief of COVID-19 infection was formulated from HBM constructs. As a result, eighty-four percent of the respondents have cues to perform prevention measure activities towards COVID-19 and sixty-four percent of our study participants have self-efficacy to apply preventive measures of COVID-19 infections. This result indicated that there are still gaps on the belief of COVID-19 infection. Since Ethiopian communities have a strong societal ties and poor socioeconomic basis which are now risk factors for COVID-19 transmission [39, 40] , the communities need to ensure self-efficacy to apply preventive measures of COVID-19 infections.This study suggests that, 93 (13.6%) participants were always wearing a mask, 125 (18.3%) were always washing hands with soap for 20 seconds, 90 (13.2%) participants were always practiced avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, 85 (12.4%) were always staying at home, when have cold or fever and 127 (18.6%) were always applying recommended social distancing. The overall level of adherence to recommended safety measures was 44.8%. The study done in India, showed that 93.2% of the participants have adopted preventive measures to control COVID-19 and 97.6% were wear a mask, 97.3% were frequently wash hands, 97.8% were avoid handshaking and hugging, and 95% were avoid going out [36] . Another study done in Bangladesh, showed that 87.97% of participants were followed social distancing in their daily life [41] . Community based study Done at Pakistan showed that, 92.8% of respondents were practiced maintaining safe physical distance [42] . In Punjab 71.8% participants were always wearing a mask when going outside, 91.8% participants were followed the stay at home policy, 53.8% participants were followed the steps of hand hygiene [43] . Based on an impact survey done America, about 94.7% of participants reported washing or sanitizing hands, 39.6% reported working from home, and 9.6% reported visiting a doctor or hospital [44] . Survey of Bangladish showed that, more than half 51.6% of respondents had good practices of COVID 19 preventive measure [28] . Study done on quarantine population in Tigrie region, Ethiopia showed that, nearly half, 165 (49.8%) of the participants have gone to crowded places, Forty-six percent of the participants did not use a face mask when leaving home, more than half, 54.4% of participants did not obey the preventive measures given by local health care authorities [31] . A study done in US, more than half of patients (58.6%) were reported that the corona virus caused them to change their daily routine activities [45] other study done in China, majority of the 96.4% participants were had not visited any crowded place and 98.0% participants were wore masks when going out [30, 45] . Moreover, the reported prevalence of adherence level of community was likely to be conservative as this was based on community recall and self-reports which usually overestimate or underestimate community adherence levels. The cultural and socioeconomic characteristics of the community also determine the community adherence level. Here in the study area the communities are highly socially bonded by ""Edir"", ""Ekub"" and funereal ceremonies any other social structures which may affect the adherence level of the community on recommended safety measures.Regarding with factors, community perception on the susceptibility of COVID-19 measures, barriers on prevention measures of COVID-19 and the presence of self-efficacy showed significant association with level of recommended safety measures adherence on COVID-19.Poor adherence of recommended safety measures of COVID-19 were 38% less likely among household members who share a common bed compared from the counterpart. This was available evidence implies that, at least 1 meter physical distancing was associated with a large reduction in infection, and distances of 2 meters were more effective. These data also suggest that wearing face masks protect people (both healthcare workers and the general public) against infection by corona viruses, and that eye protection could confer additional benefit (3). These may be possibly due to that if family members share a common bed they may face difficulty in keeping social distancing.The odds of poor adherence on recommended safety measures of COVID-19 were 1.60 times higher among communities who perceives they are not susceptible for COVID-19 than the counterpart (AOR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.39). A Community that has no barriers on preventive measures were 3.36 times higher on poor adherence of COVID-19 recommended preventive measures. Community members who had self-efficacy 77% more likely adherence to COVID 19 safety measure.In this study, the overall adherence level of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19 was relatively low. It is vital to consider the communities' self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 in order to improve the adherence of the community towards the recommended safety measures of COVID-19.This study has different limitations. Firstly, this study followed a cross-sectional study design that cannot establish causal inferences. Secondly, were used face-to-face interviews to collect data, which is prone to social desirability biases. Thirdly, there may be sample selection biases. There was no previously standardized and validated tool to assess the Knowledge and community health belief towards COVID-19. The area is not well studied, so we didn't find adequate studies to compare and contrast our findings with others, and it makes our discussion narrow. Despite these limitations, the study finding provides valuable information about the adherence level of the communities towards the recommended safety measure of COVID 19.Supporting information S1 Annex.

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and first evident in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The known mode of transmission are droplets, contact, and aerosol [7, 8] . The complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet, but the most commonly reported symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, pneumonia, and complicated dyspnea [9] [10] [11] . Real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) detects the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 [8, 12, 13] .Health care professionals (HCPs) are at the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak response [14, 15] . As such, contact and droplet precautions should practice, and health care professionals must use personal protective equipment (PPE) [16] [17] [18] .Globally, Coronavirus disease-2019 disrupts health care systems. It is crucial to protect those most impacted by COVID-19, sustain gains made to address other infectious diseases, and maintain people's access to lifesaving health services [19] . The contained outbreak could significantly influence the global economy in the short run. The costs reduce by investing in public health systems in all countries. But, attention is needed for less developed countries that the health care system is weak [20] . The COVID-19 pandemic will create stress on the health care system in Africa [21, 22] .A qualitative study from China indicated that health care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. They are challenged by working in a very new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation [23] . Several factors may influence the readiness of health workers to deliver essential services, including re-deployment of staff to treat increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 and the absence of health workers in quarantine. The combination of increased workload and reduced numbers of health workers is likely to pose a severe strain on the capacity to maintain essential health care services [24] .Infection control interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 include universal source control, early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, the use of appropriate PPE when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection are obligatory in the health care settings [25] . The 74.7% of study participants believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission, as shown in a study by Khader et al. [26] . Findings from Pakistan also stated that 13.8% of participants remove the mask while talking to the patient, 20.2% reused it, 44.9% correctly used the yellow-coded bag for disposal, 93.9% wear masks in clinics, and 94.6% wear masks on hospital premises [27] . Overcrowding, limited infection control material, less commitment of HCPs to the policies and procedures, insufficient training, and lack of policy and procedures of infection control practice identified as barriers [28] .Presently, studies are emerging regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in different aspects. However, a few have explored barriers that affecting the practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19 among health professionals. Therefore, there was a need to fill these research gaps in the study setting.In this phenomenological study, key informants working in public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia, were involved, from June 10-30, 2020. Gamo zone is one of the administrative zones in Ethiopia. It is bordered by Wolayta, Dawro, and Gofa zones in the North, Lake Abaya in the northeast, and Amaro special woreda and Dirashe special woreda in the southeast, and South Omo in the southwest. The administrative center of the Gamo zone is Arba Minch town. Gamo zone has one administrative town and 13 woredas. It hosted five hospitals (one general and four primary hospitals), 56 health centers, and 299 health posts.A purposive sampling method was employed to recruit key informants. Chief executive officers, medical directors of the hospitals, health center heads, environmental health workers, chief nursing director, matron, heads in each ward or unit, and case team leaders involved for the key informants' interview (KII). In this study, sixteen key informants were involved, based on idea saturation.Two interviewers were involved, and the information was collected using a semi-structured interview guide. The interview guide was developed based on expert opinion, knowledge, and skill of investigators and existing works of literature (Table 1) (Supplementary file 1) . Interviewers trained, and key informants advertised in each participating health facility to involve in the study. The aim of the study explained for those who zealous to the participant. Then, to meet the study objective, pillar participants were purposively selected by the interviewer and involved in the KII. At the outset, the sociodemographic characteristics of each participant were documented after getting written and signed consent. Each session of the KIIs was recorded by an audiotape recorder, and keynotes took. The interview was conducted in a private room, which comfortable for the participants.Trained and experienced interviewers collected the information. The interviewers communicated and discussed the points that they faced during the data collection period daily. The well-established, expert commented, reviewed semi-structured interview guide used to collect the data. The information was sought from participants with relevant expertise and experience, a neutral view of the investigator maintained, and participants probed and who had much on the issue selected to ensure trustworthiness. The participant's variations were managed by involving KIs with different positions and responsibilities in the health facilities. Original audios and written transcripts re-checked to develop themes to achieve data credibility. NVivo 12 Pro software was used to enhance the maintenance of connections between participant descriptions and researcher synthesis. The result was presented alongside direct quotes from participants. The recorded interview transcripts, translations, and demographic summary of participants were maintained, and keynotes took during and after (during analysis) the interview to achieve the dependability of standards.The two investigators independently heard the audios of each interview that transcribed verbatim in the local language more times until they familiar with the participant's information. Then, translated into English language transcripts by those investigators, compared, and argued for discrepancies. The investigators read and re-read the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the idea and developed memos and codes line by line. Then, refined and compared the emerged new themes and sub-themes. The investigators discussed until agreement regarding the inconsistencies, new ideas of the participants, emerged themes and sub-themes daily, and the data collection continued until idea saturation. To analyze that data, thematic content analysis was employed by using an inductive approach in NVivo 12 Pro software.In this interview, sixteen-key informants were involved with mean age and standard deviation of 34.7 ± 8 years old. Of the key informants, 10 (62.5%) were male, and 13 (81.3%) had an educational level of BSc (1st degree). Out of participants, 13 (81.3%) participants served five or more years in the health facility. Eleven (68.8%) participants were health professional qualifications of public health, and four (25%) were nurses. Overall, six main themes and twenty-six sub-themes emerged in this study ( Table 2) .The majority of participants stated that the origin of COVID-19 was from the markets of Wuhan province, China, after eating animal meat (bat). It is caused by a virus and the disease named by year of occurrence, called Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) . The most commonly reported modes of transmission of the COVID-19 were physical contact, air and droplets, and body fluids. Dry cough, fever, shortness of breathing, sore throat, back pain, and sneezing were symptoms reported by the study participants.""The mode of transmissions are physical contact, air, droplets, handshaking, and different body fluids"" (Participant 15).""The sign and symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, the difficulty of breathing/shortness of breathing, and sore throat"" (Participant 16).""The sign and symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, back pain, sneezing, and dry cough"" (Participant 12).The majority of the participants responded that homestay (social distancing), physical distancing, avoiding public gathering, hand washing, applying facemask, and using hand sanitizer or alcohol could prevent the transmission of the COVID-19. There is no proven drug for Table 1 Major points of the interview scriptWhat do you think about COVID-19?How health professionals prevent themselves and patients from COVID-19?What do you think about precautionary measures?What are the perceived barriers to the practice of precautionary measures?What activities done in the health facility to prevent the spread of COVID-19?What do you suggest to improve the practice of health care providers to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic?the COVID-19 until now. Nevertheless, some participants stated high dose antibiotics used as treatment and taking cooked hot foods and fluids recommended as supportive management.""There is no vaccine and treatment for Coronavirus Disease-2019. But, the best prevention way is homestay; others are not got to a public gathering, physical distancing, washing hands with soap and water, using alcohol or sanitizer, and using facemask at market or place where so many individuals gathered"". Besides, to above-stated prevention ways, social or physical distancing at least 2 m or 6 ft. Reducing transport, not got to ""Lekiso"" or burial places, ""Ikub"" and Edir"" places"" (Participant 4).""The prevention ways are social distancing, frequent washing with water and soap by rubbing hands for 20 seconds, using alcohol and sanitizer in areas where water is not available. Two staffs from our sectors trained on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and they stated that we could treat COVID-19 by antibiotics by increasing the dose (at least by Amoxicillin) and by taking cooked hot food and fluids"" (Participant 3).Tension on health professionals and absence from work, socio-cultural, and economic crisis were the main consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, it is the utmost public health issue all over the world.""COVID-19 is the most severe and resulted in tension on HCPs and economic crisis. It is possible to control the transmission but challenged with the societal culture and the way of living"" (Participant 7). The perceived practice of preventive measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in health professionalsThe majority of the health professionals prevented themselves and others who came to the health facility by using personal protective equipment (PPEs) (facemask, glove, and gown), frequently washing hands with soap and water. They continuously maintained recommended physical distance as needed, distance beds in the ward, controlling the number of visitors, and order the visitors to use a facemask. All most all the health professionals use hand sanitizer or alcohol after any contact with patients. Patients with cough and high fever identified and isolated start from pre-triage. The other infection prevention practices (IPPs) are also applied in the health facility, such as an appropriate waste disposal system.""Health care professional prevent themselves and patients or any person who visits the health facility by using different kinds of masks (surgical mask, N-95 facemask, and locally produced masks), frequently washing hands with soap and water, and by using hand sanitizers"" (Participant 1).""Health care workers, preventing themselves and others by using a facemask, which produced locally, and some bought their N-95 facemask and hand sanitizer. They wash hands with soap and water in the main get and emergency room only due to a shortage of handwashing facilities. The entrance of patients and visitors controlled in the main get. One person or supporter for severely ill patients and only patient if stand-alone can get into the facility. All individuals who enter the facility must apply a facemask and wash hand in the main get"" (Participant 8).""In the case of the pediatric ward, the patient came after passing pre-triage, and all the staff practice standard precautionary measures such as using a facemask, donning gloves, frequently washing hands, and use sanitizers. If the patients with cough came to the ward, there is isolation room until diagnosis and if we suspected COVID-19 sample sent to the testing center"" (Participant 11).""All health professionals have a facemask and maintain physical distancing. However, it is difficult in case of maternal, child health services, family planning, delivery, and postnatal care because there is direct physical contact"" (Participant 7).""The health care workers preventing the pandemic by infection prevention practice such as avoiding or stored contaminated materials in specified places and follow the adequate waste disposal mechanisms, using PPEs (facemask, gloves, and gowns)"" (Participant 15).Perceived barriers for the practice of preventive measures for COVID-19The main factor that affects the health care providers' practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic were lack of awareness of the community, negligence, and ignorance, not using a facemask and using incorrectly, and miss conception about the disease.""There is ignorance and negligence in the community to accept the practice of prevention ways or to avoid the previous culture while came to our facility"" (Participant 13).""Most community members who came to institution perceived that there are no any COVID-19 and it is false and politics, not a disease. It is a common cold, which is cured easily. Because no one is infected and no one is dead in our surrounding"" (Participant 3).""There is a lack of awareness in the community who came to the institution even if awareness created by different stakeholders by using montarbo and microphones. They came without a facemask, and some apply facemask inappropriately"" (Participant 7).The national response on COVID-19 prevention in a government organization allowed pregnant and breastfeeding staff, advanced age staff, and staff with chronic diseases to stay in the home. However, in contrast to these, health care providers with those stated issues are obligated to do work in the health care institutions. Therefore, this may affect the willingness and motivation of the staff.""The main challenge in this facility to practice precautionary measures in line with standards and emergency operation is that pregnant and breastfeeding staffs, aged staffs, and staffs with chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes mellitus were obligated to work and not allowed to stay at home"" (Participant 3).As reported by the utmost participants, negligence and ignorance were the most speculated factor or challenges in the practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic.""Regarding the practice precautionary measures to prevent COVID-19, most staffs practice the measures even if there are some negligent and ignorant staffs due to no occurrence of the case around the town"" (Participant 16).The shortage of PPEs (facemask and glove), scarcity of hand cleaning solutions (alcohol and sanitizer), and inadequate training and trained staffs were the most common barriers that influence the practice of preventive measures. Similarly, unavailability of guidelines, water shortage, lack of duty, OPD, and emergency rooms were also point outed by key informants.""The barriers are the absence of hand sanitizer, shortage of alcohol, facemasks, and other PPE since our district is new, and the majority of the thinks are limited. There is no screening in our institution as well as in our district even with infrared thermometer"" (Participant 5).""The barriers that affect the practice of precautionary measures in our institution are … , shortage of supplies (facemask, gloves, etc.), inadequate OPD, and emergency rooms to maintain the recommended physical distance. The other factors are..., unavailability of guidelines to orient the staffs"" (Participant 15).""There is no training and psychological support for HCP to avoid stress and to stabilize the situation. The budget issue is the main concern to fulfill the necessary materials and training all the health care providers. As our health facility, there is no water, we buy 20 litter/ 10 birr per day water from surrounding, and we use rainwater, which strode in the tanker, there is also a shortage of alcohol and sanitizer, and district health office gave two litter alcohol and sanitizer"" (Participant 4).""The barriers that affect the practice of precautionary measures in our institution are inadequate duty rooms for staffs that many staffs exchangeable used a single room for a period and if one individual from those infected the risk contamination is most likely. The other challenge is the shortage of hand sanitizer and facemask. The recommended duration of use of single facemask is 8 hour, but most staffs use more than a week"" (Participant 6).""The main problem in this health facility is that as different teams or stakeholders, commented there is no triage. However, we simply isolated patients with cough and gave priority for those individuals"" (Participant 3).Some of the study participants highlighted that lack of communication, support from the community and government, and lack of attention and recognition for staff were factors that influence the practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care facility.""The barriers that affect the practice of precautionary measures are attention and recognition not given for health care professionals …. There is no support from the town health office, zonal health department, and task force in the zone rather than taking the suspected or confirmed cases to the treatment center. Staffs in other government organization apply standard and recommended facemask, but we struggled to serve the community by locally produced and below standard facemasks"" (Participant 8).""The other factors are lack of communication of our institution with supporting organization or universities to train the staffs and unavailability of guidelines to orient the staffs"" (Participant 15).Newfangled activities in the health facility after the occurrence of the pandemic Organization of fever clinic and pre-triage service, hand washing station, and screening with infrared thermometer or thermo-scan in the get were the major newfangled activities after the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals are also controlled and obligated to apply facemask while entering the health facility.""Activities that conducted after the occurrence of the pandemic are an organization of fever clinic that provided by trained staffs with an infrared thermometer, pre-triage service, and COVID-19 testing center launched. Handwashing facilities organized in a different place and all persons are obligated to apply facemask"" (Participant 12).""The activities conducted in the facility after the occurrence of the pandemic were a team (taskforce) created and a team of health professionals trained in the zonal level. There is integration with health extension workers at the health post, and those health extension workers conducted surveillance at least 20 households per day to identify the suspected cases"" (Participant 3).""The activities conducted in our facility after the pandemic was the construction of new handwashing station, screening in the get, distancing patient bed in the ward, reducing the number participates in meeting"" (Participant 2).Involving and integrating the awareness creation activities with the community leaders was very important. Strengthening and monitoring the activities of different task forces, extensive training for health professionals and leaders in the health facility also suggested by the study participants. Surveillance with mass screening, outreach services to create awareness in the community, transportation control, and attention and recognition for health professionals were the other concerns, which recommended."" … the community leader must intervene on this to save the community from this pandemic. The community practicing already an existing culture in ""Eder"" ""Ekub"" and ""Lekiso"" places, that the task force, the town health office, and the zonal health department must support the health professionals or team to create awareness in the community … "" (Participant 8).""… awareness creation must continue in the community … transport access must arrange … for the staffs who came far from the health facility"" (Participant 7)."" … task force activities are key roles to prevent the spread of infection in the community. Therefore, those activities must strengthen and frequently monitored rather than one session or one-week activity"" (Participant 1)."" … the leaders in the facility must train on COVID-19 prevention aspects before anyone that the leaders are the main responsible person or individual to orient or to facilitate the health professionals or staffs to practice prevention measures"" (Participant 2)."" … mass screening needed to identify the case, staffs and all the community must apply a facemask and use hand sanitizer … "" (Participant 12).The novel coronavirus is a global medical pandemic that resulted in stress on the health care system. There is no proven drug for this disease. Because of the high contagiousness, strictly practicing precautionary measures can save the lives of many populations. Studies are emerging related to the epidemiological aspects, social, political, and economic consequences of the COVID-19. Nevertheless, few are exploring barriers. As such, this aimed to fill this research gap in Ethiopia. The study found that negligence and ignorance, shortage of PPEs, lack of infrastructure, lack of training, lack of communication, and lack of attention and recognition for staff were the most common barriers to the practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19 in the health facility.Less commitment of health care workers to the policies and procedures was the main factor that the health professionals did not practice prevention ways and affected with the COVID-19 [28, 29] . This study also reconnoitered that negligence and ignorance among health care workers were the most speculated factor or challenges in the practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason is that most people, including health professionals, have miss conception about the disease and the contagiousness, and due to that case, they do not give attention to the prevention practices and abandon due to not the occurrence of the disease in the surrounding that they reside. This study found that a shortage of PPEs (facemasks and gloves) and scarcity of hand cleaning solutions (alcohol and sanitizer) had the main barriers. These findings also are shown in studies conducted elsewhere [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . These are the fact that health professionals are obligated to do the procedures or help patients with available resources (PPEs), and a breach in standard precautions inevitable. These resulted in the health professionals more vulnerable to the infection and more likely to transmit the disease (COVID-19) to others. Studies conducted in Ethiopia [32] , Pakistan [28] , and China [31] reported that lack of access to infection prevention training or insufficient/inadequate training in infection control measures resulted in the poor practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19. A result of systematic review also supplements the findings of the above-stated literature. Health professionals were not trained on the infection and how to use PPEs, and they reported it was a problem when training was not mandatory [34] . The other study stated institutional (training and education, policies, and management expectations) factors are essential to improve preventive measure practices [35] . In line with this, this study found that a shortage of training for the staff (health professionals) had one of the barriers that affect the practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Provide training for the health professionals on overall aspects of the COVID-19, including precautionary measures in the health care facility, can improve preventive measures practices.Evidence showed that tied to the guideline itself and how it communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, lack of physical space, and poor design of the hospitals affecting HCP's ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines. Besides, it affects infection prevention practice when managing respiratory infectious diseases [32, 34, 36] . This study also identified that lack of communication and support, unavailability of the guidelines, shortage of water supply, inadequate duty, OPD, and emergency rooms were barriers to the practice of preventive measures. The reason is that updated guidelines, communication with the different supporting teams and support from concerned bodies, adequate facilities to provide quality services with the standard are pivotal to practice precautionary measures for COVID-19 in the health facility.Lack of attention and recognition for staffs, lack of motivation and they obligated to do work, and lack of awareness, negligence, and ignorance of the community while coming to health care institution were also pointed out in this study as barriers that practice of preventive measures for COVID-19 among health professionals. The other barriers also identified, such as not using a facemask and using incorrectly, and miss conception about the disease. These are facts that give attention and recognition for those in the front line, the motivation by fulfilling the thing that urgently needs as much as possible, and community vigilance can improve the practice.Only two interviewers were involved to ensure consistency and bracketing. However, those interviewers were experts on qualitative data collection and had full information and idea about the study protocol. The ethical review board not allowed other qualitative data collection methods rather than KIIs. These were due to the nature of the disease transmission and the state emergency declaration. The sample size was relatively small, and only key informants were involved in this study. These may affect the transferability of the study results.This study can be input for the policymakers and program evaluators to design appropriate strategies and planning. These initiate training and capacity building in the health institutions based on the identified gaps. Health care providers and other stakeholders benefited from this study. The finding serves as a tool for public policy and case management teams to evaluate the prevention and control measures for novel coronavirus in the health care institution. It also provides the basic framework for future studies in assessing and comparing the performance of interventions.This study found a gap in practicing preventive measures for COVID-19 in health facilities among health professionals due to multiple barriers. Shortage of PPEs and hand cleaning solution, shortage of training, negligence, and ignorance of HCPs, and poor infrastructure in the facility were the most common barriers that need immediate attention. Lack of motivation and obligation to do work and lack of recognition for HCPs were also identified as barriers to practice preventive measures for COVID-19. Therefore, the government, the ministry of health, non-governmental organizations, and other voluntary supports should fulfill the necessary supplies in the health facilities and improve the infrastructures. Different capacity-building (individual, organizational and systemic) activities needed such as, training and workshops, mentorships, seeking volunteers with expertise, and raising public awareness. Besides, attention and recognition must give to the health care professionals.","Ethiopia","first author","2021-01-22",1

Among others, these actions involved mandatory shutdown of economic activities and restriction of nonessential travel. The global response to COVID-19 provided researchers a unique opportunity to assess the short-term impact of intervention measures on ambient air quality. Such studies are critically important considering that about nine million people, worldwide, die every year from stroke, heart disease, respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer caused by exposures to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) pollution (Cohen et al. 2005; Burnett et al., 2018; Yin et al. 2020 ). Exposure to PM 2.5 pollution has also been linked to increased deaths from diabetes mellitus (Meo et al., 2015; Weinmayr et al., 2015) and more recently, COVID-19 (Hendryx and Luo, 2020; Setti et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .Several studies reported substantial improvements in air quality during COVID-19 lockdown compared to pre-lockdown (Abdullah et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Menut et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego, 2020; Tobias et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . Other studies comparing PM 2.5 pollution levels during lockdown with baseline average also found substantial declines in PM 2.5 pollution levels during the lockdown period. For example, between 10% and 54% reductions in PM 2.5 pollution levels were reported for different localities in India during lockdown compared to baseline averages (Chauhan and Singh, 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Ranjan et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020) .Similar or lower reductions in PM 2.5 pollution levels were also reported for localities in China (Pei et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , Brazil (Dantas et al., 2020; Nakada and Urban, 2020) , J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof United States and Canada (Adams, 2020; Berman and Ebisu, 2020) , and in many parts of the world (Baldasano, 2020; Chauhan and Singh, 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020) .April. During this period, most countries transitioned from one weather season to the next.For example, India transitioned from winter to summer, while Nigeria moved from dry to rainy season. Some seasons such as winter are known to aggravate air pollution, while others such as rainy seasons reduce pollution level. Indeed, air pollution levels were found to be strongly influenced by season (Etchie et al. 2018a) . For instance, studies conducted in India observed higher levels of PM 2.5 pollution during winter compared with summer (Pandey et al. 2013; Singla et al., 2012; Tiwari et al., 2012) , or during dry (summer) compared to rainy (monsoon) season (Etchie et al., 2017) . Recently, Chauhan and Singh (2020) attributed about 20% and 30% reduction in PM 2.5 pollution level during COVID-19 lockdown period in New York and Los Angeles, respectively, to rainfall. Likewise, the analysis of long-term trends (2015-2020) in PM 2.5 pollution during the months of January to May in New York did not find a significant change in air pollution resulting from COVID-19 lockdown (Zangari et al., 2020) . Improvement in air quality during the lockdown months in New York was attributed to seasonal change and previous environmental interventions (Zangari et al., 2020) . To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the long-term seasonal changes in air quality in tropical countries (such as a transition from dry to rainy season) in the months of COVID concentrations due to their high spatial (global) and temporal (~20 years of daily observations) coverages. Several methods have been utilized to derive ambient PM 2.5 concentrations at a high spatiotemporal resolution using satellite AOD products ). The methods include: semi empirical models (Lin et al. 2015; Zhang and Li, 2015) ; chemical transport models (van Donkelaar et al. 2019) ; and statistical models such as linear model (Chudnovsky et al. 2013) , mixed-effect model (Chudnovsky et al. 2014; Kloog et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019 ), generalized additive model (Ma et al. 2016 ) andgeographically and/or temporally weighted regression models (Hu et al. 2013; He and Huang 2018 Yang et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2021) and extremely randomized tree (Wei et al. , 2020 (Wei et al. , 2021 (Guo et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2013 ), South Africa (Kumar et al. 2014) , United States (Tang et al. 2017) and India (Mahato et al., 2020; Ranjan et al., 2020) . Satellite AODs however represent both natural and anthropogenic aerosol pollution level, and may have high measurements error compared to ground-level fine mode AODs (AOD f ), which have radii between 0.1 and 0.25 (Park et al. 2019 ) and are mainly anthropogenic.In this study, we utilized NN to derive monthly average ground-level AOD f across localities in Nigeria from the year 2001 to 2020 using satellites AOD products, AERONET aerosol optical properties, meteorological parameters and spatial predictors. We statistically assessed the long-term trends (2001 to 2020) in AOD f in order to ascertain whether changes in air quality occurred in Nigeria due to COVID-19 lockdown or not. We believe that ours is a first study to statistically examine the long-term trends in air quality in a tropical country with high baseline air pollution level, high frequency of rainfall and no environmental intervention measures prior to 2020.Nigeria detected the first COVID case in Ogun State on February 28, 2020 traced to an Italian visitor to Nigeria through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos.On 26 th March 2020, the first COVID fatality was recorded in Nigeria, prompting the Federal Government to declare a nationwide lockdown in effect from 11 pm on 30 th March 2020. The lockdown, spanning from 30 th March to 3 rd May 2020, banned all non-essential international and domestic travels, and shutdown economic activities including schools.Between 4 th May and June 1 st of 2020, the first phase of easing of the lockdown (easing phase-1) took place. During this period, intrastate movement resumed but commercial drivers were allowed to take only 60% of their normal carriage capacities. Also, overnight J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof curfew from 8 pm to 6 am was exercised but was later shortened from 10 pm to 4 am in mostStates of Nigeria. Senior public offices and private businesses were allowed to work only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. In the second phase of easing (easing phase-2), which was from 2 nd June to 29 th June 2020, banks resumed normal working hours. Religious gatherings less than 20 persons were allowed to hold just one service per week. Government offices opened from Monday to Friday but working hours were from 9 am to 2 pm. This second phase was later extended to September 03, 2020. During this extension, domestic travels resumed followed by international flights. Vehicles were mandated to travel with 50% of their carriage capacities, with compulsory use of face mask.We obtained daily Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction ( We downloaded different monthly average meteorological predictors over Nigeria: rainfall (RF) (mm), relative humidity (RH) (%), air temperature at 2 m above the ground (T) (K), wind speed at 10 m above ground ( Journal Pre-proof datasets were processed and downloaded using GEE cloud platform with its built-in country boundary feature for Nigeria.First, we evaluated the satellite MAIAC AODs (AOD MAIAC ) against the corresponding ground-level AERONET AOD datasets at 550 nm (AOD AERONET ) at Ilorin using simple linear regression, after removing outliers (n = 9). The validation result is shown in Equation 1:The correlation coefficient (r) We utilized the multilayer perceptron, neural network (MLP-NN) procedure, which is a feedforward architecture from the input layer through the hidden layer to the output layer.The input parameters were location, year, month, AOD MAIAC , RF, RH, Temp, WS, PBLH, NDVI and PD, while the output parameter was ground-level AOD f . We obtained the number of nodes in the hidden layer from training without external interference.

The analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 23 statistics package.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWe investigated the impact of local meteorological conditions on the AOD f , using multiple linear regression, of the form:= 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +Where y is AOD f , 0 is intercept, 1 to 8 are the coefficients for time (X, is month of the year from January to August), season (S: dry season is January-February, while rainy season is March-August.), relative humidity (RH), rainfall (RF), temperature (T), wind speed (WS), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and year (Z, is 2001-2020), respectively. is error term.The monthly average AODs across Nigeria during pre-lockdown, lockdown and easing phases in the year 2020 are shown in Fig. 1 . There were substantial reductions in AOD levels across the States in Nigeria during the period of lockdown or easing phases compared to pre-lockdown in year 2020 (Fig. 1 ). During lockdown, the average air pollution level inNigeria fell by about 69% in comparison to the pre-lockdown value, with further reduction of about 23% during easing phase-1. In Lagos, the pollution levels changed by about 81% and 6% respectively for the above two phases, and the reduction was observed to be about 50% and 56% respectively for these phases in FCT area. Generally, air pollution reductions during lockdown appeared to be greater in Southern States than in the Northern States. Also, the lowest pollution levels were observed during easing phase-1, but not during lockdown. The pollution levels increased considerably, particularly in the Central States, during easing phase-2. The percentage increase in pollution levels in Nigeria as a whole, Lagos or FCT during easing phase-2 compared with easing phase-1 was approximately 44%, 11% or 381% respectively.A time-series analysis of historical changes in AOD levels from 2010 to 2020 (Fig. 2) did not reveal a considerable change during lockdown or phase easing in 2020 compared to the past ten years. Seasonal influence and local meteorological conditions, rather than lockdown, appear to account for the reduction in air pollution level during lockdown or phase to reduced (or delayed) rainfall, we could not suggest the same for the AOD spike for the same period in 2018.The COVID lockdown measures in Nigeria is expected to impact mainly anthropogenic pollution sources. Therefore, we statistically assessed the long-term trends The impact analysis using multiple linear regression shows that seasonal change and variations in local meteorological conditions are significant (α = 0.05) factors influencing fine mode aerosol levels across Nigeria ( Table 1 ). The prevailing temperature has the greatest effect on fine aerosols pollution in Nigeria, followed in a decreasing order by month of the year, relative humidity, PBLH, season and wind speed. The negative sign in Table 1 indicates negative correlation between the parameter of interest and AOD f . For example, when the surface temperature increases, the convective currents become stronger dispersing ground level aerosols leading to a decrease in AOD f levels. Similarly, increase in surface relative humidity favors the hygroscopic size growth and accumulation of fine mode aerosols into coarse mode aerosols (Hu et al. 2010) resulting in lower AOD f levels. High wind speed reduces AOD f levels by dispersion. Aerosols interact strongly with meteorological parameters within the PBLH. PBLH characterize the convective and turbulent processes, entrainment and dispersion of aerosols and was found to correlate negatively with surface relative humidity (Zhang et al. 2013; Miao et al. 2019) , except over desert region dominated with stable PBL regime (Zhang et al., 2018) . Therefore, a decrease in PBLH (i.e. increase in surface relative humidity) may lead to the growth/accumulation of coarse mode aerosols from fine mode aerosols, leading to a reduction in AOD f levels.For the coastal state of Lagos, the effect was greatest for temperature followed in a decreasing order by month of the year, rainfall, wind speed, season, year and PBLH. The result for Lagos suggests that rainfall may also have statistically significant effects on aerosol pollution levels in other southern States of Nigeria where the intensity of rainfall is high.Heavy rainfall can reduce aerosol pollution levels by directly scavenging the pollutants or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof indirectly, by limiting outdoor activities that cause the pollution. For instance, both economic and commercial activities are affected by heavy rainfall. Rainfall also reduces household burning of solid fuels and wastes. In periods of heavy downpour, rainfall degrades roads and causes flood, leading to reductions in non-essential movements. Floods also pollute drinking water resources considerably (Adewuyi et al., 2014; Etchie et al., 2013 Etchie et al., , 2014 Etchie et al., , 2020 . Kumar 2020; Kumar et al. 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Ranjan et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego, 2020) . However, studies that analyzed the long-term changes in air pollution in temperate localities found no significant improvement resulting from the lockdown measures (Adams, 2020; Zangari et al., 2020) . Using groundlevel fine mode aerosol levels across Nigeria from 2001 to 2020, we have, for the very first time, shown that the COVID-19 shutdown measures did not contribute significantly to air quality improvement in Nigeria. Although there was substantial decline in the pollution levels during the COVID lockdown and phasing easing months (April-August, 2020) compared with pre-lockdown months (January-March, 2020), the change in pollution was similar in magnitude to reductions occurring during the same period in past years (2001 to 2019). The impact analysis revealed that seasonal change to favorable meteorological conditions in Nigeria is responsible for the decline in air pollution during the COVID lockdown period.We note some limitations of this study. First, we derived the levels of fine aerosols across Nigeria using AERONET's ground-level measurements due to the lack of groundlevel monitoring stations for PM 2.5 or gaseous pollutants such as No x and SO 2 in Nigeria.Thus we could not interpret the magnitude of the changes in fine aerosols in terms of actual concentrations or risk to human health in Nigeria. Secondly, our estimates of fine aerosols were based on datasets from the only AERONET monitoring station in Nigeria, which is at Ilorin. Therefore, the spatio-temporal variability of fine aerosols across Nigeria is dependent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof on the variability in MAIAC AODs, spatial predictors and meteorological parameters utilized.From this study, we conclude that there were significant improvements in air quality across Nigerian localities during the COVID-19 lockdown and easing phases, compared with pre-lockdown period in year 2020. However, the air quality improvements were not due to the lockdown measures, but seasonal change of favorable meteorological conditions. Namely, improvement in air quality resulting from the 2020 COVID lockdown measures in Nigeria was not statistically significant because of the strong effects of seasonal weather changes.Possibly, this conclusion may also be applicable to other tropical countries that transitioned into a season characterized by low pollution levels at the time of COVID shutdown, and should be investigated in future studies. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that has statistically assessed the effect of COVID-19 lockdown intervention on air quality in a tropical country with high baseline pollution level, strong seasonality and no environmental intervention history before 2020.This study was made possible by the efforts of numerous persons over many years Liu, B.C., Binaykia, A., Chang, P.C., Tiwari, M.K., Tsao, C.C., 2017.

Despite the devastating scourge of the disease, there has not been any proven treatment against the SARS-CoV-2. The recommendations of the disease control bodies are focused on disease prevention and control measures to minimize spread and to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. [6] [7] [8] Vaccination is an effective preventive measure reducing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious agents. It constitutes the mainstay of prevention of infectious childhood diseases and is of major importance in primary health care. 9 Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant drive to find an effective vaccine with several vaccines at various stages of drug trials and some already being tested in humans across various countries. 10, 11 However, the success of this vaccine will be dependent on the acceptance and uptake level and the subsequent development of herd immunity. 9 In recent times, there has been a growing anti-vaccine movement, 11 it is therefore imperative to explore the barriers and drivers of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine to help the government, policymakers, and health care workers mitigate the impact of probable low vaccine uptake.Vaccine uptake refers to the absolute number of people who receive a specified vaccine dose(s); 12 and low uptake has been increasingly recognized as a challenge to the success of vaccination programs. 11 Uptake of vaccines can be influenced by several factors such as personal risk perception, fear of side effects, access to media, information sources, religious/cultural beliefs, the convenience of getting to a health facility, level of trust for the healthcare system, household wealth, residence, ethnicity, and other demographic variables, as well as other social influences. 13, 14 Introduction of a new vaccine to the public may be met with hesitancy due to skepticism about its effectiveness and potential safety. 9 Several studies have been carried out on determinants of uptake of already existent vaccines [14] [15] [16] but there is currently a paucity of data on the uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa with an estimated population of about 200 million and a total land area of 910,770 Km2 (351,650 sq. miles). 19 Nigeria has six geopolitical zones (Southwest, Southeast, Southsouth, Northwest, Northeast, Northcentral) with 36 states. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Federal Medical Centre Gusau, Zamfara State, Nigeria.The study was conducted online using a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire and included Nigerian adults above the age of 18 years who consented to participate in the study. The minimum sample size was determined to be 409 at a confidence level of 95% and based on the proportion of people with good knowledge of 39% in a previous study 20 and a 5% margin of error.Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. The knowledge of COVID-19 among respondents was scored based on the number of correct responses given. The number of correct responses was compared with the average score. Participants whose score equaled or was above the average were categorized as having good knowledge while those who scored below the average were categorized as having poor knowledge. Descriptive statistics (frequency tables and percentages) were calculated for the sample demographic characteristics. The frequency and percentage of willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were also calculated. Chi-square analysis was computed to test for association between sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19 among respondents, vaccination history of the respondent, and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was carried out to determine the predictors of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The level of significance was predetermined at a p-value of less than 0.05 at a 95% confidence level.Most of the respondents (58.2%) were willing to receive the vaccine once it is available while 19 .2% of the respondents were not willing to receive the vaccine; 22.6% of the respondents were indecisive ( Table 2 ). Many of the respondents who were unwilling to take the vaccine were not sure of reasons why they were unwilling to receive the vaccine ( Table 3 ). Among the respondents that were willing to take the vaccine, the majority (53.5%) were comfortable with a single dose of the vaccine, while only 8% of the respondents were willing to take more than 4 doses. (Table 4 ) The preferred route of administration among most of the respondents was either oral (58.2%) or Injection (53.8%) with many of the respondents rejecting the administration of the vaccine through the intranasal route (76.1%) ( Table 5) .Socio-demographic variables such as gender and religion of the respondents showed a statistically significant association with willingness to receive the vaccine (Table 6a and 6b).This study reveals that only a simple majority (58.2%) were willing to take a COVID 19 vaccine when available. This is short of the findings from a study by Abdelhafiz A. et.al 24 where about 73% of the respondents were willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Malik A. 25 in his study in the United States (US) also found that 67% of participants would be willing to accept the vaccine. About one-fifth of the respondents in this study were indecisive; a finding similar to the one reported among healthcare workers from a study conducted by Fu C. et.al. 26 Strikingly, there was an aversion to multiple vaccine doses among those willing to take the vaccine with most preferring the oral and the injection routes over other potential routes of administration This information is important for policymakers to improve uptake and compliance, especially if multiple route options become available. About one-fifth of the respondents were unwilling to receive a potential vaccine which appears to stem from skepticism about the safety of the potential vaccine. For instance, in this study, the majority were unsure if the potential vaccine is 'a mark of the beast' or if the motive is 'to reduce the world population'. This is comparable to the findings in the study by Thunstrom L. et.al 9 where it was reported that 20% of the US population would decline the vaccine. They noted that distrust of vaccine safety and vaccine novelty are among the most important obstacles to vaccination.While gender (male), and 'perception that vaccines generally are good' predicted the positive uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine as hypothesized, surprisingly, knowledge and risk perception of the disease did not, despite reported good knowledge and positive risk perception.This suggests there are still other factors influencing the uptake of a potential vaccine; of note is the range of misconceptions bordering on the skepticism about the safety of a potential vaccine identified in this study, which seems to agree with the study by Thunstrom L. et.al. 9 While it is recognized that hypothetical choices may not always reflect real-life behaviour/decision, it is imperative for stakeholders (for example government agencies/policymakers, non-governmental organizations, and health care workers) to still do more in terms of health education and promotion especially in addressing these misconceptions about a potential COVID-19 vaccine.This may go a long way in improving probable low vaccine uptake.Findings may be influenced by selection bias because respondents needed access to a smartphone or computer. This may have excluded the poor, elderly who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 this may limit external validity and may have distorted estimation of those willing to take the vaccine.Policymakers and Stakeholders will need to focus attention on Health education campaigns targeted at both males and females in the community to improve the acceptance and uptake of the vaccine.Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of Federal Medical Center, Gusau, Zamfara State, NigeriaThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable requestThe authors declare that they have no competing interestsConception/design of the study-COO, VKS, OBF, AOO; data collection-UOA, CMI, JCO, OFA, KWO; data analysis and interpretation-EEA, GOP, AOA, OEA; article drafting-BFU, YBA, OFA, AOO; Critical revision of the article-COO, BFU, VKS; final approval of the version to be published-all authors 1 9 12.

Yet compliance with public health guidelines is not guaranteed, and motivating people to adopt new preventive health behaviors is inherently difficult. Quantifying the extent to which mask rules are being followed is essential for setting public health policy decisions. But limited data availability has made understanding the extent to which COVID-19 mitigation rules are being followed challenging. Encouraging mask use in rural, low-income settings with limited ability to absorb economic shocks of lockdowns 5 and fewer resources to obtain and distribute vaccines 6 is especially important.The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards in Kenya (Maseno University) and the United States (University of California, Berkeley).Using direct observations, we constructed three measures of mask use: 1) whether masks were in possession (i.e. visible), 2) whether masks were worn correctly (i.e. covered mouth and nose), and 3) whether no mask was visible to the observers. Using phone surveys, we asked respondents whether they had been to a public place in the past 7 days, and if so, whether they used masks in the specific places they visited. We classify both direct observations and phone survey self-reports by location: within the village, in market centers, on public transport, and other. We then transformed the individual-level phone survey data into person-place observations and constructed three measures of self-reported mask use: 1) always wears masks, 2) sometimes wears masks, and 3) does not wear masks. Respondents who said they never wore masks in public were coded as not using mask in each specific location. Self-reported responses were limited to participants who disclosed they had been to a public place in the week prior to interview. For simplicity, when comparing self-reported and observed data, we group the observed outcomes to a single indicator of whether masks were worn or visible and group the self-reported outcomes to a single indicator of always or sometimes wears masks. We also calculated the estimated proportion of other households wearing masks to the same public places.3) social activities, including shopping and talking. Similar measures were not possible to construct with phone data. All linear regression models had standard errors clustered at the village/market and were weighted by the sampling probability of being selected for the phone survey to make reported averages representative of the study area population. We checked the robustness of our findings by restricting the phone survey data to the same dates and the specific villages where observations were conducted.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and accept responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.We conducted phone interviews with 2,247 respondents from Ugunja subcounty, 87% of whom (1,960 respondents) visited a public place in the 7 days prior to the interview and answered questions about mask use. We observed mask behavior of 9,549 individuals in public places.Percentages of age and gender may not add to 100% because of missing data: gender was missing for 242 observations and age was missing for 60 observations. Location in phone surveys do not add to 100% because many respondents visited multiple public places in the past 7 days. We categorized the public places into general categories of market centers, villages, public transportation, and ""other"" places that included religious gatherings, work, and other similar circumstances.We document a large discrepancy between self-reported and observed mask use (Table 2) .Among the 1,960 respondents who visited a public place in the past 7 days (87% of full survey sample), 76% said they always wore a mask and 12% said they wore a mask some of the time. In direct observations, only 5% of people wore masks correctly and another 5% had masks visible but did not wear them correctly. In other words, while only 12% of people admitted in phone interviews to not wearing a mask in public, 90% of people we observed did not have a mask with them. Self-reported mask use was significantly higher than observed mask use (77.7%Observed mask use is the proportion of people: 1) wearing masks correctly, 2) having masks visible, and 3) having no mask visible. Self-reported mask use is the proportion of people reporting: 1) always wearing masks, 2) sometimes wearing masks, 3) never wearing masks. We tested for statistical differences in self-reported vs. observed mask use by comparing the proportion of people disclosing they always or sometimes use masks vs. the proportion of people observed wearing or having masks visible using OLS regression with standard errors clustered at the village level, where each row is a separate regression conditional on the descriptive characteristic. Phone data were transformed so that each observation represents a respondent's outing to a public place. Table 1 ). Slightly more women had masks visible, but correct mask use was equal among men and women (Panel A of Figure 2 and Appendix Table 2 ).Notes: Proportions estimated on sample of 1,960 respondents who had been to a public place in past 7 days and 9,549 observations conducted in 71 villages and 10 market centers. Phone surveys were weighted by the probability of being selected for the phone interviews. Panel B is restricted to participants with age data; no statistically significant differences found in mask use between participants with and without age data. Age and gender in direct observations were estimated by enumerators. Selfreported mask use is significantly higher (p<0.001) than observed mask use in each scenario.Respondents' perceptions of mask use by others in their communities were generally lower than their own (diamond markers in Figure 2 , Panel C), but were still far higher than direct observations. For example, while 66% of respondents said they always wear masks in villages, their estimate was that about half (54%) of other people in their community wear masks, compared to the 2% of people we actually observed wearing masks correctly. The large discrepancy in mask use via self-reports and estimates of mask use by others compared to the direct observations was evident in all location types.We also grouped direct observations into three broad activities based on the level of exposure: 1) commuting, 2) solitary activities, and 3) interactive activities. We find that mask use in general was higher in market centers, where there are more interactions with strangers, than in villages ( Figure 2, Panel D) . Mask use was highest among people who were commuting: in markets 22% wore masks correctly (42% had mask visible) and in villages 14% wore masks correctly (22% had mask visible). We find no meaningful differences in mask use by whether people were interacting or alone.Since the observations were collected over a shorter time period and a random subset of phone survey villages, we tested robustness of our findings by restricting the phone sample surveys to August to September 2020 in the same 71 villages. We found no meaningful differences in mask use after applying these restrictions (Appendix Tables 3 and 4 and Appendix Figure 1 ). Age data were missing for 465 phone survey respondents (24% of the sample), but we found no differences in mask use between participants with and without age data (Appendix Table 3 ).Masks are among the few tools available to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 without imposing major economic hardship, and mask mandates have been implemented or contemplated by governments around the world. Using data from rural Kenyan that is fairly representative of other rural African settings, we find that the strict government COVID-19 mitigation rules regarding mask wearing are adopted to a limited degree. Although only 12% of phone survey respondents admitted to not wearing masks when they visit public places, our observations revealed that the vast majority of people (95%) do not wear masks over their mouth and nose when they are in public. The high proportion of participants who said they wear masks suggests that most are aware that mask use is mandated and socially desirable. However, this awareness has not translated to the behavioral change of adopting mask use in public. This finding suggests that there is an urgent need to improve the adoption of mask use in Kenya and similar settings, via education and behavioral interventions, and possibly increased public distribution of masks.Although observed mask use was generally low in all of the tested scenarios, we found that people adjusted their mask behavior in more high-risk settings. Mask use was highest on public transportation and in market centers, where interactions with strangers are much more likely.The existing mask policies in Kenya are enforced with fairly harsh fines ($200 fines have been reported by popular news outlets), 19 suggesting that further focus on enforcement may have a limited effect. Moreover, enforcement by police may be prone to corruption in this and similar contexts, and in at least one instance a clash over mask use between the police and Kenyan citizens has led to violence and fatalities. 20 Focusing on other barriers such as lack of access to masks, beliefs about effectiveness of masks or the need to use masks, and behavioral issues related to adopting a new health behavior may be more promising. The vast majority of the phone survey participants in our sample (>99%) reported that they own a mask. However, it is possible that the self-reporting bias we found in mask use was also pervasive in ownership disclosures. Given the relatively low cost of masks in the study setting (approximately $0.50 USD) distribution of free masks may be a worthwhile investment. Pairing mask distribution with public health messages that clearly communicate the risks of COVID-19 and the benefits of masks may be needed to educate the public. 21 Tailoring the interventions to appeal to social desirability of masks, either through modeling behaviors or stressing altruistic motivations, 22, 23 may be especially relevant in the context of the highly visible behavior of wearing masks, which inherently involves social signaling.Nonetheless, since having a mask in a place other than on the face is ineffective in preventing the spread of infection, this bias does not significantly affect our study conclusions. Enumerators were also not able to distinguish whether observed individuals are members of the same household where continuous mask wearing may be impractical. However, since observed mask use was low in all settings including public transport and shopping in market centers where people are in close proximity to strangers, this seems unlikely to alter our conclusions. Finally, we acknowledge that the observational nature of the study limits the interpretation of our findings to descriptive statistics that cannot be interpreted as causal.The progress that the scientific community has made in vaccine development may be slow to translate to widespread distribution in low-income setting such as Kenya, where health systems have limited capacity to supply and distribute even the most basic medicines. With no specific plan for vaccine implementation in sub-Saharan Africa so far developed, 6 reliance on nonpharmaceutical interventions remains highly relevant for the foreseeable future. Increased focus on encouraging mask use may be needed in cultures where mask wearing is not the social norm. 25 Mask use remains one of the key public health strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission in Kenya. Policies to encourage mask use may be especially important in places where shutting down economic activities is harmful to the already low-income population. Our study findings indicate that an increased focus on encouraging mask use via public health campaigns is urgently needed in Kenya and possibly other similar settings in order to close the gap between mask wearing recommendations and actual behavior.","Kenya","abstract","2021-01-29",1

[14] [15] [16] [17] Despite the large and rapidly rising number of COVID-19 and resulting deaths, there are limited data about the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with the disease. 2,-18-21 Although pregnant women do not seem to have an increased susceptibility to COVID−19 or more severe complications than non-pregnant adults, the available studies suggest that they may have the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. 22, 23 A study conducted in New York City shows more than one in eight asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the labor and delivery unit were positive for SARS-CoV-2. 1 A case study conducted in the USA reports a high-risk pregnant woman who developed respiratory failure associated with COVID-19, possible vertical transmission of infection in this case. 24 Pregnant women at all gestational ages, the gravida in labor, and the acutely ill parturient are at risk of this virus. 1, 25, 26 Pregnancy is a physiological state that predisposes women to viral respiratory infection due to the physiological changes in the immune and cardiopulmonary systems. 3,-27-29 Therefore, pregnant women and household members should be educated about personal hygiene, basic Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures, and how to care as safely as possible for the person suspected of having COVID−19 to prevent the infection from spreading to household contacts. 6, 13, 14, 30 Recently COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout Ethiopia. New data are being collected every day. It is important to provide healthcare workers with the most updated information about COVID-19 in pregnant women. This information will help to answer the numerous questions that future mothers may have in the current situation and to prevent Study Area, Design, and PeriodGuraghe zone is one of the administrative zones in Southern nation nationalities and peoples region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia. It has 13 districts and two town administrations. Wolkite town is the capital of Guraghe zone, found 153 km southwest to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. According to Wikipedia, Guraghe zone has a total population of 1,279,646, of which 657,568 are women. 31 There are six hospitals in Guraghe zone: Attat primary hospital with an annual Antenatal Care (ANC) case flow of 5,342, Bue primary hospital with an annual ANC case flow of 1,700, Butajira general hospital with an annual ANC case flow of 5,254, Gunchire primary hospital with annual ANC case flow of 1,275, Quantie primary hospital with an annual ANC case flow of 1,396, and Wolkite university specialized referral hospital with an annual ANC case flow of 1,216 serving the total population in the zone. All hospitals provide comprehensive emergency obstetric care services. Moreover, there are 72 health centers which provide basic emergency obstetric care services in Guraghe zone. All the six hospitals in Guraghe zone were involved in this study and an institution-based crossectional study was conducted from July 27-August 27, 2020.All pregnant women visiting those six hospitals in Guraghe zone were the source population of this study. Women who had come to the hospital for ANC follow-up in the study period were included. However, pregnant women who were either admitted to the inpatient department for gynecologic, medical, or surgical cases or treated in the out-patient department were excluded.The required sample size was calculated using OpenEpi statistics software version 3.03. An assumption of 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and a proportion of 60.9% 32 from a study done in Nigeria on knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in a low-resource African setting is considered. This makes a sample size of 366, adding a 10% contingency to account for non-response rate, which yielded a final sample size of 403. The total sample size was deployed proportionally to each hospital according to their case flow. A systematic random sampling technique was employed in this study. The intervals for subjects to be selected were calculated for each hospital in accordance with their case flow ( Figure 1 ).Professionals who were on routine service were data collectors on their respective hospitals. Two data collectors who were working in ANC and have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in midwifery were selected. Two supervisors who have a degree in midwifery and instructors of Wolkite University were recruited. One day training for supervisors and data collectors in each hospital was given on how to conduct data collection. The training discloses the possible benefit and purpose of the study to the study participants before the start of data collection.Orders of interview and intervals of selection were according to their ANC clinic entry. The objective of the study, how they are selected, and voluntary participation was clarified. The interview was conducted after routine services were given in ANC.An interviewer-administered based questionnaire on the practice and knowledge of coronavirus infection preventive measures were used for data collection. The questionnaires were developed following a review of the literature and WHO recommendations on the measures to prevent human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 infection.The questionnaires have an 8-item scale for knowledge assessment questions and an 8-item scale for practice questions. The scoring system of women's knowledge and practice of preventive measures were either 1 (for correct answer) or 0 (for incorrect answer). The minimum score was 0, whereas the maximum score was 8 for each of knowledge and practice component of the questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was checked by conducting a pretest among pregnant women in Saint Lukas hospital antenatal clinic, by taking 20 clients, which was 5% of the total sample size.Variables COVID-19 preventive measure practice and knowledge were the dependent variables, and socio-demographic characteristics (age, parity, marital status, permanent residence, occupation, participant's level of education, and husband's level of education) and media exposure to access information about the coronavirus infection pandemic (Radio, Television, Smart phone for social media, route for broacher and tracts) were the independent variables.Good practice: Women who scored 100% on the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures questionnaire, and poor practice: Women who scored <100% on the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures questionnaire. 32 Adequate knowledge: Participants who scored ≥65% on knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measures questionnaire, and inadequate knowledge: Women who scored <65% on knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measures questionnaire. 32The principal investigators checked the completeness and consistency of questionnaires filled by the data collectors to ensure the quality of data. To check the clarity, skipping pattern and order of questions, the questionnaire will be pretested before the start of the actual data collection. After pre-test, questions have revised, edited, and those found to be unclear have been modified. The questionnaire was prepared in English language and then translated to Amharic and Guragigna (local) languages by native speakers of the languages. Two trained midwives who can speak both Amharic and Guragigna language have been participated in the data collection in each hospital. Guragigna and Amharic questionnaires were used for data collection and have been used according to the skills of the clients. The questionnaire will then be refined accordingly for final use.Data were checked manually for completeness. Data marked as complete were entered in to Epi Data version 3.1 software. For further analysis the data were exported to the statistical package for social sciences version 24.0 software. Descriptive statistics were carried out as a frequency and percentage. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were used to see the effect of independent variable over COVID-19 preventive measure practice and knowledge. Variables which will be significant on bivariate analysis at a P-value less than 0.25 were taken to multivariate analysis. The fitness of model have been checked by Hosmer and Lemeshow test with the value 0.11. In multivariate analysis P-value of less than 0.05 and 95% confidence level was used as a cut-off point for the presence of association. Finally, results were compiled and presented using tables, graphs, charts, and texts.A total of 403 study subjects participated in this study making the response rate of 100%. In this study the maximum age of the participant was 41 and the minimum age was 18 with the mean and standard deviation of 27.11 Figure 2 ).From the total participant almost all of the participants were aware of COVID-19 except 18 (4.5%) of them. In the same manner, 28 (6.9%) participants were responding that this virus have vaccine ( Table 2) . Most of the participants listed washing hands with soap and water as a preventive measure (Figure 3 ). From the total participants, 221 (54.84%) of them have adequate knowledge (Figure 3 ). Almost all of the participants have awareness of the ongoing pandemic (Table 3) .Knowledge assessment questions with multiple responses were categorized as correct response if they respond above or equal to the mean of listed answers (Table 3) . This study presents COVID-19 preventive measure practices and knowledge of pregnant women, visiting hospitals in Guraghe Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Factors which have a significant effect on COVID-19 preventive measure were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. On the multivariate analysis only three variables were found to be statistically significant from the eight variables that were significant in bivariate analysis. Those factors statistically significant in the final model were discussed accordingly in comparison with other studies and possible authors' justification on the nature of this specific study.This study shows that 54.84% (95% CI=50.1-59.6) of the participants have adequate knowledge. Result of this study on knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measure were lower than studies conducted in Ghana which state that knowledge of women following antenatal care were 62.7%, 33 in Uganda knowledge of COVID-19 among mothers following antenatal care were 69%, 34 and in Nigeria knowledge of pregnant women visiting medical centers were 60.9%. 35 Contrarily, this result was higher than a study done in Debre Tabor town (46.8%). 36 Moreover, knowledge of preventive measure among Jimma university medical center visitors was 41.3%. 37 This difference might be due to the time of the studies conducted in which information delivery and awareness creation programs about the pandemic are ongoing and improving from time to time. For this reason practices were expected to be low in the beginning of the pandemic. The other reason might be those who have better information source and urban residencies were intended to practice prevention methods than their counterparts.In the other hand this study shows that COVID-19 preventive measure practices were 76.2% (95% CI=72.0-80.4). A study in southern Ethiopia reports that 47.6% of the participants have good practice. 36 This difference might be due to effective interventions measures taken by the government and health institution; which was accepted by the healthcare provider to carry out the rules and regulations. Because of this, practices of the community on the preventive measure were increasing. Since this disease could not be defeated without efficiently sticking with preventive measure practices, the results of this study are not good enough. Pregnant women visiting hospitals in Guraghe Zone are expected to practice more than the stated value. Therefore it's not conclusive to state practices of COVID-19 preventive measures among those women were higher. Participants aged 20-24, 25-29, and 30-34 were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures practice compared to participants whose age was greater or equal to 35. Consistently, a study conducted in Debre Tabor town shows that participants aged 15-24 were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures. 38 This might be due to information access to younger participants being better. This study also shows most younger participants have access to print media, internet, television, and radio. In another way younger participants have a better educational level, and another study has shown participants with a higher level of education have better preventive practices. 38 Results of this study also showthat younger participants have a better educational status when compared to older participants.Urban residents were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures compared to rural residents. Consistently a study conducted in India shows urban residents was more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures. 39 This might be due to urban residents in Ethiopia having better access to different types of communication media carrying messages about the pandemic. Additionally peoples living in an urban area of Ethiopia were relatively surrounded by educated people who would have the chance to obtain information informally like in transport, in neighborhood, and informal social meetings.Participants who perceive that COVID-19 has a poor prognosis on people with chronic disease were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures compared to those who perceive that COVID-19 has no difference on people with chronic diseases. Consistently, a study conducted in Addis Zemen Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia reports that participants practicing better on preventive measures responded that the pandemic was worst among people with chronic diseases. 40 This might be due to those peoples having better knowledge on the characteristics of COVID-19 because they were responding to the right answer, unlike their counterparts. Similarly clients with chronic disease have the chance to visit health service facilities during their follow-up appointment, and could get information from their health provider to develop their knowledge about the pandemic in relation with their disease.COVID-19 preventive measure practice and knowledge among mothers in Guraghe zone hospitals were low compared to other studies.Participants aged 20-24, 25-29, and 30-34 were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures practices compared to participants age greater or equal to 35. Residence of urban area was more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures compared rural residence. Those perceiving COVID-19 has a poor prognosis on people with chronic disease were more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive measures compared to those who perceive chronic disease to have no difference on the prognosis. Therefore:• COVID-19 preventive measure practices and knowledge among pregnant women in the rural part of Guraghe zone needs to be supported by Guraghe zone health office. • Pregnant women aged ≥35 in Guraghe zone hospitals need to be counseled by the healthcare providers about the preventive measures practices.Ethical clearance was obtained from Wolkite University College of medicine and health science institutional review board (IRB) with a reference number RCSUILC043/2013. Permission was obtained from Guraghe zone health office and each hospital medical directors office; oral informed consent, which was approved by IRB of Wolkite University, was obtained from participants, and this study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured, and participants were informed that their participation was voluntary.When the world is in terrible planning to be a part of solution is remarkable decision. Wolkite University was in charge of this decision, and those who facilitate conditions accordingly in hierarchy of their position to conduct research need to be acknowledged. This work would not beas good as it is now without friends, whose support and advice made this article viable, thank you for your time.My wife, you are kind, patient, and closest friend ever, I see you can hear me even when I am silent; thank you my sweet and I love you. My subjects, pregnant womenvisiting hospitals in Guraghe zone who were included in this study; this research couldn't have happened without you, many thanks dear clients.","Ethiopia","abstract","2021-01-07",1
