The disease has quickly spread to other corners of the world and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak, which is still ongoing (Zhu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020) . By using impartial sequencing of samples from patients, it was possible to identify a new type of beta coronavirus. This novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was compared to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), presented a lower mortality rate and a higher transmission capacity (Zhu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020) .Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with a lipid envelope able to cause respiratory, enteric, liver, and neurological diseases in domestic animals and human beings (Zhu et al. 2020; Weiss and Leibowitz 2011) . The existence of wild viruses in nature is well known by researchers. They are highly prevalent, broadly distributed, genetically diverse, and frequently genetically recombined. There is a higher probability of natural hosts disseminating these viruses to human beings as the man-animal interface activity is increasing.Both SARS and MERS were associated with a zoonotic origin and transmitted by civets and camels, respectively. The appearance of diseases such as SARS and MERS, supposedly caused by the new coronavirus, tends to become more frequent events when no barriers are imposed between human society and wild nature (Zhu et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2019) .As there is no specific drug or vaccine to treat the new coronavirus, early detection is crucial so that the patient is isolated from the healthy population as soon as possible (Ai et al. 2020) . Thus, the research for methods of early detection has become essential to fight this pandemic outbreak.Currently, the gold standard of the COVID-19 diagnosis is made by viral nucleic acid detection using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in realtime, although its effective accuracy is 30 to 50% (Ai et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Ozturk et al. 2020 ).An underlying problem with this method is how unavailable it is in several regions and countries impacted; this generates logistic and political issues for providing enough test kits for the increasing number of patients suspected of having the disease . Moreover, the delay in processing and getting results and the significant number of false negatives urged researchers from all over the world to try to find a solution for this problem in various areas of knowledge (Ozturk et al. 2020) .Medical image processing is one of the areas which has been contributing to promising studies. Research in this area is being done to clinically aid to diagnose the disease for patients who develop lung atypical pneumonia, using chest X-ray images or computed tomography (CT) scans (Ozturk et al. 2020) . As several patients with COVID-19 develop lung infection, CT scans are useful to detect lung impairment, as well as to classify its progression Dai et al. 2020) .Radiological images from COVID-19 patients may present similarities with those from patients with bacterial or viral pneumonia, specifically the ones caused by SARS and MERS. Thus, the ability to accurately differentiate diseases by analyzing medical images has become a vital challenge, and overcoming it means helping healthcare professionals with detecting the disease early and isolating affected patients as soon as possible (Ozturk et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020) .Medical image processing area has several studies aimed at developing machine learning methods able to help to diagnose COVID-19, either using CT scan images or chest X-ray ones (Ozturk et al. 2020) . Problems using CT scans rather than chest X-rays include low availability of equipment, radiologists, and physicians; higher cost; and longer time to obtain images .A machine learning technique used in research is called deep learning. It allows computer models with several layers of processing to learn how to represent data in various levels of abstraction Lecun et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2020) . This technique allows the design of applications which can perform recognition, such as speech recognition, visual recognition, and object detection.Medical images of patients with COVID-19 presents common features that might show a pattern. Deep learning is an effective technique used by researchers to help healthcare professionals to analyze vast volumes of data generated by chest X-ray images, for instance Martin et al. 2020) .When it comes to applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the medical field, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stand out. CNNs are deep artificial neural networks which can be used to classify images, group them by similarity, and run object recognition. These networks are inspired in the human visual cortex processing and used for medical images where irregularities in tissue morphology may be used to classify tumors. CNNs can detect patterns, which are hard to be found by human specialists, for instance, initial stages of disease in tissue samples (Balas et al. 2019) .This paper proposes a new Convolutional Neural Network model called CNN-COVID, to classify images of COVID-19 patients and differentiate them from those who do not have COVID-19, with a focus in analysis, classification, and high accuracy. The CNN-COVID model and its related work are presented in the following sections.In the study from Zhang et al. (2020) , a model to detect anomalies was developed by using deep learning. The goal is to do a quick and trustworthy triage of patients with COVID-19. One hundred chest X-ray images from 70 patients with COVID-19 were sourced from a GitHub repository to assess the performance of the model, and 1431 chest X-ray images from 1008 patients with other types of pneumonia were sourced from ChestX-ray14, a public data pool. The Zhang model in ) is composed of three components, namely, a backbone network, a classification head, and an anomaly detection head. Thus, the first component extracts the highlevel features from a chest X-ray which will be the input data for the classification head, and then, the input data for the anomaly detection head. So, with this paper, it resulted 90.00% sensitivity, 87.84% specificity (when parameter T from the study was 0.25), or 96.00% sensitivity and 70.65% specificity (when parameter T was 0.15). Nonetheless, this model presented some limitations, such as missing 4% of COVID-19 cases and having an approximately 30% false positives.In a similar study, Sethy and Behera (2020) suggested a model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays using deep learning. Support vector machine (SVM) classified images of patients suffering from this disease differentiating from images of patients who suffer from other diseases. A subset of 25 COVID-19 images were sourced from the GitHub repository, and a subset of 25 pneumonia images was sourced from the Kaggle repository. The ResNet50 deep neural network model with SVM classification has proven to be the best approach to detect COVID-19, with 95.38% accuracy, 97.2% sensitivity, and 93.4% specificity.In Wang and Wong (2020) , a CNN was adapted to detect COVID-19 cases. It was called COVID-Net, and it used chest X-rays images from open source code and available to the general audience. Thus, COVIDX was created, a database sourcing samples from five different databases (Wang and Wong 2020) : 100 samples of chest X-rays of healthy patients, 100 samples of pneumonia patients, and 100 images of COVID-19 patients. COVID-NET presented the following results: 93.3% accuracy, 91.0% sensitivity, and 99.9% specificity when detecting COVID-19 X-ray images out of healthy cases and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.The study from Abbas et al. (2020) uses the transfer learning technique, an effective mechanism to provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic tasks for object recognition to domain-specific tasks. Therefore, DeTraC, a deep CNN was adapted with functions to decompose, transfer, and compose samples to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19. They sourced 80 chest X-ray images (4020 × 4892 pixels) of healthy patients from the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT), 105 images (4248 × 3480 pixels) of COVID-19 patients, and 11 images (4248 × 3480 pixels) of SARS patients from GitHub. DeTraC presented the following results: 95.12% accuracy, 97.91% sensitivity, and 91.87% specificity when detecting COVID-19 X-ray images out of healthy cases and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.CNN-COVID was trained and tested using images from two different databases (public domain) containing chest X-ray who tested positive for COVID-19. The 434 images from Dataset I was obtained at the beginning of the pandemic, and the 4030 images from Dataset II, in October 2020. Due to the limited availability of public images at the beginning of the pandemic, Dataset I was expanded using data augmentation techniques. For Dataset II, a data augmentation was not necessary, and the images were randomly selected for each phase of training and testing. Figure 1 represents the proposed methodology for image classification.Two databases compose Dataset I. The first one has 217 chest X-ray images from the COVID-19 image data collection (Cohen et al. 2020) . In this database, the images are from 141 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was labeled as COVID. From the second database, ChestXray14 , 1126 images were used. All these images correspond to chest X-ray images labeled for the presence of 14 common chest radiographic observations that, in this paper, were labeled as NON-COVID.A subset of 166 images, out of the 217 images from the COVID-19 set were selected randomly (Cohen et al. 2020 ). Out of these 166 selected images, around 75% were for the training phase and 25% were for the testing phase. From the NON-COVID set, 1000 images were selected randomly, 80% were for the training phase and 20% were for the testing phase.For the validation phase, 126 images were selected from the COVID-19 set (out of the 217 total images) and 126 images from the NON-COVID set (out of the 1126 total images), as shown in Table 1 .As the state of pandemic was declared on March 2020, one of the challenges of this study was to find suitable COVID-19 images to work with. So, we had a limited number of X-rays images from COVID-19 patients for training the deep learning m o d e l s . T o o v e r c o m e t h a t i s s u e , w e u s e d t h e ImageDataGenerator, that provided us with new images to be generated for the training phase. The new images were generated from digital processing, using geometric transformations of the original images.These geometric transformations, such as be translation, rotation, patch extraction, and reflection, do not make changes to the image object properties, making ""data augmentation"" possible. The positive side of this technique is that it increases the ability to generalize CNN-COVID when trained with an augmented dataset (Aggarwal et al. 2018; Chollet 2016) . Thus, overfitting, which is when the network is no longer able to generalize when presented with new data, can be reduced.The following common methods were used for dataset augmentation:After these changes, it was possible to balance the Dataset I from both COVID and NON-COVID classification on the testing and training sets. This database augmentation happens during run time, when chest X-ray images are presented as an input for CNN-COVID.Dataset II is composed of images from the Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (BIMCV) repository (Vayá et al. 2020) containing chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19+ patients. From this repository, two databases were created: COVID and NON-COVID. The COVID has 2025 chest X-ray images from patients who tested positive for COVID-19, and NON-COVID database, 2025 chest X-ray images from patients who tested negative for the disease.Among the 2025 images, chosen from the COVID and NON-COVID databases, approximately 75% of them made up the training phase, 15% the testing phase, and 15% the validation phase, as shown in Table 2 .Created by the authorA CNN is composed of two stages: feature extraction stage and classification stage. In the CNN, the pooling and convolution layers act as a stage of feature extraction. In contrast, the classification stage is made of one or more fully connected layers followed by a sigmoid function layer (Wani et al. 2020) , which are presented below. For our proposed CNN-COVID method, we used Python programming language (using Keras library) (Chollet, 2016) to create and train CNN-COVID. The work was developed using a I7-8750H Intel processor, 2.21 GHz CPU, 16.0 GB RAM, and a GeForce GTX 1060 graphic card with Max-Q Design.In the proposed CNN-COVID, a new convolution operation is established for the convolutional layer, in which a kernel is used to map the activations from one layer into the next. The convolution operation places the kernel in each possible position in the image (or hidden layer) so that the kernel overlaps the entire image and executes a dot product between the kernel parameters and its corresponding receptive field-to which a kernel is applied-in the image. The convolution operation is executed in every region of the image (or hidden layer) to define the next layer (in which activations keep their spatial relations in the previous layer) (Ponti and Da Costa, 2018; Aggarwal et al. 2018; Lecun et al. 2015) .There may be several kernels in the convolutional layer. Every kernel has a feature, such as an edge or a corner. During the forward pass, every kernel is slid to the image width and height (or hidden layer), thus, generating the feature map (Ponti and Da Costa, 2018; Aggarwal et al. 2018; Lecun et al. 2015; Balas et al. 2019 Adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) CNN-COVID uses Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM), an adaptive optimization technique that saves an exponentially decaying average of previously squared gradients v t . Besides, ADAM also computes the average of the second moments of the gradients m t (Wani et al. 2020; Kingma and Ba 2014) .Average and non-centered variance values m t are presented in Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively:ADAM updates exponential moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient where the hyperparameters β1, β2 ∈ [0, 1] control the decay rates of these moving averages (Eqs. 3 and 4):The final formula for the update is presented in Eq. (5):Where α is the learning rate and ϵ is a constant added to the denominator for quick conversion methods in order to avoid the division by 0 (Wani et al. 2020; Kingma and Ba 2014) .CNN-COVID uses the Dropout technique, the most popular technique to reduce overfitting. Dropout refers to dropping out neurons in a neural network during training. Dropping out a neuron means temporarily disconnecting it, as well as all its internal and external connections, from the network.Dropped-out neurons neither contribute to the forward pass nor add to the backward pass. By using the dropout technique, the network is forced to learn the most robust features as the network architecture changes with every input (Wani et al. 2020; Balas et al. 2019 ).An activation function feeds the output of every convolutional layer. The activation function layer consists of an activation function which uses the resource map produced by the convolutional layer and generates the activation map as the output. The activation function is used to change a neuron activation level in an output signal. Thus, it performs a mathematical operation and generates the neuron activation level at a specific interval, for instance, 0 to 1 or −1 to 1 (Wani et al. 2020) . The functions used were the following: In the CNN-COVID pooling layer, or downsampling layer, is used to reduce the receptive field spatial size, thus, reducing the number of network parameters. The pooling layer selects each convolutional layer feature map and creates a reduced sample. Max-pooling was the technique used for this work. It generates the maximum value in the receptive field. The receptive field is 2 × 2; therefore, max-pooling will issue the maximum of the four input values (Wani et al. 2020 ).After the convolution and pooling processes, the next step is to decide based on the features detected. This is done by adding one or more fully connected layers to the end. In the fully connected layer, each neuron from the previous layer is connected to each neuron from the following one. All values contribute to predict how strong a value correlates to a given class (Wani et al. 2020) . The fully connected layers may be layered on top of one another to learn even more sophisticated feature combinations. The output of the last fully connected layer is fed by an activation function which generates the class scores. The sigmoid activation function is the one used for CNN-COVID. It produces class scores, and the class with the highest score is treated as the correct one (Wani et al. 2020 ).Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were proposed to assess image data. The name comes from the convolution operator, a simple way of doing complex operations using the convolution kernel (Ravi et al. 2017 ). Many variations of CNN were proposed, such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) , Clarifai (Zeiler and Fergus 2014) , and GoogleNet (Szegedy et al. 2015) . CNN-COVID structure is also a variation of CNN with the following architecture: an input layer, a convolutional layer, a dense layer, and an output layer, as per Fig. 2 .CNN-COVID detailed architecture is illustrated in Table 3 . Our proposed network consists of conventional layers, including input, convolution layer, max-pooling layer, and fullyconnected layers.Besides, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is used after each convolution layer (1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th) and dense layers (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th). To reduce the possibility of overfitting, a dropout rate of 20% was implemented to the first four fully connected layers (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th).In the training phase, weights are initialized randomly. The network was trained as per the ADAM model (Wani et al. 2020) . Standard parameters β 1 = 0.9 and β 2 = 0.999 were used (Kingma and Ba, 2014) , as well as the initial learning rate α = 0.001 reduced by a factor of 10. The ADAM training model (Wani et al. 2020 ) has a better performance compared with other adaptive techniques; it has a quick conversion rate; thus, it reduces the chances of error and increases accuracy. It also overcomes problems faced by other optimization techniques, such as decaying learning rate, high variance in updates, and slow convergence (Wani et al. 2020 ).Several options were tested when choosing the input parameter values and the CNN-COVID batch size, considering the performance capacity of the available hardware. For input sizes 200 × 200 and 220 × 220, the batch size was 20. For larger input sizes, the batch size was 10. The input parameter tests were run in 500 epochs. The test with better accuracy results was the one with input size 300 × 300 and batch size 10, as per Fig. 3 .For Dataset I and II, the training and testing phases were performed as follows: & Regarding Dataset I, the network was tested 10 times varying the parameters used by the ImageDataGenerator class to generate new samples on the image databases for both COVID-19 and NON-COVID classes. For the validation phase, the network with the best accuracy in the test phase (10 tests) was considered. & Furthermore, for Dataset II, the network was also tested 10 times, and the training and testing database images were randomly selected. For the validation phase, the network with the best accuracy in the test phase (during 10 tests) was considered.The following metrics were used to validate the CNN They are commonly used to assess the performance of classification algorithms (Ruuska et al. 2018; Skansi 2018; Khatami et al. 2017 ). There is a standard way to show the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) to be more visual. This method is called the confusion matrix. For a classification of two classes, the confusion matrix is presented in Table 4 .The confusion matrix allows us to determine the following metrics (Narin et al. 2020; Ruuska et al. 2018; Skansi 2018; Khatami et al. 2017) :Performance metrics help assess the CNN-COVID network and must be interpreted as follows: accuracy is the proportion of correct classification, considering the samples classified; precision, in turn, shows the odds of a positive anomaly be confirmed, recall is the ability of the model to identify all positive examples, and F-score is the harmonic average between precision and recall, best results being closer to 1 and worst, close to 0.It is also possible to get the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC curve). ROC analysis is often called the ROC accuracy ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models (Shirazi et al. 2018) .A total of 10 trainings and tests were done with CNN-COVID. A total of 2000 epochs were applied to each training and test Fig. 4 . The average accuracy of Dataset I and II was 0.9787 and 0.9839, respectively, and the overall average between the two datasets was 0.9813. To perform the validation phase, we take the weights of the best accuracy from the 10 tests obtained in CNN-COVID. So, the confusion matrix for Dataset I was generated with 126 COVID-19 images and 126 NON-COVID images which resulted in 252 images for validating the model. Otherwise, the confusion matrix for Dataset II was generated with 303 COVID-19 images and 303 NON-COVID images which resulted in 606 images for validating the model. Figure 5 shows the confusion matrix generated for Dataset I (Fig. 5a) and Dataset II (Fig. 5b) , respectively.Using the TP, TN, FP, and FN parameters, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for both Dataset I and Dataset II, as registered in Table 5 .According to the results presented in Table 5 , the ROC curve was calculated for both datasets as (1-SP) and SE, as x and y, respectively. As per the ROC assessment, the area (AUC) is shown in Fig. 6 .From the results of Table 5 , we calculated the average of the ACC, SE, and SP metrics for the two datasets, which was compared with the results of the state-of-the-art methods. Our method (CNN-COVID) presents better results for SE (98.83%) and ACC (98.03%) metrics, in comparison with other studies as shown in bold text in Table 6 . In addition, the methodology applied at CNN-COVID is broader than that of the studies analyzed, as it uses the average of 10 tests, that is, the average accuracy of 10 tests made with CNN-COVID was considered.For the chest X-ray images that have various sizes over 1000 × 1000 pixels, a study was needed to decide which image sizes should be remodeled to have the best input size for CNN-COVID. The initial input size was 200 × 200, and then, it was increased by 20 until it reached 300 × 300. CNN-COVID processed every input size in 500 epochs. This study showed that the higher the input size, the more accurate the network was. As per Fig. 2 , when the input size was 300 × 300, the accuracy was 0.9697.The algorithm for gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions chosen was the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM). It is an adaptive optimization technique which leverages both AdaGrad (the ability to deal with sparse gradients) and RMSProp (the ability to deal with nonstationary objectives) (Wani et al. 2020) . Besides, the method is straightforward to implement and requires little memory.For Dataset I, which presented a reduced number of COVID-19 images, augmenting the database was needed, to increase the CNN-COVID generalization. The database augmentation was done during run time. In the training phase, 126 COVID-19 images generated 252,000 new images, and 800 NON-COVID images generated 1,600,000 new images bringing it all to a total of 1,852,000 images. In the test phase, 40 COVID-19 images generated 80,000 new images, and 200 NON-COVID images generated 400,000 new images bringing it all to a total of 480,000 images. In the validation phase, the data generator was not used.In this work, we trained and tested CNN-COVID 10 times, in order to obtain a more reliable value for ACC. The average accuracy of the 10 tests was 0.9787 for Dataset I and 0.9839 for Dataset II (according to Fig. 4) . As for the validation, the accuracy obtained was 0.9722 for Dataset I and 0.9884 for Dataset II (according to Table 5 ). With this result, it was found that the accuracy of the validation of Dataset I was close to the average accuracy of the tests with a percentage error less than 1%.In Dataset II, the validation accuracy was higher than the average of the tests, showing that the average accuracy is actually more reliable. Thus, these results indicate that the investment of time, human, financial, and computational resources in the creation and improvement of techniques based on machine learning is a promising approach to assist professionals in the prognosis of the new coronavirus through chest X-ray images.This paper proposed a deep neural network, called CNN-COVID, for prognosis of the COVID-19 virus. Two different datasets were used: Dataset I is formed by a COVID-19 image data repository (Cohen et al. 2020) , as well as the ChestXray14 data set , and Dataset II, on the other hand, is formed by the BIMCV COVID-19 + repository (Vayá et al. 2020) . After completing the 10 tests, the average accuracy of Dataset I and Dataset II was 0.9787 and 0.9839, respectively. The weights of the best test results were applied in the validation, obtaining values of accuracy 0.9722 for Dataset I and 0.9884 for Dataset II.The results proved that the CNN-COVID model is a promising tool to help physicians classify chest images with pneumonia, considering atypical pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and pneumonia due to other causes. We hope this technology enhances the provision of healthcare services, contributing to the disease prognosis through straightforward exams, such as chest X-ray, and broadening the access to information through tools that help with using images for diagnosing. For future work, we plan to improve the CNN-COVID accuracy as new COVID-19 data is collected. ","Brazil","first author","2021-01-04",1

Also, it led a huge loss in the world economy and trade exchange between countries. The pandemic has spread around the world during a few months. Most nations have isolated to face this virus and decrease the losses. Several studies have investigated COVID-19 virus around the world. The target understanding the composition of the virus and find the appropriate treatment.To diagnose the symptoms of the disease, Wang et al. [1] clarified the long period of virus incubation without clinical symptoms earlier. It represents the most dangerous factor of a pandemic. Symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-negative, such as fever, cough, levels of creatinine and Procalcitonin (PCT), were studied by Chen et al. [2] . For younger age patients, they discussed the difference in urea and creatinine, as well as parameters of routine blood work-up. Xu et al. [3] considered SARS-CoV-2 or liver injury may lead to COVID-19 injury. Also, they clarified the pathological features of COVID-19 are like to SARS and MERS. The main symptoms of the pregnant that injured by COVID-19 were indicated by X. Chen et al. [4] . Pregnant suffered from fever and cough, without vertical transmission of the virus in late pregnancy. World health organization (WHO) addressed the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and elderly [5] . According to tests on 1014 patients in China, Ai et al. [6] clarified the chest CT is highly sensitive to virus diagnosis compared with reverse-transcription chain reaction.As a suggested treatment, Lipsitch et al. [7] suggested using the treatment of influenza pandemic in 2009 to treat Covid-19 patients, with provide surveillance systems. Clinical trials in many hospitals in seven cities and more than 100 patients in China were conducted by Gao et al. [8] . They recommended using Chloroquine phosphate that used with malaria disease to treat COVID-19 patients. Zhou et al. [9] collected Viral RNA samples from survivors and deaths to explore the factors that cause death in hospital by using multivariable logistic regression.As mathematical models, several researchers have formulated mathematical models to describe pandemics. Models have simulated the actual cases of diseases. Then clarify the effect of many factors on the spreading, such as vaccination, weather, isolation, and so on. The optimal control model is an example of these models. Lee et al. [10] determined the effect of treatment and isolation strategies, with a limited of antiviral on the spread of influenza. Three models of optimal control of the SIR epidemic were investigated by Hansen and Day [11] to reduce the outbreak size. Tuite et al. [12] reduced the potential effects of the cholera epidemic in Haiti by using the spread control strategies. The dengue vaccine as a control variable to paediatric and random mass, were discussed by Rodrigues et al. [13] . The total implementation costs and the number of infected cases of tuberculosis were reduced by P. Rodrigues et al. [14] by using different scenarios. Moualeu et al. [15] formulated a mathematical model of tuberculosis cases with lost-sight and latently infected. Pang et al. [16] simulated the actual cases of measles transmission, then suggest the optimal strategy of vaccine in US (1951) (1952) (1953) (1954) (1955) (1956) (1957) (1958) (1959) (1960) (1961) (1962) . Ebola virus spreading in West Africa was addressed by Rachah and Torres [17, 18] . The effect of vaccination on the virus spreading over time with different cases was investigated by the first paper. Meanwhile, the second paper addressed a control on the Ebola virus, with several strategies of exposed and vaccine. Gao and Huang [19] recommended a strategy with three controls to reduce the tuberculosis cases and the intervention cost.Follows this introduction, information about COVID-19 pandemic spreading in Sect. 2. Section 3 describes the optimal control model and its explicit solution by using the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP). The results and its explanation of several models are collected in Sect. 4. Section 5 describes conclusions and the future suggested works.Wuhan, Hubei, China is the source of the first cases of COVID-19 that identified in December 2019 [2] . In January, the virus moved into three Asian countries; Thailand, Japan, and South Korea [20] . At the end of February, the cases have been registered in Europe, North America, Asia, African and Latin American [21] . At the begging of March, more than ten thousand patients have been dead out of China [1] . Until today, 1 July 2020, more than (10) million confirmed cases with more than (500) thousand deaths in the world [22] .The first case registered in Malaysia on 26 January [23] , While in Egypt on 19 February [24] . 24 February, the first case registered in Iraq, while in Argentina and Hungary in 5 March [25] . Argentina reached to more than 100 cases by only (9) days, while Malaysia in (44) days. Other countries, Hungary, Iraq, and Egypt have reached to more than 100 cases in 17, 22, and 25 days, respectively.The objective function of optimal control model is defined by:Subject to state equations of inpatient, recover and death:where, The total number of inpatients increases by the new cases and decrease by the number of recovering and death every day (Eq. 2). Equations (3) and (4) represent the total number of recovering and death, respectively. Control variables represent the percentage of increase of the medical capabilities of the health sector.We can find the solution of the optimal control model by using PMP. The Lagrangian function is as follows [26] :A Hamiltonian function is as follows:Substitute Eq. (6) into Eq. (5), yields:Derive the Eq. (7) with respect to I(t), R(t), D(t), separately, yields:The adjoint equations can be found from Eqs. (8)-(10) is as follows: ) and (20) , we can find the total number of recovered cases over time is as follows:We can find the total number of death cases over time by substituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (4) is as follows:Now, the value of control variables is as follows:where γ and δ are deterministic values.Equation (23) achieves the condition of a nonnegative value of the death rate. Initially the value of control variables is zero, which means the model represents the actual cases that confirmed with the real percentage of new cases, recovered, and death is as follows:where c, r, and d represent the daily cases of new cases, recover, and death, respectively.To fit the model with the real data of the COVID-19 cases, the initial values must be as follows:where i represents the inpatient cases, and π any fixed value, such as 10,000.The results of the model will be percentages that must be multiplied by π to convert it to the integer numbers.Then introduce the effect of the health sector capabilities by changing the values of control variables.According to the values of control variables, there are three strategies are as follows:• x(t) represents increase the medical capabilities for health sector to increase the recovery cases. This means a decrease in the numbers of inpatient and death cases. • y(t) represents increase the medical capabilities to decrease the death cases. This means an increase in the rates of inpatient and recover cases. This strategy focuses on the critical cases. • Increasing the medical capabilities with the values of the two control variables are equal regardless of the signal. This means the number of inpatient cases stay without change. This strategy focuses on the all cases, so it represents the optimal strategy.Finally, the solution of the optimal control model depends on Eqs. (12-14, 17, 20-22) .The study deals with COVID-19 cases in five countries: Argentina, Hungary, Egypt, Malaysia and Iraq. Approximately 2750 confirmed cases in each country represent the study period. The study period begins from registering more than 100 cases in each country, so the length of the period is more than one month. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (see ""Appendix"") show the number of COVID-19 cases in countries and parameter values of the model (β, μ, N) by using Eq. (26) . Figure 1 shows the results of the three strategies and the actual case of injuries (x = y = 0) in Argentina. The length of the study period is 30 days from 128 to 2758 confirmed cases.From Fig. 1 , we can deduce that the number of inpatient of the third strategy (green line) is the same in the actual case (blue circle). Increase the 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The number of paƟents death (ArgenƟna) Fig. 1 The results of the optimal control model (Argentina) medical capabilities affect only on the numbers of recovering and death with the same patients number. This means increased the recover cases by 0.2%, while a significant decrease the death cases (green area) by 0.861. A difference in percentages back to the big difference between the actual numbers of recovering and death cases. The first strategy leads to decrease the number of inpatient (red line) by 0.123. At the same time a significant increase the recovers cases and decrease the death cases (red area) by 0.187 and 0.073, respectively.The opposite case (the second strategy) leads to increase the number of inpatient (grey line) by 0.091 due to decrease the death cases. At the same time a slight increase the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (yellow area) by 0.057 and 0.856, respectively. Figure 2 shows the number of inpatient, recover and death cases in Hungary.The length of the study period is 39 days from 131 to 2727 confirmed cases. This means COVID-19 cases spreads in Argentina is faster than Hungary. From Fig. 2 , the number of cases a significant increase 17 days later of the beginning of the study period (April 7th). The third strategy leads to increase the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (green area) by 0.325 and 0.581, respectively. This means the most of the actual daily percentages of death are higher than 0.005 over the study period.The first strategy leads to decrease the number of inpatient (red line) by 0.162. At the same time increase the recover cases and decrease the death cases (red area) by 0.191 and 0.102, respectively. The low change percentage of the recovery cases represent the best health sector. Thus, the health sector in Argentina is better than in Hungary, according to the change percentage of the recovery cases. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 The number of paƟents death (Hungary) Fig. 2 The results of the optimal control model (Hungary)Increase in the number of inpatient (grey line) by 0.173, according to the second strategy. At the same time a slight increase the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (yellow area) by 0.108 and 0.544, respectively. The high change percentage represents the best health sector in the case of death cases. Thus, the health sector in Argentina is better than in Hungary. Figure 3 shows the number of inpatient, recover and death cases in Egypt.The length of the study period is 33 days from 126 to 2673 confirmed cases. This means the ranking of countries, according to the speed of spreading of COVID-19 cases is Argentina, Egypt and Hungary. From Fig. 3 , the number of cases a significant increase 19 days later of the beginning of the study period (April 2th). Increase in the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (green area), according to the third strategy by 0.17 and 0.517, respectively. This means more than half of the actual daily percentages of death are higher than 0.005 over the study period.The first strategy leads to decrease the number of inpatient (red line) by 0.136. At the same time a slight increase the recovered cases and decrease the death cases (red area) by 0.079 and 0.088, respectively. The ranking of the countries is Egypt, Argentina, and Hungary, according to the change percentage of the recovery cases.Increase in the number of inpatient (grey line) by 0.141, according to the second strategy. At the same time a slight increase the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (yellow area) by 0.086 and 0.478, respectively. The ranking of the countries is Argentina, Hungary, and Egypt, according to the change percentage of the death cases. Figure 4 shows the number of inpatient, recover and death cases in Malaysia. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 The number of paƟents death (Egypt) Fig. 3 The results of the optimal control model (Egypt)The length of the study period is 22 days from 129 to 2766 confirmed cases. This means the ranking of countries, according to the speed of spreading of COVID-19 cases is Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt and Hungary. From Fig. 4 , the number of cases a significant increase 6 days later of the beginning of the study period (March 15th). The number of death cases is zero, according to the second and third strategies. This means the actual daily percent of death are less than 0.005, while the increase in the recover cases by 0.08.The first strategy leads to decrease the number of inpatient (red line) by 0.087. At the same time a slight increase the recovered cases and decrease the death cases (red area) by 0.125 and 0.06, respectively. The ranking of the countries is Egypt, Malaysia, Argentina, and Hungary, according to the changing percent of the recovery cases.Increase in the number of inpatient (grey line) by 0.029, according to the second strategy. At the same time a slight increase the recover cases by 0.016 percent. The ranking of the countries is Malaysia, Argentina, Hungary, and Egypt, according to the changing percent of the death cases. Figure 5 shows the number of inpatients, recover and death cases in Iraq.The length of the study period is 55 days from 165 to 2767 confirmed cases. This means the ranking of countries is Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt, Hungary and Iraq, according to the speed of spreading. From Fig. 5 , the number of cases decreases 27 days later of the beginning of the study period (April 12th) and increase again 43 days later (April 28th). The third strategy leads to increase in the recover cases by 0.037%, while a significant decrease the death cases (green area) by 0.601. This means less than half of the actual daily percentages of death are higher than 0.005 over the study period. The first strategy leads to decrease the number of inpatient (red line) by 0.229. At the same time a slight decrease in the recover and death cases (red area) by 0.066 and 0.087%, respectively.Increase in the number of inpatient (grey line) by 0.146%, according to the second strategy. At the same time a slight increase the recover cases and a significant decrease the death cases (yellow area) by 0.092 and 0.59, respectively.Overall, the speed of COVID-19 spread depends on many factors, such as health awareness, tourism, modern technology using. The ranking of countries is Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt, Hungary and Iraq. For example, one of the reasons of the speed of spreading of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia is a gathering of thousands of people in one place on March 14. The ranking of the countries is Iraq, Egypt, Malaysia, Argentina, and Hungary, according to the first strategy (see Fig. 6 ). Meanwhile, Malaysia, Argentina, Iraq, Hungary, and Egypt, represents the ranking, according to the second strategy (see Fig. 7) .The important point is to determine the effect of developing the medical capabilities on the number of the recover and death cases. Figures 6, 7 and 8 represent a change of percentages of inpatient (I), recovery (R) and death (D), according to the change in control variable's value.From Fig. 6 , a small change in the recovery percent (green line) means better health sector (Iraq), and vice versa (Hungary). Meanwhile, a big change in the death percent (red line) means better health sector (Malaysia), and vice versa (Egypt) (see Fig. 7 . From Fig. 8 , there is no change in the percent of inpatients as a result to the values of the two control variables are equal regardless of the signal. The number of paƟents death (Iraq) Fig. 5 The results of the optimal control model (Iraq)We developed an optimal control model of COVID-19 pandemic spreading. The health sector performance in Argentina, Hungary, Egypt, Malaysia, and Iraq, was discussed. The explicit solution of the model using the Pontryagin maximum principle was derived. At first, we formulated an optimal control model to fit the real case of COVID-19 in the countries. Control variables x(t) and y(t) representing the percentage of change in the rates of recovering and death, respectively. Zero value of the control variables representing the actual data of COVID-19 cases. Then, changed the value of the control variables, according to the three strategies of the health sector development. Finally, we determined the ranking of countries based on the change in the recovering and death percent. It has been shown that speed of COVID-19 spreading (from 100 to 2750 cases) in Malaysia was the fastest with 22 days, and vice versa in Iraq with 55 days. The first strategy focused on increase the recovery cases by increase the medical capabilities by a specific percent. The ranking of the countries was Iraq, Egypt, Malaysia, Argentina, and Hungary. Meanwhile, the second strategy focused on reducing the death cases by increase the medical. The ranking was Malaysia, Argentina, Iraq, Hungary, and Egypt, according to the change percentage of the death cases. A change in the recovery and death cases without change in inpatient cases was the third strategy. Development the health sector by a specific percent (0.5%) led to reduce the death cases. Malaysia with the highest percent (100%) and Egypt with the lowest percent (48%). Meanwhile, 1.6% and 8.6% represented the increase in the recover cases in Malaysia and Egypt, respectively.Our model can apply in other countries to determine the health sector performance and development percent that its need. Also, with other factors, such as isolation and communications, that can affect on pandemic spreading.The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available in the ","Argentina","abstract","2021-01-19",1

Patients who are COVID positive may require orotracheal intubation (OTI) because of respiratory failure or for surgery. [1] [2] [3] OTI often triggers coughing and the dispersed aerosols pose a serious risk to personnel managing the airway or in proximity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Several guidelines have been proposed to reduce the risk of infection during OTI through limiting and isolating the sphere of aerosolisation, preventing aerosolisation, minimising the number of attempts at OTI and using personal protective equipment. [4] [5] [6] [7] Notably, whether the primary cause of aerosolisation during airway management is the OTI procedure itself and/or patient cough (both volitional or during OTI due to insufficient muscle relaxation) or during rescue manoeuvres (eg, face mask ventilation), or both, remains a subject of debate.In terms of limiting the sphere of aerosolisation during airway management, there is the aerosol box, 8 antiaerosol igloo 9 and the portable negative pressure chamber. 10 Unfortunately, the aerosol box (and by extension, any similar tent devices)What is already known on this subject ► The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a coronavirus that is transmitted primarily via aerosol, droplets or direct contact. This may place anaesthesiologists, intensivists and emergency physicians at a higher risk of infection due to their frequent involvement in aerosol-generating airway interventions. ► Simulation-based training and preparedness testing activities are vital in identifying gaps to apply corrective actions immediately. ► Orotracheal intubation (OTI) in patients with COVID-19 should be performed by the most proficient practitioner immediately available, using the most efficient technique. What this study adds ► Direct laryngoscopy is a more reliable technique than videolaryngoscopy for non-expert practitioner on the last method. ► Aerosol-mitigating strategies that do not allow stylet usage negatively affect the procedure success. ► The use of a stylet within the endotracheal tube, especially for non-anaesthesiologists, had an impact on OTI success rates and decreased procedural time.is associated with longer intubation time and higher failure rate. 11 The recommendation that, with patients with COVID-19, OTI should be performed by the most experienced professional using the best equipment 4-7 is premised on the need to reduce the number and duration of intubation attempts such that aerosolisation can be minimised, and to quickly provide ventilation to patients. Anaesthesiologists are the most proficient in OTI, while intensive care and emergency physicians are probably, on average, competent but not quite as proficient. The best equipment involves videolaryngoscopy (VL). [4] [5] [6] [7] For non-anaesthesiologists, however, experience with VL may be limited as direct laryngoscopy (DL) is usually used in most non-COVID intubations. One important question to ask is whether the use of a superior laryngoscopy technique (ie, VL) actually facilitates OTI by clinicians who are less experienced with the technique. In terms of limiting/preventing aerosol spread, British and Canadian COVID-19 guidelines suggest the use of a hydrophobic heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter to block aerosols at the endotracheal tube (ETT) opening. 4 5 Unfortunately, the HME filter can only be applied after the stylet used to bend the ETT (useful in difficult DL and with videolaryngoscopes that have a hyperangulated blade) has been removed after ETT placement, thus creating a time gap when aerosol can disperse. Our group has adopted a different technique to achieve uninterrupted blocking of the ETT at all times, one which is compatible with use of a stylet in DL and VL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, through simulation, the success rate and procedural time of two aerosol-mitigating strategies (AMS) during OTI under DL and VL performed by airway clinicians: anaesthesiologists, and intensive care and emergency physicians.This was a cross-sectional study in which volunteer physicians performed OTI on a standard airway simulation manikin using two different AMS. A total of 27 physicians-9 anaesthesiologists, 9 intensivists and 9 emergency physicians-were randomly selected from their respective departments. Notably, at the very beginning of this COVID-19 pandemic, all physicians enrolled in this study had previously received specific institutional simulation training on VL as part of a hospital-wide campaign. In addition, for the purposes of this study, clinicians were deemed experts in VL if they had performed ≥10 OTIs under VL in the previous 12 months of their clinical practice. Furthermore, prior to beginning this study, all chosen participants were provided with standard instructions for the direct laryngoscope and the videolaryngoscope used in the study, including a demonstration of the intubation methods and the use of enhancement manoeuvres (eg, head position readjustment) to facilitate OTI. The participants were then allowed up to five practice attempts with the direct laryngoscope and the videolaryngoscope on a manikin (QCPR Resusci Anne model with airways: Laerdal).A McGrath videolaryngoscope (for VL) and a Macintosh laryngoscope (for DL) with size 4 blades were used in this study. Unlike most other videolaryngoscopes, the McGrath MAC blade used in this study is less hyperangulated and routine use of a hyperangulated stylet within the ETT is not needed. As such, the HME could be attached to the ETT during placement, thus eliminating the time gap between removal of the stylet and the attachment of the HME when aerosol can disperse, as explained earlier. All intubations were performed with a 7.5 mm internal diameter Portex ETT on the standard airway training manikin.Two AMS, both without a time gap when aerosol can escape, were studied. (1) The first AMS involved use of an HME filter without stylet: the ETT (prior to intubation) was connected to an antibacterial hygroscopic condenser HME (Gibeck) occluded proximally with its own original occlusion device ( figure 1A ). This technique does not allow for the use of an ETT stylet (as mentioned earlier). After successful intubation, the participant instructed an assistant to inflate the ETT cuff, clamped the ETT, removed the filter occlusion device (figure 1A), connected to the ventilator and removed the clamp prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation. The ETT curvature was adjusted (without a stylet) at the participant's discretion during the intubation attempt. (2) The other AMS (stylet) was previously described by our group 12 : the ETT-stylet assembly was moulded prior to the procedure to follow the curvature of the blade used, which resulted in ~60° angle at the distal third of the ETT. 13 This technique was performed with the ETT connector occluded by a 20 mL syringe plunger through which a 5 mm malleable stylet was passed (figure 1B). After successful intubation, the participant instructed an assistant to inflate the ETT cuff and partially remove the stylet while keeping the ETT occluded with the syringe plunger. At this point, the ETT was clamped distal to the stylet tip and proximal to the pilot cuff tubing, the styletplunger assembly removed, the ventilator connected and the clamp removed prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation. 12 For all participants, the first intubation attempt was carried out using a standard DL technique (without either AMS) with a The primary outcome was successful first OTI attempt with each of the five attempts: (1) DL without AMS, (2) DL with AMS (HME filter without stylet), (3) DL with AMS (stylet), and (4, 5) likewise for VL. Secondary outcomes were degree of airway visualisation and the time required for intubation. The time taken for all intubations was measured by the same investigator, and was defined as the time lapse between when the laryngoscope was inserted between the manikin's teeth and when the first breath occurred. The degree of airway visualisation was reported by the participant after each attempt, and was classified according to the Cormack and Lehane grading system as easy (grades I and II) or difficult (grades III and IV).Intubation failure was considered when the laryngoscope was removed from the oral cavity due to poor visualisation, an intubation time greater than 120 s or oesophageal intubation.The time required to perform OTI on a manikin has been reported to be between 12 and 70 s. 14 For sample size calculation, a difference of 10 (mean)±7.5 (SD) s between the time taken to perform the OTI with different devices was considered significant in a simulated study, with a 95% test power and a difference at a significance level of 0.05. This would require nine physicians from each specialty. Histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used to verify the symmetry of data distribution. Analyses of variance were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Dunn's post hoc test in case of p<0.05. The χ 2 test was used to analyse the categorical variables, and the partitioning χ 2 was used when the p value was less than 0.05. The Fisher's exact test was used when one of the expected frequencies was lower than 5. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.The age of the participants included in the study was 33.8 (mean)±7.6 (SD) years. The median postcertification clinical experience was 3 (range 2-6) years for anaesthesiologists, 7 (3-13) years for intensivists and 3 (2-3) years for emergency physicians (p=0.18). There was no significant relationship between OTI success and the age or clinical experience (p>0.05).The overall success rates (defined as first attempt successful intubation) for each technique are shown in table 1. The intubation technique using VL with an AMS (HME filter without stylet) had a lower overall success rate compared with the other techniques (p<0.001).Intensivists had lower success rates compared with anaesthesiologists when using the AMS (HME without stylet) under DL (p=0.03). Non-anaesthesiologists were unsuccessful in all attempts at OTI using the AMS (HME without stylet) under VL. Conversely, success rates did not differ between specialists while using the AMS with stylet under DL (p=0.14) and VL (p=0.07) (table 1). There was no difference between intensivists and emergency physicians with regard to oesophageal intubation (p=0.67).The median intubation times for each technique are shown in table 2. With DL, intensive care and emergency physicians required a longer time for successful OTI with AMS (HME without stylet) compared with anaesthesiologists, but required similar amount of time for successful OTI using the AMS with stylet compared with anaesthesiologists. With VL, intensive care and emergency physicians failed at all OTI attempts using AMS (HME without stylet), and required significantly more time for successful OTI using AMS with stylet compared with anaesthesiologists (table 2) .The degree of airway visualisation was reported as difficult more frequently by intensive care and emergency physicians under both DL and VL (table 3) .All anaesthesiologists were deemed experts in VL (ie, ≥10 OTIs under VL over the previous 12 months), whereas 55.6% During OTI, 73% of patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 develop severe hypoxaemia and 2% suffer a cardiac arrest. 15 The risk of infection for healthcare professionals increases when multiple or prolonged intubation attempts are necessary. Furthermore, an OTI failure may necessitate face mask bag ventilation, also a highly aerosolising manoeuvre especially when it is difficult. 16 These considerations underscore the recommendations that OTI in patients with COVID-19 should be performed by the most proficient practitioner immediately available using the most efficient technique. In addition, AMS have been suggested to reduce the risks to healthcare teams. 4 5 12 Anaesthesiology trainees who have performed 50 successful OTIs under DL require 76 OTIs under VL to achieve a 90% success rate. 17 This learning curve may explain in part why intensive care and emergency physicians, who may have less VL experience, did not perform as well in our simulation. Our results suggest that anaesthesiologists, if one is available in a timely fashion, should perform COVID-19 OTIs. They also suggest that for non-anaesthesiologists, depending on VL experience, use of DL with an effective AMS may be more appropriate, despite current COVID-19 recommendations. This is particularly true when VL is performed without a stylet to shape the ETT into a more hyperangulated curvature. Finally, our results validate a novel AMS used by our group. 12 When compared with HME filter (recommended in Canadian 5 and British 4 guidelines) without stylet, our novel AMS took less time to perform by anaesthesiologists and was universally successfully completed by intensive care and emergency physicians (table 2) . Also worth noting, the use of HME without stylet, although recommended by guidelines, 4 5 appeared to significantly hinder the nonanaesthesiologists' ability to secure the airway (table 1) , thus calling into question whether this AMS should be universally adopted in the first place, especially given the lack of concrete evidence that AMS would decrease aerosolisation, particularly if patients are well paralysed and not coughing.Importantly, at the institution where the study took place, VL was not routinely used by intensive care and emergency physicians before the pandemic, and was mostly reserved for managing patients with features of difficult airway by anaesthesiologists. Hence, despite all participating physicians receiving the same institutional simulation training on VL at the beginning of the pandemic, prior clinical expertise with VL (defined as ≥10 OTIs under VL over the previous 12 months) had a significant impact on the success rates of first OTI attempt (table 4), suggesting that regional differences in physician training and expertise with VL must be taken into account.The present investigation supports the concept of creating among non-anaesthesiologists a group of excellence for OTI in patients with COVID-19 aiming at successful intubation in the shortest possible time and with minimal number of attempts, because timely anaesthesiology availability is not guaranteed.As to be expected, incorporating AMS should increase the time required for OTI. The increases (table 2) are small, and are required and well justified to prevent disease spread. With the exception of intensive care physicians performing AMS with stylet, our study was underpowered to show statistical significance in those differences. Likewise, our study was underpowered to show whether the differences in time between DL and VL were significant. Since these differences appear to be small, the choice between DL and VL should likely be based on assessment of the patient's relevant clinical features, including ease of OTI, and one's comfort level with the type of videolaryngoscopes available. Our simulation results also support the routine use of a stylet in the ETT during VL, especially by those with less experience in VL.Intubating a manikin made of rigid plastic and a real person is not quite the same. Furthermore, the manikin is immobile but not all real-world patients are paralysed, although that is recommended for patients with COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] The realism of a simulated environment may also affect operator performance. For example, concern over personal and personnel safety and a real person in extremis are difficult to reproduce. Caution must therefore be exercised when interpreting simulation results. On the other hand, experimental and objective real-world data are difficult and time consuming to obtain. The results of our study may help guide bigger simulation studies and help design clinical trials to devise the best and safest strategies for OTI in patients with highly contagious respiratory diseases.

The first case of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the Chinese province of Wuhan and quickly spread across the globe to reach the status of pandemic (Layne et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Shehzad et al. 2020) . COVID-19 spread so quickly in 2020 that it required worldwide emergency measures of social distancing and quarantine in almost all major cities around the world as a way to reduce contagion (Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego 2020; Bera et al. 2020) . Closing schools and restaurants, urging people to stay at home and reduce physical contact and interactions still are the most effective form of prevention (Guo et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2020; Wilder-Smith and Freedman 2020) . In Wuhan, the first isolation measures adopted were to ban travel, limit traffic, suspend transport and close factories, which had a substantial effect and reduced the spread of the virus (Bao and Zhang 2020) .The pandemic, a challenge in terms of global health, has shed light, in quantitative terms, on the impact of the emission of pollutants generated by human activity in the cities, in a context of reduced urban mobility never before seen in the twenty-first century. Muhammad et al. (2020) state that transport is the sector affected the most by the lockdown; based on Google's Mobility Index Report, those researchers identified reductions in the transport sector between February 23rd and April 5th, 2020, in Spain (89%), Italy (86%), France (82%), England (70%), Germany (47%) and the USA (54%), and there is a consensus that anthropogenic emission reductions, mainly in transportation and the industry, contributed to a decrease in air pollutant concentrations (Wang et al. 2020) . In this context, several studies identified various levels of pollutant reduction in the main cities that have adopted urban mobility constraints as a strategy to mitigate COVID-19 contamination.Initially, by combining satellite observations with detailed computer models of the atmosphere, studies released at the beginning of the pandemic indicated a reduction of about 20-30% in particulate matter (PM) on the surface of much of China. Part of the reduction in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) in the troposphere was attributed to the impact of the Coronavirus, with a reduction of about 40% in Chinese cities (EESA 2020a) . Satellite images also demonstrate a significant reduction in average NO 2 concentrations in major cities in India, with a pollutant decrease of about 40-50% in Mumbai and Delhi (India) compared with the same period in 2019 (EESA 2020b). In Italy and France, NO 2 levels decreased between 45 and 50% compared with the same period in 2019. Madrid (Spain), Milan and Rome (Italy) had drops of around 45% while Paris (France) had a dramatic reduction of about 54%, coinciding with the strict quarantine measures implemented across Europe (EESA 2020c).Confirming findings from satellite images, local studies assessed the impacts of lockdown on air quality and pollutant emissions of anthropogenic origin using data from local monitoring stations. The first city to adopt the lockdown, Wuhan (China) had strong reductions in PM concentration (~ 42%), in nitrogen oxides (NO x ) rates (~ 56%), and average NO 2 concentrations (~ 57%), when comparing the isolation period with the same period in the years 2017-2019 (Sicard et al. 2020) . Data from urban stations in Delhi (India), one of the cities with the highest pollution indices in the world, showed that during the lockdown there was a significant improvement in air quality, especially when comparing the concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter under 2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ) and 10 μm (PM 10 ), whose maximum reduction reached 50% when compared with a period prior to the lockdown. NO 2 concentrations and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions also decreased by 52.68% and 30.35%, respectively (Mahato et al. 2020) . Kolkata (India) had a reduction in the PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentration around 17.5%, while the pollutants CO, NO 2 and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) significantly decreased due to the closedown of all industrial and transport activities during lockdown when compared with previous years (Bera et al. 2020) . There was also a prominent reduction of surface temperature by 0.23-3.2 °C within the lockdown ambience in Kolkata.In Milan (Italy), urban station results demonstrate there was a significant reduction in the levels of PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), benzene, CO and nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the lockdown. SO 2 levels remained unchanged in most peripheral areas, and despite the decrease in NO 2 levels, there was an increase in ozone (O 3 ) levels, probably due to lower nitrogen monoxide (NO) concentrations (Collivignarelli et al. 2020) . In European cities Nice (France), Rome and Turin (Italy), and Valencia (Spain), NO 2 concentrations decreased by ~ 53% in urban stations and ~ 65% in traffic zone stations while nitrogen monoxide concentrations (NO) decreased further, by ~ 63% at urban stations and ~ 78% at traffic stations, when the isolation period is compared with the same period in the years 2017-2019 (Sicard et al. 2020) . The concentration of PM 2.5 reduced by 20-60% in other world cities, such as Bogota (Colombia), Kubait City (Bahrain), Tehran (Iran), Taskhkent (Uzbekistan), Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), Kabul (Afghanistan), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Turkey compared with a period prior to the lockdown or compared with the average figures for the same days in 2018-2019 (Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego 2020; Kerimray et al. 2020; Aydin et al. 2020) . Salé (Morocco) showed reductions by 75% for PM 10 , 49% for SO 2 , and 96% for NO 2 levels during the lockdown when compared with the previous period (Otmani et al. 2020) .In the state of São Paulo (Brazil) , during the initial period of partial lockdown (until April 20th, 2020) drastic reductions were observed in the emissions of NO (up to 77.3%) and NO 2 (up to 54.3%), as well as a reduction in CO concentrations (up to 64.8%) compared with the monthly average of previous years. However, an increase of about 30% was observed in O 3 concentrations in urban areas, probably due to reduced car traffic and decreased NO emissions (Nakada and Urban 2020) . Krecl et al. (2020) compared the NOx reductions (40-70%) of this unprecedented event with reductions brought about by the strike organized by truck drives which brought several sectors of Brazil to a halt for 10 days in 2018. In Rio de Janeiro, the second-most populous city in Brazil, measurements of the city's air quality showed significant reductions in CO levels (between 37.0% and 43.6%) and NO 2 (between 24.1 and 32.9%) during the first lockdown month compared with the same period of 2019. Levels of PM 10 were only reduced in the first lockdown week (Dantas et al. 2020 ). In Brazil, there was no consensus about the importance and the need for social distancing, reflected in an increase in urban mobility, even during the pandemic (Dantas et al. 2020) .While the positive impact on air quality may be temporary, this type of reduction can assist governments and individuals to learn how to reduce pollution in the long term, and to foresee alternatives to decrease the use of fossil fuels in the future (Muhammad et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego 2020) . Pandemics and calamities have occurred several times throughout human history, leading to-besides numerous deaths-changes in society's habits and urban planning. According to Gouveia and Kanai (2020) , the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 once again reveals the relationship between health and the urban environment. Anthropogenic action modifies or destroys biodiversity; this fact, allied to climate change, is possibly directly related to the emergence of new viruses, as is the case of the virus that causes COVID-19 (Lorentzen et al. 2020) . Moreover, urban design, climatic and environmental variables, housing configurations, population density, and sanitary and transport infrastructure, may or may not favor the control of a pandemic.Most recent studies related to the emission of pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic have evaluated changes in air quality compared with a period prior to the lockdown (Aydin et al. 2020; Bashir et al. 2020; Collivignarelli et al. 2020; Dantas et al. 2020; Mahato et al. 2020; Muhammad et al. 2020; Nakada and Urban 2020; Otmani et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Urrego and Rodríguez-Urrego 2020; Sarkar et al. 2020; Sicard et al. 2020) . Some authors sought to correlate other aspects, such as climatic variables and the spread or lethality of COVID-19 (Conticini et al. 2020; Fattorini and Regoli 2020; Guo et al. 2020; Hendryx and Luo 2020; Jahangiri et al. 2020; Kerimray et al. 2020; Ogen 2020; Prata et al. 2020; Rehman et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2020 ). The effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy was analyzed by Cartenì et al. (2020) in Italy, while Bao and Zhang (2020) related mobility indices to air quality in the lockdown period in Chinese cities.This article is distinctive and relevant because it identifies the relationship between the pollutant concentrations during the prolonged lockdown at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduced movement of people in the city of São Paulo; São Paulo is the largest city in Latin America, moreover, no studies in South America have addressed this type of analysis so far. Furthermore, the main question raised in this study is: ""What is the impact on air pollutant emissions in the context of social isolation in a longer term?"" With this question in mind, this study aims to detect the relationship between the social isolation index in the megacity of São Paulo and the fluctuation in the levels of the main air pollutants (PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO x , NO, NO 2 , SO 2 and CO) and air temperature. This study analyzed the period between March 16th, 2020, and July 20th, 2020, and compared it with the previous period in 2020 and the previous 5 years (2015-2019), based on data from three urban air quality monitoring stations located in the city center of São Paulo.São Paulo is the largest urban agglomeration in the Southern Hemisphere, with an area of 7,946 km 2 , connecting 39 municipalities and a population of 20 million, and it is one of the most populous cities in the world (Krecl et al. 2020; SEADE 2020) . São Paulo also has one of the largest vehicle fleets in the country, and a high concentration of industries that have a direct impact on urban air quality in the area. Due to this fact, São Paulo has the worst air pollution indices in the country, with emissions of 132 thousand t/Year of carbon monoxide (CO), 42 thousand t/Year of hydrocarbons (HC), 77 thousand t/Year of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), 4.5 thousand t/Year of particulate matter (PM) and 11 thousand t/Year of sulfur oxides (SO x ); vehicles are responsible for 97% of CO emissions, 81% HC, 80% NOx, 48% SO x and 40% PM (Gouveia et al. 2017) .The disordered urbanization and increase in the number of sources of air pollution over the years, mainly due to the high concentration of cars and factories, has led to a critical situation with regard to air quality in São Paulo (Andrade et al. 2017 ). Occupying cities more densely is very effective in terms of economy and the footprint left by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions; however, when high density is the result of a disordered urbanization process, it leads to problems associated with the population's quality of life, especially the poorest strata, which makes urban live unsustainable (Jacobi 2013) . Thus, it is noteworthy that in addition to population density, the transmission of COVID-19 can be affected by different factors such as climatic conditions (temperature and humidity) and the quality of the health system (Wang et al. 2020; Jahangiri et al. 2020) . Moreover, the high concentration of pollutants in the air may be directly associated with a higher probability of contamination in this pandemic (Zhu et al. 2020; Fattorini and Regoli 2020; Hendryx and Lou 2020; Conticini et al. 2020) , while the long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) can be one of the factors that most contribute to mortality caused by the Coronavirus (Ogen 2020). On the other hand, paradoxically, the COVID-19 pandemic may have decreased the total number of deaths from air pollution during the lockdown periods (Dutheil et al. 2020 ).The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was confirmed on February 26, 2020. On July 20, 2020, the country counted 2,121,645 cases and 80,251 deaths (Brazil 2020) . The city of São Paulo continued to lead the numbers of cases and deaths, which caused the prolongation of the social isolation rules. A municipal decree issued on March 17, 2020, marked the beginning of restrictions while the first actions to ease the partial lockdown were put in practice on June 10, 2020, when some businesses were reopened. July 20, 2020, is the 125th day of social isolation and reductions in urban mobility, albeit with different restriction levels.The primary data of the pollutant concentrations PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO x , NO, NO 2 , SO 2 , CO and the environmental variables (air temperature and relative humidity) were obtained from the regional agency in charge of the air quality monitoring stations in the state Companhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo, CETESB (2020) . In addition to pollutants related to air quality, we chose to verify air temperature since internal combustion engine vehicles are responsible for considerable emissions of anthropogenic heat in urban centers. For this study, three air quality monitoring stations were selected in the Central Region of São Paulo, an urban area characterized by heavy automobile traffic. We prioritized air quality monitoring stations registering the same variables, with 84.4% of the primary data validated: Marginal Tietê (Station A); Dom Pedro II Bus Terminal (Station B) and Marginal Pinheiros (Station C) (Fig. 1) . Station B is setup at a bus terminal, while stations A and C are next to heavy traffic expressways.We collected the primary data of the three stations in the form of hourly averages, and then we calculated daily averages (arithmetic mean of 24-h monitoring values) for each pollutant and environmental variable, from January 1 to July 20, 2020. Adopting daily values for the variables allowed us to compare them with the social isolation indices, as explained in item 2.3, to detect changes in the time series and quantify the effect of social isolation on the emission levels of pollutants, and environmental variables. In the weeks preceding the decree that started social isolation, there was a national holiday, which traditionally implies a reduction in the operation of businesses and, consequently, in mobility in urban centers. For this reason, this study prioritized analyzing the variations of the daily average concentrations compared with the same period of the previous 5 years, from 2015 to 2019. In an initial analysis, a similar behavior was observed in the daily variations at each monitoring station, so the average value of the three monitoring stations was used as a reference in this study. Fig. 1 Location of air quality monitoring stations in the city of São PauloThe decree that reduced urban mobility in São Paulo did not lead to a total stop (lockdown), rather, it was considered partial (partial lockdown) compared with the level of restrictions observed in other cities around the globe. The reduction in population movement was quantified by the ""social isolation index"" created by the São Paulo State Government, as a yardstick for adopting official measures to fight COVID-19 (São Paulo 2020). Bao and Zhang (2020) indicated human mobility as one potential mechanism to estimate the effects of the implementation of travel restrictions on air pollution. To establish the link between lockdown and air pollution reductions, the authors used a human mobility index measured on mobility records from a Chinese online search engine with a desktop and mobile mapping application. Cartenì et al. (2020) used an average daily mobility rate estimated by an institute for research about mobility and logistics in Italy plus data collected by car traffic count automatic sensors from the ""COVID-19 mobility observatory"" of the Italian Transport Ministry to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy. The two aforementioned studies used different types of local data sources regarding the mobility and movement of people in cities.To establish the link between urban mobility and air pollution reductions in the period of partial lockdown, we used the official daily numbers of the social isolation index for the city of São Paulo (São Paulo 2020). The monitoring system in São Paulo, where the technical team of the Institute of Technological Research (Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas-IPT) operates, updated the daily index of adherence to social isolation upon analyzing mobile phone data to indicate mobility trends and assess the effectiveness of social isolation measures. The index is based on the location obtained by cell phone antennas (Base Radio Stations), which identify a reference for the place where the cell phone ""slept"" between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. During the day, a mobile phone that has moved about 200 m away from this reference point is accounted for as a device not in isolation. The data are made available by telecommunication service providers present in the state of São Paulo and managed by the Brazilian Association of Telecommunication Resources (Associação Brasileira de Recursos em Telecomunicações) through a Big Data platform (IPT 2020). Because the system locates the telephones in use through their antennas-and not the GPS-their location cannot be hidden.The collected data were tabulated and analyzed on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Descriptive analysis was performed for all the data, and linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation were conducted to verify the relationship between social isolation and the emission of pollutants. For statistical analyses, the initial procedure consisted of verifying the normality of all data, by using as criteria the Asymmetry values ranging from + 3 to − 3, and Kurtosis values between + 8 and − 8, as proposed by Kline (2011) to accept data as normal. Correlation analyses were used in other studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify, for example, the relationship of the number of cases and deaths with environmental variables (Singh et al. 2020; Bashir et al. 2020) , and the association among the different pollutants (Sarkar et al. 2020) . Linear regression was used by Prata et al. (2020) to identify the relationship of the number of cases with air temperature and population density.The pollutants' daily average values, calculated on the three monitoring stations located in the Central Region of São Paulo, demonstrate a reduction in concentrations in 2020 compared with the average for the same period of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). However, such reduction was more pronounced in the period of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the first months after the decree that reduced mobility in the city, for the pollutants NO, NO 2 and CO, as reported by Nakada and Urban (2020) , and also NO x (Fig. 2) .By superimposing the daily average data for 2020, the daily average data for the preceding 5 years (2015-2019), and the social isolation index (Figs. 3, 4) , we notice a similar behavior in the emissions of all the pollutants during two distinct time periods of the pandemic: the first 45 days (interval 1-March 17, 2020, to April 30, 2020), when isolation rates were mostly over 50% (yet below 70% recommended by the World Health Organization-WHO); and the next few months (interval 2-May 1, 2020, to July 20, 2020), with bigger fluctuations, and averages predominantly below 50% (Fig. 3) . The national holiday on May 1st marks the beginning of interval 2. While the first period of partial lockdown is marked by greater reductions in the emission of pollutants, the second period is characterized by greater fluctuations of nearly all pollutants analyzed in this study. In this period, the maximum averages stand out because they reached higher values than those for both the period prior to the partial lockdown and the average of the previous 5 years (Fig. 4) . Table 1 and Fig. 5 show the average values for the months of January to July 20, 2020, and for the same period of the previous 5 years and demonstrate significant reductions in the months of March and April 2020 for pollutants NO (59.62% Mar and 42.65% Apr); NO 2 (30.86% Mar and 32.21% Apr); NO x (45.84% Mar and 37.27% Apr) and CO (40.81% Mar and 39.68% Apr). In May, however, the reduction trend did not stand, and the emission of pollutants NO, NO 2 , NO x and CO reached higher averages than in the immediate period preceding the pandemic (February) and very close averages to those in the same period in the previous 5 years. About the inhalable particulate matter PM 10 and fine inhalable particulate matter PM 2.5 , their reductions in the months of March and April 2020 were lower than in the period preceding the pandemic; in addition, in May they presented higher average levels than in the previous 5 years: PM 10 = + 19.39% and PM 2.5 = + 6.79%. In July, reductions reached 14.62% and 25.24%, respectively (Table 1) .In a semi-monthly analysis since the beginning of the pandemic (Table 2 and Fig. 6 ), the influence of social isolation indices on the fluctuation of pollutants becomes more evident, with the most relevant negative variations in the 2nd half of March/2020 and in the 1st half of April 2020: NO (48.86% Mar and 50.13% Apr); NO 2 (33.37% Mar and 37.58% Apr); NO x (40.86% Mar and 43.29% Apr) and CO (34.06% Mar and 44.32% Apr). The reductions in these pollutants tend to decrease from the 2nd half of April/2020 on. Inhalable particulate matter PM 10 , and fine inhalable particulate matter PM 2.5 reduced slightly in the first 30 days of partial lockdown while they increased as of the 2nd half of April. Reduced concentrations of PM 2.5 are observed from the first week of June while reduced concentrations of PM 10 are observed from the second week of June (Table 2) .By analyzing the associations between the social isolation index and the concentration of the seven pollutants ( Fig. 6 and Table 3) , we see negative correlations between the variables, which demonstrates that the restriction measures and the lesser circulation of people influenced the reduction of air pollution. As to the results, the pollutants NO, NO 2 , NO x and CO presented the strongest correlations, which allow us to affirm that social isolation explained 18.81%; 33.9%; 23.24%, and 13.45%, respectively, of the concentrations of these pollutants in the period. These results agree with Bao and Zhang (2020) , who found that travel restriction measures taken in 44 cities in China significantly reduced air pollution emissions of SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO (a decrease by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively).Human activity in cities is responsible for generating anthropogenic heat, which comes from various sources such as buildings and cars (Gartland 2010) . Vehicle traffic decreased considerably during the partial lockdown and positively affected air quality (Nakada and Urban 2020; Krecl et al. 2020) . Besides affecting air quality, automotive vehicles are assumed to influence air temperature records, especially in the areas where the monitoring stations of this study are located, that is, next to intense traffic roads. About the temperature, even if there is a natural decrease due to the season (autumn), in the months of April and May reduction scores are 7.45% and 8.11% compared with the five previous years. In June and July, the mean air temperature is higher than in previous years: + 7.83% in June and + 5.50% in July (Table 1) . On the other hand, the result of the linear regression between air temperature and social isolation (Fig. 7) , and Pearson's correlation (Table 3) demonstrate no relevant association between these variables, and it is not possible to assert that social isolation contributed to the oscillation of air temperature in the period. Table 1 Monthly averages in 2020, 5-year series (2015-2019) of pollutants PM10, PM2.5, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, CO, and environmental variables, namely, air temperature, calculated on data from 3 air quality stations in São Paulo-SP All averages calculated on data from three monitoring stations, except *2015 and 2016 data from two stations **2016 data from one station ***Data from 2015 to 2020 from one station ****Up to July 20 This study concluded that the decrease in urban mobility due to the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on air quality, with a reduction in the emission of pollutants NO (31.75%), NO 2 (20.60%), NO x (27.21%) and CO (29.95%) considering the partial lockdown period from March 16, 2020, to July 20, 2020. A more notable fall was observed in the initial period of the lockdown, however, when analyzing a longer period (since the lockdown in São Paulo was successively prolonged), from the third month on we noticed a decline in such reductions compared to the beginning of the pandemic. Subtle falls in social isolation rates in the city of São Paulo were reflected in the emission of pollutants in the period. About the inhalable PM 10 and fine inhalable PM 2.5 particles, their reductions in the first months of social isolation were lower than in the period immediately before the pandemic; moreover, in May they presented higher average levels than in the previous 5 years: + 19.39% and + 6.79%, respectively. More relevant reductions were only identified in July (14.62% and 25.24%), which may have been influenced by other aspects not addressed in this study.From the analyses conducted in this study, we highlight:• Higher drops in the emission of pollutants NO, NO 2 , NO x and CO were observed when the social isolation index reached an average of 52.20%; • Small negative fluctuations in the social isolation index broke the reductions observed at the beginning of the lockdown; • We notice two distinct periods of the partial lockdown in São Paulo-SP, with the predominance of indices above 50% in the first 45 days (interval 1) and predominance of indices below 50% in the following period (interval 2). • The relationships between pollutant concentrations and the social isolation index showed that the decrease in mobility influenced the reduction of air pollution. Pollutants NO 2 , NO x , NO and CO had the strongest negative associations (Pearson's correlation (ρ) = − 0.582; 0.481; − 0.433 and −0 .367, respectively). All averages calculated on data from three monitoring stations, except *2015 and 2016 data from two stations **2016 data from one station ***Data from 2015 to 2020 from 1 station • Other contextual factors may have influenced the fluctuations that occurred for all pollutants in the second period of the partial lockdown, in which maximum values observed are above the last 5 years' average.This study identified that the reductions of the pollutant levels were not regular in the analyzed period; great oscillations were observed in May and June 2020, which may be the object of further, more in-depth studies. The results herein presented, analyzed on a local scale, demonstrate the potential of a megacity such as São Paulo to reduce the concentrations of air pollutants generated by anthropogenic activities related to urban mobility, even if due to temporary circumstances.

Consequently, some have started to question whether the COVID-19 epidemic can be managed on the basis of daily data [13] .Understandably, most of the studies have focused on the contagion scenarios in Europe and China. To our knowledge, there appears to be a lack of COVID-19 related research focusing on south America, more specifically Brazil, home of approximately 211 million people, the world's fifth-largest country by area and currently the world's 8th largest economy. Brazil-specific predictions incorporating government introduced mitigation strategies were made available in [14] for the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. These represent the two largest economic units of the union and also concentrate a significant part of the population. However, the true local scale is difficult to assess. In part, this is due to under-reporting of cases owing to chronic test shortages [15] . Furthermore, the official figures only include deaths reported by hospitals. A more detailed analysis of current research is presented in Sect. 2.The set of guiding questions behind this work can be stated as follows: it is common knowledge that political leadership in Brazil has at times conveyed contradictory messages on how best to tackle the crisis. Some argue for the necessity of mitigation measures, whilst others defend that these will result in insurmountable damage to the economy. As a result, can public trust in civil servants affect the epidemic? Given the current set of Brazilian public policies aiming at mitigation, how will this affect the local spread of COVID-19? What would be the effects of more relaxed non-pharmaceutical measures? Sect. 3 exploits these questions by proposing carefully designed quarantine strategies based on the availability of hospitalisation beds and evaluating these strategies in the long-term by means of a traditional SEIR epidemic model. Furthermore, is it possible to predict how COVID-19 will affect Brazil based on what is happening in other countries? What features should be considered? Are there any peculiarities to Brazil? E.g. How is Brazil different from high-contagion scenarios such as Europe and the USA? How does the quality of the Brazilian health system affect the epidemic? Finally, given what we know so far about the underlying clinical conditions affecting mortality rate, how does Brazil fare? We attempt to provide an answer to these questions in Sect. 4 by employing publicly-available data alongside a neural regressor. The main conclusions of this work are presented in Sect. 5. A preliminary version of our findings was reported in [16] .COVID-19's human-to-human transmission is via droplets or by direct contact with an infected person [17] . An early estimate of the epidemic size in Wuhan, China, was presented in [18] . The forecast was based on the number of cases exported to international destinations. Several incubation periods have been cited in the literature, namely, 5.2 days [19] to 6.4 days [20] . Furthermore, estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , a measure describing the average number of secondary cases resulting from an infected person, also vary widely. For example, the intervals [2.24 --3.58] and [1.4 --3.8] appear in [17] and [21] , respectively.Currently, there are multiple ongoing clinical trials worldwide to assess the effectiveness and safety of certain drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir [22] . In vitro data has suggested that chloroquine inhibits virus replication [23] , although clinical testing has failed to provide such a strong case so far. Also, clinical studies suggest the apparent efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of pneumonia following COVID-19 infection [24] . However, as [25] carefully points out there is a delicate margin between a therapeutic and a toxic dose. The study reinforces the need for further trials to help validate the claims and design future guidelines.Given the current lack of proven pharmaceutical solutions, most governments around the world have pursued public policies promoting social distancing, e.g.: closures of schools and universities, remote work when possible, travel restrictions, public gatherings bans, amongst other measures. Additional measures hinge on early detection and isolation, contact tracing, and the use of personal protective equipment [21] . These measures have been referred to as non-pharmaceutical interventions and a number of studies have been performed in order to assess the effectiveness of these strategies.Perhaps some of the best known scientific reports coming out are the COVID-19 series produced by Imperial College. One of these is [4] , which then projected 510,000 deaths in Great Britain and 2.2 million in the United States of America, in the case of an unmitigated epidemic. The authors also projected alternative scenarios in which these numbers would be revised down to, respectively 250,000 deaths and 1.1-1.2 million. They also draw attention to the fact that there is a lag between the introduction of mitigation and the corresponding decrease in hospitalization cases. At the time, their work also strongly emphasized that even for their most optimistic scenario, the number of sick people would far outstrip the available hospital capacity.Subsequently, [5] presented an estimation of the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. This was done by using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact on 11 European countries. One of their key findings is that the decrease in the number of daily deaths being reported from Italy is in accordance with a significant impact from strict measures introduced weeks beforehand. The authors estimate that (i) between 7 and 43 million individuals, respectively 1.88% and 11.43% of the population, had been infected up to March 28th; and that (ii) 59,000 deaths had been averted through non-pharmaceutical interventions.In [6] the authors analyse different mortality scenarios, from the absence of mitigation measures to policies designed to suppress transmission. They estimate: (i) 7.0 billion infections and 40 million deaths without mitigation; (ii) 4.5 billion infections and 20 million deaths with mitigation strategies focused on protecting elderly groups and preserving social distancing; (iii) that healthcare systems would be unable to cope even in the latter scenario. Consequently, the work strongly emphasizes the need for public health measures leading to a reduction in transmission rates, in order to avoid the collapse of global health systems.A recent study proposed a fairly detailed dynamic model to describe the virus spread in China [7] . A drawback is that the model requires 12 parameters that are approximated from real-world data. We argue that such an approximation may lead to highly unreliable estimates given the poor quality and the reliability issues connected to the data made available. Regardless, their main findings, namely that R 0 quickly decreases with containment measures and that short quarantines do not suffice to stop the epidemics, hold true and do not depend on the quality of the data, see also [26] .A simpler SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model was applied to data from the UK and Italy [8] . The study suggests that (i) the epidemics originated at least a month before the first reported death and (ii) that two to three months of control measures would halt the epidemic. Although the former finding has been used to justify herd immunity strategies, that is hardly in keeping with the reported mortality rates worldwide. To illustrate the point, let us assume a mortality rate of 1% in the UK. Then, the reported figure of 167 deaths per million as of April 14 (e.g., worldometers.info), would suggest the contagion of approximately 1.67% of the population. Hence, while the models are useful to guide decision, a holistic and exhaustive analysis is needed to avoid biased assessments.A model-based analysis aimed at trying to predict mortality rates was described in [27] . The authors were able to produce age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Their findings also estimated the mean duration from symptoms onset to fatality to be 17.8 days, whilst time from symptoms to discharge was calculated as 24.7 days. The overall fatality rate was estimated at 1.38%. However, older age groups were more afflicted. Fatality increased to 6.4% among individuals aged 60 or older and reached 13.4% of those aged 80 or older.A study compiled and analyzed data from 1099 Chinese patients with confirmed diagnose of COVID-19 [28] . Patients most at risk of: (i) being admitted to an intensive care unit; (ii) requiring ventilator; or (iii) death included people aged 60 or older and also those with coexisting disorders such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular conditions, hepatitis B, cancer, chronic renal disease and compromised immune systems. Some authors have also attempted to correlate mortality rates to the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) childhood vaccination against tuberculosis [29] . The authors found a significant negative correlation between the establishment of universal BCG vaccination and mortality rate.After mitigating the first wave of the disease, the attention turns to finding efficient exit strategies [e.g., 26, 30, 31] . While it is perhaps consensual that a gradual and controlled exit strategy is to be preferred, gradual strategies require careful planning and coordination, as well as deft policy implementation. These attributes, however, may not be sufficient to avoid multiple waves that trigger cyclic on-off lock-down strategies [26] . Hence, a longterm analysis of multiple waves, as presented in Sect. 3, is essential; and it is particularly so when data is lacking and unreliable and policy making is uncoordinated, a scenario that renders multiple waves increasingly likely.Some works have investigated optimal lock-down release strategies in [30, 31] under different performance measures. Whilst the objective in [30] is to speed-up lockdown relaxation within the limits of the healthcare system, [31] suggests a function to model the compromise between healthcare and economic issues. We argue that the search for an adequate compromise in such a complex and multifaceted problem is a very challenging task in itself, which also involves policy making and societal issues. But it is beyond the scope of this article.Instead, we choose to model simple on-off policies to provide insight into the long-term management of multiple waves should such a management prove necessary. We start with simple on-off policies because they are simple and easy to understand and arguably easier to enforce. The choice is also practically motivated by our case study in Brazil, where mixed messages from the government response have been reported and the lack of compliance often meant that mild lock-down relaxations lead to uncontrolled spread of the disease. Such a reality renders the fall-back option of returning to full lock-down more likely than a conscious and coordinated strategy of gradual return to everyday activities.For the sake of completeness we also consider gradual lock-down release strategies in Sect. 3.1, inspired by the results in [30, 31] . Similarly to the on-off policies, they are designed to keep the utilisation of hospital beds within prescribed limits, enforcing full lockdown whenever an upper bound is reached and starting the release upon reaching a lower limit. The release, however, is gradual and proceeds with a prescribed linear or exponential rate. The results show that gradual release strategies tend to reduce the full-lockdown intervals, but they do not prevent multiple waves.Following the trend in the literature [e.g., 4, 5], we used the classical compartmental SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, removed) model to describe the virus spread. We argue that, given the uncertainty in the data, a simple but interpretable model can be more useful to provide insights for decision making. The proposed model considers a mean incubation period of 7 days [20] and a mean time to outcome (recovery or death) of 21 days, in line with [27] . We use SEIR instead of the simpler SIR model [8] because, in contrast to the latter, it includes the incubation period and allows us to replicate the delayed response to interventions in the system. To model the same spread, [32] employed a more detailed approach, whilst [8] made use of a simplified SIR model.In order to capture the long-term behaviour, we simulated the system for a period of two years. Figure 1 depicts the dynamics. Notice the steep increase in the infected population, characteristic of the pandemic. Observe also that the proportion of infected individuals peaks around 50% of the population, which would overload any health system in the world. The Brazilian health system has experienced a period of decreased investment and counts with around 2 hospital beds per thousand citizens [33] . To protect this system, some states in the federation are enforcing a lock-down strategy, albeit sometimes challenged by the federal government. This paper proposes a parametric on-off strategy whereby lock-down would be enforced when the number of hospitalisations due to the epidemic approaches the total number of hospital beds, and removed when the occupation recedes to a lower threshold. For the sake of simulation, we assume a hospitalisation rate of 10% [e.g., 27]. Hence, the lock-down and relaxation thresholds can be alternatively set in terms of the total number of infected patients. Our simulations do not consider the The first strategy is reported in Fig. 2 and corresponds to activating lock-down whenever the number of infections overcomes 1.5% of the population, which corresponds to an occupation of 1.5 beds per thousand inhabitants (75% of the beds). Conversely, the lockdown is relaxed when the bed occupation reaches 25%, or infection decreases below 0.5% of the population. Notice that after two years, nearly 40% of the population will have been infected and therefore be possibly immune. When one considers the results later described in Sect. 4, this also means the death of around one to three percent of the population (2.9% to 8% of the infected population). Figure 3 details the evolution of the infected and exposed populations. Observe that, even though the control policy is set for a 1.5% threshold, the number of infected individuals exceeds 2% in the peaks because exposed individuals become infected after the onset of the lock-down. Moreover, the peaks decrease over time, as the susceptible population goes down. Notice also that the lock-down periods alternate with comparatively small relaxation intervals. Figure 4 depicts the populations for a 50%-100% strategy. Lock-down is enforced when hospital beds are full and relaxed when less than half are occupied. With respect to the 25%-75% policy, we observe an increase in the infected population, with about 60% of the population being infected after two years. This is due to the increased occupation in the However, as detailed in Fig. 5 , the number of required beds is in excess of 3 per thousand inhabitants in the early peaks, signalling that a significant expansion of the health system would be needed. Another insight of the simulations is that the relaxations have to be carefully studied and the thresholds carefully calibrated in order to avoid the collapse of the health system.We expand our analysis by introducing gradual release policies with the same upper and lower threshold parameters as the on-off strategies. The difference here is that the release is gradual and can occur at a linear or exponential rate. For the sake of simulation, the linear release rate is set to 1 90 , meaning that total release would be achieved within three months. While the analysis is not intended to be exhaustive, it does provide insights regarding the long-term consequences of gradual releases. Specific analysis for local realities can be implemented making use of the R code provided as Additional file 1. Figure 6 depicts the dynamics resulting from the 25%-75% policy under linear release. Comparing with the corresponding on-off policy (Fig. 2) , we notice an increase in the length of periods between full lockdowns. This is to be expected since a gradual release implies lower transmission levels. Observe, however, that the gradual release does not avoid subsequent peaks that enforce full lock-downs; indeed, even though the level of release before the next full lockdown increases over time, it never substantially surpasses 50%. That may be due to the reduced hospital capacity. Figure 7 shows that the gradual release improves the quality of the control, reducing the infection peaks. Because the peaks are less pronounced, a lower percentage of people will have been infected at the end of two years-around 30% as opposed to 45% for the pure on-off strategy, see Figs. 2 and 6. It is worth reinforcing that, depending on the perceived compromise between economy and healthcare, either policy could be advocated. Figures 8-9 illustrate a linear release policy for 60% and 90% thresholds. Because of the increased hospital utilisation with respect to the last example, the number of infected (recovered) individuals at the end of the two-year window approaches 50%. Moreover, we also notice a more pronounced reduction in the length of the full lockdown intervals, with similar lock-down release levels over time.We also conducted tests with an exponential release with half life of 30 days, in which u(t) = 1e -0.231t-t 0 is the level of lock-down t units of time after the end of the last full lock-down (at t 0 ). The results are very similar to those of the corresponding linear release strategies and are omitted for the sake of brevity. The results seem to suggest that, regardless of the release strategies, cycles of lock-down and release may be necessary to curb the disease. Therefore, a careful analysis of such cycles is essential.The death toll due to COVID-19 in different scenarios is one of the most important quantities to forecast. It can be inferred from the number of infected individuals when the overall case fatality rate (CFR) is known. Unfortunately, the reported Brazilian CFR is not reliable, due in part to insufficient testing [15] . Bearing that in mind, we propose a model to predict the Brazilian CFR based on information acquired from COVID-19 data repositories worldwide.The proposed model utilises a committee of neural predictors, each with the architecture depicted in Fig. 10 . The committee is able to combine individual weak predictors in order to produce an improved overall regression [34] . Given the variation of the data, and considering the reliability issues surrounding multiple data sources, we use the median of the weak predictors to hedge against outliers [34, 35] . Figure 11 illustrates the committee strategy. This paper utilises a committee of N = 3 distinct regressors and the median operator. Thus, the final committee estimate y, from a set {y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N } of estimates (one for Figure 11 Block diagram of the proposed committee machine. Note that the combination step is the median operator, and that the confidence interval can be computed using variability statistics derived from the ""Model Selection"" procedure Indicator SourceHealthcare coverage LT / ILO x 4 Raised blood pressure LT / WHO x 5 Public trust in politicians LT / WEF x 6 Enforcement of regulations LT / WJP x 7 Population over age 65 (%) WBDI x 8 Fatalities of cardiovascular diseases (%) WHO each individual regressor) is computed from y = median{y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N }.( 1 )Note that the CFR strongly depends on several risk factors, which can be related to either individual or societal features. Among the former, one finds chronic medical conditions (especially diabetes [36] , cardio-cerebrovascular diseases [37] , hypertension [38] and respiratory system diseases [1] ), pregnancy [39] , obesity [40] and advanced age [38] . We can argue that social factors that influence the CFR have attracted less attention, although their impact cannot be dismissed as negligible. Among these factors, one may emphasise: shortage of medical protection in developing countries [41] , risk perception by the community [42] , political commitment to allocate resources in order to reduce disaster risks [43] , disaster risk governance [44] , appropriate allocation of humanitarian response and development activity [45] , participatory approaches that change risk management [46] , and institutional differences [47] . It is a challenging task to incorporate such factors in a regression model, mainly due to the absence of reliable metrics for the majority of countries that have experienced COVID-19 dissemination. Fortunately, there are some quantitative features available for the countries of interest that are correlated with the aforementioned factors (e.g., it is expected that the indicator ""Enforcement of regulations"", provided by the Legatum Institute, is correlated with institutional differences among different countries). Overall, a total of eight features (Table 1) were selected as inputs to the neural predictors, namely [48] :• Obesity: Percentage of the adult population who have obesity;• Smoking: Percentage of the 15+ population who currently smoke any tobacco product on a regular basis; • Healthcare coverage: Percentage of population without healthcare coverage, either through private insurance, or state-provided coverage (regardless of whether they are able to effectively access healthcare through that coverage); • Raised blood pressure: Percentage of the 18+ population with raised blood pressure; [1, 37, 38, 40] . The remaining features were chosen to try to incorporate societal dynamics that can impact healthcare services [41, 43, 44] . Variable x 5 was chosen given the large number of corruption scandals involving Brazilian politicians. As a consequence, there is a significant amount of mistrust among the Brazilian population regarding its politicians and their ability to effectively handle public-health crises. There is also the perceived notion that regulations are poorly enforced in Brazil (variable x 6 ), which is of significant importance in the context of a pandemic.Since some countries that present a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases often have distorted CFRs, the analysis has excluded countries whose number of COVID-19 cases is lower than 200. After this pruning procedure, 75 countries still remain (which does not take into account Brazilian data), resulting in the following matrix of input datawhere x(k) [x 1 (k) x 2 (k) · · · x 8 (k)] T contains the eight features of the k-th country (see Table 1 ). Since the available data is unreliable, a careful data processing should be performed to guarantee a robust CFR prediction for the Brazilian case. The first processing procedure is executed to enhance the neural network accuracy (and to speed up training) by reducing the internal co-variate characteristics of the data [49] . In this first step, each entry of the matrix X is manipulated in order to obtain a normalised matrixX, whose elements are computed aswhereμ i (resp.σ i ) is the average (resp. standard deviation) of the i-th row of X. The chosen neural regressor is the logistic feed-forward neuron, whose output, for a set of adjustable Figure 12 Ilustration of the k-fold procedure. In this paper, the performance is evaluated from the computation of the mean absolute error between the estimated CFR and the one computed from WOI data parameters w i , ∀i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m}, is described aswherex i,j is distinct fromx i,j because of the feature extraction procedure. For a specific number m of principal components, there exists the respective neural estimate y m (j). Note that the neural regressor presents m + 1 weights, since it also has a bias parameter. Because the neural architecture contains only one neuron, it is mathematically equivalent to the standard logistic regression. Feature extraction is an advisable step due to the insufficient number of training samples to enforce proper constraints in the neural network parameters; the desired estimation is considered a mathematical ill-posed problem [50] . This implies that over-fitting issues should be mitigated. One tool used for this purpose is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which aims to obtain the most compact representation of a high-dimensional dataset in terms of the least square reconstruction error [51] . Loosely speaking, it can be described as an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction technique that presents robust feature extraction properties [51] . The number m of principal components was selected by k-fold cross validation (a kind of model selection technique), in which the data set instances are randomly divided into k disjoint folds with approximately equal size, and every fold is in turn used to test the model trained from the remaining k -1 folds [52] , as depicted in Fig. 12 . The proposed committee regressor utilises the three neural regressors (each with a specific number m of principal components) that obtain the better performance in the set of 75 countries (which does not include Brazilian data). Using k = 10 folds and training the neural networks with the backpropagation algorithm under the mean quadratic error cost function, the mean absolute error (MAE) for each number of principal components is presented in Table 2 . The MAE represents the mean absolute error computed by the differences between current CFR data for each country (obtained from WOI a ) and the CFR estimated by a regressor. Algorithm 1 presents a pseudocode of the procedure that evaluates the MAE for a specific number m of principal components and assuming k folds in the k-fold cross validation.Observe that architectures with one to three principal components perform better. These are selected in our study and provide the estimates in Table 3 . Observe that the point-wise estimate (i.e., obtained from the median of the estimates) of the neural committee for the Brazilian CFR is CFR = 0.029. Due to data inaccuracies and to the large differences in the estimated losses in human lives, the variability of such an estimate should be taken into account. In this context, it is more appropriate to adopt a prediction interval, which depends on the variability of the estimator. Since such a variability can be estimated by the k-fold cross-validation, one may compute the upper bound CFR α up of a confidence interval of α% [53] . Such an upper bound is CFR 68.27 up = 0.0545 (resp. CFR 95 up = 0.0799) for a confidence interval of 68.27% (resp. 95%). The median prediction is in line with the official statistics as of April 14 2020 (5.7%-www.worldometers.info). This suggests that either (i) the underreporting in death cases is similar to the underreporting in the overall cases, or (ii) the testing and reporting biases are captured by the selected variables in the model.The weights with respect to each feature of the first principal components are described in Table 4 . Such a table shows that variables x 3 , x 4 and x 6 (i.e., healthcare coverage, raised blood pressure and enforcement of regulations) have more relevance in the first three prin- cipal components, which indicates that they incorporate important information about the profile of each country. The eigenvalues of the PCA decomposition are shown in Table 5 , which reveals the energy concentration in the first three principal components.Given the wide assortment of afflictions currently plaguing public available data over COVID-19, it is a challenging task to make reliable predictions concerning the spread and lethality of COVID-19. Consequently, data may be inaccurate and must be utilized with caution, which restricts the reliability of forecasting models constructed with them. It was already demonstrated that an inaccurate confirmed-case data induces nonidentifiability in the model calibrations, which helps to explain the wide range of forecasting variations [54] . For example, underreporting mild cases implies a reduction on the mortality rate [42, 55] . Unfortunately, such inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases are a serious problem, which might sabotage the mitigation of its harmful effects and complicate the outbreak response [56] . Additional uncertainties derive from the fact that key characteristics of the transmissibility of COVID-19 (such as whether its transmission can occur before symptom onset) are currently unknown [57] . Yet, despite the apparent gaps in knowledge, it is still possible to gain invaluable insight. Namely, by combining the existing SEIR model with on/off lock-down policies one can see that the impact of the virus will be spread through multiple waves of decreasing amplitude. The results suggest that this trend persists even if the lock-down release is gradual. Such a scenario would effectively mean that there would exist multiple waves requiring flattening over time, in the absence of effective medication, an appropriate vaccine or the development of herd immunity.Current epidemiological models such as SEIR are relatively simple, but robust prediction is dependent on reliable data. As a result, we developed a neural regressor that considers features that the current literature also deems as important factors in the fatality rate of COVID-19. This allows for non-linear extrapolations. Again, the issue of data unreliability surfaces. Through careful data processing alongside PCA and k-fold cross validation we believe that it is possible to obtain a more robust CFR prediction for Brazil, and possibly for countries with similar characteristics.The following is a set of highlights of our paper:• COVID-19 analysis focused on Brazil;• COVID-19 SEIR Model with on / off lockdown strategy analysis • Neural regressor with features that clinical studies present strong corroboration with COVID-19 fatality rate.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-020-00098-w.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-06",1

On January 30, 2020, the WHO declares that the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of international importance. On March 11, 2020, it is declared a global pandemic, given the high spread of the virus worldwide.On June 15, 2020, internationally, there are already 216 countries reporting cases of COVID-19, with a total of 7,805,148 confirmed cases and 431,192 deaths.The virus was confirmed to have reached Chile in March 2020 (Garrison, 2020) . As of 11 June 2020, Chile has the third largest number of cases in South America and in Latin America, after Brazil and Peru. While the number of fatalities has been lower than other countries in the region, even with fewer cases declared, the number of cases and fatalities have increased constantly since May 2020 (Garrison, 2020) .COVID-19 is a global public health crisis of a scale not previously experienced in modern times (Kickbusch et al., 2020) . Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption (Nicola et al., 2020) . It has led to the postponement or cancelation a lot of events (Deb et al., 2020) . Widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying (Scipioni, 2020) . Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 177 countries (UNESCO, 2020) .Some countries were put under mandatory quarantine due to an increase of cases. Quarantine involves the restriction of movement, or separation from the rest of the population, of healthy persons who may have been exposed to the virus, with the objective of monitoring their symptoms and ensuring early detection of cases (WHO, 2020b) . Quarantine is different from isolation, which is the separation of ill or infected persons from others to prevent the spread of infection or contamination (UNICEF, 2020) . This quarantine and/or isolation has had a substantive societal impact that permeates almost every facet of daily life (Gostin and Wiley, 2020; Shanafelt et al., 2020) . These widespread changes represent considerable sources of stress in the population and will have deleterious effects on mental and physical health going forward (Hagger et al., 2020) .The health threat posed by the COVID-19, and concerns about its effects on family, friends, and age group, denotes a substantive source of stress itself (Hagger et al., 2020) . This stress arising from the pandemic and associated lockdown measures is likely to be prolonged even after the threat of the virus has passed (Hagger et al., 2020) .The prolonged exposure to stress arising from the crisis is likely to have insidious long-term health effects including increased risk of physical (e.g., chronic disease risk) and mental (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder) (Gonzalez, 2020; Hagger et al., 2020) .An increase in symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety are already being reported in several countries in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic Rajkumar, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xiao, 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) . These researches indicate that the prevalence of depression is about 38%. Furthermore, it has been determined that the psychological analysis that measure the level of anxiety and emotionality shows that 71.5% of population has anxiety symptoms.Anxiety is a normal reaction to uncertainty and things that may harm us (Grupe and Nitschke, 2013) . However, too much anxiety can start to cause harm. Feeling stressed and fearful every day takes a toll on health and well-being very quickly (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020a,b) .According to stress theory and perceived risk theory (Norris et al., 2002) , public health emergencies trigger more negative emotions and affect cognitive assessment as well. It is widely accepted that emotional states disturb people's behavior but not always in the same way (Garaigordobil and Berrueco, 2007; Esnaola et al., 2008; Dave et al., 2011) , examining age differences in responses to population-wide stressors may shed light on important theoretical questions about differences in emotional experience and emotion regulation (Carstensen et al., 2020) .There is substantial evidence that, on balance, older people's daily emotional experience is more positive than younger people's (Carstensen et al., 2011; Burr et al., 2020) . However, it is unclear whether this relatively positive emotional profile reflects improved regulation of experienced emotions or the active avoidance of environments that elicit negative emotions (Carstensen et al., 2020) .Extensive theoretical work has been devoted to explaining these widely documented age associations with emotional wellbeing. Some theories suggest that age-related advantages reflect the avoidance of stressors (Charles et al., 2009; Carstensen et al., 2020) , while others maintain that age advantages are driven by motivational shifts that direct cognitive and behavioral resources to positive and meaningful aspects of life (Carstensen et al., 2011) .The literature on it suggests that differential emotion processing is a predeterminate mode of processing that emerges across adulthood and involves minimal cognitive effort in directing attention to positive elements of life (Allard et al., 2010) .In one research, Charles et al. (2009) detected that older people experienced less affective reactivity than younger people when they were able to avoid stressful or tense interactions. In the same way, Birditt et al. (2011) found that older people tend to use avoidant coping strategies in response to negative experiences, such as ignoring the problem or doing nothing, and less likely to use direct-negative strategies such as arguing or yelling than younger people.An important unresolved issue is whether age-related gains in emotional experience rest principally on avoiding stressors or whether other factors; for example, if some people oldest or younger are more or less emotional, or if this effect depending of other factors (biopsychosocial) (Poon and Cohen-Mansfield, 2011) .The analysis of these aspects would be of fundamental importance at the time of planning treatment to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, its restrictions and consequences. This is because they are positively associated with self-esteem, wellbeing, satisfaction with life, social contact, and negatively with social anhedonia (Gross and John, 2003) . Furthermore, their deficits have been found to be associated with depression (Sloan et al., 2001) , and post-traumatic stress disorder (Tull et al., 2007) . If these aspects are ignored, these can hinder and interfere with the success of the treatment, which certainly creates a need of conducting researches with different methodologies useful to give an account of the presence and relations among these different variables.On the other hand, research over the past two decades shows that culture and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race, education) have an important influence in experiencing, expressing and labeling emotions (Hofstede, 1983; Matsumoto, 1993) . Emotional expressiveness may vary by several sociodemographic characteristics. Different studies on culture (Pennebaker et al., 1996; Basabe et al., 2000) have found gender differences in the frequency of emotional expressiveness. It is very common to find that women tend to report more emotional expressiveness and negative affections than men (Almeida and Kessler, 1998) . However, this would depend on the social and/or race differences of the people, since it has been shown that there seems to be a normative system of rules for emotional display according to the upbringing and education of each person.Given the importance of emotional aspects in the life of the individual, the present study categorized as relevant, to clarify the presence of emotional aspects such as emotional expressiveness and the frequency of positive and negative affections in people with different age in the time of COVID-19, considering gender as a covariate, to control its effect on the emotional response of the participants.This investigation addressed the following questions:(1) Are there age differences in the types of reactions reported in the time of COVID-19? (2) Can age together with the frequency of positive or negative affections predict emotional expression?This is cross-sectional study that involves looking at data from a population at one specific point in time.The data was collected between April and May 2020, the sample was composed of 297 adults recruited trough via study advertisements in the internet, e-mail, and recommendations by previous participants in other researches. Participants were informed on the objectives and procedures of this study, and it was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their written informed consent before being included in the recruitment phase and completed all the measures in the survey.The sample consisted of 74 men (24.9%) and 223 women (75.1%). Age ranged from 22 to 68 years, with a mean age of 38.51 years (SD = 13.85). Table 1 presents the participants characteristics.Emotional Expressiveness (EE) is understood as the ability of people to express their emotional states in observable behaviors (Kring et al., 1994) . It was measured using the Spanish version of the Emotional Expressivity Scale (EES) made by Kring et al. (1994) . It consists of 17 items intended to measure the apparent show of emotions regardless of the valence (positive or negative) and the channel (vocal, facial, gestural) used to express them. The response format is Likert-type, with a response option from 1 (totally disagree) to 4 (totally agree) and it is corrected in an inverse manner. A higher score indicates higher expression. This inventory has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.910 (Kring et al., 1994 ). In the current study, the inventory has shown a Cronbach's alpha of 0.712.Affect is regarded as a psychological construct that refers to mental states involving evaluative feelings (e.g., feeling good-bad, liking-disliking a situation) (Parkinson et al., 1996) . The affective experience has two dominant dimensions, namely, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) (Watson et al., 1984) . PA and NA have been described as two independent unipolar dimensions of affect that include all the affective states with a positive valence (joy, enthusiasm, crush, etc.) or a negative valence (anger, fear, anxiety, etc.) (Bradburn, 1969) . To assess PA and NA was using the Spanish version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) by Watson et al. (1988) . PANAS contains 12 items on two subscales that assess a person's positive and negative trait affect. The response format is Likert-type, with a response option from 1 (very slightly or not at all), to 5 (extremely). The total score achieved is obtained by adding the response values assigned to each item on one and the other scale, respectively. A higher score indicates higher frequency and/or intensity of positive and negative emotions, while a lower score shows less frequency and/or intensity of the emotions experienced as positive or negative. Both the original validation (Watson et al., 1988) and the Spanish validation (Díaz et al., 2020) showed two clearly differentiated factors (PA and NA) and good psychometric properties. In the current study, the inventory has shown a Cronbach's alpha of 0.826.Participants reported their date of birth that was categorized into two groups: 0 (below 30 years old); 1 (over 30 years old).It was divided into these groups because since from the age of 30 a stage begins in which important changes are generated in people, the interdependent personal and work roles governed by society and the opportunities that these give each person.The data was got using an online survey distributed by e-mail to the group of people who responded to the invitation or who wanted to participate in the study. Participants were informed on the objectives and procedures of this study. The confidentiality and anonymity of their data was guaranteed, and they were asked to sign the informed consent, read the instructions, and respond to the scales. Participation in the study was voluntary.The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their written informed consent before being included in the recruitment phase and completed all the measures in the survey.IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 in tandem with Python programming language version 2.7, Scikit-Learn version 0.23.1, and JupyterLab version 1.0 web-based development environment were used to analyze data.First, descriptive analysis was performed, and normal distribution of variables was confirmed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive analysis was performed, including frequencies, means, standard deviation, to examine the distribution of scores, the need for recoding and to evaluate the performance of the scales in terms of reliability.The differences between means were tested by Independent ANOVA. To determine the association between variables, regression was calculated. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the average score.Emotional expressiveness descriptors: the sample has a greater tendency to avoid emotions rather than showing them, based on the scores obtained (see Table 2 ).Descriptors of positive and negative affections: the sample has a greater tendency to have a higher frequency of negative states rather than positive, based on the average of the scores obtained (see Table 2 ). Table 3 Multivariate regression analysis showed that age, positive affection, negative affection, and gender were significantly related to showing emotions, predicting the 10.8% of total variance (adjusted R 2 = 0.108, F = 9.60, p < 0.001) on scores of showing emotions. Age, negative affection, and gender emerged as predictors (p < 0.05). Table 5 shows the final multiple regression model.There was an interaction between age group, the number of negative affection and gender when predicting showing emotions.To detect multicollinearity, variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated. As a result, the VIF between the variables was less than 10 (see Table 5 ). There was no collinearity among the included variables in the regression model (Wood, 1984) .A second, multivariate regression analysis showed that age, affective affection, negative affection and gender were significantly related to avoidance showing emotions, predicting the 16.50% of total variance (adjusted R 2 = 0.165, F = 15.60, p < 0.001) on scores of showing emotions. Age, positive affection and negative affection emerged as predictors (p < 0.05). Table 6 shows the final multiple regression model.There was an interaction between age, the number of negative and positive affections when predicting showing emotions.The emotional aspect related to age has not been sufficiently and widely studied. The experience and minimization of negative emotional reactions in the time of COVID-19 may have differences, specially by age. Indeed, how individuals respond emotionally may be an important piece of the puzzle regarding age differences in the links between emotional expressiveness and frequency of negative or positive affection. This study found age differences in the emotional expressiveness and frequency of negative affections. Regarding the emotional expressiveness, people over 30 years old express less avoidance of their emotions than those below 30 years old. At the same time, they seem to be able to express themselves. These results provide evidence that emotional health and regulation can improve with age (Burr et al., 2020), which teaches that not only physical but mental well-being can be maintained during the pandemic. In this study, older people appear to be more likely to express their emotions, perhaps as a way to control negative emotional reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, since some of them correspond to the most vulnerable population with the highest number of risk factors, which can aggravate the prognosis of the disease. As a result, coping with stress would be a mostly perceptual process, from which strategies are generated according to individual needs in a variety of situations that the person may be experiencing (Lazarus and Folkman, 1986; Walker et al., 2004) . Furthermore, according to positive existential psychology (Wong, 2009 (Wong, , 2011 , this finding reflect how COVID-19 can be an opportunity to perceive that life implies constantly fighting in a world full of obstacles, where the only way to survive is to transform those variables seen as weaknesses and turn them into an advantage for personal growth.People over 30 years old reported more negative emotion and more positive emotion in their current lives. This finding is not similar to those studies conducted before the pandemic (Allard et al., 2010; Reed et al., 2014) . It seems that the wellbeing of younger people is more associated with the minimization of negative emotional reactions (Charles et al., 2009) . Although there is no evidence of an age improvement in emotion understanding due to increased experience in interpreting emotional cues (Phillips et al., 2002) . Future research should examine the negative emotional and behavioral reactions of young people to see if the pandemic is not affecting them emotionally or if its long-term effect will only be seen.Gender turned out to be a covariate that plays a role in predicting the expression of emotions but not in the avoidance of this emotional expression. This result is consistent with what is stated in the studies consulted (Hofstede, 1983; Matsumoto, 1993) , in which gender has a role in understanding emotional expression. However, future studies should continue to deepen the study of this variable to further understand its influence, especially when it is combined with other individual variables.It should be noticed that the low values of the regression weights obtained in both models question the assumption that they might be really sustained. That is why it is recommended to replicate the study using a larger sample or to review the different instruments measuring the positive and negative affections since the obtained results might be due to the managed conceptualization in the instrument used to measure that variable in this research.Furthermore, future research should include children and adolescents to know what happens in those age ranges, taking into account that previous research suggests that during these ages, differences in emotional expressivity are more visible (Birditt and Fingerman, 2005; Birditt et al., 2011) . This should be considered, especially now that we are facing a pandemic for the first time experienced and we cannot yet measure its effect on the emotional health of children and young people.Due to the above, the provided empiric evidence in this research is the first step and should be complemented by other studies to expand the studied sample in each age group in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the obtained findings allow us to conclude that the emotional variables should be included in any treatment. Which would help to better understand in times of crisis, the interaction of both positive and negative life experiences to achieve optimal well-being and mature happiness.Several limitations of the study should be considered. The first of these is the cross-sectional design of this study. Future longitudinal or prospective studies in this area could help to elucidate the potential role of age in conjunction with other uncontrolled sociodemographic variables, such as profession, occupation, socioeconomic level. This will help prevent emotional disturbances and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after COVID-19. Secondly, this study was based on self-report measures through an online survey and, therefore, the results are subject to possible participant response bias. In third place, the sample size was small, this decreased the statistical power of the statistical study. A larger sample size is needed in future research to include more data to verify the results obtained. Fourth, it is recommended to reproduce the study including younger populations in order to generalize the results found to other sectors of the population. Lastly, it would be advisable to replicate the present studies in international samples in order to generalize the results found, as well as to make comparisons.Despite its limitations, the findings of this research shed light on the ways in which age and emotional expressiveness are related to mental health in the time of COVID-19. People's capacity and maintenance of well-being can be improved by paying attention to strategies that promote emotional expressiveness in their coping styles. Similarly, the results reinforce the importance of being resilient, and how this variable could explain that older people face a reality of real physical and emotional risks for them, to turn it rather into a moment of overcoming (Apter, 2020) .In summary, the results obtained not only represent a contribution to the therapeutic work and to the participation of the psychologist in post-COVID-19 clinical treatments, but will also allow to contribute to reinforcing the study of positive existential psychology as a post-pandemic science.The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

First-wave mitigation strategies were largely decentralized, and the majority of governmental interventions occurred by local actions taken by the 26 states and the federal district, and their 5,570 municipalities (6, 7) . Still, mitigation efforts were inadequate to keep SARS-CoV-2 transmission under control, and the collapse of health services was described throughout the country, which probably influenced the number of fatal outcomes observed to date (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Even though in some areas of the country a very high level of infection was reached, such as the city of Manaus with an attack rate of 76% (13) , this was insufficient to prevent new waves of infection, confirming that herd immunity is not a feasible or ethical route to tackle COVID- 19 (14, 15) . Thus, it is a concrete possibility that subsequent epidemic waves could, once again, pose a heavy burden on health services with consequent loss of lives, in line with the recrudescence of transmission observed in many countries, possibly boosted by the resuming of many economic and social activities.Mathematical models have played a key role in assessing the effectiveness of public health policies and NPIs to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and how it is impacted by the movement of people (2, 7, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .However, the bridging of model outputs to governmental actions aimed at reducing mobility is limited by the inherent uncertainties surrounding the obtained estimates, interpretation difficulties by policy-makers, and the lack of full understanding of a model's predictive capabilities and limitations (21) .Accordingly, control algorithms coupled to epidemiological models provide an intuitive means to derive health policies and NPIs from data (22) (23) (24) (25) . By drawing on the availability of widespread mobility traces from cell phones, and building on the premise that circulation of individuals is a chief contributing factor for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (26) , here we report an adaptive Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy able to reliably predict an optimal level of governmental interventions to decrease mobility, considering different degrees of social mobility effects, that reduces cases and fatalities and keeps hospitalization requirements below their limits while averting the unnecessary extension of restrictive measures such as lock-downs. We applied the NMPC algorithm to study the disease dynamics in Bahia, the largest and most populous state of Northeast Brazil, with territorial extension comparable to that of France. This framework, however, could be adaptable to deploy in multiple settings and can be particularly useful to other developing nations, which lack the purchasing power of high-income countries to benefit from early vaccine access (27) , and thus will probably have to coexist with the pandemic effects for longer.Considering the large territory and population of Bahia (Fig. S1 ), the COVID-19 dynamics in this state is comparable to that of a whole country. On March 6, the first case was registered in the state, roughly one week after the first confirmed case in the country. By September 15, a total of 285,448 cases had been confirmed, of which 6,040 resulted in deaths. On March 16, the state government established a set of measures to mitigate the transmission. They were implemented and partially eased during the period, primarily targeting specific regions rather than the entire state. Most adopted interventions are related to the restrictions of public events and closure of schools/universities . We note that, more detailed information about each government measure is discussed by Jorge et al. (7) and described in table S1.Initially, we assessed whether there existed a relationship between the extent of government policies and mobility patterns. For this, the stringency index (u), and the social mobility reduction index (SMRI) were used, respectively, as proxies to measure the ""strength"" of the public policies and the consequent degree of population compliance (Fig. 1) . The SMRI had a baseline average of 28.5% (February 1-28). In what followed, six characteristic temporal states were identified: 1) March 6-15: community transmission had been declared in the state, but no governmental measure had been established (stringency u = 0; average SMRI = 30.9%;2) March 16-20: initial measures were set in place (u = 33.7%; average SMRI = 34.4%); To reproduce the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Bahia, under the previous described social behavior and governmental interventions, we applied the SEIIHURD+ model with all gains g i = 1 in supplementary equations (1a) to (1h). A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed, allowing identification of key parameters governing the dynamics of this system (detailed in Supplementary Text).Seeking to improve the forecast accuracy of the SEIIHURD+ model without compromising the epidemiological parameters, the gains g i vary every 13 days, which is consistent with the infection dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (and could provide enough days for the validation tests). As an exception, the transmission parameter may change in time, that is, the gain g 1 is allowed to change within the 13 days windows. In particular, when the internal model also has g i = 1, the results refer to a nominal case analysis. The main goal in the identification stage is to adapt the model fit by assuming that the input data series may suffer interference from several factors, such as case under-ascertainment and underreporting, as well as notification delays (29) .An optimal control guide for public health interventions Next, we combined the SEIIHURD+ model with a predictive control algorithm in order to determine an optimal level of social mobility and governmental measures that would allow a reduction in cases and fatalities and preserve clinical and ICU bed occupancy rates below their limits. We note that the operation of this control algorithm is periodic, in such a way that new public health measures are determined every week, in line with the accurate short-term projections produced by the model. Also, many local governments now rely on multi-phased approaches to ease or increase the level of measures, usually based on objective metrics such as occupation of hospitals, R t , and trajectory dynamics of cases (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Consequently, our strategy can also support the periodic re-calibration of stringency in phased reopening strategies to minimize the chances of surges.High and low compliance scenarios were considered by adjusting supplementary equation (11) , which provides the mathematical relation between u and , evaluated on the historical data presented in Fig. 1 Another important factor to weigh is how stringent governments are willing to be in imposing control policies. While some countries opted for more liberal approaches to tackle COVID-19, such as Sweden, which relied mostly on responsible behavior, others maintained very strict curfews for extended periods (eg. Argentina) (35) . A reasonable goal should be to keep the health care system below its capacity level, albeit our algorithm permits tuning the parameter Q to make stringency (u(t)) more or less flexible, which ultimately impacts economic sectors and social behavior. Therefore, from March 6 to May 15 we assume Q = 8 · 10 4 , from May 16 to August 23 we set Q = 3 · 10 4 and from August 24 to October 15 Q = 1 · 10 4 . An analysis of this parameter's variation and its effect on future predictions is given in Figs. S5 and S6.Finally, comparing the control framework results with the unfolded local scenario, we note that the proposed control algorithm is able to maintain the clinical and ICU bed occupancy below the thresholds of available beds, reduce the total number of infection and deaths, while keeping approximately the same level of applied measures.In this work, we introduced a framework for optimizing the required levels of public health policies, that translate into variable social distancing effects, during an unfolding pandemic.This tool combines control theory, parameter identification, and nonlinear dynamic modeling to optimize the level of governmental measures according to human behavior, in terms of mobility patterns, during a pandemic. We extend and validate a compartmental mathematical model (9) that describes the dynamic of symptomatic and asymptomatic/non-detected cases, deaths, and health service requirements, considering the temporal influence of social mobility. By evaluating the effects of social distancing measures enacted locally, we provide a mathematical relationship between interventions and the degree of compliance of the population, measured by the reduction in people's mobility. We embedded this model in an adaptive control algorithm that can help set policy targets such as the maintenance, heightening or lifting of NPIs (Fig. 4) . The utility of this approach is illustrated by studying the dynamics of COVID-19 in Bahia, Brazil, which offered opportunities for an enhanced control of the epidemic (Fig. 5) . However, the method is simple and versatile and can be deployed to the analysis of other infectious diseases in other populations, predicting the level of required measures with accuracy. A benefit of this approach is that the levels of predicted stringency can be fine-tuned to adjust to the fragilities of the targeted population and the government capabilities to implement a measure, which can depend on multiple factors including the availability of local resources and political stability.We used Bahia, Brazil as a proxy of an area with a large population, limited health infrastructure, and stark socioeconomic inequalities. First, we performed a pre-assessment to reproduce the dynamics of COVID-19 in the state from March 6 to September 15, 2020. By leveraging the real-world levels of locally implemented measures with the observed social mobility patterns in this period, our control algorithm identified optimal time windows where the measures and high level of population response (such as that observed at the beginning of the epidemic in the state) can be applied with different magnitudes. In this scenario, the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations could have been averted by nearly 64%, and the population would have benefited with more extended periods of relaxation of social distancing measures through the enforcement of periodic interventions, which others have shown lead to improved transmission control (36) (37) (38) , while alleviating the multiple deleterious facets of prolonged human confinements. Such an achievement can be strategically combined to reduce the impact on the health system and on the economy. In contrast, our findings highlight the importance of widespread adherence to enforced measures. In a scenario of low popular compliance, governments are forced to increase the level of measures to protect the health care system from collapsing. The results in Bahia show that a low compliance could lead to double the number of cases and deaths, and the accompanying collapse of the healthcare system would be inevitable. This is particularly important when planning measures in less developed countries, where poverty is associated with low education levels and, consequently, difficulties in realizing the importance of actions aimed at controlling spread of the virus (39, 40) . More vigorous levels of stringency could further decrease the transmission rates; however, the economic effects of prolonged curfews cannot be ignored.Deploying this strategy in other settings would require, in addition to the local epidemiological data used during the calibration of part of the model's parameters (28) , more details of the population's compliance to measures, as our results point that the level of adherence can markedly influence the dynamics of COVID-19 spread, and these may vary by factors such as education level and degree of individual freedom across countries. Consequently, identical levels of stringency may evoke different behavioral responses according to the compliance of each individual and their emerging collective attitudes-ie. people's actions, including health behavior, are subject to multiple psychological factors and motivations (42, 43) , herein modeled as high and low compliant populations. However, the compartmental model that serves as the basis for the dynamics of contagion is general enough to be readily used in other regions, while also being adaptable to other disease domains.Figs S1-S8 Tables S1-S5","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-31",1

It manages the donation, transplant, and waiting list records for the entire country under the current regulations 4, 5 .Based on hospital availability and the adoption of protection measures for the patient and medical personnel, it was determined to continue with the transplantation activity in our country.The present study seeks to evaluate the initial experience of this measure in terms of infection and mortality. The variables that were analyzed included age, gender, district of residence, socioeconomic status, health social security system regimen, blood group, medical history and pre-existing conditions, type of organ transplanted or to be transplanted, main diagnosis, date of onset of symptoms, consultation and diagnosis, test result for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, management center, severity of the disease, vital status, and the date of death.The severity of the disease was defined as mild for patients who were treated at home, moderate for patients who required hospitalization, and severe for those who were admitted to an intensive care unit.For the statistical analysis, the quantitative variables were described through measures of central tendency and dispersion, and the qualitative variables through absolute and relative frequencies. The first analysis examined the characteristics of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. A subgroup analysis was later performed considering transplant recipients and patients on the waiting list. Finally, the cases of death due to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection were analyzed. For these cases, the mean number of days from the onset J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 of symptoms to diagnosis and to the date of death was calculated. Since a multivariate analysis was precluded by the lack of a complete medical record, a relationship between basic information provided by the database and mortality was searched for with a relative risk (RR), an attributable risk (AR), and an attributable risk percent (AR%). The difference in the number of positive cases between the transplant recipients and patients on the waiting list was analyzed by the chi-square test and the difference in mortality between the two groups was analyzed using the Fisher's exact test, considering a p-value of less than 0.05 as significant. The analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and Epidat software.This retrospective study used information from secondary sources, without intervention or modification of the biological, physiological, psychological, or social variables of the participating individuals. Therefore, the study was classified as a ""risk-free"" investigation as established in Resolution 8430 in 1993, by the Ministry of Health. The data from the INS RedDataINS©, SIVIGILA and SISMUESTRAS information systems were analyzed maintaining their validity.The confidentiality of the information was protected according to the established guidelines and current regulations applicable to the National Donation and Transplant Network 4,5 .As on the cut-off date for enrolment in the study (July 31, 2020), 11,034 patients were registered Of the 158 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, 13.3% (n=21) died of causes related to this disease. Of these, 57.1% (n=12) were transplant recipients, which represents a mortality of 14.3% (12/84) for this group. 42.9% (n=9) of the deceased were on the waiting list, which corresponds to a mortality of 12.2% (9/74) in this group. There were no differences in the rate of mortality between transplant recipients and patients on the waiting list (p=0.8980). had diabetes and dyslipidemia. The RR estimated between the mortality among those with transplantation and those on the waiting list and hypertension was 3.4 (95% CI: 3.13 -3.77) and higher than dyslipidemia (RR: 2.18, 95% CI: 2.05 -2.29) or diabetes (RR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.3 -1.47). The AR estimated for hypertension was 10.5% higher than those for patients with other comorbidities, and the AR% estimates that 71% of the mortality among this group is attributable to hypertension and 29% to other causes.There were no differences in the variables analyzed between on both groups (Error! Reference source not found.).The longest period since transplant was 9 years and 8 months, and the shortest period was 7 months. 11 deceased transplant recipients had a history of high blood pressure, 2 had diabetes and high blood pressure, and 3 had dyslipidemia and high blood pressure. Additionally, 1 patient had a history of smoking, 5 had A-positive blood group and 5 were O-positive.The kidney transplant recipients who died from COVID-19 required hospitalization on an average at 2 days after the onset of symptoms, with a minimum of one day and a maximum of 5 days. They died on an average of 12 days after the onset of symptoms, with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 33 days. In general, immunosuppressed patients are at a higher risk of infection, especially during the first year after transplant. The most common viral infections during this period are those caused by cytomegalovirus and polyomavirus BK 7 . Therefore, in the context of a pandemic, the first step was to define whether inducing an immunosuppressed state could increase the risk of infection by COVID-19, while at the same time assessing the impact of this infection in terms of mortality. The best information available at that time was the Spanish waiting list and transplant registry. In a series of 1,314 patients, it was reported that the infection rate was lower in transplant recipients who could be confined to their homes during quarantine, compared to patients who had to continue to travel to dialysis units (hemodialysis in centers, 63% versus transplant recipients, 33%). Moreover, the mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was lower among transplant recipients (21.6%) compared to that in the dialysis patients (27.1%) 8 . 9 more severe course of the disease; however, the possible protective effects of immunosuppressive therapy and a milder presentation of the COVID-19 disease are being discussed without much clarity 10, 11 . To date, there are no known reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between organ donors and recipients 10,12,13 .Since the transplant procedures are non-elective as they depend on the availability of a donor, organizations dealing with organ donation and transplant explored mechanisms to continue with their activities.In Colombia, from the declaration of the pandemic until July 31, 2020, there were on an average 2,920 patients on the waiting list for a solid organ transplant; hence, continuing with the transplant services was a challenge for the entire healthcare system. Therefore, the next step was to define a safe method to perform the organ extraction and transplant procedures. The The mortality in our study population was three times higher than that of the general population in Colombia (3.4% versus 13.3%), probably due to the higher number of comorbidities in these patients. However, this mortality was lower than that reported in previous studies among the transplant recipients in other countries, which might be related to the measures adopted in the At the cut-off date used in this study, 31% of the infected patients, including transplant/waiting list, were confirmed as recovered. In other studies among this population, the percentage of recovery was highly variable, ranging from 33% to 80%, since it is dependent on the stage of the pandemic in each country at the time of the report 11 .Globally, several countries have reported a decrease in transplant procedures due to the pandemic. According to the INS, as of July 2020, there was a 44.3% decrease in organ transplants from brain dead donors in Colombia, especially between March and May, when a strict quarantine was implemented due to the health emergency, in addition to other measures.This impacted the detection of potential donors, especially from cases of traumatic injury, and there was a high prevalence of positive cases in intensive care units 16 .In the case of living donors, unlike in European countries that restricted the procedures involving live donors due to the congestion of their units, many groups in Colombia continued this activity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 since it had variables that were easier to control for both, the donor and the recipient. There was a decrease of 13% in this activity in the country 16 .The results as of July 31, 2020 in Colombia were in conformance with the results from Europe, with a statistically lower incidence of infection of 1.03% (84/8,108) in transplant recipients compared to 2.52% (74/2,926) in patients on the waiting list, who were mostly (94.6%) dialysis patients who probably could not comply with a strict quarantine due to this condition.Due to the higher risk of infection in the transplant population, this group of patients has probably adopted stricter self-isolation and care measures compared to those by the general population, which might also be related to the ongoing education of transplant patients and their families for prevention of infections. Studies in the other countries have shown that kidney transplant patients have modified their behavior, and more than 95% were in isolation at home, thus reducing the risk of infection 17 .The percentage of tests performed in this study was higher in patients on the waiting list than in the transplant recipients, possibly because of the higher risk to which they were exposed due to their dialysis visits. Until the completion of this study, the dialysis units did not have a protocol for periodic assessment of their patients and the indication for testing was based on symptoms or close contacts. However, this higher testing in patients on the waiting list could play a role on the higher infection rate among this group. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among transplant recipients in Colombia is lower than expected. The study's cut-off date possibly corresponds to the peak of the epidemic in Colombia and 5% of the population was expected to be infected at this time. This percentage is slightly lower than that reported by an international multicentric study, which reported the rate of infection to be 1.5% among kidney transplant recipients. Serological studies in Spain have shown a mean prevalence of 5% and in some areas with high infection rates, such as Madrid, it reached above 10% 18 , which supports the findings of our study that the incidence is lower than in the general population.Case series studies involving kidney transplant recipients have shown a high mortality in some centers (18-28%) [19] [20] [21] . One case series reported rapid progression, associated with a high frequency of immunological changes that could predispose to a faster progression and possibly higher mortality. In our study as well, transplant patients manifested the disease early, had longer duration of hospitalization than the general population, and died in a short span of time, while those on the waiting list manifested the disease later and stayed longer in the hospital, which suggests that there is a deleterious impact of immunosuppression on the progression of the disease.In addition to the risk factors due to the usual comorbidities in these patients 22 , immunosuppression could be an additional risk factor for mortality. However, despite a slight increase in the percentage of transplant recipients who required intensive care management, this difference, as well as mortality, were not statistically different, compared with infected J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 patients on the waiting list 14.3% versus 12.2%), which might be related to the potential effect of these drugs in modulating the inflammatory storm triggered by the virus 10, 11 .Unlike the high mortality rate (28%) reported in a group in New York 19 in the immediate postoperative period that forced the suspension of the program, the outcomes in our country during the period analyzed have been different, since none of the patients infected during the early perioperative period has died until the study's cut-off date.The mortality of transplant patients in this study was 14.3%. In an analysis of mortality in the immunosuppressed population, the mortality of the transplanted population is variable, ranging from 5% to 67%. However, compared to other populations with the same condition such as cancer or HIV, transplant recipients might have a higher risk of mortality 11 .We consider that with the data obtained so far, the availability of hospital beds and resources, and the biosafety protocols adopted, we can continue with the transplantation activity in our country. However, it is necessary to further monitor COVID-19 infection in the transplant recipients in Colombia during the coming months, to optimize control measures to prevent infection, as well as to further develop strategies for the education of families, caregivers, as well as reopening of the economic (work) and educational sectors (e.g. schools) in the environments of transplant patients.Among the limitations observed in our study is the lack of information on the clinical presentation of patients, which prevents validation of the presence of other comorbidities that affect the risk of infection, hospitalization, or progression in this group of patients. Moreover, there is lack of information related to the general management of these patients in the follow-up centers that are not registered in the National Donation and Transplant Network.

Most of these have managed to recover, but unfortunately a significant proportion have died. In February 2020 the Brazilian federal government declared a national emergency [2] . The following month, March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic [3] , which was followed by many efforts of all kinds to prevent its spread and minimize its effects.Brazil registered, as of March 2020, an increasing number of deaths, besides the increase that has always been observed since the beginning of the historical series, registered by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) [4] in 2003, except in 2005. In this work we study the historical variation of deaths since the beginning of the series, in 2003, to try to evaluate the effect that COVID-19 had on the number of deaths in 2020 and the number that would be expected in the absence of this pandemic. The series, simultaneously, may be useful in assessing epidemics that have affected Brazil over these years. In the work, as auxiliary tools, the numbers of deaths in hospitals and the number of deaths associated to violence throughout Brazil from 2003 to 2019 were also included.Our study was carried out using public data that are easily accessible to anyone interested and is therefore easy to reproduce. The sources were IBGE [4] and the Civil Registry Transparency Portal [5] .The rest of the work is organized as follows: in the DATA section the databases used for its development are described. In the RESULTS section the graphs on total deaths, violent deaths and hospital deaths from 2003 to 2020 are presented. Data on deaths related to other diseases in the years 2019 and 2020 are also presented. In the DISCUSSION section we analyze the graphs presented in the previous section, as well as the correlations between them, which allow us to arrive at the CONCLUSIONS section where the main findings of our work are summarized.The data used for the number of deaths in Brazil (total, violent and in hospitals) were extracted from IBGE. Data from the Transparency Portal on deaths in Brazil from 2015 to 2020 (the only data available) were also used. Regarding the two databases, it is worth pointing out that in the years that they are included in both databases, the data do not coincide exactly. Data on deaths in Brazil in 2019 and 2020 due to specific diseases were also obtained from the Transparency Portal.In figure 1 we can observe the total number of deaths per year in Brazil from 2003 to 2019 (black circles), obtained from IBGE [4] and the total number of deaths per year in Brazil from 2015 to 2019 (black triangles), according to data from the Transparency Portal [5] . Figure 1 also represents the point of intersection of the linear adjustment of these two sets of data for 2020. The black square is the total number of deaths for 2020, obtained from the Transparency Portal [5]. . The green line is the linear adjustment to this data. The point of intersection between the lines corresponds approximately to the extrapolation of both for the year 2020. The black square is the number of deaths in the Transparency Portal for the year 2020. Note that the two sets of data have years in common, but in which the data do not coincide. The Transparency Portal is a more recent base and we believe that it will gradually be completed, so that in the future the slope will be similar to the slope of the linear adjust from IBGE data. Interestingly, in the graph we observe that as of 2020, without a pandemic, the two series would coincide. It is normal that large databases only guarantee their data after a certain time has elapsed. Clear examples of this are the databases of earthquakes and magnetic storms, among others.The difference between the two points for 2020 (the intersection point of extrapolations and the data from the Transparency Portal for the year 2020) should be observed, which gives the value of 97,287 deaths. If we compare the actual values of deaths for 2019 and 2020, using the data for 2019 from IBGE and the data for 2020 from the Transparency Portal, the difference is 115,042 deaths. If we use the two values from the Transparency Portal, the difference is 187,023 deaths.It is important to point out at this point that, given that the number of deaths by COVID-19 officially informed on the Transparency Portal From Figure 1 it can be stated with certainty that COVID-19 brought a significant increase in the number of deaths, far beyond what would be expected by analyzing the historical series [4, 5] . However, some characteristics that are highlighted in Figure 1 appear in Figure 3 (deaths in hospitals) . From the behavior of the differences between the years 2009 and 2010, and between the years 2010 and 2011, it can be inferred that there was some epidemic that affected the health system in Brazil. We risk that it may have been the first appearance of H1N1 (but this should be the object of more detailed studies). Likewise, the difference between the years 2015 and 2016 may be the signature of another epidemic or epidemics that may have affected Brazil in those years, such as chikungunya, zica and dengue (but as in the case of H1N1, this should be the target of more detailed studies). The difference between 2005 and 2006 could perhaps be related to sporadic appearances of swine fever in that period.From the comparison of the differences between the years 2010 and 2011, 2015 and 2016 and 2019 and 2020, it can be seen that all of them are of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, it is to be expected that there were a number of false positives, as can be observed by the name adopted in the Transparency Portal -Special Covid-19, in the Registry Panel of summation: ""Deaths with suspicion or confirmation of Covid-19"". It is worth mentioning the decrease registered between the years 2019 and 2020 [6] in the number of deaths from other respiratory diseases (not COVID-19) such as pneumonia, which fell by 44 413 deaths [6].However, another plausible hypothesis is that a large part of the deaths that would occur naturally over 2020 (or even 2021, 2022 and beyond) due to severe comorbidities have been accelerated by the pandemic. If this hypothesis is correct, a number of deaths will be verified in 2021 and 2022, below what is expected from the extrapolation of historical series from 2003 to 2019, shown in Fig. 1 . This will obviously occur with the decrease in the number of deaths by COVID-19 by the use of vaccines, treatments and obtaining ""herd immunity"". This decrease could be an indication that COVID-19 was definitely removed from our coexistence.The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic brought widespread concern that must have contributed to the increase in the number of deaths by 2020 compared to 2019. One example is the increase in SARS deaths of 15044 [6].One can mention the abandonment by patients of treatment for pre-existing diseases, suicides and domestic violence, among others. The initial extreme concern must have been caused by the rapid spread of the disease in populations especially vulnerable to it (elderly population in European countries), even in places of high human development. It draws attention to the relatively low morbidity that the virus has caused in populations of places theoretically less prepared to face this type of disorder (Africa). But it is also worth mentioning that the African population is, in general and due to low life expectancy, young. Brazil is not at either extreme.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-26",1

As of 4 June 2020, a total of 6,414,828 confirmed infected cases were recorded which resulted in 382,867 deaths (2) . The global mortality rate was estimated to be 5.97%.The rapid spread of COVID-19 has negatively affected the general population and some vulnerable subpopulations including the infected patients, their close contacts, frontline health professionals (3, 4) , mentally ill individuals (5) , and older adults (6, 7) . The stringent infection control measures (e.g., quarantine, social distancing, lockdown, suspension of face-to-face teaching/learning in educational institutes) initiated by the health authorities in different countries were deemed effective in containing the virus; however, these stringent preventive measures also triggered negative psychological responses including fear of contagion, anxiety, uncertainty, posttraumatic stress symptoms (6) , depression (8) , and at worst, suicide. Furthermore, infected and suspected cases were prone to social stigma due to being placed in quarantine and how this has been negatively portrayed by the media (9) .Unfortunately, at the time of reporting, there were still no signs of effective vaccines in treating the infection, nor were there any evidence-based control measures to curb the rapid transmission of COVID-19. Consequently, the prevalence of suicide could reach a record high as the pandemic continues to spread across different countries, which may result in a suicide pandemic (10) . This suicide pandemic could further emerge as most countries are confronted with a global economic crisis. To determine the prevalence of potential suicide, one can investigate SI as it has been shown to predict suicidal attempts and other risk-taking behaviors among all age groups (11) . SI refers to having destructive thoughts and plans about dying. To determine the prevalence of potential suicide, one can investigate suicidal ideation, which refers to having destructive thoughts and plans about dying, as it has been shown to predict suicidal attempts and other risk-taking behaviors among all age groups.Nonetheless, a global picture exploring the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) among the general population across different countries is still lacking. This gives us the impetus to fill this research gap through the conceptualization of the present study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-national cross-sectional observational study examining the prevalence of SI and its correlates among the general population.The aims of this study were thus to (1) examine the overall prevalence of SI and its correlates across 10 countries in the East and West, (2) examine the association between individuals' health beliefs and suicidality, and (3) provide directions for the global imperative for suicide research and prevention. We had established three hypotheses: (1) the prevalence of SI among Asian countries in the East was higher than Western countries in this study; (2) gender was a significant covariate in predicting SI; and (3) health belief was significantly associated with face mask wearing and SI in this study.This was a cross-sectional observational study which used convenience sampling. An online survey hyperlink was distributed to the collaborative partners to disseminate to the general population in their respective countries / regions. The sampling frame was sourced from our collaborators in 10 countries / regions nationwide (the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Philippines, Republic of Korea, China, Turkey, Hong Kong, and Macau).This multi-national study targeted participants from the general population, and the eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 18 years or above; (2) male or female currently residing in a country affected by COVID-19; (3) able to read and / or understand Chinese, English, or the official language of their country of origin; and (4) capable of providing written consent. Participants who did not provide written consent and countries with <100 responses were excluded from this study.The questionnaire was disseminated via several online platforms including a discussion forum, community peer groups (e.g., COVID-19 information groups, child parenting groups, working adult peer groups), and organizational or personal Facebook pages. Data collection took place from 24 March to 30 April 2020.Sociodemographic variables including gender, age, marital status, occupation (student or working-age adult), occupation (healthcare worker or non-healthcare worker) were solicited. Other variables including participants' frequency of using a face mask for self-protection and protecting others was also included [measured by the Face Mask Use Scale, FMUS (12) ]. In addition, participants were also asked about their health beliefs which included beliefs about the susceptibility of being infected by the virus, severity toward the virus, cue to action by their governments / family members / friends, knowledge of COVID-19, and self-efficacy of wearing face masks correctly [items were applicable in the previous studies (13, 14) ].The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure the outcome variable in this study. We used the English and Chinese version of the PHQ-9 in Western countries and Asian countries / regions, respectively. The Portuguese, Korean, and Turkish versions of the PHQ-9 were used according to the established and published version (15) . The psychometric properties of the English version PHQ-9 showed satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.83-0.92), convergent and discriminant validity, and construct validity (exploratory factor analysis and known-group method) (16) .The PHQ-9 consisted of nine items which measured the presence and severity of self-reported depressive symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to completing the questionnaire. Each item had a response range from 0 to 3, with a summed total score ranging from 0 to 27. A score of 5-9 indicated ""mild"" depression, 10-14 indicated ""moderate"" depression, 15-19 indicated ""moderately severe"" depression, and ≥ 20 indicated ""severe"" depression. Cronbach's alpha for the internal consistency reliability of the Chinese version of the PHQ-9 was 0.86 and the correlation coefficient for the 2-weeks test-retest reliability of the scale was 0.86 (17) . Cronbach's alpha for the PHQ-9 in this study was 0.91. Three countries used the translated PHQ-9 (translated according to their native language). Backward and forward translations of the sociodemographic items from English into the official language were done for Brazil (Portuguese), Korea (Korean), and Turkey (Turkish), by the research team collaborators. Semantic equivalence and content validity were both established to ensure the appropriateness of the translations and relevance of the items.To reduce sampling bias and yield a representative sample, all countries described as having a ""High risk"" or ""Low risk"" (2) of contracting COVID-19 were invited to participate in this study.We aimed to recruit as many participants as possible over the recruitment period to improve the potential representativeness of the sample and thus did not calculate a minimum sample size a priori.Since our study only focused on SI, the sum total score of question nine in the PHQ-9 (18) was extracted as a composite score of our dependent variable. Question nine consisted of questions about participants' thoughts, for example, that he / she would be better off dead, or of thinking of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Participants indicated their answers on a 3point scale, with ""0:"" no SI, ""1:"" SI for several days, ""2"" having SI for more than half the day, and ""3"" having SI nearly every day. Furthermore, higher scores indicated higher SI.Data analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analysis, chi-square statistics, and independent sample t-tests were used to examine the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, face mask use, core components of the Health Belief Model (HBM), and SI. Furthermore, ordinal regression analysis was performed to identify factors which were independently associated with SI. All the significant sociodemographic characteristics, face mask use patterns, and the HBM components were entered into the regression analysis as independent variables. The level of significance was set as p < 0.05 (two-tailed).A total of 25,053 participants (77.3% female) were recruited, yielding a response rate of 52.8% in this study. Twelve countries participated, of which two countries (Finland and Sweden) had < 100 participants and were thus excluded from analysis. This exclusion resulted in 10 countries being included in the statistical analysis ( Table 1) .The overall prevalence of SI ranged from 7.6 to 24.9% in our sample. Males exhibited higher levels of SI than females (16.6 vs. 15.4%). The youngest age group (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) showed the most prevalence for SI (21.8%) and there was an upward decreasing trend between age and SI. Furthermore, participants who originated from either the U.S. / Philippines accounted for the highest prevalence of suicidality (nearly every day; both Association Between Face Mask Wearing, Health Belief, and Suicidal Ideation Table 2 showed the association between face mask wearing, health belief, and SI. Participants without any SI were less likely to wear a face mask for self-protection / others as they perceived themselves as being less susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and perceived this novel virus as not being severe, although they had been given cues to wear face masks and had good knowledge about COVID-19.Results of the ordinal regression (Table 3) confirmed the univariate comparison results and showed that relative to Macau, participants in the UK and Brazil had less frequent SI (OR = 0.38 and 0.31, respectively, p < 0.001). Younger, male, and participants with a partner showed higher levels of SI (all p's < 0.05). Furthermore, face mask wearing was not associated with SI. Participants who believed that they were susceptible to the disease, perceived the disease as severe but had a low cue to action, poor knowledge of the disease, and poor efficacy to wear a mask properly, exhibited higher levels of SI (p < 0.001).Our results showed that the youngest age group (18-24 years) had the highest odds (OR = 5.98 95% CI 3.56, 10.03) of harboring SI compared to the oldest group (≥60 years old). The younger the age, the higher the likelihood of reporting SI; thus, younger age seemed to be a significant factor associated with SI. Consistent with this finding, some researchers (19) recently reported the association between COVID-19 and youth mental health. They found that 40.4% of the sampled youth (n = 584; 14-35 years old) were prone to psychological problems, of whom, 14.4% exhibited signs of posttraumatic stress symptoms. The high prevalence of these symptoms suggests that COVID-19 infection has a significant influence on youth mental health. Due to suspension of face-to-face teaching in all education institutions during the pandemic, students have had to shift to online modes of learning. This sudden shift of their traditional learning mode may have led to maladaptation and increased levels of stress, anxiety, and academic pressure. In addition, students may have received less peer support due to a reduction in face-to-face interactions, being deprived of extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, gymnasium, youth centers) and entertainment (e.g., cinemas, theme parks, playground) due to lockdown measures. The full-scale lockdown measures in some regions / countries (e.g., China, Hong Kong, Brazil, the UK, the U.S., Italy) may have led to increased levels of social isolation, entrapment, and loneliness; consequently, contributing to elevated risk of SI among the youth (20) . Cultural and demographic characteristics may have also contributed to SI in the youth, as noted by Khan et al. (21) that male students from low-income families reported higher levels of academic stress and SI. Furthermore, other researchers (22) examined the association between physical activity and sedentary behavior among adolescent's with suicidal vulnerability. Using the Global School-based Student Health Survey data from 206,357 students (mean age 14.6 ± 1.18 years; 51% female) in 52 low-and-middle income countries, results showed that students with high leisure activity and low sedentary behavior (≥3 h/day) was independently associated with higher odds of SI, whereas insufficient physical activity and high sedentary behavior was associated with higher odds of SI for both male and female adolescents.Findings from another cross-sectional study conducted by Ahmed et al. (23) in Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus, found that young adults aged between 21 and 40 years had higher rates of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and lower mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, previous epidemiological studies found an association between psychiatric symptoms and suicidal tendency among survivors of the 2003 SARS epidemic (24) . In other words, it has been consistently found that there is a positive correlation between infectious disease epidemics, psychiatric symptoms, and suicidal tendencies. Since the COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented global public health risk, individuals residing in countries affected by this pandemic are overwhelmed with an overflow of information on the latest public health control measures to mitigate the impact of rapid transmission of this novel virus. This overflow of information and the relaying of fake news has inevitably created the ""infodemic"" on social media which triggers a panic state leading to SI or suicidal behavior (25) . Non-schoolers / working age youth, on the other hand, may worry about their future career prospects in light of the imminent global economic recession brought on by this COVID-19 pandemic.It was found that being male was one of the significant factors associated with SI. Compared to women, men were less likely to seek social, emotional, or professional support / counseling from others during the crisis, partly due to their hegemonic masculine beliefs (26) . Due to the pandemic, several male participants were confronted with sudden loss of employment which led to increased financial burden (27) and marital discord. These male, unemployed individuals may have associated their job loss with their diminished functional role as a breadwinner in the family. Furthermore, they may have subjectively felt less valued / important by their family members and perceived themselves as a burden to the family. Furthermore, the present study found that relationship crisis, increased interfamilial conflict, financial burden, and weakened masculine identity may also have triggered SI among male participants.Marital status has been identified as a risk factor for suicide in mental health research (28) . This is because marriage serves a protective function by providing social support, facilitating social participation, and increasing self-esteem (29) . Furthermore, marriage is associated with larger social networks (30) , an increased sense of belonging (31) , promoting well-being, and as a buffer against mental illness. Moreover, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (32) posits that the sense of belonging may also explain the relationship between marital status and suicide. This theory proposes that thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness contribute to suicidal desire and suggests that harboring could be an independent predictor of SI for men (33) . Among all the factors associated with SI, financial hardship was one of the strongest predictors of SI (34) . Furthermore, parents' abusive / volatile behavior may indirectly be associated with adolescents' SI (35) . Individuals who encountered a sudden loss of unemployment / redundancy may experience acute stress, anxiety, uncertainty, and feel as if they are a financial and psychological burden on their family members. Thus, governments are playing a pivotal role by providing timely financial safety nets (e.g., food, shelter, financial subsidy, unemployment subsidy) (10) to the vulnerable population to reduce the increased likelihood of psychiatric symptoms including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and SI. Consistent with our findings, later research such as Miret et al. (36) asserted that marital status and occupational status were associated with lifetime SI in individuals aged between 18 and 49.Results from the ordinal regression analysis showed that all the core components of the HBM (susceptibility, severity, cues to action, knowledge, and efficacy) were significant predictors of SI in this study (Table 3) . Thus, this suggests that participants' health belief is a critical factor in determining an individual's SI. Although there was some empirical evidence supporting HBM in the domain of physical health (37) , there was insufficient evidence to illustrate that health belief can also influence mental health (38) . Furthermore, health belief is often linked to an individual's health literacy (39) ; therefore, in any pandemic, accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated by risk communicators of the health authority to the general population to allay public fear and anxiety. For instance, public health education on preventive measures (frequent handwashing/hand hygiene, social distancing, avoid overcrowding, face mask wearing for self-protection/ others) should be disseminated via digital online platforms, mass media, and news reports to improve the health literacy of the public. Consequently, individuals with higher levels of health literacy will improve their health behavior which is crucial to prevent the rapid transmission of the virus in the wider community. Furthermore, these individuals will take primary responsibility, action, and behavior to protect themselves / others in their primary setting to combat against the pandemic (40, 41) .It is evident that the governments of different nations have adopted different public health preventive strategies to mitigate against the rapid transmission of COVID-19. The significant variation in the mortality rate and number of suspected / confirmed COVID-19 patients between different countries / regions may reflect the determination and effectiveness of these infection control initiatives by the governments / health authorities. Inevitably, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted individual's mental health including perceived loneliness, social isolation, boredom, decreased quality of life, fear, anxiety, uncertainty, depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and SI. Furthermore, the increase in suicide during the quarantine is not inevitable if appropriate measures were in place (42).Compared to Macau, participants in the UK and Brazil reported less SI. It is surprising to note that the UK and Brazil had lower odds of SI than that of Macau ( Table 3) . We speculate two reasons that could have explained this result. Firstly, Macau is a wellknown country for migrant workers who have been suffering social inequities such as social isolation, overcrowded living conditions, lack of access to sanitizers, and personal protective equipment (43) . They may also have difficulty obtaining health care compensation (44) and may not fully understand the pandemic situation due to language barriers and poor health literacy (45) . In addition, these migrants may not be eligible to apply for the Macau government's financial subsidy and welfare benefits during this pandemic; thus, migrants in Macau may be a part of the vulnerable subpopulation who have an increased tendency to experience mental health problems which leads to increased odds of SI.Therefore, essential COVID-19 related health information should be translated and disseminated in different languages to allay these migrants' anxiety and fear. Secondly, the variation in SI across different countries can be explained by the total government expenditure and financial resources available for their citizens. To illustrate, participants who originated from low-income countries such as Brazil and Philippines may have received limited welfare support from their governments compared to those residing in middle-to-high income countries (e.g., Hong Kong, U.S., UK, and Macau). Therefore, economic adversity alongside poor welfare support and medical benefits may increase the odds of having SI due to a lack of hope for the future during the pandemic.Our results have shed important insights into mental / public health research during the COVID-19 pandemic and has shown that there seems to be a significant statistical difference between participants with / without SI between Macau (the East) and the UK and Brazil (the West). The variation in our prevalence estimates is likely to be attributed to different sociocultural and economic contexts, and public health strategies in infection control, alongside government's efforts to help reduce the impact compounded by the pandemic through financial subsidy, preventive measures (mask supply, personal protective equipment), and other practical support provided to the community (10).Despite a concerted effort across the globe, evidence from older research findings suggested that the U.S. had increased rates of suicide during the influenza pandemic between 1918 and 1919 (46) and among older adults during the 2003 SARS epidemic (5, 47) . This trend is somewhat changing with youth suicide becoming more prevalent in the last few decades (48) . Findings emerging from this study have provided scientific evidence that younger adults seem to have an elevated risk of suicide than older adults. Furthermore, our key findings have highlighted that there is a pressing need for implementation of contingent global mental health prevention measures and interventions for the community at large, specifically in the vulnerable subpopulations (10), via joint international collaboration (49) . In addition, depression was found to be closely linked to suicide (50) . Although depression is a treatable psychiatric disorder, it needs to be treated in a timely fashion before leading to SI.Suicide is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted different work sectors (27) with social distancing / quarantine measures possibly inducing loneliness, fear, anxiety, and withdrawal in some vulnerable individuals across all age groups (51) .Therefore, the WHO should establish a global mental health crisis team chaired by public health / mental health experts and epidemiologists from multidisciplinary backgrounds to establish and deliver three-tiered telehealth, telemedicine, and remote psychological counseling. With the aid of advanced digital technology, health experts can identify the most at-risk groups in the community and offer imminent assistance to reduce the global mortality burden caused by suicide. Self-guided digital interventions should be widely promoted, especially in some nations where there is restricted access to traditional health services due to lockdown / quarantine (52) . Additionally, hotlines and text line support would be viable tools to mitigate against the risk of isolation and anxiety (10, 42) . Furthermore, onsite visits by psychiatrists / psychologists are warranted to provide timely treatment to individuals with elevated risks of suicide.There are several limitations that need to be addressed in this study. First, a cross-sectional study cannot infer any causal relationship between variables and thus, may reduce the generalisability of our findings. Second, some countries with a high or low risk of COVID-19 infections could not participate in this study due to the lengthy ethical approval process which inevitably reduced the representativeness of our sample. Third, some variables (monthly household income, educational attainment, number of children) were not solicited in this study; thus, we could not examine the association between these demographic characteristics with SI. Lastly, owing to the sudden surge of the pandemic emerging in the East before its rapid spread to the Western countries, use of stratified random sampling was almost impossible in this multi-national collaborative study. Therefore, future researchers should consider these factors when investigating the impact of SI and COVID-19 in future studies.'This study found that SI was prevalent among the younger age groups as well as in male, married individuals across all the collaborative countries / regions. Furthermore, health belief was significantly associated with SI during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, joint international collaboration by key stakeholders and policymakers is warranted to formulate timely and effective suicide prevention measures and mental health promotion initiatives. In doing so, the global risk of increasing psychiatric morbidity and rising mortality rates brought on by this pandemic can be reduced.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by several regional committees, including Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee of the ","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-13",1

The most common clinical picture is characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and upper respiratory symptoms. 1, 2 In May 2020, two months after it declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized alterations in the perception of smell and taste as symptoms of this disease. 3 Records of such dysfunctions have reportedly been rare findings in Chinese studies, found in approximately 5% of cases. 4 In a multicenter European study, 85.6% of the assessed patients reported alterations in smell and 11.8% had anosmia before the onset of other symptoms. 5 In a study by the American Academy of Ototlaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, 26.6% of individuals reported it as the only initial symptom. 6 The Brazilian literature is still scarce on the subject. Jofilly et al. reported that the sudden loss of smell had a high positive predictive value (88%) for COVID-19 diagnosis during the epidemic in Brazil. 7 Due to the clinical importance of this new disease and aiming to understand olfactory alterations related to this respiratory syndrome, this study was designed in a tertiary center in the city of São Paulo with patients diagnosed with COVID- 19 .The aim of this study is to assess the association between olfactory disorders in patients with COVID-19 and the severity of the flu syndrome (mild flu syndrome, severe flu syndrome, critical illness).The study was carried out in a tertiary hospital and was approved by the local ethics committee CAAE 31512220.5.0000.5463. All participants signed an electronic free and informed consent form provided by the researchers. The data were collected between March and June 2020.The inclusion criteria were patients over 18 years old with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT ---PCR) of the nasopharynx and oropharynx swab or by serology. 1,2 Those with alterations in olfaction or taste prior to COVID-19 infection; hospitalized patients at the time of data collection for the study; tracheostomized patients; individuals with mental confusion after prolonged hospital stay and those who refused to sign the consent form were excluded.The individuals were selected by non-probabilistic sampling by judgment. Three groups of patients were created for this study, according to the severity of the flu syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2: severe flu syndrome (in-hospital treatment without the need for intensive support), critical illness (in-hospital treatment with the need for intensive support) and mild flu syndrome (outpatient treatment).Inpatients (with and without olfactory dysfunction) were interviewed by a telephone call made by a team of doctors after hospital discharge, a period during which these patients did not have mental confusion and were able to answer the questionnaire prepared by the researchers. The questionnaire included identification data (age and gender) and the following clinical variables related to the period of SARS-CoV-2 infection: presence of nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction and/or nasal secretion), neurological symptoms (headache and /or dizziness), history of DM, smoking habits, alterations in olfaction and taste. In case of an affirmative answer for hyposmia/anosmia, they were also asked about the duration of this condition (<9 days, ≥9 days and <2 months, ≥2 months). There was no quantification through the visual analog scale of any of the symptoms. Laboratory parameters; C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocytes, were obtained from information recorded in the electronic medical record of individuals on the first day of hospital admission. Patients with mild flu syndrome (with and without olfactory dysfunction) were comprised of health professionals from this tertiary hospital. They were contacted and received an electronic questionnaire similar to that submitted to patients who were hospitalized, but laboratory parameters were excluded. These patients did not undergo test collection.The sample size calculation for this cross-sectional study was based on the study by Mein ST et al. (2020), 8 delineated in the Epi Info software, showing a 95% confidence level, 80% power and 5% margin of error. Using the Kelsey, Fleiss and Fleiss methods with continuity correction, the calculation of the total number of individuals was 210, 212 and 234, respectively.The variables considered for this study were: patient's gender, age, dysgeusia, diabetes mellitus, nasal symptoms, neurological symptoms, smoking status, clinical condition (mild flu syndrome, severe flu syndrome, critical illness), lymphocyte blood level and serum CRP level.The programs SPSS V16, Excel office 2010 and EPI INFO 7.2.2.6 were used for the statistical analysis. A level of statistical significance <0.05 (5%) was used for this study.Categorical variables were described according to frequency and the numerical variables according to mean and standard deviation (SD). Two-tailed Chi-Square test or twotailed Fisher's exact test was used to assess the difference between the frequencies of categorical variables.Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to study the difference in means between the numerical variables, according to the Bartlett test result. When analyzing these variables, when the Bartlett test resulted in a value of p < 0.05, the test used was the Mann---Whitney/Wilcoxon (Kruskal---Wallis test). On the other hand, when the p-value in this test was >0.05, suggesting homogeneous variance, the ANOVA test (parametric) was used. The sample consisted of 261 individuals. Sixty-two patients (23.75%) had mild flu syndrome, 151 (57.85%) had severe flu syndrome and 48 (18.40%) had critical illness.Patients with mild flu syndrome were statistically younger (p < 0.001). They had significantly more nasal and neurological symptoms when compared to critically-ill (p < 0.001) and severe (p < 0.001) patients ( Table 1) .The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) was statistically higher in hospitalized patients (p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . CRP levels were significantly higher in critically-ill patients than in patients with severe flu syndrome (p < 0.001) ( Table 1) .Olfactory alteration was observed in 66.28% of patients with COVID-19. The duration of olfactory dysfunction was variable among the interviewees. Most patients had hyposmia/anosmia for more than nine days and less than two months (56.68%). A total of 51 patients (32.48%) had olfactory dysfunction that lasted less than 9 days and 17 patients (10.82%) had olfactory dysfunction that lasted more than 2 months. It is necessary to point out that 104 patients who had olfactory dysfunction were unable to accurately inform the duration of hyposmia/anosmia.Olfactory dysfunction was observed in 88.70% of patients with mild symptoms; 62.91% of those admitted to the hospital and 45.83% of those admitted to the intensive care unit. There were significantly more patients with olfactory dysfunction among individuals with mild flu syndrome than among those with severe flu syndrome (p < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 4.63; 95%CI [1.87---10.86]). Moreover, there were significantly more patients with impaired olfaction among those with severe flu syndrome than in critically-ill patients (p = 0.05; Odds Ratio = 1.98; 95%CI [1.02---3.82]). Finally, this association was also maintained when comparing individuals with mild flu syndrome vs. critically-ill patients (p < 0.00); Odds Ratio = 9.28; 95%CI [3.52---25.53]) (Fig. 1 ).Patients with hyposmia/anosmia had significantly more dysgeusia than patients without this disorder (p < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 89.13; 95%CI [34.88---227.70]). Olfactory dysfunction and nasal symptoms. Q, Twotailed X 2 test. (Fig. 2) .There was a statistically significant association between the presence of olfactory disorders and neurological symptoms, such as dizziness and headache (p = 0.03; Odds Ratio = 1.90; 95%CI [1.08---3.32]) (Fig. 3) .Olfactory dysfunction and neurological symptoms. Q, Two-tailed X 2 test.Olfactory dysfunction is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. 3 Despite being widely observed in clinical practice and published in foreign studies, 9---11 it is a disorder related to COVID-19 that has been minimally reported in the Brazilian literature. 7, 12, 13 In the present study, we observed an inverse association between the presence of hyposmia/anosmia and the severity of the patient's clinical condition. Participants classified as having mild flu syndrome were statistically younger when compared to patients who required hospitalization. This result is similar to that found in other studies, in which older patients tend to have a more severe clinical picture of COVID-19, probably due to the +Model Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology xxx (xxxx) xxx---xxx higher number of chronic diseases and decreased immunological competence. 1, 2 Patients in the mild flu syndrome group also had significantly more nasal and neurological symptoms. In a study carried out in South Korea with 213 outpatients, cough, hyposmia, dysgeusia, nasal obstruction, headache and myalgia were identified among the most common symptoms. In contrast, inpatients had more fever, cough and dyspnea. 14 Diabetes mellitus was a significantly more frequent comorbidity in hospitalized patients. The presence of DM is considered a risk factor for developing the severe clinical form of COVID-19. 15 Critically-ill patients had statistically higher levels of CRP. CRP level is considered an inflammatory marker and can be related to more severe conditions. 16 Higher CRP values may be associated with an increased need for care in the intensive care unit. 17 In this study, 173 patients (66.28%) had some olfactory dysfunction during COVID-19 infection. In another study also carried out in Brazil, 79.2% of the studied patients had positive tests for COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia and/or anosmia). 12 This difference is probably due to the presence of only outpatients in the second study.Most respondents in this study had a clinical complaint of hyposmia/anosmia lasting less than two months. Kosugi et al. (2020) followed the patients for an average of 31 days and verified that 52.6% of these participants achieved complete olfactory recovery in approximately 15 days. 12 There was a significantly higher prevalence of hyposmia/anosmia in patients with the mild clinical condition when compared to patients with severe flu syndrome and those with critical illness. Moreover, there were statistically more cases of olfactory dysfunction among patients who were admitted to the hospital ward when compared to participants with a history of ICU admission. Similarly, Yan et al. (2020) , evaluated 196 patients and concluded that those with anosmia or hyposmia had a lower rate of hospitalization when compared to those with normal olfactory function (OR = 0.09; 95%CI [0.01---0.74]). 18 Therefore, they suggest that patients with flu syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, but without olfactory dysfunction should seek medical help earlier, because of the greater likelihood of pulmonary involvement and greater chance of developing the severe systemic inflammatory syndrome. Finally, they report that the presence of anosmia/hyposmia could be used as a clinical marker related to disease severity, just like the APGAR scale in the newborn. 18 In contrast to these findings, Moein et al. (2020) and Vaira et al. (2020) found no association between the olfactory disorder and disease severity. Vaira stated that alterations in olfaction reported by critically-ill patients can be overlooked in the context of prolonged hospitalization and invasive ventilatory support. 8, 19, 20 Another study carried out in the Brazilian population that included patients admitted to the ICU and the hospital ward and participants who received only outpatient treatment also did not identify an association between the presence of olfaction disorder and the severity of the patients' clinical condition. 13 There was also a significant association between the presence of hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia. Speth et al. (2020) found an important association between the clinical symptom of olfaction and taste alteration. They reported that the severity of taste dysfunction is closely associated to the severity of olfactory dysfunction. 21 Although it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acts on the chemoreceptors of smell and taste separately, these clinical complaints are more likely to be directly related due to impaired retronasal taste perception, which influences the experienced tastes. 21 In the present study, patients with olfactory dysfunction reported significantly more nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction and / or secretion). In a study prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, another type of human coronavirus was inoculated into the upper airways of nineteen patients. Nine participants developed a common cold. It was observed that, in these patients, there was a hyperresponsiveness of the subepithelial microcirculation of the upper airways with increased plasma exudation, which resulted in mucosal edema and nasal obstruction. 22 Based on this, it can be considered that, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there may also be a conductive disorder that results in the mechanical blocking of odor molecules, which prevents them from reaching the chemoreceptors in the olfactory epithelium. This mechanism could also be responsible for generating olfaction disorders in patients with local symptoms.Patients with olfactory dysfunction had a significantly higher frequency of neurological symptoms. One of the mechanisms proposed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the central nervous system is through the cribriform plate, reaching the olfactory nerves and the olfactory bulb, 23 leading to a picture of viral encephalitis. This pathophysiological mechanism could explain the presence of prolonged headache for a few weeks in some individuals with olfaction alterations.The findings of this study suggest that patients with hyposmia/anosmia might have a state of better immunological competence, with a greater chance of containing SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airways. The olfactory dysfunction in individuals with COVID-19 could be caused either by edema in the nasal mucosa (conductive), or by viral aggression directly in the olfactory system (involvement of the olfactory epithelium and/or neurons). Another proposed mechanism for the development of post-viral hyposmia/anosmia would be the increase in cytokine production. Henkin et al. (2013) identified elevated levels of IL-6 in the nasal mucus and plasma of individuals with these symptoms after a cold, when compared to controls (29.7 vs. 11.6 pg/mL; p < 0.001). 24 This interleukin could regulate the activity of the olfactory neurons and glial cells. 24 In individuals with severe COVID-19, the serum levels of this substance are increased. 16 On the other hand, in mild cases, there may be a localized increase of this mediator, thus promoting a localized inflammatory process and leading to a dysfunction in the olfactory system.A limitation of this study is related to the inaccurate reporting of anosmia/hyposmia in hospitalized patients. Patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit or hospital ward may have had difficulties in reporting the presence of olfactory dysfunction during the acute picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the data regarding these patients were collected after hospital discharge, that is, during a period without mental confusion and without clinical alterations, the use of oxygen support during hospitalization (orotracheal intubation or use of a nasal catheter) and presence of more severe symptoms, such as dyspnea, can alter the patient's perception of the presence or absence of olfaction alterations. Another limitation of this study was the lack of quantification of olfaction loss. The results obtained, therefore, are restricted only to patients' reports. Moein et al. (2020) applied the validated UPSIT test (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test) to 60 inpatients with COVID-19 to measure olfactory dysfunction. About 98% of those studied had olfaction alterations, of which 83% had anosmia or severe hyposmia. A relevant information is that only 35% of this sample had olfactory dysfunction complaints before the test. 10 Overall, olfaction alterations are more noticeable in cases of more significant loss, such as anosmia. Thus, although it was not quantified, it can be inferred that the number of olfactory dysfunctions may be higher than that recorded in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, despite the significant sample of patients, the present study was carried out in a single hospital, thus being geographically limited.The olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 seems to be more than a symptom of this new infection. The presence of hyposmia/anosmia in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be a predictor of good disease prognosis. It is possibly a spectrum of this disease that affects mostly the upper airways, without significant pulmonary involvement. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the presence of olfactory dysfunction as a symptom can be associated with a milder clinical picture of COVID-19.There was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with hyposmia/anosmia among patients with mild flu syndrome. Although the information about this dysfunction may be impaired by the clinical condition severity and by memory bias, the olfaction alteration has shown to be a factor of good prognosis for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. New population-based studies must be carried out to corroborate these findings.","Brazil","first author","2021-01-01",1

Strong empirical evidence recently begins to show what works best for addressing the pandemic [1, 2] . This recent literature focuses on experiences in East Asia, Europe, and the United States [3, 4] , including several studies based on previous epidemic experiences [5] [6] [7] . Latin America, despite becoming the hardest region struck by the pandemic, has been much less studied [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Further research is needed to better understand how our policymakers and institutions are dealing with this pandemic and its consequences [11] . More specifically, comparative research between countries will be particularly helpful in assessing the effects of different policy strategies to address this unprecedented global health challenge [13, 14] .This article examines how six Latin American health systems addressed the pandemic and the effectiveness of these policy responses. A health system is defined here as a set of organizations and people, as well as the actions they take, whose main purpose is to promote, restore, and maintain health [15] . This definition involves not only the government, which must lead and coordinate the actions in question. It also requires shared responsibility of the entire population and of the organizations and institutions whose actions influence health-families that protect themselves at home, the student population that learns at a distance, the media that distribute information, the companies that temporarily close their doors, and the medical institutions that handle the most delicate cases.This article first describes the initial situation of the pandemic in each Latin American country and how the government responded. Then it analyzes when and how strictly governments enforced mitigation policies and the effects produced in reducing social mobility of the population in various public spaces. Third, it analyzes COVID-19-related weekly mortality trends to explore differential effects of public policies on this health indicator. Finally, it draws policy lessons from the way each country implemented these mitigation policies.We performed a comparative policy analysis on how six Latin American health systems addressed the pandemic and the effectiveness of these policy responses from the date each country declared a sanitary emergency between middle and late March to the most recent available measurement on 23 September 2020. We selected Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru because they had the data necessary to carry out the analysis, represented the most populated nations on the continent, had similar overall population health status, measured as life expectancy at birth, and confirmed their first COVID-19-infected case between late February and early March. To better assess how each country responded to the pandemic, we also considered how well prepared were their health systems, comparing several key indicators from the most recently available Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) report [16] . We used public health expenditures as percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to compare the overall financial resources allocated to public health. Higher percentages of out-of-pocket expenditures allow comparing which health systems are not satisfying health care needs, especially drugs. The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) is an indicator that allows comparison of how well prepared was each health system before the pandemic started in terms of public health infrastructure, epidemiological surveillance, and capacity to deliver appropriate medical care, among other characteristics [17] . We employed life expectancy at birth to measure overall health system performance and maternal mortality rates per hundred thousand population to compare health care performance. Finally, we included the percentage of the populations living with diabetes and aged over 65; both have been identified as two of the most important COVID-19-related mortality risk factors.We employed several socioeconomic indicators from the same PAHO report [16] to consider how each country could influence the effectiveness of the public policies implemented to address the pandemic. We used US Purchasing Power Parity dollars (PPP) per capita to compare the capacity of the economies to face the pandemic and the GINI index to compare income inequality. To compare what percentages of their total populations were more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and less likely to comply with the mitigation and control policies, we used percentages of poverty, extreme poverty, and population with vulnerable jobs [18] . Finally, we used years of schooling for each country to explore whether education would influence compliance with the public policies implemented.To analyze how governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in these six Latin American countries, we use an overall index of government response and two of its disaggregated indices, created by the University of Oxford, which allows comparison of how public policies are implemented to mitigate the effects of coronavirus worldwide [19] . The COVID-19 Government Response Index monitors thirteen indicators to compare the stringency of policy responses to the coronavirus around the world. The first eight indicators measure closure policies in schools, workplaces, public transportation, and public event cancelations, stay at home restrictions, restrictions on domestic travel, and international travel controls. Two economic indicators measure income support for people who lose their jobs or cannot work and debt relief for those who do not have capacity to pay for loans. Finally, three health policy indicators measure if there are public information campaigns, how are testing policies targeted, and how comprehensively contact tracing is implemented.This overall government response index is a simple additive score of the 13 indicators measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. The ordinal scales measure the strictness of the public policy. For example, if the workplace closing policy required closing for every activity, except the essential ones, such as health care or grocery shops it is classified with a 3, required closing for some sectors is a 2, and when closing is only recommended and not required, it is a 1 and no policy a 0. This overall government index can be disaggregated into indices with fewer indicators. The index of mitigation and health policies, which includes 11 indicators, the 8 mitigation public policies, and the 3 health policy indicators, measures how strictly these policies are implemented without considering the economic policies. The index of economic support only includes the 2 economic variables.We analyze each index separately to better assess its effects on social mobility and health.To explore the effects of these public policies on reducing social mobility, we use Google mobility reports [20] . These provide aggregated and anonymous data that allow one to plot movement trends over time in different region and settings from users who have the location history activated on their mobile phones. Public mobility spaces range from recreational areas such as parks and squares; retail and recreational spaces such as restaurants, cafés, and shopping centers, to places considered more essential for buying groceries in supermarkets and drugs in pharmacies; means of transportation through transit stations such as subways and buses; and workplaces where people need to earn a living [20] . The dataset consists of daily regional percentages of change from the median value of the corresponding weekday during the 5-week baseline period (3 January to 6 February 2020). In this study, we focused on the period from 12 March to 23 September 2020 with days as a time unit. For each country, we considered days starting from when the country declared a sanitary emergency.We then analyzed how these policies may have influenced COVID-19 mortality rates. We calculated these rates using the number of new weekly deaths related to COVID-19 obtained from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard [21] , divided by the number of people in each country, obtained from the Panamerican Health Organization Basic Health Indicators data base [16] . Even though underreporting of COVID-19-related deaths has been a characteristic of all the Latin American health systems analyzed, they are the most reliable health outcome indicators available for assessing the evolution of the pandemic (excess deaths were not available for every country analyzed) because they allow for cross-country analysis and do not depend on the even higher underreported numbers of positive COVID-19 cases in most Latin American countries.Government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the region have been diverse. Argentina and Colombia imposed total closures on 20 and 24 March 2020, respectively. Peru did the same earlier on 15 March 2020, while the remaining three countries made partial closures around 15 March 2020. Brazil and Mexico were the last two of these countries to declare health emergencies. Brazil declared it on 19 March 2020; Mexico did so on 23 March 2020. Table 1 summarizes the dates of detection of the first cases, of the emergency sanitary declaration, as well as dates and types of social distancing measures taken to reduce the risk of contagion and mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Argentina, Colombia, and Peru implemented total closures, while Chile, Brazil, and Mexico implemented partial closures. Argentina, Colombia, Perú, and Chile declared sanitary emergencies less than 10 days after each detected its first COVID-19 case. In contrast, Brazil declared sanitary emergency nearly a month after the first case was detected and Mexico took little more than a month.Overall, the health systems of Argentina, Chile, and Colombia were better prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic before it started. They allocated more public health resources as a percentage of GDP, spent less from out-of-pocket sources, had a higher GSHI, except for Colombia, and presented lower maternal mortality rates and diabetes prevalence as shown in Table 1 . Chile, however, showed both the second highest percentage of out-of-pocket expenditures and the second highest diabetes prevalence after Mexico.Brazil, Argentina, and Chile showed the three highest level of preparedness to face the pandemic measured with the GHSI and the highest percentage of their population over 65 years of age. Peru, except for having the lowest diabetes prevalence and percentage of elderly population, showed worse health system indicators.Peru, Colombia, and Brazil are the three lowest income countries measured in US Purchasing Power Parity dollars (PPP) per capita, and have the highest percentage of people living in poverty or with a vulnerable job, except for Mexico (Table 1) . Their distribution of income is more unequal measured with Latin American health system's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic vary widely, both in timing and how stringently they have been implemented. Figure  S1a (see Supplementary Material) shows trends of the most comprehensive government response index comprising the 17 indicators for each Latin American country from their declarations of health emergency around 12 March 2020 to the most recently available measurement of 23 September 2020. Argentina and Peru began implementing stricter policies from 18 March 2020, while Colombia started them ten days later. All three governments maintained at least an 80% index through September, except for Colombia, that relaxed its policies in September 2020, lowering its index to 60%. Chile adopted less stringent measures, up to 72%, on average, in early April through the middle of June 2020-then rising gradually to an average of 86% by the end of September 2020. Brazil began implementing stricter policies by early April 2020, up to 61%, through July, then reached its highest percentage of 73 in early September 2020, then stabilized at 71% by the end of that same month. Mexico implemented stricter policies until the end of March 2020 but reached only 63% on average between April and May 2020, then reduced its stringency to 55% on average through the end of September 2020. Figure S1b (see Supplementary Material 1) shows how strictly the three health government policies measured implementation of public information campaigns, testing policies, and contact tracing in each country. Similar to the overall government response index, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia started implementing such policies earlier than the other three countries, but only Argentina and Peru maintained percentages above 80 through the end of September 2020. Colombia relaxed its health mitigation polices in early September 2020 dropping its response level to 57%, the lowest of the six countries analyzed. Chile implemented stricter polices by the end of March, rising its level of response to an average of 85 by the end of September 2020. Mexico began implementing its health policies with a level of response above 70% until the end of March and Brazil until early June. Brazil and Mexico relaxed their health policies through mid-August. They both then implemented stricter polices through the end of September 2020. Brazil reached 75% on average and Mexico only 65%. Figure S1c (see Supplementary Material 1) shows Chile and Mexico as the extremes. Although Chile started with a low level of economic response from early April through the middle of June 2020 with 38%, it gradually increased its level from then to 75% through early August and then to 100% by the end of August 2020. Mexico, in contrast, did not adopt any economic policy response. Brazil provided some economic support, but it only reached a level of 50% on average throughout this same period. Argentina, Colombia, and Peru, however, have maintained a level of 75% since early April 2020, although Argentina and Peru started two weeks earlier.We explored the mitigation effects of these differential public policies by measuring the percentage of mobility reduction in public spaces starting on the date of declaration of a sanitary emergency to the most recent available measurement on 24 September 2020. Figure S2a (see Supplementary Material 2) shows heterogeneous mobility reductions in retail and recreational spaces such as restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, and cinemas.Argentina and Peru showed the largest reductions, ranging from 60 to 90% during the period analyzed. Both presented decreasing trends, although Argentina showed a steadier one, achieving its highest reduction of 95% in May 2020 and finishing with a 56% reduction by September 24, 2020, while Peru showed reductions ranging from 97 to 65 through June 2020, then 50 on average in July 2020, and again changing from nearly 90 to 45 by the end of the period analyzed.Chile began with reductions of more than 60% until April 2020, then increased it to 75% until July 2020 and then again to 65% on average until September 2020. Colombia started with an 80% reduction through May 2020, but then gradually achieved lesser reductions, down to 40% by the end of the period analyzed. Mexico achieved its largest reduction of 80% in the middle of April 2020, but only gradually has reached 34% reductions since August 2020. Brazil reached its highest reduction of 80% in early April 2020 but showed the lowest achievements from July 2020 until the end of the period analyzed with a 30% mobility reduction. Figure S2b (see Supplementary Material 2) shows percent mobility reductions in public recreation areas such as parks, beaches, and squares. Argentina and Chile achieved the highest and most steady reductions, reaching on average 80% in Argentina and 70% in Chile. Peru achieved similar reductions, but with a less steady pattern. Colombia started with mobility reductions that reached 80% in early April 2020, but by June only showed reductions of 40%, then achieved higher reductions of 60% in July and August 2020 but reached reductions around 30% by the end of September 2020.Mexico achieved its highest reduction of 60% in mid-April, gradually lowering this percentage to a thirty average by the end of the analyzed period. Brazil reached reductions of 60% on average in early April but since then has been achieving much lesser mobility reductions that range from 25% in mid-July to 3% by the end of August and then a smaller improvement of 20% by the end of September 2020.Grocery and pharmacy shopping, which are the more necessary activities, showed lower percentage reductions in Figure S2c (see Supplementary Material 2). Peru and Chile achieved the highest reductions, although Peru showed ups and downs throughout the study period ranging from 45 to 95% reductions. Colombia achieved reductions of nearly 70% in mid-April 2020 to then reach lesser reductions ranging from 30% in mid-June 2020 to 16 by the end of the period analyzed. Mexico only reached a 29% reduction in mid-April, then lowered its reductions to nearly 10% on average by the end of September 2020. In contrast to the other countries, Brazil reached minor reductions averaging 20% through June 2020 and only mobility increases since then.Less clear mobility reduction differentials were observed in transit stations such as subways, buses, and taxis, except for Peru and Brazil ( Figure S2d ). Peru reached the highest reductions throughout the analyzed period, nearly 90%, except for June and July 2020, when it reached a 60% reduction on average. Brazil reached its highest reduction of 67% in mid-April but then showed a smaller reduction that ranged from 40% between May and June and then dropped to a 20% reduction through the end of September 2020.Mobility reduction differentials in workplaces were less pronounced ( Figure  S2e ). Peru and Chile presented the largest reductions on average, ranging from 70 to 30%, followed by Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina with 37, 35, and 29 reductions, respectively. In contrast, Brazil only reduced its workplace mobility by 22%. Figure S3 (see Supplementary Material 2) shows the differential trends of weekly mortality rates in each Latin American country selected as of September 28, 2020. All countries, except Argentina, seemed to converge in similar mortality rates by the end of the period analyzed. Peru presented the highest weekly mortality rates throughout the analyzed period, reaching peaks of 15.5 and 16.1 per million population on July 26 and 16 August 16, 2020, respectively. Brazil and Mexico followed Peru with the second and third highest weekly mortality rates through June but then stabilized until the end of the period analyzed, at around 2.5 per million. Chile showed a less stable trend, growing until it reached its first highest weekly mortality rate of 14 June at 8.3, to then decrease and grow again to that same highest rate of 8.2 a month later. Since then, it has shown a decreasing trend reaching 1.8, the lowest of the five countries, by the end of the period analyzed. Argentina and Colombia presented the lowest weekly mortality rates from March to the end of July but started a growing trend in early August 2020. Argentina reached the highest weekly mortality rate, 6.3, by the end of the period analyzed and Colombia only 3.7 per million population.The results of the analysis showed that both timelier and more stringent implementation of the government policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be associated with higher mobility reductions, as other studies have shown [1-3, 7-12, 21-25] . Argentina, Colombia, and Peru that started adopting these public health policies earlier and maintained higher degrees of stringency in their implementation, throughout most of the 6 months analyzed, showed higher mobility reductions. Mexico and Brazil, that implemented less strict mitigation policies and did so later than the other Latin American countries, presented the two lowest mobility reductions in all the public spaces analyzed.The exploration also suggests that if public policies are relaxed, as most countries did when they 'reopened' their economies, mobility increases. Mexico did it first in early June, followed by Brazil in mid-June, while Argentina and Chile relaxed its policies in mid-July, Peru in early July, and Colombia did it until September 2020. If the measures adopted are more strictly implemented, as Chile did since July 2020, mobility may also be reduced.Several factors may have influenced this differential effectiveness of the closure and restriction policies in reducing mobility in each Latin American country. One factor seems to depend on the degree of compliance of their respective populations [8, 9, 11, 12] . People living in Argentina, Chile, and Peru were more compliant with these policies than those in Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico, as the higher mobility reductions showed. As other studies have shown, this higher compliance is related to their better socioeconomic conditions, including their lower levels of poverty, lower income inequality, lower percentages of their populations with living with vulnerable jobs, and their higher average years of schooling [8-10, 21-24, 26, 27] .Better communication from their governments [9, 11, 27] and trust in their governments [28] , as shown by other studies, are additional factors that may have influenced the differential mobility reductions and the mortality rates. Argentina, Chile, and Colombia implemented swifter and more strict public information campaigns, which in turn seemed to achieve higher mobility reductions [9, 11, 21, 22] . In contrast, Brazil and Mexico did not deliver an effective communication campaign. The presidents of Brazil and Mexico minimized the severity of the pandemic at its start. ""You have to hug! It's okay!"" insisted López Obrador, the president of Mexico, at one of his press conferences. Even on 22 March 2020, he invited Mexicans to eat at restaurants and enjoy in public spaces [29] . In March, Brazil's president commented at a press conference: ""Obviously we have a moment of crisis, but it's a small crisis. From my point of view, the issue of coronavirus is much more fantasy and is not so much the case, as the great media propagates and spreads all over the world"" [30] .Results also suggest that economic and social policies specifically implemented to reduce the impact of pandemic, together with the mitigation and health policies adopted, mainly by Chile and Argentina and to a lesser extent by Peru and Colombia [18] , allowed people to comply with closure and containment policies due to income support and debt relief from their governments [21] . Argentina and Chile had stronger social protection systems in place before the pandemic started [31] , including better health system indicators such as higher public expenditures as percentage of GDP and higher life expectancy at birth, as well as lower maternal mortality rates, but higher diabetes prevalence and percentage of elderly population [20] .In addition to its effects of mobility reduction, our analysis also suggests that more swiftly adopted and strictly designed and implemented government policies seem to be associated with lower mortality rates and potentially slower growing mortality rates as other studies have shown [2, 3, 5, 9, 11, [21] [22] [23] .Responding to the outbreak more quickly, as Argentina did from 12 March 2020, at the time of the sanitary emergency declaration, along with maintaining stringency levels above 80% through the end of September 2020, including the most comprehensive contract tracing policy [18] may have contributed to keeping the lowest weekly death rates of the six countries throughout most of the period analyzed. Argentina's health system seemed better prepared given its highest percentage of public health expenditures (5.6%), lowest out-of-pocket expenditures (15.8%), highest GHSI (58.6), and its second lowest maternal mortality ratio (28.7), despite having the second highest percentage of its population older than 65 years of age (12%). In terms of its socioeconomic situation, Argentina was both the richest and the least unequal country with the highest income per capita (19,820 US PPP), the lowest percentage of its population living in poverty (10%) and extreme poverty (1.4%) and smallest GINI coefficient (40.6). The growing weekly mortality rates presented in the last month of the period studied can be explained by an adjustment in the methodology of daily deaths reported [32] .The second lowest weekly mortality rates presented by Colombia, at least through August 2020, seem also to be associated with the prompt and strict government policies. Its higher weekly mortality rates presented by September 2020 seem to be associated with the relaxation of its closure and restriction public policies [11, 17, 22] . Colombia also conducted the most comprehensive testing policy of the six countries analyzed [18] , testing anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms compared to the testing only those who both had symptoms and met specific criteria such as being admitted to a hospital, being high-risk care workers or returning from overseas. Other factors influencing this second lowest weekly mortality rates may be their second least unequal income distribution, including low out-of-pocket health expenditures (20.2%), their stronger social protection system before the pandemic [20] , and their economic support policies [21] .Brazil and Mexico presented higher weekly mortality rates than Argentina and Colombia throughout most of the study period, compared to Chile from late July 2020. This may be explained by less swift and strict implementation of mitigation policies, including the least comprehensive contact tracing policies, tracing only limited cases [9-11, 17, 22] . Mexico implemented the least restrictive policies on gatherings compared to Argentina and Peru that imposed restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or fewer [18] . These levels of responses, in turn, seem to lead to lower levels of compliance by the population in addition to the absence of an effective communication strategy from the government, as evidenced as well with the lower mobility reductions. Mexico's lower mortality rates than Chile and Peru, less populated countries, are also likely due to undercounting of deaths given the unreliability and incompleteness of their epidemiological surveillance systems as shown by recent studies [22, 33] . Other factors include a more recent declaration by authorities of the Mexican Ministry of Health [34] and Mexico's highest diabetes prevalence, one of the main risk factors for COVID-19 death identified so far, along with having the second highest poverty level of the six countries analyzed [17] .Chile's trend of weekly mortality rates during the period analyzed grew gradually until early June 2020. Then it rose until it reached its first peak on 14 June 2020, when the Ministry of Health resigned over a controversy about the country's figures for COVID-19-related deaths [35] , and its less restrictive policies, including limiting private gatherings to more than ten people. Chile also targeted social distancing measures by neighborhoods in Santiago, the nation's capital. A governance crisis that started 6 months before the COVID-19 pandemic may have undermined both government's authority and people's compliance during the first months of the pandemic. However, both socioeconomic living conditions of the population and its better health system indicators helped to better address the pandemic compared to other Latin American countries analyzed. With a new minister in place, Chile implemented stricter policies, including high rates of testing, but it only managed to lower its weekly mortality rates after the middle of July 2020 when it reached its second peak. Since then, its weekly mortality rates have decreased and have remained the lowest of the six countries throughout the rest of the period analyzed.Despite its relatively prompt and strict government policy responses through June, Peru presented the highest weekly mortality rates on 26 July and 16 August 2020, when its government policies relaxed. Since then, it again became stricter and the population complied better maintaining a downward trend towards the end of the period studied. Peru's relatively high mortality weekly rates throughout most of this period are likely due to its having the worst health system conditions and socioeconomic living conditions for the population before the pandemic [16] . Peru's 88 maternal mortality ratio per hundred thousand population is the highest compared to the other countries, ranging from 64 in Brazil to 17 in Chile. Peru's coverage of basic sanitary services of 74% is the lowest compared to higher than 90% in the other five Latin American countries analyzed [36] . Peru had the lowest income per capita (13,810 US PPP) and the highest percentage of population living in poverty (45.1) and extreme poverty (16. 3), as well as nearly 70% of its people working in the informal sector [37].The data analysis was exploratory and should be interpreted as a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the public policies implemented by six Latin American countries. The Oxford indices allow for cross-national comparisons of government responses but are not comprehensive measures of all policy options. For example, the use of face masks has not been included yet [18] . However, these data provide insights about feasible public policies and how they may help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in other settings with similar health system characteristics. Even though we considered both the socioeconomic conditions of their populations as well as the health system preparedness of each country, a quantitative multifactorial analysis is needed to better assess the effectiveness of the policies implemented. We recognize that data were aggregated at the national level while the outbreaks have been local, usually in densely populated cities in Latin America such as Buenos Aires, Bogotá, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Lima, the capitals of the six countries analyzed. More research is needed at a more granular level to better understand what works best to mitigate the pandemic. Also, case studies should be conducted to analyze in more depth the policy processes of each country, including the political dimensions, to better understand and assess the consequences of decision making and implementation of COVID-19 mitigation policies.We draw five policy lessons from the above analysis of the six Latin American health systems. The first is that timely implementation of more strict mitigation and control public policies seem to be more effective for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, as our analysis and other studies have shown.Governments should also generate reliable, credible, and useful information, so that people can adopt the appropriate mitigation measures, such as washing hands frequently, using face masks, and staying at home. This is the second policy lesson. Currently, there is an excess of false or information of little use, which generates mistrust of the governments. In Brazil and Mexico, politicians have lost the trust of their people by contradicting their experts on basic facts about the pandemic, publishing implausible numbers on COVID-19 deaths, or underestimating its impact.The third policy lesson is that using unreliable and incomplete information can lead to misguided policy making. Mexico, for example, where the government decided to gradually get back to 'normal' in June and started to loosen restrictions, still has not been able to mitigate the pandemic as well as the other Latin American countries, as of September 23, 2020; and new deaths continue to increase.The fourth policy lesson is that people are more likely to comply with closure and social distance policies when they also receive some kind of income support to reduce their mobility needs, or if strong social protection systems were in place before the pandemic started.Finally, health systems which maintain high levels of policy stringency and enforce restrictions together with income support and effective surveillance through testing policy and contact tracing will contribute more to mitigating the pandemic. Currently, this is particularly relevant, when incidence and mortality rates seem to be diminishing, and new waves of infections will rise if health systems let their guards down.","Argentina","abstract","2021-01-28",1

Manaus is the largest metropolis in the Amazon, with a population of more than 2 million and a population density of 158 inhabitants/km 2 . The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case in Manaus was confirmed on 13 March 2020 (2) and was followed by an explosive epidemic, peaking in early May with 4.5-fold excess mortality (3). This was followed by a sustained drop in new cases despite relaxation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an estimate of the attack rate in Manaus and provides a databased estimate of the extent of COVID-19 spread in the absence of effective mitigation.Given a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of 2.5 to 3.0 for Amazonas state (4), the expected attack rate during an unmitigated epidemic in a homogeneously mixed population is 89 to 94% (5) . When the percentage of infected people exceeds the herd immunity threshold of 60 to 67%, or 100 × [1 -(1/R 0 )], each infection generates fewer than one secondary case (case reproduction number R t < 1) and incidence declines. We sought to measure the SARS-CoV-2 attack rate in Manaus and to explore whether the epidemic was contained (R t < 1) because infection reached the herd immunity threshold, or because of other factors such as behavioral changes and NPIs. We compared data from Manaus with findings from São Paulo, where the first Brazilian COVID-19 cases were detected (2, 6) and both the rise and fall in mortality were slower and more protracted.We used a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; AdviseDx, Abbott) that detects immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.To infer the attack rate from antibody test positivity, we need to account for the sensitivity and specificity of the test (7) . The specificity of the CMIA is high (>99.0%) (8-10), but previous high (>90.0%) sensitivity estimates (8, 10) may not apply to blood donor screening (11, 12) for two reasons. First, most SARS-CoV-2 infections in blood donors are asymptomatic, and weaker antibody responses in asymptomatic disease (13) may lead to a lower initial seroconversion rate (i.e., more ""serosilent"" infections). Second, as a result of antibody waning, sensitivity falls over time (14) , such that test positivity increasingly underestimates the true attack rate.We used a variety of clinical samples at different time points to gain insight into the dynamics of the anti-N IgG detected by the Abbott CMIA (Fig. 1) . In samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients collected at 20 to 33 days after symptom onset, reflecting high disease severity and optimal timing of blood collection, sensitivity was 91.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 80.8% to 96.8%], which suggests that~8% of severe convalescent cases do not develop detectable antibodies. Among a cohort of symptomatic cases with mild disease also tested in the early convalescent period, sensitivity fell to 84.5% (95% CI, 78.7% to 88.9%), indicating that initial seroconversion is lower in milder cases. In samples drawn later (50 to 131 days) from the same mild disease cohort, sensitivity was lower still (80.4%; 95% CI, 71.8% to 86.8%), reflecting antibody waning. Indeed, in a subset of 104 patients with two consecutive blood draws, the signal-to-cutoff (S/C) declined over the period observed ( Fig.  1B) and among 88 individuals with a positive reading at the first time point, the mean rate of decay was -0.9 log 2 S/C units every 100 days (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.75), equating to a half-life of 106 days (95% CI, 89 to 132 days) (Fig. 1C ).Finally, we tested 1000 blood donations given in São Paulo in July 2020 in parallel, using a second high-specificity [>99.0% (15) ] immunoassay less prone to antibody waning (14) (Roche Elecsys). Of these, 103 samples were positive using the Abbott CMIA and an additional 30 were positive using the Roche assay. Assuming that all 133 samples were true positives, the sensitivity of the Abbott N IgG assay was 77.4% (95% CI, 69.6% to 83.7%) on asymptomatic blood donor samples. Samples in July were donated 4 months into the ongoing epidemic in São Paulo; accordingly, the false negatives using the Abbott assay include cases that did not initially seroconvert, as well as past infections that had subsequently seroreverted.Because specificity was high, with only one false positive result in 821 pre-epidemic donations from Manaus (Fig. 1A) , we also attempted to improve assay performance by reducing the threshold for a positive result from 1.4 S/C (as per the manufacturer) to 0.4 S/C. This resulted in 27 false positives and a specificity of 96.7% but substantially improved sensitivity at this threshold ( Fig. 1A and table S1).To estimate the proportion of the population with IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we used a convenience sample of routine blood donations made at the Fundação Pró-Sangue blood bank in São Paulo and the Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM) in Manaus. The monthly sample size and sampling dates, spanning February to October, are shown in table S2.The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in February and March was low (<1%) in both São Paulo and Manaus. This is consistent with the timing of the first confirmed cases that were diagnosed on 13 March in Manaus and on 25 February in São Paulo (2) . In Manaus, after adjustment for the sensitivity and specificity of the test (but not antibody waning) and reweighting for age and sex, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 4.8% (95% CI, 3.3% to 6.8%) in April and 44.5% (95% CI, 39.2% to 50.0%) in May, reaching a peak of 52.5% (47.6% to 57.5%) in June ( Fig. 2 and table S2). The increasing seroprevalence closely followed the curve of cumulative deaths. In São Paulo, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in blood donors also increased steadily, reaching 13.6% (95% CI, 12.0% to 8.1%) in June.Between June and October, the effect of seroreversion became apparent in both cities. In Manaus, after the peak antibody prevalence in June, the proportion of blood donors who tested positive fell steadily to 25.8% in October. Excluding extreme negative samples (<0.4 S/C), the median assay signal fell steadily from May: 3.9 (May), 3.5 (June), 2.3 (July), 1.7 (August), 1.4 (September), and 1.3 (October) (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, in São Paulo, antibody prevalence remained stable between June and October while the number of daily COVID-19 deaths also remained relatively stable, reflecting a balance between antibody waning from infections earlier in the outbreak and seroconversions following recent infections (Fig. 2C) .In Manaus, the effect of antibody waning on apparent prevalence was partially ameliorated by reducing the threshold for a positive result from 1.4 S/C to 0.4 S/C and correcting for the resulting increased false positive rate. However, the results in São Paulo were largely unchanged by this correction (Fig. 2  and table S2) .We further corrected for seroreversion with a model-based approach (see supplementary materials). Briefly, we assumed that the probability of an individual seroreverting exactly m months after recovery decays exponentially with m. We estimated the decay rate and the proportion of patients who seroreverted using the seroprevalence data from Manaus to find the decay rate that minimized the number of new cases in July and August while avoiding decreases in prevalence-that is, assuming there were few cases in Manaus in July and August and that changes in seroprevalence were due mainly to waning antibodies. The results of these corrections are shown in Fig. 2 and table S2. After adjusting for seroreversion, we find that cumulative incidence in Manaus may have reached as high as 66.2% (95% CI, 61.5% to 80.1%) in July and 76.0% (95% CI, 66.6% to 97.9%) in October. The reliability of this estimate depends on the validity of the exponential decay assumption, and in the absence of an accepted approach to account for seroreversion, these results should be interpreted with caution.To calculate infection fatality ratios (IFRs), we used the prevalence (adjusted for sensitivity and specificity, and reweighted for age and sex) in June, as this followed the epidemic peak in Manaus but preceded appreciable seroreversion. In Manaus, the IFRs were 0.17% and 0.28%, taking into consideration the numbers of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 deaths and probable COVID-19 deaths based on syndromic identification, respectively. In São Paulo, the global IFRs were 0.46% and 0.72%, respectively. The difference may be explained by an older population structure in São Paulo ( fig. S1A ). Supporting this inference, the age-specific IFRs were similar in the two cities, and were similar to estimates based on data from China (16) (fig. S1B ) and a recent systematic review (17) . We also obtained similar agespecific IFRs using the seroreversion-corrected prevalence estimates from October ( fig. S1 ).Blood donors may not be representative of the wider population. In both cities, the eligible age range for blood donation in Brazil (16 to 69 years) and the sex distribution of donors are different from those of the under-lying population (fig. S2 ). Reweighting our estimates for age and sex ( Fig. 2 and table S2 ) resulted in a slight reduction in prevalence, particularly in Manaus, where men were overrepresented among donors and also had a higher seroprevalence ( fig. S3 ). Self-reported ethnicity in donors was similar to that of the census populations ( fig. S2 ). The median income in blood donors' census tracts of residence was marginally higher than a population-weighted average for both cities (fig. S4 ). Regarding the spatial distribution of donors, there was a similar antibody prevalence across different regions sampled in both cities ( fig. S5) , and we achieved good geographic coverage in both cities (see supplementary materials and fig. S5 ).Because potential donors are deferred if they have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, increasing access to testing might have reduced the pool of eligible donors through time. However, only 2.7% of residents in Manaus and 8.5% in São Paulo reported having a PCR test performed by September ( fig. S6 ). As such, changing access to testing is unlikely to have been important. Considering these factors together, we suggest that our results can be cautiously extrapolated to the population aged 16 to 69 years in Manaus and São Paulo. Within this group, studies of blood donors may underestimate the true exposure to SARS-CoV-2 because donors may have higher socioeconomic profiles and greater health awareness and engagement, and because symptomatic donors are deferred. However, it is likely that seroprevalence in children and older adults is lower.Our results show that between 44% and 66% of the population of Manaus was infected with SARS-CoV-2 by July, following the epidemic peak there. The lower estimate does not account for false negative cases or antibody waning; the upper estimate accounts for both. R t fell to <1 ( fig. S7 ) in late April when cumulative infections were between 5% and 46% of the population. NPIs (table S3) were implemented in mid-to late March when physical distancing also increased ( fig. S8 ). It is likely that these factors worked in tandem with growing population immunity to contain the epidemic. Transmission has since continued in Manaus, albeit to a lesser extent than in April and May (Fig. 2 and fig. S7 ). From the second 3 of 4 4 S/C, to the age and sex distribution of each city; further correcting for sensitivity and specificity at this assay threshold; reweighting positive tests for age and sex at a reduced threshold of 0.4 S/C; correcting for sensitivity and specificity at this threshold; and finally correcting for seroreversion. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Gray bars are standardized daily mortality using confirmed COVID-19 deaths from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe; https://covid.saude.gov.br/) notification system and standardized by the direct method using the total projected Brazilian population for 2020 as reference. Black lines are rescaled cumulative deaths, such that the maximum is set to the maximum seroprevalence estimate for each city. week of August there has been a small increase in the number of cases (18) , which, at the time of writing, has begun to decline. Consequently, the attack rate rose to 76% in October. This remains lower than predicted in a homogeneously mixed population with no mitigation strategies (~90%). Homogeneous mixing is unlikely to be a valid assumption (19) , and behavioral change and NPIs may explain why the estimated final epidemic size has not yet reached 89 to 94%, as expected for R 0 values between 2.5 and 3.0 (4).By 1 October, Manaus recorded 2642 [1193/ million inhabitants (mil)] COVID-19 confirmed deaths and 3789 (1710/mil) severe acute respiratory syndrome deaths; São Paulo recorded 12,988 (1070/mil) and 20,063 (1652/mil), respectively. The cumulative mortality proportions were similar in both cities and high relative to other locations such as the United Kingdom (620/mil), France (490/mil), or the United States (625/mil) as of 1 October (20) . The different attack rates in Manaus and São Paulo (76% versus 29% of people infected), despite similar overall mortality rates, are due to the higher IFR in São Paulo. The agestandardized mortality ratio was 2.0 comparing observed deaths in Manaus to those expected from projecting the age-specific mortality in São Paulo onto the age structure of Manaus. The R 0 was similar in the two cities ( fig. S7 ), but cases and deaths increased and then decreased more slowly in São Paulo than in Manaus where both the rise and fall were more abrupt (fig. S7 ). The lower attack rate in São Paulo is partly explained by the larger population size (2.2 million versus 12.2 million inhabitants). As population size increases, the time to reach a given attack rate also increases (21) .The attack rate in Manaus is higher than estimates based on seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe and North America (8, 22, 23) and on recent results from Kenyan blood donors (24) . A similarly high seroprevalence (~50%) was observed in slums in Mumbai, India (25) . In Brazil, one population-based serosurvey in São Paulo (26) found a prevalence similar to that in our study (26.2% versus 28.8% in blood donors, in October). In Manaus, a lower seroprevalence (14%, in June) was found in a random household sample of 250 people (1) . But this study was not powered at the city level and used the lower-sensitivity Wondfo (27) rapid test. As such, the results are not directly comparable.Future investigations should be conducted to determine what accounted for such extensive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus. Possible explanations include socioeconomic conditions, household crowding (28) , limited access to clean water, and reliance on boat travel (1) in which overcrowding results in accelerated contagion, similar to that seen on cruise ships (29) . The young mobile population with potentially low preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (30), as well as the early circulation of multiple virus lineages introduced from multiple locations, may have contributed to the large scale of the outbreak.Our data show that >70% of the population had been infected in Manaus about 7 months after the virus first arrived in the city. This is above the theoretical herd immunity threshold. However, prior infection may not confer long-lasting immunity (30, 31) . Indeed, we observed rapid antibody waning in Manaus, consistent with other reports that have shown signal waning on the Abbott IgG assay (14, 32) . However, other commercial assays, with different designs or targeting different antigens, have more stable signal (14) , and there is evidence for a robust neutralizing antibody response several months out from infection (33) . Rare reports of reinfection have been confirmed (34) , but the frequency of its occurrence remains an open question (35) . Manaus represents a ""sentinel"" population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated. Further seroepidemiological, molecular, and genomic surveillance studies in the region are required urgently to determine the longevity of population immunity, the correlation with the observed antibody waning, and the diversity of circulating lineages. Monitoring of new cases and the ratio of local versus imported cases will also be vital to understand the extent to which population immunity might prevent future transmission, and the potential need for booster vaccinations to bolster protective immunity.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-15",1

In Brazil, the Ministry of Health confirmed on February 26 th , 2020 the first case of coronavirus in the country, and the announcement of the first death by COVID-19 on March 17 th of the same year. Up to October 3 rd , 4,906,833 confirmed cases and 145,987 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported in the country, with 1,003,428 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 36,136 deaths in Sao Paulo State 2 , the first epicenter of COVID-19 in Brazil.Since the first case of COVID-19 in the world, there has been an evolution in the understanding of how the virus spreads and what must be done to contain the viral transmission at high-risk settings. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are considered at higher risk for virus outbreaks with poorer outcomes of residents, which can be particularly devastating in low-and middle-income countries 3, 4 . In March 2020, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology and the World Health Organization recommended the suspension of external visits to residents in LTCFs 5 . Therefore, the assessment of SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence is important in the definition of heath care policies in LTCFs.Here, we present the results of a serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a population living in 15 LTCFs, following two intra-institutional outbreaks of COVID-19 in the city of Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, with a population of 139,856 inhabitants and an elderly population of 22,756 inhabitants (16.3%) 6 .Starting on May 29 th and May 30 th , 2020, two LTCFs located in the city of Botucatu experienced COVID-19 outbreaks. The first cases, in both institutions, were confirmed in women residents by RT-PCR. From June 3 rd to 25 th , the local health authority collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions to perform the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 in all elderly residents and employees (called ""Universal RT-PCR test"") from the 20 LTCFs located in the city. In this study, 20 institutions were invited and 15 (75%) agreed to participate. Only the residents were invited to participate in the serological survey. The institutions were assessed for the complexity of the care provided based on the degree of dependence of the residents. The degree of dependence and the most frequent fragility observed among residents were used to define the level of care complexity of each LTCF.The functional capacity of the elderly was assessed using the Katz index, which includes actions related to self-care (bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, the ability to eat without help, the ability to move without help for transference and continence). The total score corresponds to the sum of the 'yes' answers in relation to the items related to independence. Residents were considered independent if they reached a score between 5 and 6 points, partially dependent when the result was 3 or 4 points and highly dependent with scores of zero, 1 or 2 points 7 . Frailty was assessed by the Frail Scale, in which residents were classified as robust (0 points), prefrail (1 to 2 points), and frail (3 points) 8 and for Frail Nursing Home (Frail-NH), [robust (0 to 1 point), prefrail (2 to 5 points), and frail (6 or more points)] 9 . The presence of previous symptoms in the 14 days prior to this survey were obtained from a report by the resident or the LTCF team.The rapid serological OneStep COVID-19 tests (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co., Ltd., China) was approved by the Brazilian Regulatory Agency -ANVISA and were supplied by Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The test consists of a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay that is able to detect both, IgM and IgG immunoglobulins together, with no discrimination of the immunoglobulin isotype 10 .Blood samples were collected, processed and the serological tests were performed on serum samples. Moreover, information was collected on the demographic and clinical status of the participants, as well as the characteristics of the institutions.The rapid test kit showed sensitivity of 86.4% (95% CI: 82.4%-89.6%) and specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 97.6%-99.9%) 10 according to the manufacturer. Additionally, there was a better performance of these kits using plasma or serum samples instead of capillary whole blood 11 , so in this survey all tests were performed on serum samples.The study was reviewed and approved by both COVID-19 seroprevalence rates were calculated based on the results of the rapid serological test for each participating resident from the LTCFs. The prevalence was reported as frequencies of positive tests corresponding to a proportion of the total sample considering a 95% confidence interval.The demographic characteristics of the participants and the LTCFs were described as frequencies (counts and percentage), or their median, by age and by the rate of residents per team. Fisher's exact or chi-square tests were used to compare the rapid serological results. The Mann-Whitney test was carried out to compare the age of the population age. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). The significance level was set at 5%.A total of 209 residents (73.3% of all residents in the 20 LTCFs in the city) were tested from June 22 nd to July 8 th , 2020. Their median age was 81 years old (min 50 -max 106), 135 (64.6%) were female and 171 (81.8%) self-referred as white. Regarding their clinical profiles, 129 (61.7%) residents had between 2 and 4 comorbidities and 120 (57.4%) were using 1 to 5 medicines daily; 194 (92.8%) had no previous COVID-19 symptoms in the 14 days prior to the test. Regarding the state of dependence and fragility, 91 (43.5%) residents were dependent for three or more daily activities (Katz index) and 89 (42.6%) were considered frail (Frail-NH index). Most residents (101; 48.3%) slept in multiple accommodation (Table 1 ).An overall seroprevalence of 11.5% (95% CI: 7.5%-16.6%) was found in the population, ranging from 3.4% to 100% in seven LTCFs that presented at least one positive serological test ( Table 2 ). The highest seroprevalences of 100% and 76.9% were observed in Table 2 ). The overall positivity rate of RT-PCR among health care teams was 4.2% (7/168); confirmed cases in team members were observed only in the two LTCFs that had experienced COVID-19 outbreaks, corresponding to a positivity rate of 40% (4/10, LTCF #8) and 60% (3/5 at LTCF #14) assessed by nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal RT-PCR.The frequency of non-white ethnicity was significantly higher in residents with positive serological test compared to the negative group (p=0.041). Most residents with positive serological tests (70.8%) referred previous contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, whereas only 2.2% of residents with negative results did not report such exposure to the disease (p<0.001) ( Table 1) .More than half of all residents (113 or 54.1%) lived in LTCFs classified as level III of care complexity. Most residents in LTCFs classified as level II/III had a positive serological test (87.5%) compared to seronegative cases (59.4%) (p=0.007) ( Table 1) .The median rate of residents per health provider supervision was 1.3 (0.7 to 3.0); more than half of the LTCFs had 100% of the beds occupied, with bed occupancy rates ranging from 80.0% to 100%, and 12 (80.0%) of them with private financing. The dependency assessment showed 11 (73.3%) LTCFs classified at level III of care complexity ( Table 3) .The overall seroprevalence (11.5%) observed in the LTCF residents was relatively low, compared to some institutions in high-income countries 12 , but it varied considerably when compared to the results obtained by RT-PCR in each LTCF, probably because many residents had already recovered from the symptoms of COVID-19 or were asymptomatic carriers at some stage and had detectable antibodies at the time of serological test.Symptoms of COVID-19 in the elderly do not seem to be a good predictor of infection, since almost 93% of the residents examined did not show symptoms in the period of at least 14 days before the serological test, corroborating similar findings from other studies 13,14 . Therefore, the immediate testing of all contacts in the first positive case should be performed regardless of the presence of symptoms 15 . However, the fact that the OneStep COVID-19 test does not differentiate between IgM and IgG immunoglobulins may be a limitation for the interpretation of results during outbreaks in this population, so that other testing strategies or combined strategies should be planned. The contact with the care giver team coming from outside the institution, facility, the presence of visitors and the living conditions of the elderly make the LTCFs highly vulnerable to the transmission of COVID-19 12 . Such vulnerability can be seen in the two LTCFs that had previous COVID-19 outbreaks and had seroprevalence rates above 70% and case fatality rates of 33.3% in their residents. In addition, only in those same two LTCFs, cases of COVID-19 in health care teams were confirmed, showing a RT-PCR positivity rate of 40% (4/10, LTCF #8) and 60% (3/5 at LTCF #14). High positivity rates of COVID-19 in care giver teams of LTCFs that experienced COVID-19 outbreaks have also been observed in investigations carried out in the United States. In these studies, an average of 7.4% positivity was reported in health care teams of 15 LTCFs tested soon after an initial case of COVID-19 was identified, contrasting with the average of 1.0% positivity in care giver teams of 13 LTCFs with no COVID-19 identified 16 . In our study, the LTCFs affected by outbreaks had a higher positivity rate among their team members than observed in the literature, suggesting that specific characteristics such as living conditions (frailty and degree of dependence) of the residents in these LTCFs would require special care on the part of the health team and close contact for daily activities; however other specific risk factors for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated in these settings. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community is another important factor that may impact the number COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes 18 and should be considered in the context of investigations carried out in LTCFs during outbreaks.Most residents with a positive test for COVID-19 tend to have a higher degree of dependence, comorbidities or different levels of cognitive decline or dementia, making it difficult to comply with contingency measures 17 . In this study, among residents with a positive test, 87.5% lived in complex care institutions level III, almost half of the population (45.8%) was totally dependent on the team care for daily activities, 54.2% were considered frail and 58.3% lived in accommodation with multiple beds, which favors the spread of the disease. Even so, the low seroprevalence in this population can be explained by the restriction of visits and group activities, as well as by the implementation of hygiene protocols in the LTCFs 5 .Normally, in health institutions of high complexity frailty and extreme dependent residents imply a greater number of healthcare givers, increasing the risks of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This study showed a median rate of 1.3 residents per health team. However, there is no consensus on the impact of the proportion of resident per health team on the dissemination of COVID-19 in LTCFs settings 18, 19 .Most LTCFs investigated in this study are financed by the private sector 80%). In fact, Sao Paulo State is the richest State in the federation 20 . However, the country presents many other challenges in relation to the elderly and COVID-19.Equal acquisition and distribution of adequate personal protective equipment in quantity and quality for residents and workers, specialized training for health teams, scheduled periodic repetition of tests if someone develops symptoms or presents a positive test for the virus 17 , laboratory capacity and for the last, but not least, the assessment of the mental and emotional state of the workforce in nursing homes. Faced with a possible second wave of COVID-19, LTCFs require special attention. The literature suggests that these units should be the last ones to reopen and isolation measures including restriction of visits should continue 17 . The government should discuss special lines of credit and new financing sources directed to these institutions to ensure the adequate isolation, routine examination and adequate care of residents, reducing transmission and avoiding lethal endpoints.

A case study from Quito, Ecuador High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among food delivery riders. A case study from Quito, Ecuador","groups as possible. Delivery riders are a highly moving population that offer their services to a wide range of clients, including vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those less likely to leave their house for basic needs stoking.COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented pressure on health systems and economies worldwide (1) . With the global recommendation of keeping social distancing and the implementation of partial or total lockdowns many businesses like restaurants were forced to close. Consumers generally perceive that delivery services are safer than going into a restaurant, because reduce exposure to other people and their risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion. In this scenario delivery services have grown as an alternative source of revenue for formal businesses but also for people inserted in the gig economy (2) . This led to the question of how safe is to receive food at home or if you can get COVID-19 from packaging and food; According to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), there is little evidence to support that COVID-19can be transmitted through food or food packaging since European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has stated that food is not likely a source or route of virus transmission (3) .Delivery workers have suddenly been thrust to the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.Most of them use an app (like Uber Eats, Glovo, Mei tuan or Rappi) or a website to match with customers and provide their services. The increased mobility of delivery workers, most of them driving bikes or motorcycles, and the high number of personal contacts put their health also at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. While keeping their income, delivery workers are vulnerable because cannot rely on a stable income and are usually excluded from the labor and social protections systems offered to formal employees (4).Some mass media have reported that delivery workers are at risk of exposure to illness at work at the same rate as nurses, social workers, and paramedics. Also, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports that these workers may have increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, however, there is not enough evidence available on the risk of SARS-COV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof infection in delivery workers (5) . There are few case reports , one in Beijing China; a 47-yearold deliveryman offering services across a wide area of Beijing between June 1 and June 17 delivering around 50 orders per days (6, 7) , and another case reported in India where a pizza delivery man was positive for SARS-CoV-2, which had contact with 72 families and 17 delivery men who were quarantined (8) .An interesting factor that might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the role of the environmental and atmospheric condition in which the food riders deliver their packages (9) (10) (11) .In urban areas, where air pollution, highly pedestrian traffic, reduced wind speed and atmospheric stability are common; the risk of having contaminated aerosols floating for longer time might represent a higher risk for contagium (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . The lack of appropriate occupational health control measures among food riders and the highly risky behaviors in terms of mobility and social interaction put this population on the edge between work and safety.In order to elucidate some of the current questions and contribute to a clear gap in knowledge, our study aims describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among food delivery riders in Quito, the capital city of Ecuador in Latin-American.A Cross-sectional study to describe the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among food delivery self-employed riders in Quito, Ecuador. The study was performed in this city from having an average relative humidity of 75%. In Quito and due to its elevation, wind speed increases during the summer (June-August), having an annual average of 6.8 Km/h. According to the international developing index, Quito has a very high score of 0.821, a GDP of USD $ 15 388 and an unemployment rate of 8.2% for 2019. In this city, at least 1,700 selfemployed riders are registered in two of the biggest food delivery App-based services.A sample size calculation based on a margin error of < 5% and a confidence level of 95% assuming a response distribution of 10% among the respondents yielded a sample of 128 riders in order to achieve significance. A non-probabilistic chain referral sampling technique was used to engage volunteer-to-volunteer's participation. We have contacted three of the main food delivery apps on Ecuador and only two of them agreed to invite their riders to voluntarily participate in the study. The human resources department of each company sent out an invitation and the explanatory package to every volunteer and the directions to the Universidad de las Americas (UDLA) molecular laboratory. Upon their acceptance, 145 subjects were positively recruited for a unique nasopharyngeal swab testing to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2.The socio-demographic information was obtained from the official epidemiological record used Our data shows a high prevalence up to 15.2% for SARS-CoV-2 infection among food delivery riders in Quito, Ecuador. These results suggest that food riders might have higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that other workers, as it has been previously proposed (32, 33) . In one recently published study, Ortiz-Prado et al, 2020 described the prevalence of COVID-19 among several professions, careers and occupations, and up to April 2020. Using their publicly available data we calculated that medical doctors have a point prevalence of 13.6%, politicians 4.7%, civil security personnel 3.2% and blue collar jobs 1.5% in relationship with the total number of available information about how many professionals are registered (34). In comparison with local urban prevalence rates reported, food riders seem to have higher attack rates than the rest of the population at risk. For instance, in the city of Quito the overall attack rate was reported to be 7.14% in November 2020 and for Guayaquil, the second biggest city in pandemic. For instance, a case report from India shows that a single delivery worker tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was in contact with 72 families that need to be quarantined (8) .The proposed mechanisms for this unusually high prevalence of infection among food riders relies on several factors and residual co-factors that are hard to track. Although in the majority of scenarios delivery is done outdoors by a food rider wearing a mask, due to extenuation and the speed required to deliver on time, the riders might decrease the degree of their protection as the day continues. This is important to point out since it would be valuable to generate local or national recommendations and potential solutions to reduce the risk. For example, the delivery staff would be requested via rule/law to drop to food outside the door and inform the recipient and leave upon confirming its receipt by the client. Another option although highly implemented worldwide is to mandate online payments only. There are few studies that have shown the potential risk of handling money in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (35, 36).Around the world, different strategies have been proposed to guarantee the health of the delivery workers and of those who make use of their services, among these strategies, is Contact-free delivery, which is carried out in different ways as in the USA deliveries are left in the door of the house, or in Vietnam where delivery workers leave the meals at the designated position, standing 2 meters away to await customers (30) (31) (32) . Other strategies used are the strict use of new face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers. Delivery workers should wear new face masks and gloves, and frequently apply hand sanitizers to minimize contamination with the novel coronavirus, the use of E-Wallet (ie, digital) or credit card payment method to limit contact with delivery workers and it is also recommended that customers should discard the packaging as soon as possible and wash hands immediately after (30) (31) (32) .The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people and companies who work with breaths follow strict hygiene standards such as proper handwashing, use of alcohol-based hand J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof sanitizers, providing personal protective equipment such as masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, frequent cleaning/disinfection of work surfaces and touchpoints such as door handles (33) .We found that food delivery riders are difficult to follow-up and track. Once the diagnosis was established, results were provided individually by email or cell phone number and the results were communicated anonymously to the hiring company. However, when we wanted to get more information about other sociodemographic variables, very few agreed to share such a detail. This situation might respond to their precarious situation and their immigration status that could jeopardize the follow-up and the obtainment of information.One of the main limitation of our study is that is difficult to extrapolate our results to other cities in the world. First, not everywhere food riders share the same socio-demographic characteristics as in Quito. Second, the environmental and atmospheric conditions in which the riders work in Quito (low barometric pressure, high pollution, 75% humidity and high-speed winds during the summer) are not the same for other cities worldwide. So far, further studies are needed in order to conclude if food delivery is highly associated with an increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the social factors behind food riders are responsible for the reported significantly high prevalence of COVID-19 among food riders.The high prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 found in riders in Quito showed how vulnerable this population might be, with higher prevalence that even healthcare workers. So, this group could represents a potential source of transmission of SARS into the community at the city of Quito.Food delivery companies should implement a frequent preventive testing scheme in their employees as well as develop strategies and provide tools for safe work for themselves and customers.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fAs the results show, these people, being asymptomatic, are not aware that they are infected, representing a health risk for both the company for which they work as well as the people who use their services, they are even a risk for their own families.Since the results suggest that most of them are asymptomatic, we suggest more aggressive testing and contact tracing strategies in order to reduce the risk for other populations.All participants signed an informed consent to participate freely and voluntarily in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In Ecuador diagnosis and testing for COVID-19 does not require IRB approval and anonymous data collected can be published without restrictions as long as data is anonymized. The University received a government approval for testing for SARS-CoV-2 within its facilities and addition to access to the epidemiological surveillance system VIEPI in Ecuador.This study was funded by Universidad de Las Américas and by Fundación CRISFE (Fondo ""Sumar juntos"").None declared.To the deliverers who took the time to collaborate with the study, even setting aside time for their informal activities of distributing food and goods during the pandemic. To the Molecular Biology Laboratory at Universidad de Las Americas for providing free SARS-CoV-2 testing to all study participants and to Raul Fernandez who collaborated in the design of figure 1.

This rapid spreading of the virus led governments to adopt restrictive measures such as social distancing (i.e., limiting physical interactions with others outside of their close family and leaving their homes only when necessary). Such a strategy is used to increase preparedness of healthcare systems and to mitigate the incidence of COVID-19 cases and related deaths (Islam et al., 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al., 2020) . Notwithstanding its effectiveness, these approaches have been linked to unintended consequences such as psychological distress (United Nations, 2020; Pierce et al., 2020) . Some recent studies have reported that social distancing increased the prevalence of depression and anxiety (Pierce et al., 2020) , perceived stress (Stanton et al., 2020) , sleep disorders (Casagrande et al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020) , and self-harm (Iob et al., 2020) .An elevated burden on mental health might trigger an increase in memory complaints at the population level -another indirect consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (United Nations, 2020) . Previous studies have highlighted the association between psychological distress and subjective memory impairment (Bassett and Folstein, 1993; Smith et al., 1996) . For example, magnetic resonance imaging in patients with cognitive impairment provide similar findings to those of patients with depression, specifically in brain white matter changes (Krishnan et al., 2004; Lapteva et al., 2006) . Although the causal relationship between depression and subjective cognitive impairment is still unclear, some authors explain that depression may be a consequence of cognitive impairment, and the associated difficulties that it may cause in daily life (Panopalis et al., 2007) . Therefore, subjective memory complaints have been suggested to be used to assess brain function in large-scale epidemiological studies (Stewart et al., 2008) .Physical activity promotes several neuroprotective mechanisms, especially in the brain (Deslandes et al., 2009; Dishman et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2019) . Nevertheless, since the implementation of restrictions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, a reduction in physical activity levels has been documented in several settings (He et al., 2020; Lesser and Nienhuis, 2020; Smith et al., 2020) , regardless of the degree of social distancing adopted (i.e., staying at home all the time, go out only for essential things, or go out every day to work or another regular activity). We have been reminded that the necessity of closing gyms and sporting clubs to prevent COVID-19 spread should not offset the importance of practicing physical activity during the pandemic (de Carvalho et al., 2020) . Recent findings have demonstrated the beneficial role of physical activity during the pandemic on mental health (Pieh et al., 2020; Stanton et al., 2020) . It would stand to reason a similar relationship may be observed for physical activity and subjective memory decline; however, to our knowledge no studies have evaluated the effect of social distancing restrictions on subjective or objectivemeasured cognitive function in population-based samples. Therefore, we aimed 1) to determine whether subjective memory decline is a consequence of social distancing and 2) to evaluate the association between subjective memory decline and physical activity.The study protocol was approved by the institutional research ethics board of the School of Physical Education of the Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Brazil (protocol: 4.093.170) . The PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health) is characterized as an ambispective cohort study. Data on our primary outcome (i.e., subjective memory decline) and exposures were collected during COVID-19 social distancing to reflect two-time points: pre-COVID-19 social distancing and during COVID-19 social distancing. The period before social distancing was assessed retrospectively. More details about study design, sampling process, and data collection can be found elsewhere (Feter et al., 2020) .The inclusion criteria required participants to be an adult living in the Rio Grande do Sul state during the survey period. Sample size was calculated based on the prevalence of the three primary outcomes from this cohort (i.e. low back pain, mental health, and healthcare access). The highest sample size (N=1359) was achieved from depression prevalence (13.2%, 95%CI, 11.8%-15.0%) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Stopa et al., 2015) , southern Brazil. Further, we accounted for a possible loss-to-follow-up of 30%. Therefore, our final sample size was estimated in 1767 adults living in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.Full description of participant recruitment can be found in our previous publication (Feter et al., 2020) . Briefly, we used local media (i.e., radio, TV, newspapers), professional colleagues, social media (i.e., Facebook® and Instagram®), and contact with city and state-level agencies of health to achieve the target sample size. The recruitment phase had a total duration of four weeks (June 22nd to July 23rd, 2020).We developed an online-based, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on memory and physical activity. Questions about self-rated memory and physical activity were asked twice to assess these outcomes based on different periods (before and during social distancing).The instrument had two questions about self-rated memory. Participants were asked to rate their memory in the period before social distancing and present, using the following questions: ""How do you rate your memory before social distancing?"", and ""How do you rate your memory today?"". The options for both questions were ""excellent"", ""very good"", ""good"", ""fair"" or ""poor"". Subjective memory decline was defined as decreased memory perception. Similar questions has been used in previous epidemiological studies (Nunn et al., 2002; Vancampfort et al., 2017) .We questioned participants about physical activity levels before and during social distancing. The first question was ""Before social distancing, were you engaged in physical activity regularly?"". If the participant answered ""Yes"", then the total days and duration (minutes) of the activities during a typical week before that period were asked. The second question had the same format; however, the time-reference was the current week (during COVID-19 pandemic social distancing). This question presented a moderate agreement to classify subjects as physically active (kappa=0.63, 95%CI 0.54 to 0.72) compared to a longer questionnaire (e.g., Global Physical Activity Questionnaire) (Milton et al., 2011) .Respondents were stratified according to the World Health Organization's guidelines for physical activity (World Health Organization, 2010). Adults aged 18-64 years complete 150 min or more of moderateintensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week OR 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination were classified as physically active. Participants who did not achieve the guideline were classified as physically inactive. To explore the effects of changing physical activity on self-rated memory, we further classified participants based on physical activity classification in both periods, as follows: remained inactive, became inactive, became active, or remained active.Questions on age, gender (male, female, other/prefer not to mention), ethnicity (white and non-white), conjugal status (with or with no partner), and the highest education level achieved were assessed.The impact of the social distancing in participants' economic situation was evaluated. Participants were asked whether their monthly income was affected since the beginning of social distancing. When the answer was ""yes"", they were requested to report whether their income increased or decreased.Attitudes towards social distancing were asked by the following question: ""Regarding the social distancing that has been guided by health authorities, that is, staying home and avoiding contact with other people, how much of it do you think you are managing to do?"". The options available were ""very little"", ""little"", ""somewhat"", ""very much"" and ""totally isolated"". Participants were classified as ""fully committed"" with social distancing"" when answered ""very much"" or ""totally isolated"" to this question.Self-reported weight, height, and whether there had been a clinical diagnosis of a chronic disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, depression) were asked using the same questions from the Brazilian Surveillance System of Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Interviews (VIGITEL) (Enes and Nucci, 2019) . Weight and height were used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Based on this value, the sample was categorized into the following groups: normal (≤24.9 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m 2 ), and obese (≥30 kg/m 2 ) (World Health Organization, 2018).Mental health was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which identified symptoms of depression and anxiety, both pre-and during social distancing. This 14-item scale was designed to provide a simple and reliable tool to be used in both community settings and primary care medical practice (Bjelland et al., 2002; Snaith, 2003) . Each domain (depression and anxiety) has seven items that are scored between 0 and 3. Therefore, each domain has a maximum score of 21. Participants who scored less than 7 were classified as non-cases for that domain. Scores between 8 and 10 were considered as mild, between 11 and 14 as moderate, and between 15 and 21 as having severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) . Similar to physical activity, we compared the severity of symptoms between periods. Participants were classified with aggravated symptoms when they were classified in a worse severity group from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic.Data were exported from Google® Sheets to Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Due to a higher number of respondents from one region within the Rio Grande do Sul state (South, N=1247 [53.7%]), all analyses were weighted for the number of respondents in each region. Continuous and categorical data were reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) or proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI), as appropriate. The chi-squared test was used to compare the difference in the proportion of participants among groups. Linear trend test was carried out to verify linear trend among groups. Independent t-test was used to verify difference in mean age between groups. The conceptual framework for our hypothesis is that depressive symptoms might lead to memory decline and reduced physical activity. Therefore, we first examined whether aggravated depressive symptoms had a mediation effect on the relationship between physical activity and subjective memory decline. Mediation effect was accepted if depressive symptoms had a significant association (p<0.05) with both outcome and exposure; then, the ""khb"" test was ran, and when p<0.1, mediation effect was accepted.A multivariable Poisson regression was run to identify the impact of changing physical activity during the pandemic on subjective memory decline. The hierarchical model had two levels: In the first level, the sociodemographic variables (gender, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, conjugal status) were included in the model. In the second level was entered the variables related to the impact of social distancing on monthly income and mental health, commitment to social distancing, BMI, and diagnosed chronic diseases. Only variables with a p-value ≤ 0.20 were kept in the model. Alpha was set at 0.05 to indicate statistical significance of association between the independent variables with the outcome. We found a prevalence of subjective memory decline in 30.0% of the cohort (95CI%: 27.7%, 32.4%). This outcome was more frequently reported among younger adults, females, and those living without a partner. Further, they presented with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, aggravated mental health, and acute economic strain since social distancing. Also, most individuals with subjective memory decline reported being physically inactive during social distancing. Indeed, the proportion of respondents who reported worse depressive and anxiety symptoms during social distancing were 2.1 and 1.9 times more common, respectively, in participants with subjective cognitive decline than in non-impaired ones. Although aggravated depressive symptoms were associated with both subjective memory decline (p<0.001) and reduced physical activity (p<0.001). No mediation effect was observed (p=0.828), suggesting a direct effect of physical activity on subjective cognitive decline. Table 2 presents the Poisson regression models to examine the association between changes in physical activity behavior and subjective memory decline. Roughly one quarter (26.6% [95%CI: 24.4%, 28.9%]) of participants who meet physical activity guidelines (i.e., 150 min per week) before social distancing became physically inactive during this period. No noteworthy difference among models was noted, suggesting a consistency of the effect of physical activity on subjective memory decline. Adjusted analysis showed that participants who became inactive during the social distancing had the same probability (PR: 1.09: 95%CI: 0.88, 1.33) of reporting subjective memory decline than those who remained inactive behavior throughout the period. On the other hand, a sufficient level of physical activity reduced the likelihood of reporting this event. Participants who either became (PR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.89) or remained (PR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.93) physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report a subjective memory decline. No remarkable changes were observed when adding socioeconomic variables (Table 2) . Fig. 1 illustrates the dose-response relationship between physical activity during social distancing and subjective memory decline. We observed a continuous decrease in the likelihood of subjective memory decline as the minutes per week spent on physical activity during social distancing increases.This study aimed to identify the effect of physical activity on subjective memory decline during social distancing. We found that roughly one third of adults from southern Brazil reported worse memory since the beginning of social distancing restrictions. Furthermore, remaining or becoming physically active during such restrictions reduced the probability of subjective memory decline even when analyses were adjusted for important confounding factors such as symptoms of depression and anxiety.We observed that participants who reported subjective memory decline were female gender, had monthly income reduced, and aggravated symptoms of depression and anxiety since the beginning of social distancing. Alongside the rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths, COVID-19 pandemic has led many countries to an acute economic strain (Fernandes, 2020) . Constant concern about the future, combined with fake news (Cuan-Baltazar et al., 2020) and fear of contracting COVID-19 (Fitzpatrick et al., 2020; Ornell et al., 2020) might impair mental health. Likewise, surveys on stress levels carried out in India(United Nations, 2020), China (Fu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , and the United Kingdom (Pierce et al., 2020) during the pandemic indicated that women are at higher risk of psychological distress than men. Gender inequality in household activities led to a large burden of stress on women, who are commonly performing a double role, including managing their job and household-related activities (UNFPA, 2020) . Also, people with chronic diseases are also considered at higher risk for more severe symptoms and mortality due to COVID-19 (Baqui et al., 2020; Cummings et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2020) . The heightened stress of living with a chronic condition/s or having close friends or family with chronic conditions may increase the risk of psychological distress ultimately leading to memory complaints.The United Nations highlighted the potential risk of the pandemic on Values are reported as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Model 1: Crude analysis. Model 2: adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, living alone or with a partner. Model 3: model 2 plus change in monthly income and mental health (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms) due to social distancing, commitment with social distancing, BMI, and diagnosed chronic diseases. cognitive decline in older adults, primarily driven by social isolation and physical inactivity (United Nations, 2020). However, our data revealed that the cognition of younger age groups can also be affected, which is in accordance with other studies ( (Minds, 2020; Pieh et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020) . A possible explanation for this may be due to a fear of losing the job, since young adults are less likely to be in an established position in their careers. Furthermore, some effects of the COVID-19 pandemic might be perceived only years after the end of social distancing. Thus, urgent action on groups at higher risk are required to prevent the long-term impact of this pandemic on both younger and older populations.Despite the complexity of this relationship and the high prevalence of aggravated symptoms of depression and anxiety in our study, we found that physical activity had an important protective association with subjective memory impairment even after adjusting for such symptoms. Indeed, we observed that using different models with adjusted analyses did not affect the strength of this association. Worse depressive and anxiety symptoms during social distancing restrictions were 2.1 and 1.9 times more common, respectively, among respondents with subjective memory decline than in non-impaired participants. Physical activity is a powerful non-pharmacological strategy to reduce the risk of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic (Pieh et al., 2020; Stanton et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . This protective effect may be associated with increased availability of neurotransmitters (Jovanovic et al., 2000) and neurotrophic factors (Feter et al., 2019) which are well-known promoters of neurogenesis (Deslandes et al., 2009; Vivar et al., 2013) , angiogenesis (Duggan et al., 2016; Duggan et al., 2014; Newton and Duman, 2004) , and synaptic plasticity (Vaynman et al., 2004; Vivar et al., 2013) . Altogether, these neuroprotective mechanisms induce enhancements in cognitive performance in healthy (Cotman and Berchtold, 2002; Dishman et al., 2006) and clinical populations such as adults with mild cognitive impairment (Gates et al., 2013) and dementia (Heyn et al., 2004) . Reduced stress levels have also been found to mediate the association between increased physical activity and reductions in subjective memory impairment (Phillips et al., 2017) . However, our findings indicate that the protective effect of physical activity on memory decline is not mediated by aggravated depressive symptoms. As face-to-face interactions between participants and trainers are not recommended during social distancing, internet or telephone-based programs to promote physical activity should be encouraged to alleviate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on selfperceived cognitive function.Notwithstanding the relevance and novelty of our findings, some limitations of the present study must be acknowledged. First, the retrospective design for questions about mental health and physical activity before and during social distancing might have some degree of recall bias. Although the recall bias cannot be ruled out, the COVID-19 pandemic is such an unprecedent event in everyone' life that it can help people to clearly remember their health habits or issues, such as low back pain or physical activity practice, for example, thus reducing the risk of recall bias. Second, as face-to-face interviews were not allowed by the local ethics board, questionnaires were selfadministered. Therefore, response bias may be a limitation. Third, the use of self-rated memory could underestimate the negative impact of social distancing in cognitive function (Jungwirth et al., 2004) . Nevertheless, objective measurements of cognitive function were not possible due to such restrictions. Lastly, the proportion of participants selfdeclared white (90.6% [95%CI, 89.0% to 92.0%]) and aged 30 years or over (62.7% [95%CI, 60.2% to 65.2%]) is similar to the general population of the Rio Grande do Sul state (whites: 79%, adults aged 30 or over: 62.2%). Nevertheless, respondents with one or more academic degree is overrepresented in our sample. Data from the latest Continuous National Household Sample Survey (Continuous PNAD) (IBGE, 2020) revealed that 16.9% of adults aged 25 years or more had at least one academic degree, while in our sample, this proportion was 40.2% (95%CI, 37.8% to 42.8%). This sampling bias was expected, since data collection was online and poorer/less educated individuals have less access to the internet compared to richer/more educated people in Brazil. However, COVID-19 is likely to have had a larger impact on the lower economic groups of the population, thus our results are likely underestimated. Had our sample included a higher proportion of less educated individuals, an even higher prevalence of subjective cognitive decline may have been observed.We conclude that subjective memory decline affected one in every three adults in southern Brazil following the beginning of social distancing. However, remaining or becoming physically activity during such restrictions reduces the likelihood of this impairment. Studies with objective measurement of different domains of cognition are required to better understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive function at the population level.NF, ELC, IGR, FFR, MCS, and AJR conceived the study.

Currently, there is no end in sight to the pandemic. There is not yet a universally available vaccine and the disease had a rapid expansion in Europe, Asia and most of the American countries. Lethality is still high despite recent evidence that corticosteroids and the antiviral remdesivir may be of benefit [2] . In this regard, corticosteroids are a late intervention and it would be preferable to stop the virus prior to the development of severe viremia and an uncontrolled inflammatory response [3] . A very active search for already available drugs that may be repurposed to decrease the severity of COVID-19 so ingoing. Thus, clinical trials are exploring the impact of drugs such as statins and SGLT2 inhibitors, among others [4, 5] . However, the world attention focused on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two cheap, widely available oral drugs used to treat malaria and some autoimmune conditions [6] .Chloroquine has in vitro activity against several virus, including SARS-CoV-2 [7] . These drugs increase the pH of endosomes that the virus uses for cell entry and may also interfere with the glycosylation of the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [8] . Activities (EC50s) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are in the low micromolar range which represents the upper end of the safely achievable free plasma concentration range [8] . To avoid toxicity, dose regimens should aim to achieve whole blood concentrations below 10 µM (3.2 µg/mL), corresponding approximately to plasma concentrations <3 µM (1 µg/mL) [8] . Early optimistic reports from uncontrolled trials and the wide availability of these well-known drugs transformed them into the standard of therapy in many countries as no other weapons were known. However, data from clinical trials have not confirmed the benefit of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine neither in prophylaxis nor therapy. After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent COVID-19 when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure [9] . Moroever, hydroxychloroquine may even be deleterious. In the British ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25) [10]. Understanding the disappointing clinical outcomes despite the promising in vitro antiviral effect may help to guide therapy for COVID-19. In this regard, the decrease in endosomal pH may cause dysfunction of lysosomal enzymes, increased lysosomal size and the development of zebroid bodies, similar to those found in Fabry disease (FD), is a classical finding in chloroquine-treated patients [11] .FD is a rare X-linked disease characterized by deficient activity of the α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) enzyme due to mutations in the GLA gene. This enzyme deficiency leads to lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids possessing a terminal α-galactosyl moiety, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated metabolite, globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) [12, 13] . Endothelial cell injury is a primary driver of FD complications. Notably, Gb3 accumulation may decrease the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) [14, 15] , ultimately leading to impaired endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation, which could affect blood pressure [14] . Interestingly, FD is associated with an imbalance of redox homeostasis and increased oxidative stress, with consequent damage to cellular biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids and DNA [16] [17] [18] [19] . Gb3 may also up-regulate the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), P-selectin, and Eselectin [20, 21] . Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD consists of replacing the missing or hypofunctional enzyme by administering recombinant human α-GAL (agalsidase).Endothelial cell injury and a prothrombotic state have emerged as key pathogenic features of COVID-19. Additionally, chloroquine toxicity (i.e cardiac arrhythmia) partially overlaps with FD symptoms. Thus, the present study hypothesized that chloroquine may cause endothelial cell injury through mechanisms involving interference with lysosomal function, which could be modulated by agalsidase. The immortalized human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (ATCC CRL 2922, Virginia, USA) was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 mg/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and was maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Endothelial cells were exposed to chloroquine [22] . A dose-response curve experiments for chloroquine (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 μg/mL) and agalsidase-β (5, 10, and 15 µg/mL) for 72 h were performed. Based on the results of these experiments, 0.5 μg/mL of chloroquine and 5 µg/mL of agalsidase-β were established as experimental conditions.Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay as described previously [23] . Briefly, endothelial cells were plated into 96-well culture plates at a density of 2.5x10 3 cells per well. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced, and the cells were treated with chloroquine and agalsidase-β for 72 h. This medium was then replaced with fresh medium (100 µL/well), and 10 µL of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) solution (5 mg/mL in D-PBS) was added to each well. The plate was then further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the media was removed and replaced with DMSO to dissolve the crystals of reduced formazan, and the absorbance was then measured at 570 nm (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). All analyses were performed in triplicate.Endothelial cells were plated into 96-well plates (2.5x10 3 cells/well) and treated with chloroquine and agalsidase-β for 72 h. Next, all medium was removed, and 100 μL NR solution (40 μg/mL) was added.Journal Pre-proof Subsequently, the plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Finally, the NR-containing medium was removed, the cells were washed with 150 μL PBS per well, and 150 μL of developer solution (1% glacial acetic acid, 48% ethanol) was added. The absorbance was measured using a 540 nm filter spectrophotometer [24] . NR stains lysosomes as color is pH-dependent. After the NR assay, the solution was removed from the wells and washed once with PBS (200 μL/well). Next, 100 μL of violet crystal solution (0.25 mg/mL) was added per well, and the plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature (22°C). Then, the wells were washed 2x with PBS and solubilized with 33% acetic acid. Finally, the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 570 nm.The result was obtained by normalizing the NR test to the violet crystal. Three experiments were performed in quintuplicate.The LysoTracker fluorescent probe was used for visualization of acid organelle inclusions such as lysosomes since lysosome size is related to amount of inclusions. The cells were plated on coverslips and were treated with chloroquine and agalsidase-β as described above. The treatment medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS. Next, cells were incubated for 90 min at 37°Cwith 50 nM of LysoTracker probe diluted in culture medium and subsequently washed twice with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and washed again with PBS. The coverslips were mounted on histological slides with Fluoromont-GTM and DAPI mounting medium, sealed with formaldehyde-free color enamel, and observed under a Nikon A1RSiMP confocal microscope (NIKON, Tokyo, Japan). Three experiments were performed in duplicate.DCFH-DA, a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye, was used to measure ROS production (mostly peroxides), and NO was assessed using the NO-specific fluorescent probe DAF-FM Diacetate.Endothelial cells (2. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical packages JMP (version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C., USA) and SigmaStat (version 3.5; Systat software Inc., Erkrath, Germany).Comparisons between groups were performed using a Student's t-test or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for paired data and using Mann-Whitney and ANOVA on Rank's for unpaired data. Values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Three or five independent experiments were performed. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.To select an appropriate chloroquine concentration, a dose-response curve experiment was Once an endothelial cell culture system was established that was clinically relevant from the point of view of the chloroquine concentration used, a dose-response curve experiment was performed to verify the concentration of agalsidase-β required to reduce the accumulation of acid organelles in endothelial cells treated with chloroquine. There was a significant increase in acid organelles (P<0.0001) in cells treated with chloroquine at 0.5 μg/mL compared to levels in control cells.Endothelial cells treated with agalsidase-β at 5 μg/mL and chloroquine at 0.5 μg/mL exhibited a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof significantly lower accumulation of acid organelles than observed after chloroquine alone (P<0.0001) ( Figure 2 ). This 5 μg/mL concentration of agalsidase-β did not significantly alter cell viability (data not shown).To visually qualitatively assess lysosomal inclusions after treatment with chloroquine and/or agalsidase-β, lysosomes were labelled using the LysoTracker probe. Endothelial cells treated with media alone were used as negative controls ( Figure 3A and 3B ). As shown in Figure 3C To investigate the chloroquine and agalsidase-β effect on oxidative stress in endothelial cells, we evaluated intracellular ROS levels using the DCFH-DA probe. Figure 4 shows that chloroquine significantly (P<0.05) induced ROS production compared to that of control untreated endothelial cells.Additionally, agalsidase-β significantly decreased ROS production (P<0.0001) in endothelial cells treated with chloroquine as compared to chloroquine alone. As a further control, pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC reduced cellular ROS levels in cells exposed to chloroquine (P<0.0001) and or chloroquine/agalsidase-β (P<0.05).Chloroquine decreased in NO production (P<0.01) in endothelial cells ( Figure 5 ), while co-treatment treated with agalsidase-β and chloroquine simultaneously significantly increased NO production compared to chloroquine alone (P<0.05). As a control, L-NAME, an inhibitor of eNOS activity, also reduced NO levels (P<0.001).Journal Pre-proofThe main findings of the present study are that chloroquine at in vitro test concentrations for COVID-19 causes lysosomal dysfunction and endothelial cell injury possibly through inhibition of the activity of the enzyme α-galactosidase ( Figure 6 ). Chloroquine induced the accumulation of acidic organelles, increased ROS levels, and decreased NO production, while agalsidase-β reverted these manifestations of endothelial cell stress.Chloroquine was a short-lived promise for the treatment of COVID-19. Its low cost, widespread availability and perceived low toxicity made it part of most initial therapeutic regimens against COVID-19 as soon as non-controlled reports suggested its efficacy possibly due to its inhibitory effect on coronavirus replication in vitro [6] . However, formal trials did not support its clinical efficacy [25, 26] .There are different potential explanations for the lack of efficacy in an in vivo setting, such as low in vivo drug exposure, limited by toxicity. We have now addressed a further hypothesis, that any potential benefit of chloroquine may be offset by an adverse impact on the endothelium. In this regard, the high mortality of severe COVID-19 has been related to micro-or macrothrombosis, i.e. to endothelial cell injury [27] [28] [29] . Although chloroquine was known to induce glycolipid deposits in lysosomes, the impact of this phenomenon on endothelial cell function had not been explored. The effect of chloroquine on decreasing NO production and increasing ROS levels are at least partially due to its inhibitory effect on the GLA gene encoding α-galactosidase A in endothelial cells [20] , as demonstrated by the improvement of the chloroquine-induced endothelial cell dysfunction afforded by exogenous agalsidase. Importantly, chloroquine-induced endothelial cell stress was observed to be lethal at high concentrations. In this regard, this toxic effect might occur earlier in previously damaged cells, as is might be the case of infected endothelial cells or endothelial cells exposed to complementmediated injury or hyperinflammation-induced injury in COVID-19 [30, 31] .Although the present study was focused on endothelial cells, it is likely that the findings can be extended to other cell types. Thus, given that chloroquine-induced endothelial cell stress was responsive to agalsidase, it is likely that α-galactosidase A hypoactivity is a contributor. As this enzyme is ubiquitously present throughout the body cells, it is then likely that target organs of COVID-19, such as the kidneys, the heart and the lungs may be adversely affected by chloroquine-induced cellular dysfunction in the course of the disease. Indeed, these cells were previously shown to accumulate glycolipids in individuals treated with chloroquine [6, 7] . Thus, one may hypothesize that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof COVID-19-induced cell injury may lower the threshold for chloroquine-induced cytotoxicity which may in turn potentially aggravate the severity of COVID-19-induced tissue injury. Overall, our findings and hypotheses may explain at least in part the lack of benefits, as well as the potential harmful effect, of chloroquine in the clinical setting despite its antiviral activity in vitro.We recognize that our study has some shortcomings. The expression and activity of α-GAL in the presence and absence of chloroquine and agalsidase-β were not evaluated. Moreover, it would had been interesting to use other cell viability assays such as Annexin V/PI and 7-AAD. To deeply assess oxidative stress, other methods could be used, such as lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation/nitration. Additionally, only one cell type was examined. However, as COVID-19 has been pointed as an endothelial disease [32] and endothelial cells are present in all target organs of COVID-19, reinforces the importance of using an endothelial model of chloroquine toxicity unlike other cell types that are organ-specific. Thrombosis and/or endothelial dysfunction are shared events of the different target organs of COVID-19 [3] .In conclusion, chloroquine may lead endothelial dysfunction due to oxidative stress and decreased NO production secondary to lysosomal accumulation of fatty acid substrates due to αgalactosidase A hypoactivity. Given the magnitude of endothelial cell injury in COVID-19, this adverse effect of chloroquine may contribute to its lack of clinical efficacy despite promising cell culture data. Endothelial cells were exposed to chloroquine (0.5 μg/mL) and/or agalsidase-β (5 μg/mL). NO levels were determined immediately by measuring fluorescence (λEx 495 nm, λEm 515 nm). ** P<0.01, chloroquine vs. control; * P<0.05, agalsidase-β and chloroquine vs. chloroquine; *** P<0.001, chloroquine with L-NAME (100 µM) vs. chloroquine; ## P<0.01, chloroquine with L-NAME (100 µM) vs.agalsidase-β and chloroquine. NO production in untreated control cells was considered to be 100%.Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of four independent experiments.This study has shown that chloroquine is toxic to endothelial cells higher dose may induce endothelial cell death and it is likely that lower doses may be lethal for cells that have been previously damaged. A lower non-lethal but clinical relevant concentration promoted lysosomal dysfunction evidenced by increased lysosomal size, previously shown to correspond to glycolipid accumulation [11] . This was associated with oxidative stress and decreased production of the vasodilatory molecule NO. A contributor to lysosomal dysfunction appears to be a hypoactivity of α-galactosidase A, as a recombinant for of the human enzyme, agalsidase, was protective. Overall, these changes may contribute to endothelial cell injury and dysfunction that has been identified as a key contributor to organ injury in COVID-19. Thus, while chloroquine may decrease viral replication one hand but promote a cytotoxicity that may be potential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Brazil","first author","2021-01-21",1

In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) for populations and health professionals, products such as mechanical respirators have become essential to combat the deadly impact of the pandemic. The disease has spread to more than 160 countries, infecting millions of people globally. Estimates of severe cases have been the main concern of health authorities worldwide [2] .This global health emergency has demanded urgent responses to lessen the impact of the pandemic, forcing the international scientific community to develop and improve interventions that can assist public policies in slowing the spread of the pandemic in their communities. In Brazil, the research, development and innovation (RD&I) sectors have suffered severe budget cuts since 2018 [3] . Recently, government officials have denied scientific findings by saying ""So what!"" as described in The Lancet editorial, ""COVID-19 in Brazil: So What?"" [4] . However, universities and public research centers have remained focused on their social responsibility and have continued to work diligently to help control and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, using a voluntary work force and the existing research infrastructure in a clear demonstration of strong institutional resilience.On February 26, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Brazil. By May 15, when we conducted this survey, 218,000 confirmed cases and 14,000 deaths due to COVID-19 had been reported. These figures had jumped to six million cases and 175,000 deaths by December 2020; with regard to the number of cases and deaths, Brazil ranks third internationally. This illustrates the challenge facing our public Unified Health System (SUS) in providing universal access to care and universal health coverage, as recommended by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) [5] and guaranteed by the Brazilian Constitution, to an estimated population of 211 million in a country with a vast territory and wide regional and social inequalities [6] .Given this context, this article investigates how the Brazilian scientific community responded during the very early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic.The Brazilian science and technology (S&T) system is composed of public universities and public research centers; this helps to explain how health research has developed in Brazil over time. Research in the area of COVID-19 shows that even with the scarcity of funding, universities and public research centers support national scientific development.In Brazil, scientific research in the field of public health in the early twentieth century encouraged the development of the national health research systems [7] , starting with the creation of public research centers such as the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro in 1900 and the Butantan Institute in São Paulo in 1901. The creation of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC) followed shortly thereafter, in 1916. The history of Brazil's health research system is intertwined with the creation of a network of publicly funded universities. The first public university was Amazonas Federal University, founded in 1909, followed by substantial federal government investments that led to the creation of 36 universities by 1974. After three decades of stagnation and deterioration , investments in higher education accelerated substantially under Presidents Lula and Dilma (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) . They launched the ""Restructuring and Expansion of Federal Universities Project, "" REUNI (2003-2012), which created 15 new universities, in addition to refurbishing installations, infusing the faculty with qualified researchers, increasing available spaces for students in undergraduate courses, expanding the availability of evening courses and promoting pedagogical innovations, all with the aim of reducing social inequalities in the country [8] . In fact, 23% of the existing federal universities started during this period, resulting in an unprecedented democratization of access to high-level education. At present, this network of public universities encompasses 68 highly qualified and autonomous universities that are completely free (unlike universities in the United States and European countries) and offer scholarships (tax-free) for undergraduate and graduate (masters, doctoral) students as well as postdocs. In addition, there are 41 public universities maintained by state governments and five financed by municipal governments. This network of 114 institutions [9] is undoubtedly an important and integral part of the scientific and cultural heritage of the nation [10] .The implementation of the national science and technology policy started in 1951, with the creation of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), which contributed to transforming universities and public research centers into vectors for RD&I. From 2004 to 2014, the coordinated efforts of the Ministry of Health's Department of Science and Technology (DECIT), CNPq and CAPES encouraged the establishment of a health science, technology and innovation policy [11] . In addition, an agenda of health research priorities was generated and implemented, with 3586 projects financed [12] . Starting in 2004, federal RD&I investments were also on the rise. A recent report from the Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) analyzed RD&I expenditures from 2000 to 2020. Prior to 2004, the expenditures amounted to approximately R$4 million per year. This amount increased steadily, reaching R$13 million in 2015, but afterwards sharp reductions occurred, and by 2018 the budget had been reduced to R$5.1 million [3] .Brazil ranked 13th in international scientific publications in 2015 [11] . The development of the public university research infrastructure, as mentioned before, together with federal RD&I investments from 2004 to 2015 were decisive factors facilitating the achievement of this rank [3] .Because of the COVID-19 public health emergency, societies in virtually all countries had to organize their flow of production and innovation in the hope of reducing the impact on the health systems and guaranteeing adequate health care for the population. The RD&I sectors in each country have assumed the immense responsibility of generating the domestic responses to reduce the impacts on the healthcare and economic systems of their regions because, given the magnitude of this pandemic, imports of healthcare products and supplies are limited by the scarcity of products on the international market. Those countries with established health production systems (that involve different production chains) are more likely to avoid shortages of raw materials and finished products that are essential for combatting the pandemic.However, in Brazil, the knowledge generated by ongoing research that led to Brazil ranking 13th in terms of scientific publications did not lead to proportional advances in the development of organizational processes and technologies. This could explain why, in 2016, Brazil ranked 69th on the Global Innovation Index. During the pandemic, Brazilian universities struggled to overcome the wide disparity between the high level of production of scientific knowledge and the low level of scientific innovation. In the ""ecosystem"" of economic and social development in which the production sector and government participate, the university sector must play a fundamental role in transforming knowledge into solutions that confer benefits to society [13] .From 2004 to 2015, a concerted effort was made in Brazil to stimulate the triple helix model of innovation, which describes the interactions among universities, industries and governments [14] . Such interactions are considered key to innovation in increasingly knowledge-based societies, such as China, as well as in other developing countries [15] . The paradigm known as the Brazilian health economic-industrial complex (HEIC) considers the health sector to be part of the production and innovation system that generates wealth and jobs; this concept was present in the advancement of SUS in recent decades, during which it operated in accordance with the market. The rationale that guided the public policies resulting from this paradigm emphasized the systemic approach and the use of states' purchasing power to push sectorial development [16] . From this point of view, the health sector is part of the developmental agenda and supports innovation and economic development through health industrial complexes [17] .Given this context, this article investigates how the Brazilian scientific community has responded to the threat of COVID-19. The knowledge accrued by universities, institutes and public health research centers was challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the scientific sector responded immediately by producing health solutions to mitigate the destructive progress of the ongoing pandemic. We intend to show the immediate response and commitment of the Brazilian scientific community. Most of these actions were taken as the result of the scientists' own initiative and desire to meet the most urgent needs of the population affected by COVID-19, and not in response to specific calls for proposals.To analyze the actions taken by Brazilian scientists to meet the needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we collected official RD&I projects carried out by 114 Brazilian public universities (plus Fiocruz and Butantan), as reported on their institutional websites (access May 10-15, 2020). Additionally, we examined all the studies on COVID-19 that had been submitted to and approved by the National Comission for Research Ethics (CONEP) as of May 15, 2020 [18] . Third, we analyzed all the RD&I proposals available on the Ministry of Education official website on May 15, 2020, which were obtained with webscraping computational tools.We then analyzed and classified the projects into categories according to information obtained from the proposals' titles and/or summaries. The following categories emerged:Basic research on disease mechanisms: genetic sequencing, viral mutations, physiopathology, immunological profiles and clinical manifestations of COVID-19.Epidemiologic research: distribution and evolution of the disease, risk factors for COVID-19.Development and innovation (D&I), organized into five subcategories: (a) personal protective equipment (PPE): face shields, masks, disinfection mechanisms; (b) medical devices: respirators, ventilators, mobile ICUs; (c) diagnostic tests: novel tests, rapid tests, alternative body fluid samples, test accuracy; (d) vaccines: development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); (e) medications and therapy: drugs, novel treatments for COVID-19.Other types of projects: research relevant to COVID-19 and its social, psychological and economic consequences.The projects under the category of D&I demonstrate the potential for developing new technologies, resulting in the transfer of technology from universities to the production sector and interactions with the health economic-industrial complex.There was a rapid reaction from Brazilian scientists; the search on the official websites of each of the 114 public universities, which are distributed throughout Brazil, retrieved information on 551 R&D projects, the majority of which originated in the Southeast region. Table 1 presents the research projects, classified into categories as described before. With regard to the four broad categories, the majority of proposals (n = 280) were D&I projects that focused on PPE, medical devices, diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines, which were rapidly identified as research priorities by the scientific community. These topics are extremely important under the current circumstances for the development of the health economic-industrial complex and the Brazilian capacity to attend to health needs [16] .The initiatives indicate a focus on translational health research [19] involving the transfer of knowledge generated in the basic sciences to the production of new products such as medicines, equipment, PPE, diagnostic tests and innovative treatment options. These 280 projects aim to bridge the gap between bench research and its application in health [19, 20] .The map of the Brazilian geographic regions in Fig. 1 shows the distribution of research proposals developed by public universities, stratified by the project categories. Public universities from all Brazilian regions were involved. The Southeast and Northeast regions accounted for 55.0% and 16.1% of the proposals, respectively. The Central West, South and North regions accounted for 13.2%, 11.9% and 3.8%, respectively. In terms of financial support, there was information on 140 projects that received funding, 116 of which were developed by federal universities and 24 led by state universities. The project category most likely to receive funds was D&I (25.7%), especially vaccine development (50.0%), as such projects present the health solutions most in line with the urgent needs of the healthcare system ( Table 2 ). At the time of our data collection, the number of research proposals that had received funding was relatively low. This first analysis showed that despite inadequate funding, the Brazilian D&I sector offered scientific and technological options capable of strengthening the health production chain in response to the public health emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19.Out of the 789 research projects included and analyzed, there were only 10 vaccine projects (50% of which were financed). Considering the highly sophisticated laboratory facilities and clinical requirements for vaccine development, this is reasonable. However, there is evidence that the most promising vaccines for SUS and for the Brazilian population may come from two of these vaccine trials. One candidate vaccine based on the spike (S) glycoprotein is developed in partnership with Oxford University in the United Kingdom. The phase III study is under way and plans to enroll more than 30,000 volunteers worldwide. Brazil will participate in the tests, providing approximately 2000 volunteers under the supervision of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) [10] and Fiocruz [21] . This partnership involves the production, by Fiocruz, of 100 million doses of the vaccine for the Brazilian population; 30 million doses could be available in December 2020/January 2021 [21] . The other trial was of the CoronaVac vaccine, developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, which involved 9000 volunteers in São Paulo, Brazil, in the final phase III trial. If proven effective and safe, national production will commence immediately due to technology transfer agreements with Butantan in São Paulo. The provision of doses to the SUS will be possible as early as June 2021 [22] .There are 211 projects classified as epidemiologic research, which include the development of several observatories, surveillance systems and mobile phone apps for COVID-19 monitoring at the local and national levels, especially for vulnerable populations. One example is MONITORA COVID-19, developed by Fiocruz (https ://bigda ta-covid 19.icict .fiocr uz.br/), and another is the COVID-19 BR Observatory, established by the Federal University of ABC (https ://covid 19br.githu b.io/).The COVID-19 health emergency is reminding all members of the scientific community of the reasons we embarked on research careers: we know that research is vital and valuable and can save lives. During this crisis, we are accelerating research production [23] . It is reassuring that society has come to recognize the fundamental role of solid scientific evidence [24] .Strong mobilization of the Brazilian scientific community took place in a very short time to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, presenting 789 scientific proposals to address the most urgent problems posed by the pandemic. The interaction of universities, industries and governments is essential. In the absence of this linkage in Brazil, it is virtually impossible to perform translational research, that is, to take the results from the bench to the bedside, and from there to the healthcare system. It is necessary to enhance and encourage the interaction between universities and public research centers, which are involved in the production of scientific knowledge, and private companies, which specialize in production on an industrial scale. However, it must be emphasized that the rapid response observed in this survey was only possible due to decades of investment in the RD&I system in Brazil. We need to reinforce and protect this system from austerity policies that disregard health and knowledge as crucial investments for Brazilian society, in line with the constitutional right to universal health access and universal health coverage.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-21",1

Later, it was established that the new entity was a novel type of coronavirus, which received the name of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . Within a few months, this disease spread through the five continents turning the epidemic into a pandemic [3] . In Bolivia, the first case was diagnosed and notified in March, with a rising number of new cases since then [4] .Coronaviruses are similar to the influenza virus, due to its contagion and its high transmissibility and they have triggered epidemics, such as SARS-CoV in 2002-2004 [5] and the MERS-CoV in 2015 [2, 6] . The experience of these previous epidemics shows that a modification in behavior to adopt protective measures is required, such as the use of masks, washing hands, and isolation, principally among the affected populations [7] . Furthermore, social media has become a firsthand information channel during epidemics and more so in the pandemic. People can obtain new data about the disease and the current situation to share it with others. Its role in previous epidemics has been studied, demonstrating that social media information can influence people's own risk perception and behaviors [8, 9] . In this new scenario, the traditional media has reported the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic and social media has assumed an important role in the faster diffusion of information and further and in some cases with fear-mongering [10] . The challenge with such an infodemic we are experiencing is not to get people informed but to get people informed with accurate information that enables them to act properly [11] . Risk perception would motivate individuals to adopt new attitudes and behaviors in order to protect their health [12, 13] . A model explored during the MERS epidemics concluded that risk perception was influenced by social media promoting two selfrelevant emotions; fear and anger. At the same time, risk perception was also related to the adoption of protective behaviors such as social distancing and mask use [8] . Facing the new pandemic, the role of social media and risk perception in the implementation of protective measures against the COVID-19 is still unknown.More than a seventeen million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide. Facing this health emergency, in Bolivia, as in other countries, a nationwide quarantine has been established on a mandatory basis since March 22th, 2020 (Decrees 4196 and 4199) in addition to mask use and hand washing [4, 14] Accomplishment of the control measures was a challenge and its reception has been heterogeneous among the population. We hypothesize that the acceptance of the preventive measures could be explained by risk perception and social media exposure. We therefore aimed to investigate the factors associated with risk perception to COVID-19. We also explored the association among risk perception with preventive attitudes and behaviors during the first stage of this epidemic in La Paz and El Alto.We conducted a cross sectional study in La Paz and El Alto in La Paz department, in Bolivia. La Paz is the second department with highest incidence of COVID-19, corresponding to 12.35% of the cases reported until April 9, 2020 [15] . The study included participants aged 18 years old or older, with residence in either of the cities mentioned above.We launched an online survey through social media, available since April 29th to May 9th of 2020. The questionnaire was adapted from Oh et al. study [8] and structured in four sections including 1) sociodemographics and clinical history; 2) social media exposure; 3) risk perception, 4) attitudes and behaviors to prevent COVID-19 including the acceptance of a future vaccine.To assess risk perception we used a 7-item Likert scale, 1 corresponding to totally disagree and 7 to totally agree, for the following questions: The COVID-19 problem is serious to me; I am worried being affected by the new virus; it is probable that I will be affected by COVID-19; I feel that COVID-19 is dangerous. The mean of the four questions was summarized in low (1-3), mild (4-5) and high risk perception (6-7). We assessed attitudes toward COVID-19 asking about hand washing, alcohol gel use, mask use, social distancing (aligned with the current WHO and Bolivian Health Ministry recommendation) using a 7-item Likert Scale. Preventive behaviors toward COVID-19 included mask use and hand wash frequency. Acceptability of a future vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with two questions using a 7-item Likert Scale, these questions were: Do you agree with vaccines as a preventive measure toward diseases? Would you use a covid-19 vaccine if it were available?. A third question asked about their use of flu vaccines: Were you vaccinated towards the flu? with three possible answers: 1) never in the life; 2) yes, this year; 3) yes, but not this year.Social media exposure to COVID-19 information in the week before the survey was assessed using a Likert scale of 5 points (1 = never and 5 = always) with the following questions: ""How much information have you seen about COVID-19 on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter or You-Tube?"". Furthermore, we evaluated the emotions (fear and anger) caused by the information with a Likert scale going from 1 never to 7 all the time. Other covariates, such as age, gender, schooling, employment status, health clinical history and having a relative infected by COVID-19 were considered for the analysis.For statistical analysis, we use descriptive measures to summarize the principal results. The bivariate association was evaluated using Pearson's χ2 test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Likert scales variables that did not have a normal distribution. There were defined as significant p-values < 0.05. A multivariable analysis (models that have two or more outcome or dependent variables) was developed in two-stages. First, we performed a logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with high-risk perception, including social media exposure, clinical history, sociodemographic characteristics. Fear and anger were included, adjusting the logistic regression as intermediate variables linked with social media exposure. In a second-stage, a structural equation model (SEM) with confirmatory factorial analysis was used to describe the direct and indirect relationships in our theoretical model that included social media exposure, feelings experienced, risk perception and preventive behaviors and attitudes including the acceptance of a future vaccine. For the SEM analysis, a confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) was developed and three latent variables were created related to risk perception; preventive attitudes and behaviors; and vaccine acceptance with the questions that evaluated these domains. On the other hand, social media exposure, fear and anger were included as single variables. The analysis was performed using R Statistical Software version 3.1.6 using the tableone package to table generation [16] , Stats package to develop the logistic regression [17] , and the Lavaan package for SEM analyses [18] .The study was approved by the Emergency Epidemiological Committee formed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic at the school of medicine from the Higher University of San Andres and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of The Declaration of Helsinki. Participants read and accepted a consent document online before completing the online survey. All participant data were anonymized. This study was conducted after the written consent of the anonymous volunteer participants was obtained.A total of 1100 participants answered the questionnaire; we excluded 214 participants who lived outside the study area. Of the 886 participants included, 673 (76.0%) lived in La Paz and 213 (24.0%) lived in El Alto, the most common group age was 18-25 years old (73.4%), 577 (65.1%) were female, 255 (28.8%) had a formal job. Social media exposure to COVID-19 information in the week before the survey was high, only 6.2% said that they did not receive information about the pandemic on social media (Table 1) .Risk perception to COVID-19 was high in 304 (34.3%) participants and low or moderate in 582 participants (65.7%) (Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Risk perception was associated with female sex (p<0.001), a high social media exposure (p = 0.002), and fear experience (p<0.001) about COVID 19 information in social media (Table 1) . Regarding vaccination, acceptance to a future vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 was high in 481 (54.3%) and moderate in 264 (29.8%) participants. In contrast, this year only 6% of the participants had been vaccinated for influenza and 65.8% had received the vaccine before, but not the current year. Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine if one were available was associated with a high risk perception (p<0.001) ( Table 3) . Participants with positive preventive attitudes (aligned with current recommendations) were more likely to have a high-risk perception (p < 0.001 in all attitudes evaluated). Also, data related to mask use (p <0.001) and high frequency of washing hands (>15 times per day) (p = 0.014) were superior in participants with a high risk perception. The high-risk perception group showed a superior acceptance to vaccination in general (p <0.001) and to a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (p <0.001) ( Table 4 ).In the multivariate analysis, we found that being female increased 50% the chances of having a high risk perception (aOR of 1.5; CI 95% 1.1-2.1). Higher exposure to COVID-19 information on social media was also associated with 2.5 times more chances of having higher risk perception (aOR 2.5; CI95% 1.3-5.3) ( Table 5 ). The Structural equation model had an acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.030; CFI = 0.989; TLI = 0.986). Factor loadings (β) can be interpreted like a regression coefficient. For each unit increase in a latent variable (risk perception; preventive attitudes and behaviors; and vaccine acceptance) the model predicts a increase with the associated variable if was associated positively or decreases if the association was negative (Fig 2) . We could observe that social media exposure is related with fear and anger. Fear was positively related with risk perception (β = 0.226, p < 0.001), while anger was negatively related (β = -0.098, p < 0.005). Risk perception is associated positively with preventive behaviors and attitudes (β = 0.605, p < 0.001), and with the acceptance of a vaccine if one were available (β = 0.388, p < 0.001) (Fig 2, Table 6 ). Fear was associated with preventive behaviors and attitudes, although this association was negative and weak (β = -0.053, p = <0.001). Other associations in the Structural equation model show the same direction as the binary logistic regression, where social media exposure is indirectly related with risk perception through fear experience Washing hands frequency on the last day, n (%) (Fig 2) . Additional information related to the develop of the three latent (risk perception; preventive attitudes and behaviors; and vaccine acceptance) used in the SEM are summarized in the S1 Table.We found that high exposure to COVID-19 information on social media is associated with higher risk perception, moreover, fear and anger could influence the shaping of this risk perception. Women were 50% more likely to perceive themselves at risk to COVID-19 when compared to men. Higher risk perception is associated with preventive behaviors and attitudes, including a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance. The adoption of preventive behaviors and control measures has been fundamental to overcoming previous epidemics, but the success of these actions relied on the population response. Our findings corroborate the literature, risk perception is an important factor that influences the population's willingness to adopt behaviors such as mask use, frequent hand washing and physical distancing [19] [20] [21] , especially in a scenario surrounded by uncertainties at the beginning of the epidemic in Bolivia. During the MERS outbreak in 2015, a study determined that social media exposure to the outbreak information influenced risk perception and population behaviors [8, 9] . Furthermore, similar to our results, social media exposure was positively associated with fear and anger [8] . Experiencing fear during COVID-19 pandemic has been previously reported, and also associated with positive preventive behaviors [22] [23] [24] . We also observed that fear was positively associated with risk perception, while anger was negatively associated with risk perception. Anger is related to an optimistic position regarding potential risk [25] , as consequence people are confident in controlling the risk and tend to minimize their own risk [8, 21, 25] . Even though COVID-19 was an uncertain and uncontrollable for a while, by the time that the first cases were reported in Bolivia, information about successful experiences of other countries was available [26] . We also observed that fear had a stronger influence on risk perception when compared with anger, as has been previously described in literature [8] . Depoux et al. recommend social media as a tool for information, and in China it was used as a disclosure tool for quarantine, giving advice to the population. Also, social media can help reduce social distancing and mental health problems encountered by people forced into quarantine [10, 25] .Females were more likely to perceive themselves at risk, which is consistent with other studies conducted in previous epidemics [8, 20] . A recent study that surveyed people of ten countries on risk perception of COVID-19 found that being male was associated with lower risk perception and the same pattern was observed in many countries [27] . This is interesting because the novel coronavirus tends to have a more severe and deadly presentation in men. It is unclear whether these higher fatality rates derive from biological or behavioral differences, or if it is due to the heterogeneity of the current data [28, 29] . However, male risky behaviors such as ignoring health preventive measures, smoking and not considering symptoms seriously could be contributing to this difference [29] . Acceptance of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 if available, 54% of the participants thought they would and 30% thought they might. The structural equation analysis showed that acceptability is associated with risk perception; it means those who perceived higher risk were more likely to accept the vaccine. As described before, risk perception is heterogeneous and varies according to the disease, the context, and participants. A study conducted in Germany explored attitudes toward the Ebola vaccine and the findings showed a low proportion of people who would actually use the vaccine [30] . These results can stem from the fact that the Ebola epicenter stayed in Africa. A study conducted in Poland where no cases of Èbola were registered, 97% of the participants affirmed that Èbola disease was mortal but just 15% would use a vaccine [31] . This scenario would change if they traveled to to a country where this disease were endemic, 92.5% affirmed that in that case they would use the vaccine [31] . People had the information but the mediator to take an action was risk perception. A recent study investigated the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in France, a country where vaccination was widely rejected. The authors observed that 77.6% of the participants would certainly or probably use the vaccine. The acceptance of a future vaccine was associated with individual risk perception, principally in those groups that are known to be highrisk such as health care workers and the elderly [32] . However, this scenario can change if the number of cases decreases when COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. It is surprising that barely 6% of the participants declared that they had received the influenza vaccine this year and only 65.8% indicated that they had had it sometime in their lives. A study that assessed the relationship between social media use and influenza vaccine uptake found that despite the fact that social media was not a main source of health information, it has a potential role in shaping behaviors to increase influenza vaccination rates [12] . Furthermore, influenza vaccination lessons could be useful when COVID-19 vaccines become available [33] , as we could observe, a high percentage of this Bolivian population had been vaccinated against the flu virus before.Limitations of our study are related to the study design that did not allow us to establish a causal relationship. As we conducted an on-line survey accessibility issues should be addressed, representativity of our population might be limited to those who have access to the internet. In consequence, our sample had a high number of young adults. However, an online survey is a strategy that in the current context gives us the opportunity to do primary research and find a population exposed to social media. The results of this study correspond to the first time period of the COVID-19 in Bolivia; other studies need to be performed to understand the dynamic of attitudes and behaviors during the period of the highest numbers of infections and after the epidemic. We did not evaluate the quality of the content to which the participants were exposed as this could also influence behaviors even negatively [10] , this also can be associated with mental health problems [34] . In consequence future studies need to be conducted to understand the influences of the content quality and the association with the factors we addressed. Understanding the determinants of the perception of risk among people is critical to disseminate information on appropriate public health behaviors [35] .In conclusion, our results address an important issue with social media as an information channel and its association with shaping risk perception and behaviors to communicate information to the population. Effective communication with the population by public health agencies and governments is among the most important components of successful pandemic responses. Successful communication can help the public adopt appropriate behaviors to stop the spread of an outbreak. This findings presented can help policymakers and communicators better understand the complex process of emotions and cognition provoked by infectious disease outbreaks and develop better communication strategies.Supporting information S1 Table.

This outbreak was later found to be caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 [1, 2] . The disease, now called Coronavirus Disease 2019 , has quickly spread to most countries of the world, affecting almost 5 million individuals and causing more than 320,000 deaths. Until May 22, 492,124 cases were registered in the South America, with 55,3% being in Brazil [3] .COVID-19 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and development time as the previously known Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 4] . The rapid international spread of COVID-19 pressured the WHO to declare the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international importance in late January 2020. Such a decision is taken when an event with major public health implications crosses the borders of the country initially affected, demanding immediate international action [5] . In the absence of antivirals and while awaiting the large-scale introduction of COVID-19 vaccination [6] , various public health strategies to contain the infection have been implemented around the world. These strategies commonly consist of enforced or semienforced ""lockdowns"" and closure of national and/or intra-national borders, as well as promotion of respiratory hygiene (masking, coughing/sneezing etiquette) and hand hygiene. The package of containment measures for COVID-19 around the world probably represents the largest global public health intervention in human history, though the societal and individual impact of these measures is not yet well-understood.The population-level adherence to such measures may determine to a considerable extent the national magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 8] . However, little is known on population-level adherence to the various containment measures implemented worldwide, with most studies focusing on adherence to hygiene measures among healthcare workers [9] [10] [11] . Indepth documentation of adherence to containment measures is nonetheless essential, on the one hand to feed into initiatives attempting to model outbreaks [7, 12] , and on the other hand to adapt and target health promotion messages to sub-populations that may be struggling to adhere to specific measures [13] , such as specific age groups.In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19, reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on February 26th, was a 61year-old man who had traveled to Italy between February 9 and 21 of 2020. Two tests were positive for COVID-19 infection. Since then, the number of infected persons in Brazil has increased dramatically [14] . Physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 16th [5] . Events expected to attract large numbers of people were cancelled, universities and schools were closed, and only services considered essential to the population remained functional, such as markets, pharmacies and bakeries. However, traveling between Brazilian states remained possible. To document how the containment measures affected the lives of the Brazilian people, and to understand which containment measures were best adhered to by which strata of the population, we conducted an online survey on the adherence of the Brazilian people to individual public health measures and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people's lives. A particular emphasis was placed on age as a stratifying factor, considering the clear association of COVID-19 severity with age, and the general need for adapting health messaging to specific age groups.An online questionnaire survey was organized in Brazil between April 3 to April 9. At the time of the survey Brazil counted 9056 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1769 hospitalizations and 359 deaths. Data were collected on the ICPcovid website (www.icpcovid.com), which is a secure web-based platform developed by the University of Antwerp, Belgium.The link for the survey was disseminated using What-sApp, email, and social media such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and ResearchGate. Furthermore, we had support from national organizations such as the Research Support Foundation of the State of Goiás, the Regional Council of Biology of the First Region, and the Faculty of Public Health of the University of São Paulo who actively disseminated the survey link. Everybody in Brazil, regardless their nationality could participate in the study: the only exclusion criteria for participation were being younger than 18 years (as we considered that approval from one of the parents was needed) and not living in Brazil at the moment of the survey.The structured questionnaire consisted of 60 questions about socio-demographic characteristics, individual preventive measures (such as hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing and isolation) and daily living practices (such as impact on working conditions, difficulties to adhere to the preventive measures and COVID-19 health concerns); See supplemental information. We used Likert scores for questions concerning health risk perception and the level of difficulty to observe the preventive measures.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25 for Windows. Containment measures were grouped into three main categories: hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and physical distancing/isolation. A composite adherence score was generated for each of these categories using specific questions from the survey, with empirical weights (Table 1) . Subsequently an overall adherence score was generated by combining the sub-scores using equal weights (1:1:1 ratio).Descriptive statistics were presented using means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes, and percentages (%) for categorical variables. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the number of days of work per week before and after the epidemic.Multiple linear regression was performed to analyze factors associated with adherence to national prevention restrictive measures; the composite adherence score (Table 1 ) served as dependent variable. Variables with p < 0.10 in bivariate analysis were included in the adjusted model, and the final model was selected via a backward stepwise process of eligible covariates. Covariates that were investigated included: age, gender, state and area of residence, education, marital status, living alone, profession, working in the health sector, and existing comorbidities. The significance level adopted was 5% for all hypothesis tests.A total of 25,266 persons participated in the survey. After excluding respondents younger than 18 years (n = 163) and people with inconsistent responses (1207), 23, 896 respondents (94.6%) were included for analysis. Participants were from all parts of the country. The median age of participants was 48.0 years (IQR 37.0-58.0 years); 71.8% were women ( Table 2) . 7020 (29.4%) reported a chronic underlying disease such as diabetes, cancer, HIV infection or tuberculosis and 2177 were smokers of cigarettes.At the time of the survey, 44.6% of professionals were working from home. For those who were not working from home, 66.1% were not able to do so because of the type of job, 9.1% were not allowed by their employer, 5% had to leave the house to make money to support the family, and 1.3% left the home because they considered this to be without a risk (Table 3 ). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, participants reported going to work less often (mean number of days of work per week: 0.8) compared to the period before the epidemic (mean number of days of work per week: 3.2; p-value< 0.001; Wilcoxon test).Most participants (92.6%) reported adhering to the 1.5-2 m social distancing rule; 69.5% covered their mouth and nose when they sneeze and washed their hands afterwards; 45.5% wore a face mask when going outside; Staying at home was found to be extremely difficult for 7.9%, but 29.3% considered it not difficult at all (Table 4) .Difficulty to adhere to the COVID-19 preventive measures and health concerns While 29.3% of respondents found it relatively easy to stay at home, indoor confinement was extremely difficult for 7.9% of participants (Table 3) . When queried about their health concerns as a consequence of COVID-19, respondents were more concerned about the health of their loved ones (29.9% very concerned and 22.2% concerned) than their own health (11.0% very concerned and 13.9% concerned) (Fig. 1) .Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with higher overall adherence. Older age, being female, having at least an undergraduate degree, being a health care worker, having comorbidities, not living in the rural area/village, not being a student, not working in the private sector, and not smoking were all independently associated with a higher overall score (Table 5) . Adherence scores for the specific measures were all significantly lower in the younger age group (18-25 years) . Respiratory hygiene and physical distancing adherence scores were significantly lower in the 26-65 years old than in the > 65 years oldconfounding of the other covariates was controlled for through multiple linear regression (Fig. 2 ).Our study shows that, during the survey period, Brazilians were following the COVID-19 preventive measures relatively well. Hand hygiene measures were adhered to most, followed by physical distancing and respiratory hygiene. In all categories of measures, a clear age effect was observed, with younger individuals scoring lower than older respondents on the adherence score.Overall, only 45.5% reported wearing a face mask when going out. This is much lower than in Asian countries, where most people wore face masks once the COVID-19 epidemic was introduced in their country [15] [16] [17] . This is also lower than the 91.7% face mask use reported in a similar online survey in Ecuador in April 2020 and the 99.8% face mask use in a survey in Peru in June 2020 [18] . This is however higher than in several European countries where wearing face masks was initially advised only in health care settings, following WHO recommendations at the time [19] [20] [21] . Checking one's temperature for the early detection of a COVID-19 infection at least twice a week was only practiced by 10.8% of the respondents. This may be a point of concern, as WHO reported that temperature screening was able to detect the majority of exported cases during the COVID-19's expansion [22] . When assessing the profile of individuals with poor general adherence, men were less adherent compared to women, which mirrors findings from a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices study conducted in China (17) . In our study, younger age was also associated with a lower overall score. In another large online survey in Brazil conducted between April 24th and May 24th, assessing only the degree of adherence to physical contact restriction measures, greater adherence was found among females compared to males but it was mainly the 30 to 49 year old group that was less adherent and not the younger age group [23] . People living in rural areas and poor neighborhoods were also less adherent: in rural areas people may not perceive themselves at high risk of COVID-19, and therefore may not respect the national restriction measures and not practice individual hygiene measures [24] . Therefore, extra communication and health education may be needed to change the risk perception in rural areas and popular neighborhoods [25] . Brazilian students reported difficulties to stay home, which may be related to a need to travel to their original homes in periods when schools and universities were closed [26] or could be related to differing social habits among this population. Encouragingly, respondents with underlying diseases followed the preventive measures well, which is important considering their higher risk for more severe disease. Taken together, these observations suggest that tailoring of the public health messages may be indicated. A reinforcement of specific messages, such as mask use and temperature taking, may be beneficial, and using delivery methods tailored to the specific age groups could allow higher uptake. Especially communication methods to the younger age group could benefit from such tailoring, and possibly approaches relying on social media and including influencers to spread public health messages could be considered [27] . Of note, the observation that most respondents' concern was higher for their loved ones than for themselves could be incorporated in such health messages; possibly by emphasizing how adhering to measures protects one's close environment.In general, our results indicate that following an intensive COVID-19 prevention campaign [28] the Brazilians gradually became aware of the importance of adopting simple methods to prevent COVID-19 transmission. For only 7.9% of the respondents indoor confinement was experienced as extremely difficult. Initially the MOH of Brazil expected a peak of COVID-19 infections during the second half of April. However, it did not happen. The satisfactory adherence to the preventive measures may have delayed the peak of the epidemic.COVID-19 associated mortality during the study period was highest in the North region of Brazil (Amazonas) and in two states in the Northeast (Ceará and Pernambuco) [29] . Our study showed that the Northeast Fig. 1 Level of concern about COVID-19 consequences among participants of an online survey on COVID-19, Brazil, April 2020 (bivariate: selfversus loved ones) There has been a lot of confusion about how to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. The president has minimized the actions of the MOH, downplaying the importance of quarantine, and is defending vertical isolation to avoid financial collapse. Vertical isolation or shielding implies that most people return back to normal life and people with underlying diseases, older adults and pregnant women continue to respect physical distance and reduce their social activities. Regarding this vulnerable group, 29.4% stated to have underlying diseases in our survey. This is a concern, as older age and the presence of (an) underlying health condition(s) are associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality [30, 31] On the other hand, Brazilian respondents with underlying diseases adhered better to the containment measures.The lack of unified actions against COVID-19, by the federal government, led to the resignation of the health minister on April 16 [32, 33] . From that moment on, there was a relaxation of quarantine measures, opening of part of the trade, and consequently less physical distancing. The lack of national coordination by the government in response to the pandemic reveal the conflictual positions between the federal government and governors from the 27 states of the country [34] . This increased the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths [30, 31] .At the end of April, the COVID-19 death toll in Brazil had already exceeded that of China [3] (more than 5000 deaths) and this scenario got worse, not reaching the flattening of the curve and overloading the Brazilian health system [35] . As of December 31th 2020, more than 7,000,000 cases had been confirmed in the country, causing almost 200,000 deaths [3] . Our findings suggest a considerable initial willingness of the Brazilian people to follow the quarantine and other containment measures. However, this willingness seems to have been irrevocably subverted through the political stance against the public health measures with as a consequence that currently South America became the new epicenter of the pandemic with Brazil as the most affected country [3] .Our study had several limitations. The number of respondents was relatively small compared to the entire Brazilian population, and respondents were unevenly spread over the national territory. Indeed, only 2,6% of the participants reported residing in rural areas. The reason for this low number of participants from rural areas most likely is because in those areas people have less internet access and consequently are less linked to social media [24, 25] . While 51.8% of the Brazilian population are women [36] , 71,8% of the respondents in our survey were female. Such a higher proportion of female respondents was also observed in other studies on COVID-19-related practices [17] . Participants were more likely to be higher educated individuals living in cities and in the Southeast region. The latter may be explained by the fact that since the beginning of the pandemic, this region recorded the largest number of COVID-19 infections. Moreover, broadband internet quality is best in the Southeast region [37] . Our survey was also not able to reach vulnerable populations, such as the homeless, prisoners, older adults, migrants and people with mobility problems. Such populations may be at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and should be considered as priority key groups in the prevention and control of Covid-19 [26, 38] . Our study findings are based on self-reports without a possibility to verify whether these responses corresponded with the real preventive behaviour of the respondents.At the time of writing, the COVID-19 vaccination started in more than 30 countries [39] , and in Brazil, it is scheduled to start at the end of January 2021. However, it will still be challenging to deal with the vaccine hesitance movements and the political polarization [40] that it is taking place in relation to vaccination.In conclusion, most participants in this survey correctly followed the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, although staying at home was difficult for individuals who had to go out because of their job, and younger individuals tended to adhere less to containment measures. Larger follow-up surveys and in-depth qualitative studies about the preventive behavior of different groups in the Brazilian society are needed. The adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures will need to be monitored closely as restrictive measures are being relaxed and as the expectations concerning the COVID-19 vaccine may decrease the motivation of people to adhere to prevention measures.The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12889-021-10222-z.

Coronaviruses are found in a variety of birds and mammals throughout the world and have a proclivity for emergence. In the past 20 years, three novel SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus that is genetically related to but distinct from SARS-CoV. To gain entry into the host cell, the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (2) . The viral response phase starts during the first days of infection, and flu-like symptoms are common (mild phase). Some patients progress to an inflammatory response phase. During this stage, patients develop viral pneumonia, and dyspnea/hypoxia might appear. A minority of COVID-19 patients transit into the third and most severe stage of the illness that manifests as systemic hyperinflammation syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction (3) . In the respiratory system, the virus targets cells lining the respiratory epithelium, causing from an asymptomatic infection to severe end-stage lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation. Disease severity is likely to be a combination of direct virus-induced pathology and the host inflammatory response to the infection (2) . In the cardiovascular system, there is evidence of myocardial injury with some patients presenting abnormalities similar to myocarditis(4). In the skeletal muscle, some patients showed malaise, muscle soreness, and elevated levels of blood creatine kinase, which is considered an indicator of muscle damage and inflammatory response (5) .As a result of this multisystemic effect, it is reasonable to suggest that COVID-19 can decrease cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular performance, affecting these functions in a direct association with the disease severity.Additionally, these compromises may persist after the patients have recovered from the COVID-19. However, to date, very few data exist about COVID-19 impact on these capacities after recovery and thus the performance sequels of this illness are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance in patients recovered from mild to severe COVID-19. These data could provide physiological guidance for rehabilitation training programs after COVID-19. We hypothesized that recovery patients present impaired cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular performances in accordance to the disease severity.Patients were classified as mild (major clinical symptoms without dyspnea or respiratory failure) or severe (major clinical symptoms with dyspnea or respiratory failure), as postulated by Tian et al (6) . Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: recovered (less than 30 days) from mild to severe COVID- 19 . Exclusion criteria were based on comorbidity confounding factors. Thus, patients with critical COVID-19 (i.e. who had required intubation and mechanical ventilation) and those with previous cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, hematological or muscular diseases were excluded.During CPET, neuromuscular activity was analyzed by EMG using a signal acquisition module with a 12-bit resolution A/D converter (EMG800C, EMG System, São José dos Campos, Brazil). Sampling frequency was adjusted to 1000 Hz, frequency band to 20-500 Hz and gain to 1000 times. Bipolar Ag/AgCl self-adhesive surface electrodes were used and placed 20 mm apart (center to center) at the right vastus lateralis (2/3 of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral side of the patella), according to Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles recommendations (9) .Data normality was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to evaluate intergroup differences for data with a Gaussian distribution. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test were used to evaluate intergroup differences for data without a Gaussian distribution. The categorical variables were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The effect size was calculated by the F test family (ANOVA: fixed effects, omnibus, one-way) and post hoc type of analysis. The input parameters were as follows: the effect size, f; total sample size; number of groups = 3 and error probability α = 0.05. The effect size, f, was directly calculated from the partial η 2 . The effect size convention was f ≥ 0.1 (small), f ≥ 0.25 (medium) and f ≥ 0.40 (large) (13) . A statistical significance value of p ≤ 0.05 was set for all analyses. GraphPad Prism 7.0 and GPower 3.1.9.7 software were used.According to data normality distribution, data are presented as means ± standard deviations or as medians and interquartile ranges and percentages.The main finding of this study was that 1) patients recovered from severe COVID-19 had lower cardiorespiratory fitness, activate muscle fibers Ia and Ib at lower power outputs and present lower neuromuscular efficiency than patients with mild COVID-19 and healthy subjects; while 2) patients recovered from mild COVID-19 had cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance similar to healthy subjects.Peak oxygen uptake reflects functional capacity and has high prognostic value in clinical populations (14) (15) . The expected behavior of this variable in patients recovered from COVID-19 is unknown. The present study showed that COVID-19 can have a significant impact on this variable in those patients who had the severe disease but have no effect on those who had only mild symptoms.The hazardous impact observed on VO2 may derived from COVID-19's effects as this disease produces pulmonary function landings (16) , myocardial injury (17), and neuromuscular dysfunction (5), but it may also derived from functional impairment imposed by inactivity and hospitalization (18) . In a clinical perspective, the reduced VO2 observed after severe COVID-19 suggest a worst prognosis for these patients, which should be investigated.Once spirometry values normalize in severe patients and present only a slight reduction in total lung capacity (19) , ventilatory performance may have been impaired by respiratory muscle dysfunction. In addition to peripheral muscle, respiratory muscle may present lower performance in severe COVID-19 patients.As demonstrated in healthy (20) (21) and other disease models(22), there is a relationship between peripheral muscle performance and respiratory muscle performance.Multiple mechanisms of deregulation in pulmonary perfusion exist in COVID-19: the abolition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing an increase in venous admixture, and excessive pulmonary vasoconstriction and microthrombosis or macrothrombosis, leading to increased deadspace (23) .Despite this, the VE/VCO2 slope was normal in our sample (even in severe patients). A significant reduction in O2pulse was also observed in the group of individuals with severe manifestations; however, the normal ascending behavior of the O2pulse curve and preserved ventilatory efficiency reduced the probability of central cardiovascular limitation. One possibility is that those deregulatory mechanisms do not persist after a time of recovery. Another possibility is that only critical patients present significant pulmonary perfusion deregulation.Thus, individuals recovered from COVID-19 who had severe manifestations had lower functional capacity, without evidence of significant central cardiorespiratory changes, than those recovered from mild COVID-19 or healthy subjects. The reduction in neuromuscular efficiency demonstrated through electromyography suggests that the effort limitation of these individuals is related to a peripheral mechanism.Type IIa and IIb fibers were activated at much lower power output in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting worse performance in type I and IIa fibers.Currently, there is insufficient knowledge about muscle histology and fiber-type composition in COVID-19. Independent of any specific pathological process, muscle inactivity causes significant atrophy of all muscle fiber types. Bed rest appears to most strongly induce type I fiber atrophy, accompanied by a fiber-type shift from type I and IIa fibers to type IIb fibers. Taken together, the type of injury, the muscle group affected and the time since injury or rest may all influence how specific muscle fiber types are affected (27) .The pathological process in myopathies results in dysfunction and the dropout of individual muscle fibers located randomly within the motor unit. In myositis, motor neurons and motor axons are not affected. Motor unit action potentials become polyphasic, short in duration and low in amplitude (28) . Severe COVID-19 patients presented high EMG activity with low power output because each small motor unit was able to generate only a reduced amount of force, requiring the recruitment of many motor units.The current study shows a consistent external validity once CPET and EMG are low cost and non-invasive methods, available in the majority of clinical exercise laboratories. However, it is important to point out that we assessed a small sample from a single city in Brazil.Patients recovered from severe COVID-19 present low cardiorespiratory fitness, activate glycolytic fibers at low power outputs, and show low neuromuscular efficiency; while patients recovered from mild COVID-19 do not present these sequels.","Brazil","first author","2021-01-13",1

Since international cooperation during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus and Ebola epidemics [2] . However, the current COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge faced by IHR thus far [3] . Although the WHO has issued several guidelines related to the current epidemic, the adherence level varies among nations and, inside nations, provinces, and states [4] . Up to the present day, non-pharmacological interventions, like social distancing, radical lockdown, and extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been applied by different countries, with widely varying degrees of success [5, 6] . In some countries, such as Brazil, scientific research on the effectiveness of those strategies has been severely hampered by political bias, which interferes with public health decisions [7] .São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), is also the most severely affected by COVID-19. The state government has challenged the Brazilian President's denial of the pandemic and declared the closure of commerce, schools and other non-essential services. However, despite the ferocious spread of the virus on the state capital and metropolitan area, the slowly evolving of the epidemic in the state's inner cities (until April 18th), where 20 million people live, has led to protests against governmental measures. In this context, there is a sense of urgency about predicting routes of epidemic spreading in the inner state and the population's risks.Here, we discussed a detailed analysis of the spatial dispersion of COVID-19 in São Paulo State, Brazil, intending to provide real-time responses to support public health strategies. Using data since the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in São Paulo State, we assess the importance of geographic space on the spread of the epidemic. We hypothesize that urban hierarchy is the main responsible for the disease spreading, and we identify the hotspots and the main routes of virus movement from the metropolis to the inner state. This premise is also supported by [8] where multivariate analyses showed that demographic density and high classification of regional relevance were associated with early introduction and high COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates. We cross validate the confirmed cases with urban mobility, urban hierarchy, and land use at each spatial localization, in work developed here. The results highlight the importance of the main routes that cross São Paulo State and the regional airports on introducing the disease in the territory, just as the main municipalities act as critical centers of disease spreading to the inner state. Knowing in advance the path of COVID-19 dispersion can support decision-makers to optimize health service, and plan strategies of quarantine measures. This approach can be made in other states of Brazil and other developing countries, observing local and regional mobility and urban network [9] .Spatial analysis of surveillance data includes exploratory data analysis, spatial modeling, and cartographic visualization [10] . The first one uses spatial statistical methods to measure centrality and dispersion of data sets to detect spatial patterns and check for relationships between variables of the complex phenomenon under investigation. The second one examines the elementary forms of spatial organization that explains the phenomenon under study, such as railways, land cover, demographic, economic, and social factors [11] . Lastly, cartographic visualization provides a synthesis of the previous procedures, aiming the elaboration of a thematic map that can be presented to managers for decision making in emergencies in public health [9, 10] .Focusing on São Paulo State, its center and periphery structure, main roads, and network flux that gives population and trade mobility, the geographic spread of COVID-19 was studied. For this, several maps were made to summarize information about quantity and localization of confirmed cases, urban hierarchy, area of influence and urban-rural typology of cities, modes of transport, and population vulnerability. The maps were constructed based on graphic-semiology principles, the theory of colors and visual communication [10, 12, 13] .We used surveillance data (number of confirmed cases of coronavirus) updated on April 18th, 2020. The data was obtained from Brasil IO's compiled databank (https://brasil.io/ dataset/covid19/boletim/) kept by volunteers' task force (researchers and reporters). This group daily catches, from the epidemiological reports of each state, the number of confirmed cases and death by SARS-CoV-2 and make it publicly available. Because of the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic by the WHO, laboratory certification in Brazil ranged from few laboratories to 26, in eight weeks since the beginning of the epidemic; the majority is located at São Paulo State [14] . Data reporting of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) is mandatory in Brazil. A specific form (national database SIVEP-Gripe) collects information that allows us to estimate reported delay, disease fatality at which age class, and identify confirmed cases of the disease. This permits surveillance of all respiratory diseases in Brazil. Only cases that were hospitalized belong to this data set; therefore, underreporting is expected. On the other hand, this is probably homogeneous along with the municipalities and will not impact on the observed pattern of disease spreading. Out of this national surveillance system (SARI), test capacity can vary among cities because many of them made agreements with factories to test the population that lives on the site where the factory is settled. The same procedure has been done in universities, schools, and firms that returned their activities. However, this data has not been taken into account here, since SARI only reports severe cases. Lastly, test capacity has grown fastly in São Paulo State; currently, 13 out of 35 laboratories of Brazil are settled in this state. A broader serological survey is on course in Brazil, to detect underreporting and follow the population susceptibility along with the course of the epidemic. This may help in defining target groups for vaccination.Data about each municipality, such as territorial management, trade and services, financial services, health care services, educational institutions, media and communication markets, culture and sport, mode of transport, and land use, was used to identify the fundamental entities of spatial structure that trigger coronavirus dispersion in São Paulo territory [15] . This information was compiled from census data done by the Federal Government and other thematic studies. The metropolis of São Paulo appears as the largest urban complex in the country, with almost 22 million inhabitants and a high level of integration with other municipalities that comprise the national territory. It is listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC). In the second level of the hierarchy, we have Rio de Janeiro and Brasília (the capital of Brazil). Focusing on São Paulo State, it has two main axes of urban and trade mobility (roadways, railways, and airways), the first one connecting São Paulo with Rio de Janeiro, and the second one connecting São Paulo with Brasília and Central-West Region of Brazil. Besides these main transportation axes, we have a secondary flux network connecting the metropolis of São Paulo to country municipalities and the South of Brazil. This secondary flux aggregates roadways, railways, airways, and waterways (Tietê-Paraná). Over this intense flux of people and trade, a complex structure of cities emerges, reinforcing this network composed of high hierarchy cities (as nodes) linked by the best transportation system of the country (as edges). With almost 48 million inhabitants, São Paulo State concentrates 23.6% of the country's population and 33% of its income. Besides, São Paulo State has the highest number of primary (Metropolis) 2/15, and secondary (Regional Capital) 26/97 cities on the urban hierarchy level in Brazil, and a high number of other cities classified as Subregional Center 77/352, and Zone Center 51/398, respectively, at tertiary and quaternary levels.Out of 645 municipalities in São Paulo State, 145 have laboratory-confirmed cases on April 18th and were used in this study. The first confirmed case was at São Paulo metropolis on March 25th. In all maps that we will present, the studied feature (number of coronavirus cases or time-lapse since the first case) is located at each municipality's city hall.In the first map, we plotted the number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported from March 25th to April 18th. For this, the proportional symbol maps scale was used to draw circles proportionally to the number of cases in each municipality. Proportional symbol maps are often constructed by beginning with the largest symbol size (the largest radius of the circle corresponds to the largest data value) to minimize symbol overlap. To measure the spatial trend on data, we use a weighted standard deviation ellipse. In this case, data of each municipality i was (until the date at which each ellipse was drawn), centered at the city hall (position coordinate (x i , y i )) and weighted by the number of cases in the municipality [16] .Three ellipses were drawn to show, at different times, the main direction of disease spreading. Although the SARS-CoV-2 was introduced in São Paulo on March 25th, it took time to move towards the inner municipalities because of the strong mitigations strategy adopted by São Paulo State to halting the disease's spread. The average time spent by the disease, since its introduction on the metropolis, to achieve the regional centers, the municipalities under major and minor influence, and the rural municipalities were respectively 22, 31, 34 and 55 days [8] (the classification of the municipalities follows the criteria established by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (2017) [17] ). Therefore, three calendar date were chosen to cover the period of study (from March 25 until April 18): March 29, April 8, and April 18; which are 10 days apart from each other. Over this information, we highlight the main roads that cross São Paulo State, and its 645 municipalities' urban-rural typology.The standard deviations for the x-and y-axis are given byffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffiffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffiffi Xand the summation symbol i takes into account the number of municipalities with registered cases of COVID-19. Observe that (� x; � y) represents the mean center of the feature. A Standard deviation ellipse summarizes both the dispersion and orientation of the observed set of samples. If the data is normally distributed, one standard deviation represents approximately 68% of all occurrences. The second map shows the movement of airplanes during March and April of 2020, connecting municipalities of São Paulo State among them and with other states and countries. The data were obtained from [18] . Line thickness is proportional to the number of passengers moving from one place to another. For the purpose of the study, the flux inside São Paulo territory is highlighted.The third map shows the urban hierarchy centrality level of municipalities. The regional importance of each city can also be seen in this figure from the tree diagram. The data were obtained from [15] . According to the literature, five urban hierarchy levels are defined: metropolis, regional capital, subregional center, zone centers, and local center. Many variables are used in this classification, such as services establishments, inter-urban relations, banking establishments, social information, cultural and sports offering, and territorial management [15, 19] .The fourth map was constructed by interpolating over the total number of days at which coronavirus transmission was reported in each municipality. We used Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) as an interpolator and a circle as the neighborhood shape for the interpolation procedure. The Root Squared Error (RMS) permitted to set up the radius of the circle (25 km) and the minimum and maximum numbers of neighbors, respectively 2 and 12, to optimize global accuracy of the interpolated curve. Inside of this radius, the nearest neighbors (with reported cases) of each point s 0 were used in the interpolator and the contribution of each one was weighted by the inverse of its distance. This gave us an RMS of 6.56. Assuming that the measured values closest to the prediction location have more influence on the predicted value than those far away, the following equation was usedwhereẑðs 0 Þ; w i , and z(s i ) are the estimated value at position s 0 , the weight attributed to each pair of coordinates (1/|s i − s 0 |) and the numerical value observed at position s i . In the summation symbol, i takes into account the number of neighbors.The interpolator created a surface on which the values from points (municipalities) are combined and recorded in a data matrix, simplifying information, and creating regional patterns. As it has spatiotemporal data, it must be read with the darkest data in the red palette as the oldest that passes through orange, yellow going to the blue palette, which are the municipalities that were later infected. Although we are using the time-lapse since the first case reported in each municipality to create the interpolated surface that permits us to predict the epidemic course over the state, some cities entered community transmission only after 10 to 15 days from the first confirmed case. This reflects not only the stochastic nature of the introduction of a new pathogen in a community, but also the fact that data of COVID-19 in Brazil do not distinguish between imported and autochthonous cases. This is an exploratory analysis that permits us to follow the virus's dispersion pattern, glimpsing the next cities that will probably be affected by the disease. The palette of colours of the map comprises the period from February 25th to April 18th, with white color indicating disease absence.The last map is a schematic cartogram of the elementary spatial structures that drive and modulate disease spreading in São Paulo territorial. It shows the main modes of transportation, together with the key municipalities that acted as agents of the initial spreading of COVID-19. It also highlights the geographic position of the metropolis and the vulnerable population.Finally, we want to emphasize that we are not looking for epidemiological links that explain disease transmission among municipalities, but we seek geographical links that conditionate the regional pattern of disease spreading along São Paulo territorial.Fig 1 shows on grayscale the 645 municipalities painted according to their classification of urban-rural typology that takes into account population density, accessibility to goods and services, and land use; São Paulo State has 13% of its area classified as rural [17, 20] . In pink, we highlighted the main roads that cross the state, dividing them into primary and secondary axes according to the flux of people and goods. The municipalities with reported COVID-19 cases are shown in red circles, which size is proportional to the number of cases recorded until April 18th. Three weighted standard deviation ellipses are shown on March 29th, April 08th, and April 18th. The angles are 128, 135, and 137 degrees, respectively, and the semi-major axis measures 34, 89, and 110 km. As time passes and the epidemic evolves, we can notice a change of direction and velocity of disease spreading. A simple calculus gives us 5.5 km/day and 2.1 km/day (ΔS/Δt where ΔS is the difference between the semi-major axis measure and Δt is the time elapsed between each ellipse). Interesting to note that on March 24th, mobility restriction was imposed at São Paulo State. Planned to be finished on April 07th, this restriction mobility was extended several times until May 27th when São Paulo quarantine plan started [21] .To emphasize the mobility restrictions imposed by São Paulo government and how connected are its municipalities, Fig 2 shows the airplanes moving in and out of São Paulo during March and April months of 2020. It was registered a movement of 2 to 11350 individuals per connection (107 different connections among different cities) using this option as transportation in March, and 2 to 4 individuals per connection in April (16 connections among different cities), considering that every flight has at least two individuals. In the figure, line thickness is proportional to the number of individuals moving among municipalities. The reduced number in April reflects the travel restrictions imposed by the government of São Paulo to reducing coronavirus spread in the state. We can see that the inner state is well connected not only by roadways (as shown in Fig 1) but also through airways. A highlight to cities of Campinas and São Paulo that have international airports. In order to compare, in March and April of 2019, the number of passengers that left São Paulo State was three times greater than in 2020; and People's movement is facilitated, and encouraged, due to transportation availability and commercial and social activities Likely SARS-CoV in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 fastly spread among cities and countries due to airline network and ground transportation [22] [23] [24] . In the case of São Paulo State, the delay in closing the airports located at the inner municipalities probably contributed to the hierarchical dispersion of the disease on its territorial. Fig 3 displays the cities with a high level of urban hierarchy centrality that we can find at São Paulo State: the metropolis of São Paulo, the regional capital of Campinas, the subregional centers of São José do Rio Preto and Ribeirão Preto, the zone centers of Presidente Prudente, Marília, Bauru, Araçatuba, Sorocaba, São José dos Campos, Santos, Araraquara, and Piracicaba, and local center of Barretos, Franca, São João da Boa Vista, São Carlos, Rio Claro, Limeira, Ourinhos, Botucatu, Jaú, and Catanduva. The black border delimits the regions subordinate to the cities level one and two in the hierarchy, and the yellow one the regions subordinate to cities of level three. The diagram on tree summarizes the regions of influence of each city displayed on the map. We hypothesize that city hierarchy plays an important role in the disease spreading over the territory.The exploratory analysis of data on confirmed cases in São Paulo State generated a dispersion map in which the color spectrum indicates the areas ranging from earlier to the more recent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4) . The colors have to be reading such as a predictor of an earlier or later arrival of the disease in each city of the map because they comprise only the study period; therefore, it is a first insight into disease dispersion. The white areas on the map show the municipalities without COVID-19 cases, and at the same time, far away from the ones where the disease was already reported. Overlapping this map with the one shown in Fig 1, we can see that most municipalities without case reported are classified as rural ones. The main roads that cross the state are also highlighted, and we hypothesize is that they also play an important role in the disease spreading over the territory.To understand the regional pattern of SARS-CoV-2 spreading Fig 5, presents the elementary spatial structures identified as the main ones responsible for the disease spread inside the state. They comprise the main roadways as well as the airports that give people and trade mobility, and the hotspots of the disease introduction and spread. The airports and the cities are displayed by circles proportional to their role on COVID-19 spread. In the case of cities, we classified them as principal (São Paulo, Campinas, São José dos Campos, Ribeirão Preto, and São José do Rio Preto) and secondary (Santos, Araçatuba, Presidente Prudente, Bauru, Marília, São Carlos, Sorocaba, Rio Claro, and Piracicaba) urban centers in the level of relevance for the disease spread. Cities belonging to the metropolitan area, such as Santos, São José dos Campos, and Campinas, are classified as ""contiguity""; the other ones are connected to São Paulo City through a primary or secondary axis. The metropolitan area of São Paulo and the state's region where there is a massive concentration of elderly population (older than 60 years of age) are highlighted. The latter is called vulnerable because disease lethality among them is high. For these listed cities, demographic characteristics, number of reported cases and, disease lethality (up to April 18, 2020) are presented in Table 1 . Santos, which has a considerable mortality per 100,000 inhabitants, is the one in the list with the more significant number of the older population (� 50 years).Based on the results of the exploratory analysis (Figs 1 and 4) and population mobility studies (Figs 2 and 3) , two dispersion patterns were postulated. In the first one, virus dispersion occurs by contiguity, from a region of initial introduction, that is the Metropolitan Region of the Capital, the City of São Paulo (contagious diffusion) to its nearest neighborhoods. In the second one, there is a long-distance dispersion following structural axes (roadways and airways) that connect São Paulo city to peripheral municipalities of regional importance (hierarchical diffusion). From these, diffusion by contiguity occurs again to smaller municipalities. Around the main map, we display the structures that comprise it, such as road axes, regional airports, the metropolitan area of São Paulo city, municipalities keys as centers of disease dispersion from the metropolitan area to inner state, and municipalities where the oldest population of São Paulo lives.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245051.g005 Table 1 . Epidemiologic COVID-19 data for São Paulo State capital and hotspots cities for disease introduction and spread on April 18th (see Fig 5) .Population ( A relationship between disease spreading and territorial geography was also established in other epidemics [22, 25] . Differently from São Paulo State [26] , showed that the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany followed a dispersion pattern called relocation diffusion process since the arrival of infections in Germany coincided with a traditional carnival festivity. Therefore, a single infected individual transmitted the infection to several others. After the festivities, people went back to their homeland, creating long-range connections, and new spots of infection spread, which were randomly distributed across the country. In São Paulo State, since all non-essential activity was limited, the spread followed the main routes of commercial relationships and supply distribution, in a hierarchical diffusion, firstly reaching the most important cities in São Paulo State, and locally spreading within their regions.Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is reported in all São Paulo territorial; the last city to be achieved by this coronavirus (September 1th) was Santa Mercedes, a rural municipality with 2,945 inhabitants and 580 km far away São Paulo City (also out of the main roads of coronavirus dispersion). On September 27th, São Paulo State reports 972,237 confirmed cases and 35,108 deaths. The isolation index is 48%, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) occupation is 45,6%, and disease lethality is 3,6% [27]. Schools and universities still closed, and the state has its own plan of quarantine measures (""Plano São Paulo"") that, based on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths and bed occupancy rates in each Regional Health Departments (DRS), can be more or less flexible. Cities belonging to the same DRS (we have seventeen) are ruled by the same quarantine measures. Phase 1 is considered a contamination phase, and only essential services are permitted. Phase 2 is considered an attention phase with the possibility of some services such as commerce opening. Food courts are still banned in this phase. Phase 3 is considered a controlled phase with some flexibilization. Phase 4 has less restriction than phase 3, and at phase 5, all services are allowed to open, maintaining all specific protocols. Now, in December 2020, all São Paulo State is at phase 3 [28] .Our predictions of routes and risks of COVID-19 in inner São Paulo State (Fig 5) have been thus far validated by surveillance data. Given the extensive mobility between smaller municipalities and those cities with regional economic relevance [17] , it is reasonable to infer that the regional spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections depends on the success of non-pharmacological strategies applied in the latter. We also state that similar methodological approaches can direct public health strategies in other developing countries, especially those that either have great territorial extension and/or have diverse patterns of urbanization and mobility.Limitations of the analysis include: (i) the no-identification of asymptomatic individuals and, potentially, mild or moderate infectious, since only symptomatic cases that seek for medical assistance have been tested; (ii) data dependence, i.e. data set does not distinguish between imported and autochthonous cases; (iii) the assumption that all individuals have the same degree of susceptibility and transmibility of the disease, regardless the environment they live; (iv) the transmission is homogeneous within the cities; (v) mitigation strategies are the same everywhere. All those characteristics may variate according to the city because the number of tests that is distributed and performed among cities is not homogeneous; the number of contacts among people changes according to the city characteristics, such as the use of public transportation [29] ; and people's adherence to social distancing really differed across the state, which may be related to the epidemics delay into reach the small inner cities, affecting people's risk perception [30] .Moreover, the data source in Brazil has been updated with some delay, regarding the occurrence of the infections [31] . Nevertheless, since the data used in this study is related to the arrival of infections in each city, which happened in early 2020, we expect the numbers to be trustful at the point of the analysis. Despite there is no data at a granular level, such as information about the address of the infection occurrence, the data is enough to perform the analysis and reach our goal, which was to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among cities.Spatial analysis of coronavirus spread is an important tool for public health management, as it can highlighting the main routes of disease dispersion and the fragility of municipalities related to its socio-demographic characteristics. In the case of São Paulo State, this analysis evidenced the hotspots and main routes of disease dispersion from capital to inner state. Currently, nonpharmacological controls are the only tools to halt or diminish the disease spreading among both individuals and municipalities. The existence of two different ways of disease dispersal, by standard diffusion and hierarchical one, can provide alternative strategies to control disease spread in the São Paulo territory.This work shows that it was possible to understand and even predict the route of COVID-19 spread in São Paulo State looking to the cities' hierarchy, which means that the spread of the epidemic does not follow a diffusion process but reaches the cities based on their regional importance and activities. After that, the epidemic spread to contiguous cities following a diffusion standard process. We state that those cities are responsible for the arrival of the epidemics in the inner São Paulo State and demand attention. ","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-07",1

Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, las prácticas diagnósticas habituales, como el lavado broncoalveolar y el aspirado traqueal, están limitadas debido al alto riesgo de exposición que conllevan para el operador. Con el fin de poner el foco principal en la protección del personal sanitario, se desarrolla y utiliza una técnica de aspiración traqueal modificada (M-TA) para la adquisición de muestras microbiológicas del tracto respiratorio inferior con un dispositivo de aspiración cerrado.Métodos: Se realiza un estudio observacional retrospectivo para evaluar la eficacia de la M-TA.Resultados: Se analizaron un total de 33 muestras de M-TA. En el 66,6% de los casos, los resultados condujeron a un cambio en la toma de decisiones médicas. Se alcanzó una precisión del 100% en el diagnóstico de COVID-19 y una tasa de crecimiento bacteriano del 56% en las cultivas en las que se sospechó de VAP. Ningún personal sanitario desarrolló síntomas ni dio positivo a COVID-19 durante o después de la recogida de muestras.Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was defined as pandemic by the World Health Organization 1 and affected more than 20 million people globally with confirmed cases in 215 countries. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the risk of viral transmission to healthcare personnel at the front line has been a global concern 2 posing a challenge for healthcare systems in terms of managing human resources, supplies, and personal protective equipment. Therefore, it is key that all clinical decisions are based on prevention strategies to obtain the best value from the available resources 3 .The collection of samples from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs is a standard procedure used for diagnosis of COVID-19 in adults and children.Nevertheless, early data suggested relatively poor sensitivity of initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from swabs 4 . False-negative results of nasopharyngeal swabs have direct implications for infection control and isolation rooms management. In addition to the previous, among critically ill patients the bacterial superinfection as well as a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are frequent events 5 , and usual practices such as bronchoalveolar lavage and traditional tracheal aspiration are limited due to their associated high risk of exposure for the operator 6, 7 .Setting primary focus on the protection of health care personnel, a modified tracheal aspiration (M-TA) technique is developed and used for acquiring a lower respiratory tract microbiological sample with a closed suction device. This technique proved to be useful not only in aiding COVID-19 diagnostic confirmation in patients with negative RT-PCR from swabs, but also in other respiratory infectious diseases when COVID-19 status remains unknown.A retrospective analysis was conducted in medical records of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of high complexity between June 1, 2020 and August 1, 2020. All patients included in the analysis were more than 18 yearsold, underwent mechanical ventilation (MV), and required a lower respiratory tract microbiological sample due to suspected VAP or COVID-19 diagnosis. A description of epidemiological data, prior nasopharyngeal swab test-results and microbial rescue of M-TA from patients' medical records was included.The data collection for this study was completed as part of the ICU follow-up clinic up to August 1st, 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires in June 2020, under protocol number 5678.In patients with confirmed COVID-19 in whom VAP was suspected, an M-TA was performed with the aim of microbiologically defining VAP. Otherwise, in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and an initial negative nasopharyngeal swab test, a M-TA was performed with the aim of achieving COVID-19 diagnosis. Also, in this group of patients, the true false reports were confirmed with serologic detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. Complications associated with the procedure were documented.All healthcare personnel involved in performing M-TA underwent serologic testing for COVID-19 every 2 weeks during the study period.In order to perform tracheal aspiration, 2 operators donned with personal protective equipment (Figures 1 and 2) . The PVC probe was introduced through the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy cannula until resistance was encountered (level of the carina in the trachea). This was followed by the release of the vacuum, and the probe was delicately removed using turning movements, until secretions were aspirated into the collector bottle. No saline solution was used for liquefy secretions, and strictly aseptic principles were followed.The following were the steps the suggested to perform tracheal aspiration:1. Explain the process to the patient or relatives. 19. Set the alarms, secure adequate FiO2 and verify that the humidification system is working.20. Labeled the microbiological sample with patient's data as well as with the legend ""COVID-19"" for its proper processing. 21. Dof personal protective equipment.Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Given the fact that the cohort of patients in the study was not derived from random selection, all statistics are deemed to be descriptive only. RStudio developed by R-Tools Technology Inc was used for analysis.Study did not receive funding sources.33 patients were included in the study; 10 were female (30,3%) and 23 men (69,6%). Median Table 1 .Of the 33 samples obtained, 22 (66,6%) led to a change in medical decision making. When technique was used for COVID-19 diagnosis, among a total of 8 patients 4 (50%) were a true positive and 4 (50%) true negative. Analyzing microbiological samples due to suspected VAP in confirmed COVID-19 patients, 14 out of 25 samples (56%) presented microbial growth in cultives. Among all 33 procedures performed, only 2 associated complications (6%) were observed: one hypotension episode due to propofol bolus, and one inability to obtain the sample due to absence of secretions. Results of M-TA are shown in Table 2 . In the event that VAP was suspected, there was a high rate of germ rescue in the samples obtained. A higher revenue rate was observed in comparison with the one reported for bronchoalveolar lavage and conventional tracheal aspirate technique 12 . It is relevant to pinpoint that a key factor in decreasing mortality associated with VAP is the administration of adequate antibiotics as early as possible 11 .Even though the size of the sample is small, the procedure described could be considered safe and effective with a low percentage of associated complications. Moreover, the technique developed involves minimal additional costs because it requires materials that are widely available.Finally, it is worth to mention that none of the healthcare personnel involved have developed symptoms nor tested positive for COVID-19 during or after the data collection.

Addressing this issue is important due to the potential benefit of immunomodulatory therapies. Many aspects of this syndrome resemble Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) that has been described in malignancies, rheumatologic conditions and infectious diseases, including several caused by viruses [2] [3] . sHLH is characterized by high fever, cytopenias, organomegaly, elevated inflammatory markers, and frequently (though not always) by hemophagocytosis in bone marrow or lymph nodes [4] . Once presented, sHLH is associated with high mortality and aggressive therapy must be initiated in order to control the hyperinflammatory state. Treatments are usually complex and evidence-based data regarding the best approach remain scarce [5] [6] .The HLH-2004 study, established the first commonly clinical criteria used for diagnosis of sHLH [7] . More recently, a clinical scoring system (HScore) has been developed and validated for the diagnosis of sHLH [8] , with an optimal cutoff value of 169 points to predict the disease.HScore has also been proposed for measuring hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients [9] . Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the presence of sHLH among patients with COVID-19 admitted for hospitalization in one center in Santiago (Chile), and to evaluate HScore as a prognostic tool for poor outcomes.Patients aged 18 years and older hospitalized because of COVID-19, between April 1st and May 31st of 2020, were considered for enrollment into a prospective, single-center, cohort study at the Hospital del Salvador in Santiago, Chile.SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs in all cases. Patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (eg. pre-surgical testing), or COVID-19 cases in which the infection was suspected to be acquired during hospitalization, were excluded.The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of sHLH among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A secondary objective, was to evaluate the relationship between elevated HScore and a composite endpoint comprising mechanical ventilation and 60-days mortality from any cause, in a multivariate analysis.Within 72 hours since admission, HScore was calculated for every enrolled patient, including the following parameters: history of known immunosuppression, highest body temperature registered, number of cytopenias, organomegaly, concentration of ferritin, triglycerides, fibrinogen and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Immunosuppression was defined as being HIV positive or receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy (eg. glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, azathioprine). Cytopenia was defined as either haemoglobin concentration <9,2 g/dL, a white blood cell count <5000 cells per mm3, or platelet count <110.000 per mm3. Organomegaly was defined as hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly based on physical examination or imaging studies. We also recorded routine demographic and clinical data. Comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), as it has been previously reported in this population [10] . Multiple comorbidities were defined as having two or more points in CCI. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 Kg/m2 or more. sHLH diagnosis and HScore as a prognostic tool Once HScore was assessed, if sHLH was clinically suspected, haematological consultation was requested for further evaluation. Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy were performed only when clinically indicated, and whether it was considered useful for the patient management. We considered a definitive diagnosis of sHLH when HScore was equal or superior to 169 points, in absence of an alternative diagnosis.For prognostic purposes, we defined ""high"" HScore as having 130 points or more as this cut-off has been reported previously, anticipating difficulties to perform a bone marrow analysis in critical care patients or for security reasons [11, 12] .The study protocol received ethical approval from the institutional ethics committee (Comité de Ética Científica del Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Oriente. Santiago, Chile).From april 1 st to may 31 sth 2020, 143 patients were evaluated. The median age was 57 years (21-100), and 91 (63.6%) were male. The median time of symptoms before admission was 7 days (1-40). The median CCI was 1 (range 0-9) and 43 (30,1%) patients were obese. Seventy-one patients (49,7%) were admitted to Intensive Care Units, and 42 (29,4%) needed mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two (15,4%) patients received corticosteroids. Thirty-six (25,2%) patients died during follow-up ( Table 1 ).The median HScore was 96 (33-169). One patient was diagnosed with sHLH, due to a HScore of 169 points (incidence 0,7%). He was a male with a high-grade astrocytoma. Due to poor prognosis, no further immunosuppressive therapy was given, passing five days after admission. After initial scoring, sHLH was clinically suspected in four additional patients. Three of these patients had advanced cancer, and one had a liver transplant. In one of them, the diagnosis was ruled out after bone marrow biopsy; whereas the remaining patients were not biopsied because it was not considered useful for patient management (terminally ill).HScore as prognostic factor After dividing the patients in low versus high HScore groups, we observed some significant differences, with the latter group being more likely to be male, admitted to ICU or prescribed corticosteroids.Fifty-eight patients experienced the composite endpoint during follow-up. In the multivariate analysis, and after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and obesity, HScore ≥ 130 points was independently associated with the composite endpoint (HR 2.13, CI 1.18 -4.06, p 0.022) ( Table 2 ).The pathophysiology of sHLH is not fully understood. It is frequently associated with malignancies, infections or inflammatory/rheumatic diseases. In some patients, these conditions can trigger a cytotoxic T lymphocytes-driven macrophage activation, leading to hypercytokinemia, which clinically presents as fever, cytopenias and organ failure. Virusassociated sHLH occurs commonly among immunosuppressed patients but also in healthy hosts. The most common virus infection triggering sHLH is Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) [2] . However, sHLH is not frequently associated with respiratory failure, as seen among SARS-CoV2 patients. Rather, sHLH produces organomegalies such as hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy.Our results suggest that sHLH is not behind the hyperinflammation state of COVID-19. Within the whole cohort, only one patient fulfilled sHLH criteria during early hospitalization; whereas in only four additional patients sHLH was suspected and excluded thereafter during evolution. Interestingly, all those patients had predisposing pathologies; high-grade astrocytoma, advanced breast cancer (one patient), lymphoma (two patients), and recent liver transplantation (one patient). This observation raises the question whether these patients had indeed sHLH manifestations due to COVID-19, or related to comorbidities largely known to be associated with sHLH.Cytopenias occurs in 60-70% of patients with sHLH [2] . However, very few COVID-19 patients presented cytopenias, and if they did, HLH-2004 or HScore criteria were not met. Most of the patients also presented high ferritin levels, which reflects inflammation (after excluding multiple red blood cell transfusions). Fibrinogen was elevated in most COVID-19 patients, contrary to what we should expect in sHLH. This may be reflecting the hypercoagulability state of this disease, and the fact that fibrinogen is an acute-phase protein. It would have been desirable to measure IL-6 levels, since it is modestly elevated in sHLH unlike other hyperinflammatory syndromes, as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) described in Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells or Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) [6] . Furthermore, there have been reports of high levels of IL-6 in COVID-19, but again, not as high as seen in CRS [18] . This observation has led some investigators to propose hyperinflammation in this pathology does not correspond to neither CRS nor sHLH [19] , and might be similar to the so-called Macrophage Activation-Like Syndrome in sepsis [20] [21] .Inflammation is a major cause of morbility and mortality among COVID-19 patients, as previously reported in infections by other coronaviruses [22] . This can be explained by an uncontrolled, self-perpetuating, and tissue-damaging inflammatory activity, highlighted by the increase of a number of markers of inflammation in the curse of the disease [23] [24] . The observation that clinical worsening is often seen at day 8-10 since the symptoms onset, reinforces the idea that it is hyperinflammation and not the virus itself that produces the most severe manifestations [11] . Several prognostic factors are described so far for this new disease, including age, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, high CCI, D-Dimer and ferritin levels [10, [25] [26] [27] [28] .HScore was developed in 2014, to predict the presence of sHLH [6] . Nevertheless, since high HScore at time of hospitalization may reflect severe inflammation rather than sHLH itself, some authors have suggested to use this score in all patients with COVID-19 [8, 15] . Although others discourage this approach [29] [30] , our results suggest 130 or more points of HScore are associated with worse outcomes, namely, the requirement of mechanical ventilation or/and death, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. HScore is relatively easy to calculate, and can eventually lead to aggressive therapies, such as, more potent immunosuppressive agents or immunomodulators [15, [31] [32] [33] [34] .There are some limitations in our study. First, we did not have access to all tests listed in sHLH diagnostic criteria. Namely, NK-lymphocytes study is not currently available in our country; while the soluble CD25 (sCD25) study is not available in our institution. As previously stated, bone marrow study was not performed in all patients, to minimize the researchers' exposure to the virus, and because it was not considered useful for patient management in most cases. Nevertheless, we believe that we can reasonably rule out sHLH as a cause of hyperinflammation in our patients. Finally, during the data collection, hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir were commonly prescribed, while steroids were not. Data from large RCT have modified this practice [35] [36] in favour of steroid use, which in turn could affect the power of HScore to predict poor outcomes.In COVID-19 patients, sHLH seems to be a rare event, but excessive inflammation is common. In our cohort, high HScore (≥130), even at a lower threshold than required for sHLH diagnosis, was associated with poor outcomes. Further studies validating this finding could be helpful to select patients for more aggressive immunosuppressive treatments.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Chile","first author","2021-01-26",1

An emergency physician in Washington DC, Thomas Kirsch, asked on March 24, 2020, ""How much risk do healthcare workers have to take? Or, more bluntly: How many of us will die before we start to walk away from our jobs?"" (Kirsch 2020) . Many healthcare workers stopped showing up at work once COVID-19 hit the USA, due to the shortage of PPE (Cloherty 2020) . Such issues can be more severe in less developed economies. For instance, media reported over 100 nurses stopped coming to work on one single day in a hospital in South America (Galdos 2020) .In this critical time of the COVID pandemic, it is paramount for healthcare workers to feel satisfied with their current jobs and lives without intention to leave their jobs. However, little research has studied the job-related variables of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The existing research on healthcare workers under COVID-19 has focused on workers' mental health and well-being (c.f. a meta-analysis by Pappa et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020) . This study presents the first attempt to document healthcare workers' job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention, and their predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic.We aim to examine the predictive effect on the job-related outcome variables by several canonical risk factors of mental health issues in the pandemic such as age, gender, and education (Lai et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Liang et al. 2020; Yáñez et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020a) . We are also interested in healthcare workers' job-related characteristics, such as office days, and whether they are temporary staff or redeployed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the burgeoning evidence that those variables can predict satisfaction and/or turnover intention in the ongoing pandemic (Labrague and Santos 2020; Zhang et al. 2020a, b) . These predictors can help healthcare organizations to be more specific in developing evidence-based screening for mental health, job satisfaction, and turnover issues of their staff during the COVID-19 pandemic (Yang et al. 2020 ).Bolivia, with the lowest GDP per capita in South America, lacks adequate health infrastructure (Arigho-Stiles 2020). COVID-19 cases appeared in Bolivia on March 10, 2020, and on March 25, 2020, Bolivia declared COVID-19 a national health emergency. COVID-19 has since spread quickly, generating enormous pressure on the country's healthcare workers. Media reported healthcare workers in several hospitals turned away COVID-19 patients out of concern over the limited resources in overcrowded facilities (Laing and Ramos 2020) . On April 23, 2020, Bolivian health workers protested publicly about shortages of PPE and other supplies, including body bags for the dead (Requena 2020) . And the dire situation continues to worsen as the COVID-19 pandemic deepens in Bolivia.This study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) guideline. All participants agreed with their informed consent to enroll in the online survey. Strict confidentiality was assured in the data collection processes was voluntary. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tsinghua University (20200322). We sent out our online survey, developed in English and back translated into Latin American Spanish, to 402 healthcare workers in 83 healthcare facilities (40 in La Paz, 11 in Santa Cruz, and 32 from Table 1 Predicting healthcare workers' job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention (N = 240) .82 0.07 (0.00 to 0.14). other administrative regions) in Bolivia from April 10 to April 30, 2020, 1 month into the COVID-19 emergency in Bolivia.The survey was open to healthcare workers in healthcare institutions such as hospitals, clinics, first emergency responders, medical wards, nursing homes, dental clinics, and pharmacies. Two hundred forty health workers filled the entire survey, resulting in a response rate of 59.7%. The healthcare workers reported their demographic characteristics such as actual age, gender, number of children, education level, daily exercise hours, and number of office days in the past week. We also asked whether they were temporary staff or were redeployed from their usual positions (i.e., from non-ICU to ICU) to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome variables included healthcare workers' job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention.Job Satisfaction We measured healthcare workers' job satisfaction by a five-item scale (Brayfield and Rothe 1951; Montazeri et al. 2011 ). These five items were scored on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) Likert scale. Sample items include ""I find real enjoyment in my work"" and ""most days I am enthusiastic about my work."" The Cronbach's alpha was 0.80.The respondents reported using the five-item scale of Satisfaction with Life (SWL) (Diener et al. 1985) . These five items were scored on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) Likert scale. Sample items include ""in most ways my life is close to my ideal"" and ""the conditions of my life are excellent."" The Cronbach's alpha was 0.81.We used the 5-point scale to measure healthcare workers' turnover intention (Cammann et al. 1979) . The three items were scored on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert scale. Sample items include ""I often think about quitting my job with Fig. 1 The predicted value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention by healthcare workers' age and office days my present organization"" and ""it is very possible that I will look for a new job next year."" The Cronbach's alpha was 0.85.We used Stata 16.0 to summarize the variables and to identify the predictors of job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention with a 95% confidence level. Table 1 shows that 72.9% of the 240 healthcare workers were female, and 8.3% were younger than 29 years old, 29.2% were between 30 and 39 years, 57.5% were between 40 and 59 years, and 5.0% were 60 years or older. Most participants (91.7%) had an undergraduate degree or higher. Less than a third (30.8%) were temporary staffs, and 10.8% had been redeployed to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, 6.7% of participants worked in healthcare facilities 7 days in the past week, 4.2% worked 6 days, 14.2% worked 5 days, and 71.3% worked between 1 and 4 days, and 3.8% worked zero days. Table 2 reports the descriptive statistics and correlations.First, healthcare workers' office days predicted their job satisfaction but the relationship depended on their age (b = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.02; P = .004). Margin analysis showed that office days negatively predicted job satisfaction for the young healthcare workers (e.g., at 25 years old: b = − 0.21; 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.60; P = .006). On the contrary, office days positively predicted job satisfaction for the older workers (e.g., at 65 years old: b = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.44; P = .009).Second, office days predicted workers' life satisfaction overall, and the relationship also depended on their age (b = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.02; P = .04). In particular, the number of office days was positively associated with life satisfaction among the older workers (e.g., at 65 years old: b = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.44; P = .04) but was marginally negatively associated with life satisfaction among the younger workers (e.g., at 25 years old: b = − 0.15; 95% CI: − 0.32 to 0.03; P = .09). In addition, job redeployment (b = − 0.51; 95% CI: − 0.97 to − 0.05; P = .03) and daily exercise hours in the past week (b = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.14; P = .04) both predicted life satisfaction.Lastly, healthcare workers' office days predicted their turnover intention, and the relationship similarly depended on their age (b = − 0.01; 95% CI: − 0.01 to 0.00; P = .05). In particular, the number of office days was positively associated with turnover intention among the younger workers (e.g., at 25 years old: b = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.29; P = .03) but not the older healthcare workers.These results were shown in a forest plot Graf-Vlachy et al. 2020) in Fig. 1 .Healthcare workers are especially critical in the COVID-19 pandemic (Ni et al. 2020) . This study presents the first attempt to identify which healthcare workers have more or less job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention during the COVID-19 pandemic.Several covariates, which were significant predictors of mental health and well-being in healthcare workers in earlier studies, were not significant in our study. For instance, age and gender predicted mental health and well-being among healthcare workers in China (Lai et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Liang et al. 2020 ) and in Iran (Kaveh et al. 2020) , and in Spain (age only) (Romero et al. 2020 ) during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, neither age nor gender predicted outcomes in this study. In addition, education was found to be a predictor of mental health of health staff in studies in China Liu et al. in press) but not in another study in Iran (Zhang et al. 2020a ). Education was not a significant predictor of satisfaction or turnover intention in our sample. These findings support that the predictors of healthcare staff's job-related variables and well-being during a pandemic vary across countries (Zhang et al. 2020a ).Moreover, this study identified several unique risk factors including weekly office days. Importantly, the number of office days predicted job satisfaction positively for the older healthcare staff, but negatively for the younger staff. Similar patterns existed on the outcome variables of life satisfaction, and turnover intention. These findings suggest that healthcare organizations need to pay attention to younger workers working many days a week and older workers with fewer office days.While it can be necessary to redeploy workers or hire temporary staff to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, those workers who were redeployed were less satisfied with their lives. Hence, hospitals may need to better support those redeployed healthcare workers. It is also worth noting that the temporary healthcare staff did not significantly differ from regular staff on job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention.This study has some limitations. First, as data collection is challenging during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly for busy healthcare staff, we used convenience sampling. Second, to our best knowledge, this is the first study that has examined several job characteristics, such as office days, temporary staff, and job redeployment, as predictors for healthcare workers' jobrelated outcomes under COVID-19. Such practices differ across countries and healthcare systems , and future studies may test these factors.Protecting and retaining healthcare workers is paramount during a pandemic. This study demonstrates that healthcare workers' number of office days matters to their job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention. However, the number of office days carries different impacts on younger and older workers. We call for more studies on healthcare workers from the perspective of their ongoing working characteristics under the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bolivia","abstract","2021-01-07",1

A medRχiv PREPRINT","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in December 2019 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . This pandemic started in Wuhan-China, but it quickly spread to several countries worldwide [1] . This rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has caused an urgent need of readily-available forecasts of the spatio-temporal transmission patterns to inform risk assessment and planning instances. In Colombia, the first positive case for the novel corona-virus (SARS-CoV-2), was reported on March 6 of 2020 in Bogota D.C. Then, the virus has spread rapidly to several municipalities in the country, and as of October 29 21 of 2020, 71 municipalities reported historically more than 50 deaths. On March 20 the government declared a nation-wide lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the country. After the first lock downs, several non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolating, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, social distancing, travel restrictions, school, churches and workplace closures were in place in Colombia to reduce transmission of the virus [3, 1] . Although, some of these measures are still in place; the intensity of these restrictions have changed over time as a consequence of reopening attempts, generating changes in mobility and activity patterns. Thus, assessing the temporal variation of transmission in real-time for different regions of the country, based on human mobility, becomes essential for evaluating the possible effects of reopening the economy of the country. Nowcasting and forecasting COVID19 dynamic can also be used to do early detection of possible time periods or scenarios with high transmission intensity, and ultimately help the public health system to assess, intervene and formulate long term public health policies.The ability to generate nowcasts, forecasts, and the early identification of epidemic events can help to develop early-warning systems, which is important to timely implement effective control policies in developing countries [4, 5, 6] . In recent years, the interest in generating real-time epidemic forecasts to help the control and management of infectious diseases has grown, prompted by a succession of global and regional outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola among others [7, 8, 9] . The current availability of epidemiological and digital data streams, enhanced by process-based models that incorporate climate, demography, and mobility among other factors, can provide a basis to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of intervention strategies in changing environments [10, 11, 12] . Different studies have proposed a variety of mechanistic and statistical approaches to forecast seasonal and pandemic diseases [13, 14] . The limitation of statistical models is that these approaches focus on associations and correlations in the epidemiological time series data, but it is not possible to disentangle the mechanisms behind disease transmission dynamics. [15, 13] . Opposed to mechanistic models which are based on biological mechanisms that underlies disease transmission, although forecasting with this models is often computationally intractable [14, 16, 10, 17, 18] .Recently, mathematical models and forecasting algorithms have been used to forecast and survey diseases such as Ebola [5] , influenza [9, 10] and dengue [6] . These forecasting approaches combine assimilation techniques with dynamical transmission models, which allows to re-estimate parameters in real time; therefore their outputs would allow a rapid assessment and decision-making. Forecasting of infectious diseases is valuable tool that allows to understand disease transmission dynamics and to plan future interventions, although it can have biases due to assumptions in the short term value of key epidemiological parameters that mean to map real world setting or human behavior [19, 11] . In this paper, we used a population SEAIIRD model and a iterated filter algorithm to estimate and model the transmission of COVID-19 for municipalities that by the first week of October have reported more than 50 historical deaths. Parameter estimates in this paper are an important contribution for the understanding of SARS-CoV2 spacetime dynamics, and combined these simulations with data assimilation techniques we are able to generate weekly real time now-casting and forecasting of this critical infectious disease in Colombia.We used daily reported cases (new infections) by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) in Colombia, (this data is available in their Coronavirus web page [3] ). Each new infection is identified by a unique case ID and has an associated notification date by the surveillance system (SIVIGILA), the symptoms onset date (reported by the patient to the health care provider) and diagnosis date (reported by laboratory after test confirmation). The epidemiological data also includes recovery date (when an infected patient tested negative for the virus), date of death, age, sex, municipality (county), department, type (imported from other country versus associated i.e., locally-acquired), location, if the patient is currently at home, hospital or ICU and the state/level of the disease (mild, medium or severe symptoms). The number of daily infected people (This number can be denoted by exposed, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, or asymptomatic disease stage) depends on the testing effort, namely, the percentage of positive tests among all tests conducted on a given day. However, we assumed that most reported infections are from symptomatic individuals with severe or mild symptoms. We considered movement between municipalities as the movement in the meta-population. Our model is formulated as a discrete Markov process across days, and it assumes that susceptible individuals get infected at rate λ i which we refer from now as the force of infection (FOI). In the model the FOI is proportional to the number of contacts between susceptible individuals (S i ) and infectious individuals I i at rate β t and with asymptomatic individuals A i at rate σ t β t . The model subdivides infectious stages in 3 classes: i) Exposed (E): Individuals who have the virus but cannot infect others. ii) Asymptomatic or individuals not reported as infected (A): Individuals who have the virus but do not present with symptoms or individuals who do not get tested for SARS-CoV2. iii) Infected: Individuals who are infectious for an average time of 1/γ days before acquiring immunity. Moreover, we suppose asymptomatic individuals (with none or mild symptoms) are a proportion α t of the total infections.We parameterized the transmission model using the municipality-level incidence and death data reported from March 06 to October 11 2020. To estimate model parameters we use an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is applicable to high dimensional models [22, 16, 10] . A iterative filtering approach to infer model parameters was used [23] , this iterated filtering (IF)-EAKF framework has been used to infer parameters in large-scale models as network metapopulation models for other pathogens [23, 10, 16, 24] . This method starts by sampling different parameter combinations from a uniform distribution using latin-hypercube sampling with the prior ranges defined in Table S1 . For addressing the surveillance system report issue we choose the prior fraction of reported cases α to cover almost all its domain. A similar range was used for the relative asymptomatic transmission for unreported individuals that have been shown to be mostly asymptomatic σ [16, 19, 25] . Importantly, in this case we assume that viral load in this sub-population cannot be greater than the viral load reported individuals I i as has been assumed and estimated [1, 25] .Our initial conditions reflect the beginning of the lock-down in Colombia (March 20th). Here, we assume that infected individuals were not only imported to one principal administrative unit like Bogotá D.C. but to the principal Colombian districts and some surrounding municipalities. Hence we also capture the chance that the outbreak might be initiated in multiple municipalities due to community transmission. We assume equal initial conditions for all municipalities regardless of the number of cases reported in the first days of SARS-CoV detection. We assume that on the first day an infected individual was reported, there were 3 exposed individuals I i (0) = 1, E i (0) = 3 at time T i (0) this corresponds to the first day of reported cases by diagnosis date in each Colombian municipalities.We used a data assimilation algorithm (Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF)) to generate real-time forecasts for the epidemic. Kalman filters usually assume a Gaussian distribution for both the prior and likelihood. Therefore, the distribution of the system state can be fully parameterized by the first two moments (the ensemble mean and covariance) [10] . Based on this assumption, the posterior mean and co-variance is calculated through the convolution of two Gaussian distributions. However, by generating the prior using a non-linear model (e.g. the SEIRS model here), the model-filter system is able to accommodate the nonlinear system dynamics despite the linear assumption of the Kalman filter algorithm.For the EAKF, the ensembles are updated deterministically, then the ensemble mean and covariance match their theoretical values exactly. Then, the higher moments of the prior distribution are preserved in the posterior. The EAKF also adjusts the unobserved state variables and parameters based on their covariance with the observed state variables. EAKF is a very suitable technique in problems like this on because its implementation is independent of the dynamical model. This allows both to stimulate and make short term predictions assuming particular scenarios which maps to parameters space [23] . Here we used multiple observations from different locations are used to optimize the model, by iterating over all observations sequentially and adjusting the entire state vector.To assess model performance we used different metrics to evaluate how the nowcasts and forecasts generated perform every week. First, we assessed the performance of our nowcasts at a weekly horizon. For example we use the posterior estimates prior to time T and forecast assuming time variable parameters were constant in the forecasting horizon and equal to me average estimated for the previous week t ∈ [T − 10, T ] this forecast reasoning have also seen in [26] for more details in the forecast methods see section S.5 in Supplementary Material. Then we evaluated the forecast performance using different scores to measure the fit to the observations [27, 28, 29] . We implemented a probabilistic assessment of our forecasts calculating the sharpness of predictive distributions subject to calibration [29, 30] . Finally, to evaluate the performance of the models, the data were split up into two subsets, with each subset used for testing once while the other subset was used for training the models. Results of different performance measures for the model model evaluated weekly are depicted in table 3. By analyzing the results in Table 1 reported monthly, it is clear that the model forecast accurately predicts diseases dynamics one week in advance. Over July our model consistently was able to predict the number of cases in each of the municipalities, although there is much higher variance week-to-week in these forecast compared to national forecasts each week.Absolute error of the median (AE)Log Score (LS) Probabilistic fit log(P t (x t )) [27] 3 ResultsOur median estimate of the effective reproductive number (R ef f ) is presented in figure 4 . This is equivalent to the basic reproductive number, R 0 , at the beginning of the epidemic was around 2.2 [95 % credible interval (CI): 2.21 − 2.32] which coincide with the reported R 0 reported for Colombia for COVID19 [? ] . indicating that this number has been always above 1 for COVID-19 in the country, suggesting a high capacity for sustained transmission (Table 1 and Fig. 1D ). Importantly, reductions in R ef f are associated with the lock-down measures during the April, with sustained increases in this number after the reopening. Figure 4 also show the value of the parameters which R t depends on (β t , σβ t and α). Noteworthy, variation in the contact rates (β = β t ) closely match the trajectory of R ef f and the cases in the country. There is a decreasing trend in the number of detected infections, and important variations in the fraction of asymptomatic cases, which could be causing the most events of infection. We are able to compute the effective reproductive number R ef f as the case reproductive number R t times the fraction of susceptible individuals in the population S t /N where N = i N i for every municipality, this can be seen in Figure S4 and S3.Our median estimates for the latency and infectious period, T e and T r respectively, are ∼ 2.66 and ∼ 2.4 days, and remains constant for most of the period fitted to the data. The parameter α asses the fraction of cases that is reported in the country, we found that just 55% of cases are reported. This estimate reveals a high rate of undocumented infections: 45% as have also been showed with different estimates around the globe [16] . Moreover the estimated time variable parameters (View Figure 4) generally agree with estimated parameters in the literature.This assumption might not hold, as it seems that pre-symptomatic individuals might have higher viral load than symptomatic ones hence infect more [36] . However different models assume asymptomatic individuals infect less than symptomatic ones [37, 1, 38, 12] and transmission model parameter estimation also suggest this [32, 16] .We have demonstrated the potential of sequential data assimilation for COVID-19 dynamics at regional level and in combination with stochastic epidemiological models. By using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter [22] , we successfully have determined the contact parameter from simulated data and obtained reliable estimates from empirical data. Importantly, a characterization of the heterogeneity in the transmission parameter (beta) is the most critical free parameter in the stochastic SEAIIRD model, since other parameters (mean exposed and infectious duration or incubation period) can be extracted from the literature given that are intrinsic parameters of the disease [16, 37] . Given that our transmission rate is estimated in time and this parameter is directly related to the basic reproductive number R 0 [35] , our approach becomes a useful method for statistical inference of the effective reproductive number (R ef f ).Our results are the first estimates for the country and the only estimation of the under-reported or asymptomatic infections. These findings provide a baseline in Colombia for an assessment of the fraction of undocumented infections and their relative infectiousness. These results describe the transmission dynamics in Latino America, one of the regions with the highest attack rates and possible where the pandemic has impacted the most. Interestingly, our approach allows us to evaluate the impact of changes in interventions, viral surveillance and testing on the reported fraction. Here we found that on average the 40% of infections went undocumented could, however, shift in this fraction show their dependency on the time of the peak, the surveillance effort and the spatial heterogeneity. Our findings also indicate that a increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections is needed to fully control SARSCoV-2. Recent evaluation of forecast in the United States have shown the importance of including both probabilistic and point estimates metrics to assess both forecast accuracy (distance to observed data) and quality (coverage of forecast distribution) [26] . Therefore evaluation of the forecasting performance with different score measures show that our epidemiological model and the inference method has the capability of accurately predicting the number of cases in the country one week in advance, as reported results by month in table 1.Our model have four important assumptions on the SARS-CoV2 spread: i) We directly assume the delay from the infection to the report date fitting a Gamma distribution as shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material. This assumption directly assesses the challenge of reconstructing the time series of new infections, as observations occur long after the moment of transmission. [35] . ii) The model and the parameter inference setting let us to estimate time-variable contact rates for both reported individuals and asymptomatic/mild infections, which directly account for the mobility restrictions imposed to reduce the transmission. iii) The model also assumes time-variable asymptomatic/mild infections fraction, which accounts for the possible high number of asymptomatic infections in the country [37, 16] .Our work demonstrates the importance of using mechanistic models biologically motivated, and therefore have parameters that relate to well-established theory and can be interpreted by experts in the field. Although, using mechanistic models allow us to understand aspects of the dynamics behind the temporal patterns, we recognize that statistical models may prove more effective at using past observed trends to forecast the future. Many statistical models were designed to be either more flexible or parsimoniously parametrized, meaning that they may be able to more easily capture dynamics common to infectious disease time-series such as auto-regressive correlation and seasonality. In the case of these emergent pandemic, where limited data is available, mechanistic models may be able to take advantage of assumptions about the underlying transmission process, enabling rudimentary forecasts even with minimal data. On the other hand, many statistical models without assuming a mechanistic structure rely on past data to be able to make forecasts. That said, any forecasts made in settings with limited data must be subjected to rigorous sensitivity analyses, as such forecasts will necessarily be heavily reliant on model assumptions. In summary, our approach becomes a very useful tool for the country to understand the dynamics and estimate effects with comparatively little data at the level of regions, not an entire country.We then compute the transition and removal matrix F and V respectively as follows. And evaluate at the disease free equilibrium S = N .Then the basic reproductive number computed as the maximum eigen-value of F V −1 .Where we define R u as the expected secondary infection due to under-reported individuals (recall that this we also believe this contribution is mostly due to asymptomatic infections which by definition are the individuals less captures by the surveillance system) and R r as the expected secondary infection due to reported individuals. This is consistent with the term involved in the proposed Force of Infection (FOI) in Equation 1, which only assume that unreported and reported individuals infect susceptible ones. Note that for the reproductive number do to under-reported individuals R u the fraction (1 − ζ)(1 − α) is the expected fraction of population entering the A compartment, here zeta is the infect fatality risk and alpha the fraction of reported individuals, where σβ is their transmission or contact rate and T r is the average time expected in the A compartment. Similar for the reproductive number do to reported individuals R r we have (1 − ζ)α is the expected number of individuals entering the I compartment and β is their transmission rate and T r is the expected time before acquiring immunity.As we assume the contact rate is time variable β = β(t) we then compute the effective reproductive number in municipality i as, where S i (t) is the posterior sample of the estimated value of susceptible individuals at time t and N i is the population in the municipalite i:We then compute the national effective reproductive number as, for each one of the 71 municipalities that have reported more than 71 deaths by the date.We fit a Gamma distribution to the difference in days between symptom onset date and diagnosis date for addressing the report delay natural of the surveillance system using the SCIPY package available in Python [39] . The figure  below shows some examples of the fitted Gamma distribution for the capitals of states/departments in Colombia. Note that using the fitted gamma distribution worth to model as probably by surveillance system or diagnosis laboratory reports an unusual number of cases is reported usually at 15 days. Therefore we recall the importance of used a fitted distribution rather than the empirical measured one. The importance of modeling this report delay have also been highlighted in current best practices for estimating the time varying effective reproductive number [40, 35] . Figure S1 : Fitted delay distributions for some municipalities. As seen is more frequent that the data is reported with a specific delay between symptom onset and diagnosis at 15 or 16 days (about 2 weeks) which we believe is due to return of diagnosis by the laboratories. Therefore we recall the importance of used a fitted distribution rather than the empirical measured one.Commuters evolution from Facebook mobility data mobility in four different time periods.For estimating the key local epidemiological parameters and therefore characterizing the disease spread of COVID19 we use flat uninformed priors as shown in table S1. For the infect fatality risk parameter (IFR) ζ we search over all the IFR range reported for different countries and across ages [41, 42] .For forecasting t > T where T is the last fitted day for all municipalities. We do not attempt to model or impose assumptions about future change in behavior that might impact the contact rate β or assume for example that testing is increasing resulting in increased report fraction α. We simply use the estimated values of the time varying parameters prior to the forecast horizon (we simple assume parameters will remain constant in the future). However for modeling temporal variation of behavior and based on the belief that behavioral changes occur smoothly in time we average over the last 10 days instead of using the last day estimates. We attempt to use more than one week as estimates might be impacted by report model of the surveillance system as has been showed in [40] . This approach have been similarly followed in [26] . We then assume for time variable parameters θ(t) that their value in the forecast horizon t f follows Equation 3 . Moreover for embedding this into the EAKF framework we treat each ensemble separately, therefore conserving parameter estimates within each ensemble member.Median estimates of the effective reproductive number R ef f for the top 5 municipalities with more reported cumulative death by October.

This study extends Alvarez et al. (2020) , in which the authors analyze the evolution of the COVID-19 in a dataset of 191 countries. The paper utilizes a clustering method based on the correlation distance and a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), from which they obtain a Hierarchical Tree (HT). The algorithm identifies three clusters, each one associated with a different shape in the infections curve. The authors suggest that the COVID-19 propagation is a complex phenomenon whose dynamics can be better understood within the framework of the complex systems theory.Besides the already-mentioned Alvarez et al. (2020) , other authors have also employed nonparametric techniques in order to analyze the COVID-19 dynamics. Zarikas et al. (2020) analyze the set of 30 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and identify four main clusters during the period between the 22nd of January 2020 and the 4th of April 2020. One of the groups is characterized by an abrupt increase in the number of active cases. A second cluster is associated with both an increase and a flattening in the curve of infections. A third group clustered the countries with the lowest number of cases and finally, the fourth group showed an abrupt increase during the last part of the period analyzed.A K-means clustering study is presented in Chandu (2020) , in which the author analyses countries with at least 1,000 COVID-19 cases (for a discussion on the clustering algorithm see Fahim (2020) ). The algorithm grouped the set of countries into two clusters. It was observed that one of the clusters, integrated mainly by European countries, Australia, USA and Canada was characterized by a high fatality rate.On the same line, Machado and Lopes (2020) analyze a data set of 79 countries following two approaches, heuristic models and hierarchical clustering. The authors point out that the emergence and propagation of COVID-19 is an example of a complex system. A consequence of this observation is that the analysis of the new Coronavirus disease requires a methodological framework that assumes the fact that the World is currently facing a rare and extreme event. As we will explain in the methodological section, in the first stage of this work we analyze the spread of the coronavirus as a complex network in which each link represents how similar the coronavirus dynamics is between any pair of countries. Additionally, network analysis is applied in order to identify the intensity of the similarity among communities.The above-mentioned studies were carried out for different time frames and countries obtaining diverse results. This suggests that findings related to the evolution of the pandemic are sensitive to these factors. Considering that countries presented a greater variety of trajectories as the disease progressed, this study is based on analyzing the evolution of contagions from a dynamic perspective.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces data, Section 3 presents the methodology, whereas section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, section 5 concludes.This study is based on the COVID-19 data of active cases per population published by ""Our World in Data"" (Roser et al., 2020) . This source is put together with information from a variety of sources: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, government reports, Oxford COVID-19, Government Response Tracker, World Bank -World Development Indicators, United Nations Statistics Division and Eurostat.In particular, our main variable of interest is ""new cases per million"", reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We compare the evolution of the disease in countries that by December 2 had data for more than 250 days after the confirmation of the tenth case. With the aim of having a balanced panel that allows to perform distance metrics, all countries' data of new cases per million are considered for the same time span. This implies that each country's COVID-19 cases are considered in a different period. For example, for China, the first country that identified the disease, the period between January 22 and September 27 2020 is considered. The country with the most recent data is Mali, which by March 27 had more than 10 confirmed cases, being analyzed until December 1st.A seven-day moving average smoothing centered on the day of reference was made to the original data, reducing the time series to the central 244 data. Additionally, some countries were removed due to having records of negative new cases after the applied smoothing (Uganda, San Marino, Mauritius, Monaco, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Jordan and Ecuador). Moreover, Tanzania was removed due to her stopping cases report since May. Consequently, the analysis is based on 124 series of 244 observations each.Additional information from ""Our World in Data"" was considered for groups' analysis. In particular, socioeconomic indicators -Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI)-, demographic/population density, median age, life expectancyand others related to the pandemic -Government response, testing policy, contact tracing, etc.-were considered (see Appendix 1).Following the methodology developed by Mantegna (1999) , in this study the coronavirus propagation is formulated as a network problem, where each country would be represented as a node, and the relationship between each pair of countries as a link.On a first stage, distances between the time series of new cases per million of inhabitants are calculated to construct complete adjacency matrices. Pearson's correlation is the select measure of distance, which summarizes the grade of similarity of new registered cases per million of inhabitants between countries at each considered time window. Given that Pearson's correlation is an invariant to scale measure (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015) , countries that had similar shapes at their trajectories of propagation but differ in the proportion of the affected population will be considered similar and likely to cluster. Following Mantegna and Stanley (2000) , Pearson's correlations between the n x n pairs of chosen countries is computed (see Equation 1) as followswhere r i is the number of new daily cases in country i and ( r i ) is the average value of r i during the considered period. Then, the correlation matrix is built with the correlation coefficients ρ ij . By definition ρ ij takes values in the interval(−1,1), where −1 means completely anti-correlation, 1 complete correlation and 0 that the two variables are uncorrelated. This matrix is symmetrical, with ρ ij =1 in this main diagonal. As it is well known, the Pearson correlation coefficient (1) does not fulfill the three axioms that define a Euclidean metric. For this reason, the correlation matrix is transformed into the correlation distance matrix according to the Equation 2which fulfills the three axioms of an Euclidean distance:Subsequently, Prim's algorithm (Prim, 1957) is applied to adjacency matrix to obtain Minimal Spanning Trees (MST). Being introduced to graph theory by Kruskal (1956) and Prim (1957) , MST have been a widely used tool (Limas, 2019; Górski et al., 2008; Kwapień et al., 2009; Rešovský et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) , mainly because it simplifies network analysis by selecting the most relevant bounds. Indeed, MST are characterized for representing the core information of a complete network with n nodes by selecting the n-1 links that minimize the overall distance.Prim's algorithm establishes a procedure in successive stages for the selection of MST links. Taking the information from a complete adjacency matrix, at each step a node is selected and incorporated to the network. The criteria is to choose, from the not connected nodes, the one that has the shortest distance to a connected one. At the end of the process all nodes (n) are connected by n-1 links in a network that has the smallest possible total length (Prim, 1957) .Subsequently, the single linkage method is applied to obtain a subordinant ultrametric distance matrix from constructed MST. This graph method is a particular agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. It starts by considering all the nodes of the network as subgroups. In successive stages, the less distant subgroups are joined, the distance between the new subgroup and the rest is determined based on the nearest neighbor criteria.Additionally, every subordinate ultrametric distance matrix can be represented by a Hierarchical Tree (HT) or dendrogram (Gan et al., 2007) .Finally, the pseudo T 2 and CH cutting criteria are considered to determine the optimal number of groups, the highest number of suggested groups with a maximum of 30 is the one chosen. The described procedure is repeated for each considered time window.Four measures are considered to analyze group conformation dynamics; MST total distance, MST average path and number of identified groups, and the number of times two countries where in the same group.Total distance (Equation 3) corresponds to the total sum of the MST links with the lowest connection cost (taking into account their respective weights). When comparing two MSTs, the one with the lower sum of links has a lower connection cost, reflecting a major coincidence in countries disease evolution.In the case of analysis, average path refers to the average distance in the evolution of the disease between two countries of the considered MST.A lower average geodesic indicates that on average, any two countries of the network had more similar evolution in COVID -19 contagions. The geodesic between nodes i and j is the shortest path between them (Jackson, 2010) . Equation 4 reflects how to calculate average distance, for which it is necessary to define geodesics concept. From all possible paths between i and j in which any node does not figure more than one time, the geodesic is the shortest. When considering the I geodesics of the MST, the i-th one is represented as n i ∈ (1 , I) .Averagepat h=The number of identified clusters in each time window is determined as the highest number of suggested groups according to pseudo T 2 and CH cutting criteria. A smaller number of groups implies the presence of countries where the disease evolves in a similar way but that differs from how it evolves in other groups. The increase in the number of groups implies difficulties in identifying groups of countries that differ from others according to the evolution of the disease.Finally, the number of times two countries are in the same group can provide information on groups' stability. If the identified groups are constant (two nodes are always -95 timesor never -0 times -in the same group), the similarity in disease evolution between countries does not change in time, and otherwise, it is dynamic.Subsection 3.1 procedure is repeated in every time window, obtaining information about which countries belong to the same group. Intensity in similarity of disease evolution is estimated by the number of times two countries were in the same group. Given that 95 time windows of 150 days amplitude that move one day at a time are considered, the lowest possible intensity between two countries is 0 and the highest 95. With this information, an adjacency matrix and the corresponding network is constructed.Community identification is done by Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) . This method aims to achieve the maximum modularity (Equation 5), that represents the difference between observed links and the expected ones by the assumption that communities structure is independent from links formation over total links. Modularity takes values between -1 and 1, with 0 meaning that communities are independent of the amount of internal links, 1 that links are only formed inside the community and -1 that links are outside the community.Obswhere nis the number of nodes in the network (124), e i , j t the element i , j of the adjacency The procedure starts with n communities of one node each, which is moved to neighboring communities if it implies an increase of modularity. First, community structure is obtained when these movements do not produce a major modularity. Then the procedure is repeated considering the formed communities as nodes and the sum of edges as links. Algorithm ends when the movement of nodes between communities does not increase modularity.Communities are characterized in several aspects. In particular, socioeconomic, demographic and geographical indicators are considered. Other information related to the pandemic, such as number of deaths and taken actions are also incorporated (more specific information is provided in Appendix 1).This section presents the results in 3 subsections. The dynamics of the groups identified in each time span is analyzed in the first subsection. The second subsection presents the main observations of the intensity network in similarity of disease evolution and the identified communities. Finally, the third section presents the results' robustness.Communities of countries by the intensity of similarity in the disease evolution.Three communities of countries were identified from the intensity of similarity in the disease evolution network (see Appendix 2), represented in Figure 4 . Community 1 is conformed by 56 countries, community 2 of 59 and community 3 has only 9 members.In particular, community 1 has the highest average population density, with most countries in the 4 th quartile. In terms of median age, average per capita GDP, average life expectancy and average HDI, community 2 has the highest value. These communities present average values more similar to each other than to community 3 in most of the variables considered. Community 3 has the lowest population density and the youngest population (lowest average median age), but it is by far the most vulnerable in terms of the others variables.Testing policy codebook: 0 -No testing policy, 1 -Only those who both (a) have symptoms and also (b) meet specific criteria (e.g. key workers, admitted to hospital,came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas), 2 -Testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms, 3 -Open public testing (e.g. ""drive through"" testing available to asymptomatic people).*Any country of the sample had category 0 as predominant testing policy. Tracing policy codebook: 0 -No tracing, 1 -Some, but not all, cases are traced, 2 -All cases are traced.More differences can be identified in terms of predominant testing and contact tracing policies (see table 3 ). In communities 1 and 2, the most frequent testing policy between January 22 and December 1 st was to test anyone showing symptoms, while in community 3 people had to also meet specific criteria. Tracing policy has also been more rigorous in communities 1 and 2; the most frequent tracing policy between January 22 and December 1 st was to traced almost all cases, in community 3 it was to trace some cases. Given that in average, communities 1 and 2 had smoother evolution of the disease than community 3, testing and tracing policies seems to be important in controlling contagions. Even so, communities are not homogeneous in the implementation of these policies, indicating that these measures do not guarantee the control the COVID-19 spread.Having a similar evolution of the disease did not imply different results in terms of deaths, since average community registered deaths at December 1 st per million are similar between communities. Moreover, higher averages on healthcare access and quality index were not reflect in lower deaths averages (see table 4 ). 10 20 1 4 16 12 3 Source: own construction based on OWID data. Note: The difference between thesum of the countries frequency and total countries per group at each variable are due to lack of data.Variations in the maximum number of groups allowed in each time window can have effects in formed communities. In this study, results were obtained for a maximum of 10, 20 and 30 groups per time window. Identified communities were stable; only 10 out of 124 countries belonged to a different community in at least one of the exercises performed. Table 5 presents observed countries community changes when varying the maximum of allowed groups per window. Appendix 3 presents countries' values and quartiles per considered variable, confirming that communities are still diverse when these changes in membership are considered.Measuring the intensity of similarity in the disease evolution, three communities of countries were found, with distinctive aspects in their average behaviors. Community 1 presents the most controlled path, while in Community 3 average contagions were more unstable. Community 2 presents an intermediate average evolution, with an initial wave followed by a more stable path. Even so, communities' members were diverse in several aspects, and the three communities present particular cases that do not follow the average behavior. All communities presented positive trends, which suggests that the number of infections will continue for a while. Furthermore, the multiplicity of dynamics suggests that the impact on the national economies will be heterogeneous, with some countries less affected. This might be observed in the levels of unemployment. In this regard, Milani (2020) finds that the behavior of unemployment across countries has been very heterogeneous. In Latin American countries, and even in the US, socially disadvantaged populations cannot follow the order to stay at home. Thus, the issue of income inequality turns to be the main obstacle for a complete and effective implementation of social distancing measures. Even so, each community is integrated by countries from different GDP per capita levels.Our results confirm the initial assumption. The spread of COVID-19 is a complex phenomenon, characterized by both a multiplicity of patterns and non-linear dynamics. This point suggests, on one hand, the presence of diverse drivers behind the spread of the COVID-19 and that public policy responses should not be homogeneous, but should rather be adapted to different contexts. However, it is important to note that communities with a more stable evolution were composed by a majority of countries implementing stricter testing and contact tracing policies.In particular, policy makers should specify in their objective function which segments of the population are being targeted and which indicators are been used. In this regard, as Ehlert (2020) points out, policymakers should consider the identification of risk groups when designing their response strategies. In addition, Huang et al. (2020) recommend policy makers to guarantee that the impacts of public policy include the interests of the socially disadvantaged groups. It is also important to consider the existence of trade-offs within the objective function, since minimizing both COVID-19 propagation and economic impacts might be two conflicting goals. On this line, Mahasinghe et al. (2020) suggest that the lockdown strategies are non-linear. For example, in the case of Italy, Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandio (2020) offer evidence that the shutdown of service activities is effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality, although shutting down factories is less effective. Thus, they recommend closing down services, however the government should be more careful when considering closing down factories, particularly given the social costs derived from halting production. In the case of Chile, Asahi et al (2020) found out that localized lockdowns were associated to up to 15% drop in the local economic activity.Regarding the service sector, it would be important to have a second thought when considering a complete shut down in the tourism sector, as Ehlert (2020) suggests. In his study of Germany's 401 counties, he finds no evidence of the tourism sector as a driver of infection or death rates. At this point, it would be important to consider that tourism encompasses a wide range of activities and that many tourists travel in order to isolate themselves during their leisure time. Thus, this activity might be favoring conditions for social distancing. In the case of Latin American countries, in which the rate of infections and mortality has been growing, policy makers might stimulate self-isolation through promoting the use of resorts for risk groups.The Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index is measured on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) based on death rates from 32 causes of death that could be avoided by timely and effective medical care (also known as 'amenable mortality'). -Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.

Social distancing has been one of the most important public health policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic (Aquino et al., 2020) . Social distancing policy is characterized by mobility restriction in public areas and 'stay-at-home' recommendation, mainly for the high-risk groups for COVID-19 severity (Aquino et al., 2020) . Thus, this scenario may contribute to individuals spending more time inside their homes. Although the benefits of social distancing policy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is well-recognized, we have reported by accelerometer-based analysis that older adults with hypertension have reduced their time spent in physical activities (PA) and increased sedentary behavior (SB) during the pandemic (Browne et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the greater changes have occurred on the weekend (Browne et al., 2020) .Housing characteristics (e.g. housing type, housing surface area and household size) are associated with PA and SB levels (McKee et al., 2015; Pettigrew et al., 2020; Saidj et al., 2015; Svensson et al., 2017) . Older adults who reside in detached house have higher PA level than those who reside in apartments, row house and semi-detached house (McKee et al., 2015) . Individuals who reside in apartment spend less time in domestic PA and more time in SB than those who reside in house (Saidj et al., 2015; Svensson et al., 2017) . Moreover, smaller housing surface area or household size also was associated with more time in SB (Saidj et al., 2015) . In a longitudinal study, housing type and housing surface area did not predict changes in SB over 5 years, but the decrease in household size number was associated with an increase in SB (Saidj et al., 2015) . Despite the findings of previous studies, it is unclear whether housing characteristics are associated with changes in PA and SB during a period of social distancing policy, which includes a 'stay-at-home' recommendation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this exploratory study investigated the association between housing characteristics with objectively measured changes in PA and SB during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic in older adults with hypertension.This is an exploratory study, which is a secondary analysis of a previous research designed to investigate the initial impact of social distancing policy imposed due to COVID-19 on objectively measured PA and SB in older adults with hypertension involved in an interrupted clinical trial. Briefly, a sample of Brazilian older adults with hypertension who were screened for the Hypertension EXercise Approaches study (HEXA study; http://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-4ntszb/) were assessed before and during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Natal, Brazil. For more details, see Browne et al. (2020) . This observational study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the Onofre Lopes University Hospital (protocol 4.005.835/2020) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants were informed about all study procedures and provided written informed consent.The HEXA study was interrupted immediately after the first case of COVID-19 in the city of Natal in March 2020. A total of 41 participants were screened for the HEXA study before the period of social distancing policy (from January to March 2020). Among these participants, only 36 agreed to participate in the present study. The eligibility criteria of the HEXA study are available in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (http: //ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-4ntszb/). The main inclusion criteria were: aged 60-80 years; medical diagnosis of hypertension; not being engaged in a regular PA program in the past three months; being physically inactive (i.e. < 150 min/wk of moderate-vigorous PA). The main exclusion criteria were: previous cardiovascular events or diseases; uncontrolled hypertension (> 160/105 mmHg); contraindications to exercise, as indicated on the cardiopulmonary exercise testing; osteomioarticular injuries that limit the ability to exercise; neurological progressive disorders. Most of these participants met the eligibility criteria of the HEXA study, except 8 participants who were considered physically active by accelerometer-based analysis (i.e. ≥ 150 min/wk of moderate-vigorous PA). However, for the current exploratory study, the 8 physically active participants have been included. Nine of the 36 participants who agreed to participate in the present study were in the familiarization period of the interrupted clinical trial (< 1 month; 3 weekly aerobic exercise sessions of 15-20 minutes) and 27 were screened, but have not begun the familiarization with the exercise intervention.An initial screening was carried out at the Department of Physical Education of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) before the period of social distancing policy imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic, including medical history, medication use, sociodemographic (age, sex, education, marital status) and behavioral (smoking status, alcohol use, exercise practice) characteristics, clinical examination, and accelerometer-based PA and SB measures. A clinical examination was performed with anthropometric (weight and height) and resting blood pressure (BP) measurements. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared, and categorized into normal weight (< 27.0 kg/m 2 ), overweight (27.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and obese (≥ 30.0 kg/m 2 ). Resting BP was measured in a seated position using an oscillometric device (Omron HEM-780-E, Kyoto, Japan) in triplicate with 2-minute interval between each measure. The average value of the last two measures was considered for analysis (Malachias et al., 2016) , and categorized into controlled BP (< 140/90 mmHg) and uncontrolled BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg). The cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score was categorized into low, moderate and high risk by the Framingham risk score, considering the following criteria: age, sex, smoking, BMI, systolic BP, treatment for hypertension and diabetes (D'Agostino et al., 2008) . The total weighted accumulation (weekdays and weekend) of PA measured by accelerometer for 7 days was considered for the classification of PA level. Based on the moderate-vigorous PA, the older adults were classified as: physically active (≥ 150 min/wk of moderate-vigorous PA) or inactive (< 150 min/wk of moderate-vigorous PA) (Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009 ).Since the interruption of the HEXA study on March 2020, all participants have been receiving weekly phone calls from the research staff to be monitored regarding COVID-19 symptoms. The participants were invited by phone calls to participate in the present study after a 11-week period from the beginning of social distancing policy in the city of Natal, Brazil. Accordingly to the information reported by the participants by weekly phone calls, none of them were involved in an exercise training program following the interruption of the HEXA study. Given that there is no evidence that exercise interventions modify the non-exercise PA level (Fedewa et al., 2017) and that all participants were assessed 11 weeks after the interruption of HEXA study, we have included the 9 participants who were in the familiarization period and the 27 participants who were only screened, but have not begun the familiarization with the exercise intervention in the interrupted clinical trial. All participants who agreed to participate in this study received sterilized accelerometers in their homes between June 1 st and June 3 rd , 2020, to be used during 7 consecutive days. The accelerometer-based PA and SB measures during the period of social distancing policy occurred during a period of high mobility restriction in the public areas within the city of Natal, which included 'stay-at-home' recommendation, especially for older adults and high-risk individualsthose with non-communicable chronic diseases. In addition to the accelerometer-based PA and SB measures, information about housing characteristics that the participants were residing in during the social distancing period, including housing type, housing surface area (m 2 ) and household size (i.e. number of persons residing in the home) were collected by phone calls. Housing type was categorized into apartment, row house and detached house. Housing surface area was categorized by the tertiles: ≤ 105 m 2 , 106-249 m 2 , and ≥ 250 m 2 . Household size was categorized into 1-2 persons and 3+ persons.PA and SB were objectively measured by accelerometry (GT3X, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, USA). All participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on their right hip during 7 consecutive days, including awake and asleep periods, and to remove it during bathing. They also filled out a diary describing the time they took off the accelerometer during the awake period, went to bed and waking up. A sampling rate of 60 Hz with a period of 60 seconds was used with the normal filter enabled. Non-wearing time was defined as ≥ 90 consecutive minutes of zero counts with a tolerance of up to 2 minutes of ≥ 100 counts/min (Choi et al., 2011) . Participants with at least three valid weekdays of accelerometer wearing time (≥ 600 min/day) with at least one weekend day, totaling at least four valid days, were included in the data analysis (Trost et al., 2005) . Although there is no consensus on the cut-off points for older adults, we used those which are most commonly reported in this population (Migueles et al., 2017) . The cut-offs in counts per minutes to define SB, light PA, and moderate-vigorous PA were: 0-99, 100-1951 100- , and ≥ 1952 100- , respectively (Freedson et al., 1998 Matthews et al., 2008) . PA and SB measures were analyzed as weekdays and weekend using the ActiLife version 6.13.3.2 software program. The variables considered for analysis were: steps/day; time spent in SB, light PA, and moderate-vigorous PA (in minutes per day).Descriptive data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), absolute and relative (%) frequencies. A generalized linear mixed model with subject as a random effect and time period (after vs. before the 'stay-at-home' recommendation; i.e. binary variable) and predictors as fixed effects was used to assess the housing characteristics associated to objectively measured changes in PA and SB, controlling for: a) accelerometer wear time; b) age, sex, education and accelerometer wear time. For all analyses, the baseline assessment of the participants for the original HEXA study, which have occurred between January to March 2020, was considered as 'before' the pandemic. All assessments 'during' the pandemic have occurred in the same week of June 2020. A robust estimation was used for the fixed effects model. The generalized linear model was used to compare the housing surface area between housing types. The model results were expressed as coefficient estimates (β) and its 95% Wald confidence intervals (CI), estimated marginal means (EMM) ± standard error (SE), pairwise contrasts and its 95% Wald CI. Residuals distribution was verified using the normal Q-Q plot. A twotailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Win/ v.26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).Among the 41 participants invited to participate in the study, five participants declined to participate (three for personal reasons, one was sick with dizziness symptoms, and one was in quarantine due to direct contact with a relative infected by COVID-19). One participant was excluded due to a technical issue with the accelerometer data. Thus, a total of 35 older adults with hypertension were included in the final analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included participants. Most participants were women (65.7%), physically inactive (77.1%), residing in a detached house (57.1%), and with three or more relatives (51.4%). Only 14.3% (n = 5) of participants were residing in an apartment. All apartments were located in condominium buildings, which contain concierge, security service, private garage and leisure area. The use of condominiums' leisure area was restricted during the period of data collection. All participants were taking anti-hypertensive medication(s). In addition, the participants had a moderate CVD risk (42.9%) or high CVD risk (57.1%). Approximately one-third of participants had uncontrolled BP (37.1%) and one-fourth were ex-smokers (22.9%). Table 2 and Figure 1 show the results of housing type, housing surface area and household size as predictors of objectively measured changes in PA and SB during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for the accelerometer wearing time. Housing type was a significant predictor of objectively measured changes in PA and SB (p < 0.05), but housing surface area and household size were not significant predictors (p > 0.05). Age, sex, education, BMI and CVD risk were not associated with objectively measured changes in PA and SB (p > 0.05; data not shown). Despite this, we examined the models of housing type, housing surface area and household size as predictors of objectively measured changes in PA and SB during the COVID-19 pandemic controlling for the age, sex, education and accelerometer wearing time (Supplementary Table 1 ). The results of all models remained unchanged.Regarding the weekdays, residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA (β = -65 min/day, p = 0.035) and a trend toward significance for an increase in SB (β = 55 min/day, p = 0.056) compared to those residing in a detached house. Participants residing in a row house showed a greater decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (β = -10 min/ day, p = 0.037) and steps/day (β = -2,064, p = 0.010) compared to those residing in a detached house. Residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on the weekend (β = -83 min/day, p = 0.015) and a greater increase in SB (β = 72 min/day, p = 0.036) than residing in a detached house. Despite this, participants residing in a detached house showed a decrease in moderate-vigorous PA compared to those residing in an apartment (β = -11 min/day, p = 0.016).Additional analyzes were performed to check whether the housing Values expressed as mean ± SD and absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%).

The results remained unchanged after including housing surface area or household size in the models (data not shown). Moreover, housing surface area was compared between the housing types. The detached house (322 m 2 , 95%CI 263, 394) had a larger housing surface area (p < 0.001) than the row house (127 m 2 , 95% CI 92, 175) and apartment (92 m 2 , 95% CI 50, 169). There was no significant difference between apartment and row house (p > 0.05).Generalized linear mixed models of housing type, housing surface area and household size as predictors of objectively measured changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior during the period of social distancing policy due to COVID-19 pandemic in older adults with hypertension (n = 35).

The models were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model controlling for the accelerometer wearing time.Bold values indicate significance at p < 0.05. Abbreviations: MVPA, moderate-vigorous physical activity; PA, physical activity. Table 3 shows the within-group changes in PA and SB of participants residing in an apartment, row house and detached house. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the participants already had low PA (e.g. < 6,500 steps/day; ~15 min/day moderate-vigorous PA) and high SB levels (> 10 h/day) on weekdays and weekend. Regarding the within-group changes on the weekdays, residing in an apartment showed an increase in SB (65 min/day, p = 0.008) and a decrease in light PA (-74 min/day, p = 0.005). Participants residing in a row house showed a decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (-11 min/day, p = 0.007) and steps/ day (-2,173, p = 0.002). No changes were found for detached house (p > 0.05). On weekend, there was an increase in SB among participants residing in an apartment (114 min/day, p < 0.001) and row house (60 min/day, p = 0.015). There was a decrease in light PA among participants residing in an apartment (-118 min/day, p < 0.001) and a trend toward significance for those residing in a row house (-49 min/day, p = 0.053). In addition, residing in a row house showed a decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (-11 min/day, p = 0.013) and steps/day (-2,968, p = 0.001). Participants residing in a detached house showed a decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (-6 min/day, p = 0.018) and steps/day (-1,230, p = 0.014) on weekend.This exploratory study investigated the housing characteristics associated with objectively measured changes in PA and SB during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults with hypertension. The main findings indicate that housing type was associated with changes in PA and SB: i) participants who resided in an apartment showed a greater reduction in the light PA and increase in the SB compared to those who resided in a detached house on weekdays and on weekend; ii) participants who resided in a row house showed a greater reduction in the moderatevigorous PA and steps/day compared to those who resided in a detached house on weekdays.Older adults with hypertension are a high-risk group for severity of COVID-19 (Espinosa et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) , which requires more rigid social distancing policy. The data collection in this study occurred during a period of high mobility restriction in the public areas with a 'stay-at-home' recommendation implemented by the governor of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, of which Natal is the capital city. This scenario probably contributed to the participants spending more time inside their homes. Previous studies have shown that housing characteristics (e.g. housing type, housing surface area and household size) are associated with PA and SB levels (McKee et al., 2015; Pettigrew et al., 2020; Saidj et al., 2015; Svensson et al., 2017) . However, as observed in Figure 1 and Table 2 , our data support the idea that only housing type is associated with changes in PA and SB levels which occurred during the period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants who resided in an apartment or a row house showed greater unhealthy changes in movement behavior (less PA, more SB). It should be noted that before the period of social distancing the participants who resided in an apartment or a row house already had low PA and high SB levels. However, they showed a Table 3 Estimated marginal means and pairwise contrasts of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior during the period of social distancing policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults with hypertension according to housing type (n = 35). Values are expressed as estimated marginal means (EMM) ± standard error (SE), and pairwise contrasts and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). The models were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model controlling for the accelerometer wearing time.Bold values indicate significance at p < 0.05. Abbreviations: MVPA, moderate-vigorous physical activity; PA, physical activity.greater decrease in the PA and increase in SB levels compared to their peers who resided in a detached house. Therefore, it seems that housing type may contribute to individuals change more or less their movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during a more rigid period of social distancing policy. The housing surface area of the apartments and row houses of the participants who resided in these housing types is equivalent to ~29% and ~39%, respectively, of the housing surface area of the detached houses. A larger housing surface area combined with other architecture features such as the presence of backyard and garden might have contributed to participants who resided in detached houses mitigating the unhealthy changes in PA and SB during the period of social distancing period policy, which did not occur with those who resided in apartments or row houses. It is reasonable to think that under a more rigid social distancing period policy, the participants who resided in detached houses had more possibilities to be involved in PA inside their homes, particularly within the domestic and leisure domains. In addition, we believe that as social distancing imposes mobility restriction in the public areas, the participants who resided in apartments and row houses might have reduced their PA levels mainly in the transportation and leisure domains. However, different from those who resided in detached houses, it seems that they were not able to replace the PA performed in the transportation and leisure domains outside for PA inside their homes, potentially due to the limited area and unfavorable architecture features. As a consequence, they might have increased their time in SB such as watching TV. Taken together, this above-mentioned perspective could partially explain the greater reduction in the steps/ day, light and moderate-vigorous PA and the increase in the SB observed in the participants who resided in apartments and row houses.Although not objectively assessed in the present study, it is reasonable to think that the life-space mobility (LSM) of the participants was restricted during the period of social distancing policy. Briefly, LSM refers to the physical and social environment an individual inhabits on a day-to-day basis considering the frequency and independence. LSM is commonly structured into 'life zones', ranging from a restricted and dependent mobility (life-space 0, bedroom) to an unrestricted and independent mobility to travel out of town (life-space 5; unlimited) (Taylor et al., 2019) . It should be noted that LSM focuses on the performed actions rather than abilities of an individual, providing a picture of what he/she 'does do' rather than what he/she physically 'can do' (Taylor et al., 2019) . All participants from the present study were physically independent. For example, all of them performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill as a part of the HEXA study screening procedures (data not shown). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic context, it is probable that the LSM of the participants declined and became more concentrated in more restricted 'life zones' (life-space 0; bedroom; life-space 1, home; life-space 2, outside house), independent of their housing types. Studies designed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LSM in older adults are needed to confirm (or not) our assumption.The unhealthy changes in movement behavior observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the participants might have health-related consequences involving both physical and mental aspects (Browne et al., 2020; Creese et al., 2020; Werneck et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2020) . As previously suggested (Browne et al., 2020) , home-based actions focusing on reducing the time spent in prolonged SB and reallocating time for PA independent of its intensity seems to be more realistic as a first-level approach; i.e. breaking up prolonged leisure-time SB with light PA and doing household chores more frequently. Although more challenging, particularly for individuals who reside in apartments and row houses, a second-level approach could be to include specific exercises focusing on maintaining health-related fitness; i.e. for cardiorespiratory exercises: marching in place, stair climbing, dancing; for muscular strength: bodyweight exercises, such as chair squats, wall push-ups, and calf raises. Workout videos from well-recognized institutions, including simple, low-cost, and safe exercises would be an option: i.e. an online workout video from the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (https://youtu.be/eLClKvN9Qag). Also, wearable fitness technologies can be useful to help older adults to meet the recommended PA levels. As a public health initiative, governments should consider delivering clear and practical information to older adults on how and why increasing PA and decreasing SB is important during these challenging times of COVID-19 pandemic. It seems pivotal the inclusion of feasible actions to overcome the new barriers to be physically active imposed by the pandemic in this population. Despite the above-mentioned possibilities, it must be clear that there is no 'one size fits all' solution to reach healthier movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest a need for specific PA interventions delivered to older adults who reside in apartments and row houses, who are more vulnerable to unhealthy changes in movement behavior during the pandemic.This exploratory study has limitations that should be mentioned. The HEXA study was not originally designed to investigate the changes incurred and housing characteristics associated to PA and SB during the period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Environmental hazards in the homes were not considered (e.g. slippery surfaces, no handrail, low lighting and loose rugs). These factors are associated with an increase in the perception of the risk of falls and, therefore, could modify the interaction between movement behavior and housing type in older adults (Valipoor et al., 2020) . Although the housing types included in this study were similar to those used in other countries, such as Denmark (Saidj et al., 2015) , Australia (Pettigrew et al., 2020) , Sweden (Svensson et al., 2017), and Ireland (McKee et al., 2015) , we recognize that urban and sociocultural characteristics can make housing types incomparable among countries. This is an exploratory study that included participants who were originally screened for a clinical trial that was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The small subgroup of participants residing in an apartment may have underestimated the power of the results; however, it should be noted that there were no cases of outliers in this subgroup. Taken together, our preliminary results should be interpreted with caution and not generalized to all older adults and countries.Older adults with hypertension residing in an apartment or row house have greater unhealthy changes in movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings. It seems important consider specific home-based countermeasures for those who reside in housing types with limited area to move around in order to mitigate the unhealthy changes in movement behavior and its potential health-related consequences.This study was supported by the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq; 427729/2018-1).

As a diabetes care center specialized in technology, we developed a virtual training program for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were upgrading to hybrid closed loop (HCL) system. The aim of this study is to describe the efficacy and safety outcomes of the virtual training program.A prospective observational cohort study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of T1D previously treated with multiple doses of insulin (MDI) or sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP) who were updating to HCL system, from March to July 2020. Virtual training and follow-up were done through the Zoom video conferencing application and Medtronic Carelink System version 3.1 software. CGM data were analyzed to compare the time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability, during the first two weeks corresponding to manual mode with the final two weeks of follow-up in automatic mode.Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems use various combinations of control algorithms, glucose sensors, and insulin pumps. HCL system is the first system that automatically increases, decreases, and suspends insulin delivery in response to continuous glucose monitoring. HCL has demonstrated increased time in range and reductions in A1c, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia(1).Training, education, and support are the most important factors in achieving success with continuous subcutaneous insulin delivery in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), this training in our center has been traditionally delivered in person by either individual or group sessions, where the training program has been the basis of therapy success(2).The first case of COVID19 in Colombia was reported in March 2020, immediately after MiniMed TM 670G system was launched. At that time, the government established the response plan, including mandatory isolation at national level (3), restricting the displacement to health care centers of patients with diabetes. So, we had to modify our face-to-face education programs to a virtual modality using new tools for medical and educational purposes with all our patients, including the development of a virtual course for patients who were updating to HCL system.Although there is experience with telemedicine in diabetes programs, few data are available about the effect of shifting to virtual training on the HCL system in people with T1D, as it was necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of a virtual training program, such as time in range (TIR) between 70 -180 mg/dL, time above range (TAR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability using coefficient of variation (CV%) comparing manual and automatic mode.A prospective observational cohort study was conducted, including T1D patients who were upgrading to HCL system (Minimed 670G insulin pump, Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogotá, Colombia. Recruitment was performed between March and July 2020. T1D patients older than 14 years old who were being treated with multiples doses of insulin (MDI), Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP) Therapy with Low Glucose Suspend (LGS) (Paradigm VEO®, Medtronic MiniMed, Inc, Northridge, CA, USA) or Sensor Augmented Pump Therapy with Predictive low-glucose management (SAP-PLGM) (MiniMed 640G®, Medtronic MiniMed, Inc, Northridge, CA, USA) were selected for the study. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, alcohol consumption or refusal to sign the informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitario San Ignacio and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.In all patients, the training program was directed by the diabetes physician, with the support of education and nutrition teams. The number of virtual sessions depended on baseline therapy as it is shown in figure 1 . Patients with MDI and Paradigm VEO® as baseline therapy had two additional sessions, including carbohydrate counting, device overview and basic concepts about continuous glucose monitoring. All virtual sessions were performed through Zoom Enterprise Version of the Zoom video conferencing application (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, California). In all cases, prior to the initiation of therapy, the device was programed according Medtronic clinical recommendations (4) . Subjects treated with SAP-LGS or SAP-PGLM therapy and TIR above 70% continued with their baseline settings. The PLGM function was indicated to be turned on with a threshold of 60 mg/dl. For patients with history of severe hypoglycemia (SH) and hypoglycemia unawareness (HU), a threshold of 70 mg/dl was set. Active insulin function was set to three hours, except if the GFR was below 30 ml/min.The first two weeks the device remained in manual mode. Follow-up was performed within the first 24 and 72 hours and weekly thereafter. In every 30minute session patients were prompted to download continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to evaluate adherence, carbohydrate counting, proper timing of bolus delivery and sensor calibration. After that, adjustments were made to the insulin pump settings for at least seven sessions to improve the TIR. A maximum of 10 sessions were carried out in those patients who remained with TIR below 60% using manual mode. During this phase, a diabetes healthcare professional was available by phone 24 hours a day. The first infusion set change was supervised using zoom conferencing app, on the 3 rd day and the first sensor replacement on the 6 th day. After the first 2 weeks, patients were turned to auto mode if the TIR was over 60%. In every session the proper use and advantages of the auto mode feature was reinforced. SH was defined by the need for assistance from a third person for recovery and HU was detected using the Clarke questionnaire with a score ≥4. For continuous variables, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported, according with variables characteristics. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were reported. CGM data were analyzed to evaluate TIR, TBR, TAR, CV%, mean glucose and Glucose management indicator (GMI) during the first two weeks corresponding to manual mode and the final two weeks of follow-up in automatic mode. Comparison of both periods were done using a paired t-test. STATA version 15.0 was used for the analysis.Ninety-one patients were included in the analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . 51% were women and the median age was 33 years (IQR 17-71 years). The whole population reported hypoglycemia as an indication for insulin pump therapy, with SH in 24.6% and HU detected in 35%. Poor metabolic control was observed in 18% of the patients and 36% also presented high glycemic variability (CV%>34).At the beginning of our virtual training program, the mean A1c was 7.1% ± 1.95 and about half of the patients had been previously managed with multiple doses of insulin. The most common microvascular complication was diabetic retinopathy (18.5%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (14.8%) ( Table 1) .Mean TIR (70 -180 mg/dl) changed from 77.3% ± 11.3. in manual mode to 81,6% ± 7.6 at the end of follow up using auto mode (Mean difference p < 0.001) (Figure 2 ). Similar results were found for MDI and SAP-LGS groups ( Table 2) . Change in glycemic control of subjects previously treated with SAP-PLGM did not reach statistical significance (80.1% vs 82,5 %, p: 0.317) ( Table  2) .The prevalence of SH and HU before the use of HCL system are shown in Table 1 . The TBR <70 mg/dl and <54 mg/dl decreased rapidly with the use of auto mode feature (p=0.01) (figure 2). In subjects previously treated with SAP-PLGM the TBR <54mg/dl decreased from 1,22% ± 0,35 to 0,11% ± 0,33, (p=0,013) ( Table 2) . A significant reduction of CV% was found, (32.4 %±5.48 vs 29.72 %±5.9; p<0,001). This reduction was significant in all groups (Table 2) . No ketoacidosis or SH events were reported.All patients showed sensor use compliance greater than 90% during training and follow up. The auto mode feature was used 98.5% of time and it remained above 95% at the end of the training. The mean number of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SBMG) was 6.09±1.99. The mean time for changing the infusion set was every 3.58±0.91 days.The spread of COVID 19 has challenged health care systems from all the world (5) . Given the current contingency, studies consider that the use of teleconsultation has increased by 80% during 2020 (6) . Therefore, it was necessary to design and evaluate an educational program through virtual platforms for patients planning to start HCL therapy that complies with government regulations (7) and allows frequent follow-up. Our data suggest that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a program with these characteristics significantly increases TIR and reduces TBR and glycemic variability, outcomes that are similar to those reported with face-to-face training.Previous clinical studies showed a significant reduction of A1c, %CV and TBR with an increase of TIR from 66.7% to 72.2% after the implementation of HCL system. This improvement was associated with the use of auto mode feature ≥80% of the time (8). Akturk described similar results with the transition from SAP therapy to HCL with face-to-face follow up, demonstrating the increase of 18% in TIR from a baseline of 59.1% ± 15.2% at third month, change that was maintained at 6 months (9). However, there is little data about the effectiveness of HCL system after the implementation of an educational program using virtual platforms, as was necessary in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vikersky reported Glycemic outcomes data from CareLink™ Personal database from patients who were new to using the MiniMed™ 670 G system during the pre-COVID-19 and the intra-COVID-19 eras. He did not reported the number of patients evaluated, nor the basal TIR in previous therapy, however he found that the TIR was similar in both periods (70.4 vs 68.4%), suggesting than virtual training of individuals results comparable with in-person training (6) . Our data are consistent with this conclusion, suggesting than the outcomes are at least similar to those reported for face-to-face training. Further studies are needed to assess whether the results can be even better with virtual training related to patients not having to come to an office for training that may entail time away from their work or home obligations. In fact, Vikersky found a higher level of satisfaction for patients trained by virtual platforms.An interesting finding was our high baseline TIR in manual mode. Previously, we presented a multicenter prospective cohort study in Latin America (Chile and Colombia) with subjects with T1D treated with SAP-PLGM. We found TIR greater than 70%, similar to the TIR achieved using manual mode in this study (10) . We consider that these good values are associated to an intensive training program. In 2013 our group published the predictors of good metabolic control in SAP-LGS and SAP-PLGM users(2), showing that face-to-face training focused on adherence to the use of the sensor and bolus wizard allowed the achievement of adequate metabolic control with reduction of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability during long-term follow-up.Despite the fact that the TIR achieved in manual mode was higher than 70% in our study, it was notable that significant increase in TIR was observed after two weeks of using the device in automatic mode (9) . This increase was independent of previous treatment, but greater in patients treated with MDI, which was the group with lower TIR at baseline. Similar findings have been described in clinical studies, real-life trials and meta-analyzes evaluating the outpatient use of HCL in face-to-face follow-up with an increase in TIR (70-180 mg/dl) by approximately 10% compared to control therapy. The increased TIR is caused by less time in hyperglycemia (TAR) especially at night time with no significant changes in TBR (8, 11) .As a relevant finding, despite the fact that the population had a relatively low basal glycemic variability, a significant decrease in %CV was achieved, associated with the significant reduction in TBR in this study. Similar to previous reported cases using this modality, in this study there were no SH or hyperglycemia (12) .Regarding adherence in our study the use of the automatic mode was greater than 95%, compared to real-life data with face-to-face follow-up, in which the use of this function was 87% (13) . In order to highlight the advantages of the use of telemedicine, we can say it allows frequent follow-up by a multidisciplinary group, technical support 24 hours a day, the availability of assistance to upload data and access to health personnel through technology, which can improve adherence to the use of the sensor and spending more time in auto mode.To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective non-sponsored study including adults trained through a virtual platform. One strength is the application of a personalized education plan for patients with different baseline therapy, allowing the generalization of results. Additionally, this is the first prospective study to show the experience in a developing country, demonstrating that the program can be easily adopted in different centers.Among the limitations, this is an observational study without a control group under face-to-face training, for this reason we cannot compare directly virtual vs. face-to-face modalities. However, our data represent the usual care under COVID-19 pandemic and open the doors for virtual training as a permanent standard of care. Furthermore, a short follow-up period was assessed which may not represent long-term results. Future studies are needed to overcome these limitations.The use of HCL systems allows T1D patients to increase TIR and reduce glycemic variability and TBR <70 and <54 mg/dL. Implementing a virtual education program is a challenge. However, virtual training and follow-up with the use of the Carelink platform allows physicians to provide education and is an appropriate option during situations that limit the access of patients to followup centers.","Colombia","first author","2021-01-05",1

Young children, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases, and the immunosuppressed are at greatest risk, and in general, ARIs have direct and indirect costs for families, health services, and the global community [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Not only do viruses responsible for ARI have a major impact on human health, but they also continue to emerge, and as a consequence, their diagnosis and surveillance constitutes a milestone for the public health system.Diagnostic methods based on molecular biology have allowed the identification of a number of human viruses, including human metapneumoviruses (HMPVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human enteroviruses (HEVs), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and human bocaviruses (HBoVs) [10, 11] . In recent decades, epidemics related to emergent coronaviruses have occurred: Severe acute respiratory syndrome due to SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by MERS-CoV (2012, cases continue till present), and the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, which reached pandemic level on March 11, 2020 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Recombination events are responsible for the emergence of these new strains [12, 14] , which are zoonotic, gain the ability to be transmitted from person to person, and are associated with a high mortality rate. As a result, studies on coronaviruses have intensified recently, although these viruses have been known since the 1930s, and human coronaviruses responsible for a major proportion of respiratory tract infections globally were identified already in 1965 [17] .Coronaviruses are ssRNA+ viruses. Transmission occurs via the respiratory and fecal-oral routes [18, 19] . HCoVs are distributed worldwide, but the frequency and associated pathogenicity are unclear and are highly dependent on the case series studied, since the rate of detection can vary depending on the type of respiratory sample collected, the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay, and the years and seasons when patients were recruited [20] . The most common serotypes are HCoV-OC43 and HcoV-229E. It has been reported that they both show a marked seasonality, with infections more common during the winter (December through April in the Northern Hemisphere); however, HCoV-229E is sometimes only sporadically detected, and its circulation is Handling Editor: John Ziebuhr. significantly different each year [19, 21] . Both cause mildto-severe respiratory infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis [22, 23] , and they are the second-most frequently detected agent causing the common cold, after HRV [5, 7] . HCOVs have also been associated with asthma and bronchitic hyperactivity, even in non-atopic patients [24] . HCoV-OC43 is more frequently detected and is often found to be the only pathogen in patients with lower ARI, while HCoV-229E has been associated with infections of immunocompromised individuals [19] . HCoV infections have been studied in infants of Buenos Aires, where they were detected in 2% of patients, always in coinfection with another viral agent [10] . On the other hand, a study in Australia shows that these two coronaviruses (mainly HCoV-OC43) were the most common causes of influenza-like illness in children [25] . Yet, data on HCoV infection, its diagnosis, its clinical significance, and particularly, its circulation and seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere are scarce, with most of the data pertaining to countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Data from Argentina, which is located in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, are therefore of interest.Coronaviruses have not been studied in Córdoba, and its detection has not been included in the routine diagnostic panel for ARI, even though it would contribute to differential diagnosis, handling and treatment of patients, and surveillance. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the presence of endemic HCoV, using molecular techniques, in hospitalized children and adult patients with symptoms of ARI in Córdoba, Argentina. Córdoba is a Mediterranean province located in the center of Argentina (latitude: 31° 24′ 48″ S, elevation: 395 m). We investigated the circulation and frequency of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E (including seasonality, age distribution, and coinfections with other common respiratory agents) during two consecutive calendar years and identified clinical manifestations associated with infection.An observational, retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out. We analyzed nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples, obtained from patients 0 to 65 years old, hospitalized for ARI in public and private health centers in Córdoba in 2011 and 2012. The clinical specimens were handled and assayed following normal biosafety procedures and Argentina Ministry of Health recommendations implemented since the influenza A H1N1 virus pandemic in 2009. Patients were examined by a physician to identify lower respiratory infection (laryngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Patients with chronic lung disease or previous comorbidity were excluded from the study. In total, 631 patients were studied; 375 cases occurred during 2011 and 256 occurred during 2012.Nucleic acids were extracted using a commercial kit according to the indications of the manufacturer (Axygen Scientific, Inc.). RNA extracts were used as template in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for virus detection, using the a SuperScript III One-Step qRT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), following a cycling protocol described elsewhere [26] . Specific primers targeting the M protein coding region were used for HCoV-OC43 and HcoV-229E, producing amplicons of 334 bp and 574 bp, respectively [26] . Frequency distribution was analyzed using the statistical program Infostat 2019 (https ://www.infos tat.com.ar/) including tests for significance of differences observed based on chi-square (α: 0.05).HCoV was detected in 19 out of 631 patients, indicating a prevalence of 3.0%. The virus types and yearly distribution are shown in Table 1 .HCoV-229E was detected in the autumn (April and May), earlier than HCoV-OC43, which was prevalent through the fall and winter period (March-August; Fig. 1 ), but there was no statistically significant difference between the frequency in 2011 and that in 2012 (p = 0.82) or between species (HCoV-OC43, p = 0.79; HCoV-229E, p = 0.99).HCoV-OC43 was found only in children, 13 of which were 0-5 years old and one of which was in the group of 6-to 14-year-olds, while HCoV-229E was detected at the extremes of the age range analyzed, with three patients in the 0-to 5-year-old group and two in the oldest group (39-65 years).An analysis of co-circulation of HCoV with other respiratory viruses revealed evidence for both single infections and multiple infections. Co-detections occurred with RSV, HMPV, influenza A virus (Flu A) and influenza B virus (Flu B) ( Table 2) .We then analyzed the association of HCoV infection with clinical manifestations such as recurrent obstructive bronchopathy (ROB), cyanosis, BQL, ARI, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), whooping cough or pertussis-like syndrome (PLS), pneumonia, asthma and bronchitis. No association was found when the two HCoVs were analyzed together in the year 2012 or both years combined, but HCoV-229E was significantly associated with asthma during 2011 (p = 0.0361).This study confirms the circulation of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in Córdoba during the years 2011-2012. The general prevalence was 3%. The frequency of HCoV-OC43 was 2.4% in 2011 and 2.0% in 2012; HCoV-229E was detected less frequently; 0.8% in both 2011 and 2012. This detection rate in a wide-age-range group of patients including adults is similar to that reported in infants in Buenos Aires (2%) and France (3%) [10, 26] . The positive cases occurred during March-August, with no statistically significant difference in circulation during 2011 and 2012. However, the HCoV infection frequency can vary depending on geographical location [22] . Statistical differences were detected in HCoV-OC43 circulation during 2009-2010 and 2011, but HCoV-229E circulation was similar when evaluated on a biennial basis [21] . Thus, in order to obtain reliable estimates to provide quality epidemiological information, it is necessary to maximize the study sample size and time period [27] .Most of the HCoV-OC43-and HCoV-229E-positive patients were children (0 to 14 years old), coinciding with reports showing that these viruses mainly infect children less than 5 years old [28] . However HCoV-229E was also detected in adults by us and by other authors [29] . The estimated infection rate depends on the inclusion criteria for sampling: when studies are performed with hospitalized patients only, there may be an underestimate of the infection rate, while the severity of disease is overestimated. The detection HCoV at a higher rate in young children may be related to the fact that children are taken by their parents to be examined and are admitted to the hospital even when symptoms are mild, while adults themselves consult less, and therefore epidemiological data and the clinical picture of infection are limited for adults [21, 22] .HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were found in single infections and coinfections, including double and triple infections. Coinfections with RSV are generally the most frequent [19, 30] , as was seen in the present study, but importantly for the local context, about 50% of the cases were single infections.To analyze the role of HCoV in respiratory pathology, we tested the statistical significance of HCoV-Oc43 and HCoV-229E association with respiratory diseases. We found a significant association only between HCoV-229E and asthma exacerbation in children, in agreement with other authors [31] .Regarding the clinical and epidemiological relevance of endemic coronaviruses, in a previously reported outbreak of human respiratory infection associated with HCoV-NL63, three out of 20 geriatric patients died [32] , making epidemiological surveillance necessary in order to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The rapid and specific methods for diagnosis of ARI that are currently available have an impact on patient management and allow prevention measures to be implemented to control the spread of the agent, including intra-hospital, intrafamily and community dissemination, as well as providing information about viral strains circulating in the community [33] . This demonstrates the cost/benefit balance of performing diagnosis and incorporating these agents in the routine panel. Rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients can result in a reduction of up to 50% in the length of the hospital stay, up to 30% in the use of ineffective, high-cost and inappropriate antibiotics, which increases bacterial resistance, and 20% in the use of other unnecessary diagnostic procedures [34, 35] . Thus, our results can contribute to better management of ARI. This is the first study of respiratory infections caused by HCoVs in Córdoba, Argentina. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E circulated in Córdoba during 2011-2012 and were detected in 3% of clinical cases during the cold months (March through August) as single or multiple infections. Infections occurred mainly in children less than 5 years old, but HCoV-229E was also detected in adults and was significantly associated with asthma. Therefore, further studies and surveillance are required to provide early diagnosis and better medical care of patients, as well as quality data that contribute to epidemiology modeling and prevention.

(Bambra et al., 2020) Knowing the characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the need for resources and their clinical outcomes is of utmost importance to support clinical decision making and public health management. We therefore performed a multicenter study aimed to characterise clinical, laboratory and imaging features, as well as outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Brazilian hospitals. Additionally, we explored risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality.The Brazilian COVID- 19 For the purpose of the present study, patients who had completed hospitalization and were in the database by September 19, 2020 were included. Patients who were transferred to another hospital within the first three days after being admitted were only counted if data from the hospital they wound up at was available, otherwise they were excluded ( Figure 1 ). Sample size was not calculated, as all patients who met the inclusion criteria were included.Medical records were reviewed to collect data on patients' characteristics, including age, sex and occupation (whether the patient was a healthcare professional); pre-existing comorbid medical conditions and home medications; COVID-19 associated symptoms at hospital presentation; clinical assessment at admission, third and fifth admission days; laboratory, imaging, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data; inpatient medications, treatment and outcomes. The data collection instrument was designed considering COVID-19 guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Brazilian Ministry of Health.Definitions can be assessed in Supplementary Material 1. Descriptive analyses were used to summarize all variables, stratified by in-hospital survival status. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed to check for the normal distribution of continuous variables. As all variables had non-normal distribution, they were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Categorical variables were summarized with counts and percentages. The study population was divided into ten age groups Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.In-hospital mortality was 22.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 20.2-23.9%), and the median time between admission and death was 12 days (IQR: 6-18). Figure 2 shows admissions and mortality over time. The apparent higher mortality in September is due to the reduced number of cases who were hospitalized and in the database at that time.In-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay for those who died or were discharged alive by 10-year age intervals and sex are presented in Supplementary Table 2 . Overall, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality between men and women (22.9% vs. 21.1%, p=0.322), but it was higher for men compared with women at every 10-year age interval up to 69 years old.For the 84 healthcare workers included, mortality was 9.5%. The median age was 46 [IQR 37-55] years old, the median number of comorbidities was 1 (IQR 0-2) and the median time from symptom onset to presentation 7 (IQR 5-10) days. When adjusted for age and sex, being a healthcare worker was not significant associated with reduced mortality risk (RR=0.60; 95%CI 0.30-1.10).Overall, 79.8% patients had at least one comorbidity. Mortality among those with at least one comorbidity was higher compared with those with none (25.5% vs 8.6%, p<0.001), J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and the median number of comorbidities was higher among those who died when compared to those discharged alive ( Cough (65.1%), dyspnea (61.6%) and fever (59.0%) were the most common symptoms at hospital presentation. Dyspnea and neurological impairment at hospital admission were more common among patients who died (Table 2) .Seventy-three (3.6%) patients who were admitted for other reasons later developed COVID-19 during their stay. Excluding these patients, the median time from symptom onset to presentation was 6 (IQR 3-9) days. The median duration of symptoms prior to the hospitalization was shorter for patients who died compared to those who survived (5 [IQR [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] vs. 7 [IQR 4-10], respectively; p<0.001).Laboratory and imaging findings are presented in Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3 .Patients who died from COVID-19 infection had higher mean white blood cell counts, higher absolute neutrophil counts, lower lymphocyte counts, higher creatinine and increased inflammatory response with significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.Chest X-rays were done in 1219 patients (59.3%) at admission and it was abnormal in 98.7% the most common pattern being a reticular interstitial thickening in 53.0% and ground Public or mixed hospitals had higher mortality rates compared with private ones (24.7% vs. 26.2% vs. 10.8%, p<0.001), and they were associated with higher mortality risk at univariate analysis. Those differences could be explained by the coexistence of other variables (age, comorbidities; delayed access to healthcare, different criteria for hospitalization). In fact, the average number of comorbidities was lower in patients from private hospitals (1 [IQR 0-2]) than the ones from public and mixed hospitals (2 [IQR 1-3] for both, p<0.001). Once eliminating the collinearity effect of those variables, no effect over prognosis was observed among the types of hospital. This factor is especially relevant in the Brazilian Healthcare System. Users of public or mixed hospitals could have different socio-economical profiles. A recent study conducted using data from the Brazilian Surveillance System also showed increased mortality in regions with a lower development index level, as well as among black populations, representing a regional and ethnicity effect, respectively. (Baqui et al., 2020) Additionally, low income has been associated with higher incidence of comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity. (Singu et al., 2020) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f What could have been a pre-condition of poor prognosis might have been compensated by excellent care in the public health system.Although Brazil is a country with one of the highest COVID-19-related death tolls for healthcare workers, the large number refers more to the high absolute number of cases than to a high mortality itself. (Domínguez-Varela, 2020) Mortality among healthcare workers was lower than the overall patients in our study, which may be associated to younger age, lower prevalence of comorbidities and awareness to identify early signs of deterioration.The analysis of secondary outcomes confirms the growing body of evidence of the multi-systemic nature of COVID-19, affecting not only the respiratory system, but also the kidneys, cardiovascular and nervous systems. Acute kidney injury was seen in almost a third of patients, and in over 68% of those who died. This is a higher proportion than in previous Additionally, as it is based in a mandatory registration system, at patient admission to emergency departments the complete fulfillment of the notification form might be compromised due to the high demand (several incoming patients hourly), insufficient staffing with medical personnel and also the presence of severe cases, which requires more attention.Additionally, the data entry with free-text fields from multiple locations and professionals causes an inherent contrast on the use of medical terms and description, which also results in a heterogeneity of fulfilment. Therefore, the most complete and accurate medical history (including information about underlying diseases and a more detailed description of symptoms) is sometimes not possible to be achieved. (Nascimento et al., 2020) One of the main strengths of the study was the fact that it is a real-life database, which included comprehensive data of a large sample size of patients from 25 hospitals in different Brazilian regions, able to ensure diversity of the population studied. Data were obtained by detailed medical record review, with higher degree of detail than electronic abstraction of structured data elements. Data was submitted to periodic auditing to ensure data quality and the analysis provided a thorough assessment of various outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19patients.

Unfortunately, in Peru, there is no information on the prevalence of psychological responses to fear of COVID-19, nor how they are distributed in the older population. Added to this is the absence of an appropriate psychometric instrument that allows a valid and reliable measurement of fear of In response to this need, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S; Ahorsu et al. 2020 ) was recently developed with the aim of assessing fear of COVID-19. The FCV-19S is a short, easy to apply, seven-item instrument. In the initial study, using classical theory of tests and the Rasch model, it was reported that the seven items grouped into a single factor had acceptable corrected item-total correlations and significant factor loadings (from .66 to .74). Furthermore, the reliability as internal consistency (α = .82) and test-retest (ICC = .72) were adequate, while the concurrent validity assessment showed significant relationships with hospital depression and perceived vulnerability to illness.The FCV-19S has been translated into various cultural contexts such as Bangladesh (Sakib et al. 2020) , Turkey (Haktanir et al. 2020) , Italy (Soraci et al. 2020) , Eastern Europe (Reznik et al. 2020) , Saudi Arabia (Alyami et al. 2020) , Israel (Bitan et al. 2020) , New Zealand (Winter et al. 2020) , Japan (Masuyama et al. 2020) , Cuba (Broche-Pérez et al. 2020) , Peru , and Greece (Tsipropoulou et al. 2020 ). All these studies have shown evidence of reliability based on different coefficients such as Cronbach's alpha, Omega, Guttmann's lambda, or composite reliability. Regarding factor structure, most of the studies supported the presence of a single dimension. However, Bitan et al. (2020) and Reznik et al. (2020) reported the presence of two factors: the first related to physiological responses to COVID-19 (items 3, 6, and 7) and the second one that represents the emotional responses to COVID-19 (items 1, 2, 4, and 5). However, the two-factor model may have limitations to capture multidimensionality of fear of COVID-19, because the variance of every item may be associated to both a global factor and simultaneously to a specific factor (Reise 2012) .In this sense, the studies of Huarcaya-Victoria et al. (2020) and Masuyama et al. (2020) tested an alternative model to those reported previously: a bifactor model (see Reise et al. 2010for a review) . In this model, each item loads in both a general (overall) factor as well as in a specific factor, and all factors are specified as orthogonal. That way the proportion of variance due to the general as well as specific factors may be estimated (Raykov and Pohl 2013) . Regarding the FCV-19S, the bifactor model would translate into a general factor of fear of COVID-19, which explains most of the variance in line with Ahorsu et al. (2020) , and two orthogonal specific factors (physiological and emotional fear responses) as indicated in other validation studies (Bitan et al. 2020; Reznik et al. 2020 ). The bifactor model assesses the effects of multidimensionality of the FCV-19S in the total score as well as every subscale (Reise 2012) . If the specific factors explain very little variance, the recommendation is to calculate a global score instead of scores for each subscale (or specific factor). On the other hand, more percentage of variance related to each specific factor would suggest the use of each subscale for further analyses (Rodriguez et al. 2016a, b) .Although there is a validated Spanish version for Peruvian general population , the study only included the participation of 71 people over 60 years of age. In this sense, there is no psychometric evidence that supports the use of the FCV-19S in older adults in Peru or any other Latin American country. Also, given that Peru is one of the countries with the highest number of infections in the world, it is necessary to carry out an epidemiological study on the relationship between the mental health of older adults and fear of COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FCV-19S for use in older adults. Specifically, the evidence of validity based on internal structure, in relation to other variables and reliability, was evaluated.Design, Sample, and ProcedureThe study was instrumental (Ato et al., 2013) . The participants were older adults from the city of Lima. The sample size was determined with Soper's (2020) software that considers the number of observed and latent variables in the model, the size of the anticipated effect (λ = 0.3), the desired statistical significance (α = 0.05), and the level of statistical power (1 − β = 0.95). Inclusion criteria for participation were (1) being 60 years or older and (2) not have intellectual difficulties that prevent understanding the instructions and the content of the survey. Snowball sampling was used (Atkinson and Flint 2004) . Upon identifying an individual who met the established inclusion criteria, he/she was asked to suggest others who might be interested to participate in the study. Their telephone number was used to contact them. Once it was identified that the individual met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate, his/her email address or, failing that, the email address of a close relative was requested to send the online survey. This type of survey has been used in other studies with old people during the pandemic of COVID-19 (Carriedo et al. 2020) . Online snowball sampling has been shown to be adequate to contact participants from different places and reaching higher response rates than other sampling strategies (Baltar and Brunet 2012) .The final sample was composed of 400 older adults with range age from 60 to 86 years (mean = 68.04, SD = 6.41). 68.3% were women. Regarding marital status, 36.5% were married, 32.8% lived with a partner, 21.2% were widows or widowers, 4.9% were divorced, and 4.6% single. 82.8% of the sample were retired, 12.8% unemployed, and 4.4% were doing some kind of job or business. Most of the samples were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (98%), but many had family (82.3%) or friends (61.3%) diagnosed with the disease. Finally, in the last 2 weeks prior to the study, more than half of the sample (50.8%) reported having read or heard information about the coronavirus for around 1 to 3 h.No pilot study was made, given that a prior research applied the Spanish version of the FCV-19S to a small group of Peruvian older adults (Huarcaya-Victoria et al. 2020), without reporting inconveniences in the use of the instrument.The study was conducted during May 29 and June 25, 2020. An online survey was distributed to participants. Participants gave their informed consent online and answered the anonymous survey in approximately 15 min via Google Form. In this way, it was sought to guarantee a greater scope and ease of access. In order to submit their responses, participants had to answer all the questions on the survey. No compensation was given for participation in the study. The instruments were randomized in blocks to avoid order effects. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Privada del Norte, to which the corresponding author is affiliated (Registration number: 20203001); likewise, the procedures used adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Sociodemographic indicators were developed ad hoc for the study. It gathers information on age, sex, marital status, diagnosis of COVID in the participant, family or friends, and hours thinking, sawing, or listening to information on COVID-19 (1 to 3 h, 3 to 5 h, 5 to 7 h, and more than 7 h).Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S, Ahorsu et al. 2020 ) This seven-item scale evaluates fear of COVID-19 with a five-point Likert-type response scale from 1 (= strongly disagree) to 5 (= strongly agree). The total score is obtained from the sum of the scores for each item and ranges from a minimum of 7 to a maximum of 35. This version presented adequate psychometric properties. The items are (1) feeling discouraged, depressed, or hopeless and (2) little interest or pleasure in doing things. The two items have four response options from 0 (= not at all) to 3 (= almost every day). Total scores range from 0 to 6, and a score ≥ 3 indicates a greater severity of depressive symptoms.Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 Item (GAD-2; Kroenke et al. 2007 ) It is a self-report measure with two items that are basic criteria for diagnosing the presence and severity of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. The Spanish version by Caycho-Rodríguez et al. (2020e) was employed. This version has shown good psychometric properties. Specifically, the GAD-2 asks how often respondents have been bothered by anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks. The items are (1) feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge and (2) not being able to stop worrying or not being able to control the worry. Each item has four response options from 0 (= not at all) to 3 (= almost every day). The sum of the scores of both items allows obtaining a total score that varies between 0 and 6, where a value ≥ 3 indicates the presence of a clinically relevant anxiety disorder.Several structural equation models, specifically confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), bifactor CFA, and structural models with latent variables, have been estimated. Robust estimation, specifically WLSMV (weighted least Squares mean and variance corrected), was used for all the models to overcome the non-normality and ordinal nature of the items (Hancock and Mueller 2013) . Fit of the models was assessed by means of several indices and statistics from different families (Tanaka 1993) : (a) chi-square; (b) comparative fit index (CFI); (c) the standardized root mean residual (SRMR); and (d) root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) with its 90% confidence interval. Criteria for acceptable model fit were CFI above .90 (better fit above .95) and RMSEA and SRMR below .08 (Marsh et al. 2004) . Internal consistency was estimated with composite reliability indexes (CRI) and relative omega estimate of reliability (Dueber 2017) to overcome the limitations of Cronbach's alpha (Hancock and An 2018) . Validity of scales was assessed with a structural model relating the factors in the scale with relevant variables. All models were estimated with Mplus 8.3 (Muthén and Muthén 1998-2017) .Previous studies on the factor structure of the FCV-19S have tested three different structures: a one factor model, two correlated substantive factors, and a bifactor structure in which an overall general factor is declared to underlie to all seven items, while two (uncorrelated) specific factors simultaneously underlie the scale items. With these models in mind, but adding two other theoretical models, we have tested five alternative or competitive models:& Model 1. One single factor underlying the seven items of the scale. Most evidence in different countries has found evidence for a single dimension (see introduction for references). & Model 2. Two correlated factors: emotional response to COVID-19 (factor 1); items 1, 2, 4, and 5; and physiological response to COVID-19 (factor 2), items 3, 6, and 7. This model is based in Bitan et al. (2020) and Reznik et al. (2020) . Models 4 and 5 allow to discern if some of the specific factor is not needed in order to achieve a good model fit. Therefore, models 4 and 5 are alternative models to compare with model 3.All these models can be seen graphically in Fig. 1 . These models are estimated and tested, and their goodness-of-fit indices are presented in Table 1 . In this table, it can be seen that model fit of all models is good according to the CFI and SRMR, with values well above .95 and SRMR well below .08. RMSEA values are not so good, but this is usual when models with not many degrees of freedom are considered (Breivik and Olsson 2001; Kenny et al. 2014 ). When models are compared, the best fitting model in absolute terms is the bifactor model (model 3).However, these models are very different in terms of parsimony, and additionally, some are nested. Therefore, statistical tests between nested models may be applied to test if the difference in model fit can still be considered random, and therefore, the more parsimonious model is preferred over the more complex one. In this vein also, Table 1 shows the chi-square differences between models 2 and 3 against model 1 (one single factor) and also between models 4 and 5 against model 3 (bifactor). The chi-square comparisons of model 2 and model 3 against model 1 (one factor) made clear that only one factor is not the best solution for the factor structure of the scale. Then, the two bifactor models with only one specific factor (models 4 and 5) were statistically compared to model 3, in order to understand if the two specific factors are needed for a best fit to the data. Whenever model 5 was clearly worse than model 3, this was not the case with model 4 when compared to model 3: the difference was statistically significant in favor of model 3 but only at the p < .05 level and not at the more astringent p < .01. Fit indices of model 4 also pointed out that model fit of this (more parsimonious model) was excellent. All in all, and regarding the overall fit, the model that could be retained is model 4.A careful look at the standardized loadings in all models may be necessary in order to make a better decision about the model to retain. These loadings are presented in Table 2 . In general, it can be seen across models that all items load quite high in the general factor. When specific factors are introduced (models 3 to 5), the loadings for these specific factors are, in general, relatively low, with the exception of model 4, in which the loadings of three items (1, 2, and 4) are of a considerable amount. In sum, the standardized loadings also point out at model 4 as the best representation of the observed data (bifactor model with only specific factor 1 that expresses the emotional response to COVID-19).Composite reliability indexes, as measures of internal consistency, were calculated for all factors in all models. CRI for model 1 was .899. CRIs for model 2 were .838 for the first factor and .837 for the second one. Regarding the bifactor with one general factor and two specific factors (model 3), the CRIs were, respectively, .882, .300, and .292. When only the specific factor 1 was estimated (model 4), the CRI for the general factor was .878, whereas the CRI for the specific factor was .411. Finally, CRIs for the general and specific factor (two) in model 5 were .889 and .346, respectively. The chi-square difference tests are comparing with one factor, except models 4 and 5 that compare to model 3In addition, relative omegas were calculated for the best fitting model (model 4) in order to know the amount of reliable variance attributable to the general and specific factors in this model. The relative omega for the general factor was .913, while for the specific factor was .261.A structural equation model has been estimated, in which several antecedents or background variables, as well as consequents of fear of COVID-19 are considered. The final outcome of this model is mental health at the latent level (see Fig. 2 ). This outcome was measured with three indicators, a measure of mental health, and indicators of anxiety and depression. Previous to include the three indicators of mental health (scales of mental health, anxiety, and depression), a CFA at the item level was estimated in order to be sure that the items belong to the proposed factors and also in order to estimate reliabilities of the three scales. The CFA model adequately fitted the data: χ 2 (24) = 275.69, p < .001, RMSEA = .162 CI90%[.145-.179], CFI = .940, SRMR = .050. Moreover, the CRIs calculated for the three dimensions of mental health were adequate, being .801 for mental health, .876 for anxiety, and .895 for depression.The model and its standardized estimates are presented in Fig. 2 . The antecedent variables were age, gender, having or not a relative diagnosed with COVID, having or not a close friend diagnosed with COVID, and the amount of information received on COVID. This model had a Fig. 2 ) pointed out the large effect fear of COVID had on mental health (R 2 = .346). Regarding the background variables, women had more fear of COVID than men; age was only positively related with the specific factor 1; neither having a diagnose of COVID in a relative nor a friend had effects on fear of COVID; and the amount of information on the virus positively affected the fear of COVID. Overall, the background variables explained 11.1% of the variance in the general factor and 14.6% of the specific factor.The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FCV-19S for use in older adults in Peru. In general, the findings provide further support to the evidence of validity and reliability of the FCV-19S, demonstrating that the Spanish version has robust psychometric properties for its use in older adults. Several studies on the factor structure of the FCV-19S have supported a one-dimensional model (for example, Ahorsu et al. 2020; Alyami et al. 2020; Haktanir et al. 2020; Sakib et al. 2020; Satici et al. 2020; Soraci et al. 2020; Tsipropoulou et al. 2020; Winter et al. 2020) . However, the confirmatory analyses of the scale in Perú (Huarcaya-Victoria et al. 2020) gave support to the presence of a bifactor model, made up of one general factor and two specific ones, emotional and physiological response. That is, the previous validation in the general population of the scale in Peru supports that each item of the scale has two sources of variation, a general factor of fear of the virus plus a specific fear response that it is either emotional or physiological. Current results are somewhere in between. We found that a single dimension was not the best representation of the data, and indeed a bifactor structure was needed to get a better fit. However, the bifactorial structure that, in our opinion, best represents the responses of older adults only included the emotional response as a specific factor, while the other factor, which included the physiological response, was mainly due to the specific variance made by a single indicator (item 6). In any case, the reliability estimates clearly indicated that most of the explained variance was due to the single dimension of fear of COVID-19, and therefore, the scale can be used as unidimensional. This result may well explain the somehow non-coincident structures found in the literature. On the other hand, the study supports the idea of considering fear of COVID-19 as a multidimensional construct, which allows researchers and mental health professionals to differentiate between fear of COVID-19 and its associated symptoms (Bitan et al. 2020) . Therefore, it allows obtaining a total scale score as well as an independent score for the emotional symptoms.Likewise, the results indicated that the Spanish version of the FCV-19S had adequate reliability in terms of internal consistency, which is a finding consistent with previous studies carried out with samples of different characteristics (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Alyami et al. 2020; Bitan et al. 2020; Haktanir et al. 2020; Reznik et al. 2020; Sakib et al. 2020; Satici et al. 2020; Soraci et al. 2020; Tsipropoulou et al. 2020; Winter et al. 2020) , including the Peruvian . This would indicate that, despite the different versions, the measurements obtained with the FCV-19S are consistent and very stable.Regarding the structural equation model estimated, we think it gives relevant information on concurrent validity of the scale. The relationships between different antecedent variables and the consequences of fear of COVID-19 suggest that the Spanish version of the FCV-19S has adequate evidence of validity in relation to other variables. Fear generates psychological reactions that allow the individual to face threatening situations (Sakib et al. 2020) . In this sense, fear of COVID-19 has a great effect on the indicators of mental health considered. The findings suggest that higher levels of fear of COVID-19 generate higher levels of anxiety and depression and, in general, poor mental health. These results are similar to those reported in other studies carried out on different samples (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Alyami et al. 2020; Huarcaya-Victoria et al. 2020; Shigemura et al., 2020) .Results on antecedent variables also offer interesting information. Being a woman significantly predicts higher levels of fear of COVID-19. This difference is in line with previous research that indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic generates a greater negative psychological impact on women compared to men (Broche-Pérez et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020 ). This could be related to the fact that women tend to show more reactivity in fear-related neural networks (Liu et al. 2020 ). On the other hand, having a family member or friend diagnosed with COVID-19 had no effect on fear of COVID-19. This is not in agreement with other studies, where it is suggested that people experienced greater fear when contacting people infected with COVID-19 (Lin 2020; Thombs et al. 2020) . Finally, the greater the amount of information received about COVID-19, the greater the fear of the disease. This suggests that a longer time of exposure to news about the increase in diagnosed cases and deaths during the pandemic leads older adults to increment their fear as well as other symptoms such as anxiety and depression (Lin 2020) .This study has limitations. First, it is based on self-report measures which can generate the presence of biases for social convenience and/or memory effects. In this sense, it is recommended that future studies use other methodologies, such as in-depth qualitative interviews or case studies. Second, we used snowball sampling which makes very unlikely the sample being representative of the Peruvian older adult population. This sampling procedure has overrepresented older women compared to older men, and therefore, potential bias due to gender may be present. Nevertheless, alpha for men and women were calculated and statistically compared for potential differences. Alpha for men was .826 and for women .848, and the difference was not statistically significant: χ 2 (1) = 0.598, p = .439 (Diedenhofen and Musch 2016) . Therefore, future studies should use nationally representative samples. Likewise, since the older adults were not institutionalized, it would also be useful to replicate the study in this population. Third, the study used a cross-sectional design, so the reported relationships between the variables do not provide causal information. Because the development of the pandemic generates changes in social rules and behavior, future research should use longitudinal designs to assess causal relationships between antecedents, outcomes, and fear of COVID-19. A better understanding on the relationships over time between fear of COVID, changing rates of infection and death, and the social responses to the pandemic would give rise to an important line of research (Perz et al. 2020) . Fourth, the fact that most of the participants were women could affect the generalizability of the findings. Finally, the stability of the FCV-19S over time was not examined. Therefore, future studies should incorporate test-retest reliability measures.Despite the limitations, the study has various strengths. First, having an instrument to assess fear related to COVID-19 could be important as an outcome measure or a possible explanatory factor in investigations conducted with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, to have a measure to identify the levels of this fear among different groups of older adults (institutionalized or non-institutionalized, from different regions of the country, etc.) and their relationships with various sociodemographic variables (such as gender, time exposed to information on the COVID-19, diagnosis of COVID-19 in family and friends, etc.) would allow decision makers and various mental health professionals to locate risk groups during the Covid-19 pandemic. Not having an adequate understanding of the fear generated by COVID-19 in vulnerable groups, such as older adults, makes difficult to identify the most useful prevention and intervention programs .In conclusion, the results showed that the Spanish version of the FCV-19S has adequate psychometric properties and can be used to assess fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic in Peruvian older adults. Nevertheless, it is necessary to carry out more research, in different regions of Peru and Latin American countries, to better understand the usefulness of the FCV-19S in the implementation of interventions and policies aimed at improving the mental health of older adults.Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no competing interest.","Peru","abstract","2021-01-06",1

The COVID-19 disease caused by this virus can result several health complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [3] .The high dispersion power combined with a high proportion of patients needing critical care when 5 infected by the SARS-COV-2 are challenging health systems worldwide. In order to control the virus spreading, several countries adopted social distancing, quarantine and isolation policies, such as the closure of stores, schools and universities, public transport reduction and prohibition of the mass gathering events [4] . Many studies endorse these policies as an effective way to combat the disease, attributing a reduction in the effective reproduction number and the total reported number of deaths 10 [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . For instance, Flaxman et al. [4] indicated that thousands of deaths were averted in Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions and Dehning et al. [5] noticed a clear relationship between governmental interventions and disease spreading in Germany.In Brazil, one strategy raised by the government suggested isolating only the risk group (e.g. elderly people). This strategy was named ""Isolamento vertical"" [9] , or ""Quarentena Vertical"" [10] which means 15 vertical isolation or vertical quarantine. This strategy was formulated based on the hypothesis that isolating only the risk group would reduce the deaths and hospitalisation up to avoid overcrowding in the health system. It was hypothesised that such intervention could reduce some of the expected economic impacts due to broader isolation.Additionally, on 4 October 2020, various scientists signed a declaration called ""Great Barrington 20 Declaration"" [11] . The document recommends a focused protection of the elderly and people from other risk groups (e.g. chronic heart failure) in order to reduce the potential social and economic harms of more strict measures to mitigate COVID-19. Although based on some logic (protecting those under higher risk), this declaration does not cite any scientific paper quantifying the proposed approach's possible effects. 25 Guiding scientific studies can influence millions of lives by supporting government bodies in COVID-19 related actions. At the current stage of the pandemic, many authors have modeled the effect of non-pharmaceutical measures to help decision-makers to reduce disease spreading [12, 5, 8, 13, 6] .In order to evaluate the consequences of only isolating the elderly group in Brazil, we present an adapted susceptible -exposed -infectious -removed (SEIR) model, by separating those aged 60 or 30 more, which represent the risk group, and the remaining population. The model includes estimations for ward and intensive care unit (ICU) bed demands for COVID-19 patients, and estimates death counts for COVID-19, accounting for age-specific infection fatalities and the loss of lives due to overwhelmed health systems. Intending to provide a clear comparison threshold, we also evaluate the counterfactual no intervention case. By comparing these two distinct scenarios, we aim to effectivelyIn order to model the Brazilian epidemic growth and the respective health system load, we employed a 40 two-step approach. In the first phase, we used a classical SEIR model [14] to model the transmission within the population. Then, we obtained the required beds (ward and ICU) and the number of deaths as a function of newly infected individuals at each time step. Compartmental models such as the proposed in the present work were widely applied to model COVID-19 disease on large populations, mainly to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in controlling the disease [15, 16, 8, 5] . 45 The classical SEIR compartments utilized for modeling the disease dynamic are:• S: susceptible individuals,• E: exposed (infected but not yet capable of infecting other people),• I: infectious individuals,• R: removed individuals (not able to infect or be infected anymore).Our model subdivided the compartments into two groups to distinguish transmission rates for the elderly and young individuals. Throughout the text the subscript () y represents persons aged up to 59 years old (young) and the subscript () e indicates those aged 60 and over (elderly). Thus, this results in 8 compartments, represented by the following ordinary differential equations (ODEs):where β, γ and α stand for the transmission, recovery and incubation rates, respectively. For the whole population, we assume constant values for such rates. Besides, N is the total number of individuals and C ij represents the contact rate between age groups i and j, where i and j can be assigned to the index e or y, as previously discussed. It is worth mentioning that we kept the population size constant throughout the process. Such hypothesis was made for convenience and can hold due to a balanced 55 population dynamics for relatively short time lengths [17] .The parameters γ and α are calculated as [18] :where t inf and t inc are the infectious and the incubation periods respectively.We also modeled the health care system demand for ICU and ward beds for each age group and the number of deaths. During the simulation, a fraction of newly infected individuals is assigned to different outcomes (need for ICU or ward; and death or survival). In order to model the time interval between 60 being infected and requiring hospital care, intermediate compartments were created. Furthermore, to enhance the death count estimation, the rate of individuals entering the ward and ICU compartments was divided accordingly to the outcome. The previously exposed model is presented in a flowchart in Figure 1 , depicting a general framework for an age group i (e.g. by switching the subscripts i by e or y we have the diagram for the elderly or young population respectively). It can be noticed that the infection dynamics is determined by a straightforward age-structured-SEIR embedded in a larger model. Strictly speaking, the number of newly infected individuals by age group, obtained from the SEIR model, are the inputs for the process of estimating the health care system demand and deaths. The SEIR model does not depend on the larger model (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths might be already counted as removed individuals in the SEIR 70 model). Thus, the sum of all individuals in the S, E, I and R compartments will always be equal to N .The additional employed compartments are defined as:• W : recently infected individuals that are not yet in the hospital, but will require a ward bed soon The simulation starts with the number of newly exposed individuals at time step t.The parameters λ W,i and λ U,i are defined as the probability of an infected individual from the age-group i to require a ward or ICU bed, respectively. Following exposure, there is a time interval before hospitalization; therefore, they are firstly assigned in temporary compartments (W and U ).The exit rate from such compartments is respectively proportional to the inf ection to ward or inf ection to ICU parameters, related to the mean time between exposure and hospitalization. The following equations depict this process:5 All rights reserved.

Thus, the natural sequence for those leaving H and U is one of the following compartments: W survive , W death , U survive or U death . Additionally, for hospitalizations, we incorporated the effect of an eventual health system overloading. We constrained the total number of hospitalized individuals at time t to the available number of wards or ICU beds within the Brazilian health system (regardless of the age group). We employed a logistic function to model a possible shortage of beds:where f j is the output of the logistic function, balance j is the total number of available beds and const j is a constant that calibrates the system to operate above its maximum capacity for each type of care bed j (ICU or ward). In the present work, we used −0.01 and −0.06 for const W and const U respectively. These values are high enough to impose the desired restriction without introducing numerical issues due to the evaluation of large exponential numbers. The number of available beds balance W and balance U are calculated by summing up the contribution of all compartments related to each hospitalization bed location (ICU or ward), considering both age groups:The logistic function is bounded by 0 and 1. The 0 value is returned when the system is not under high load, whereas 1 occurs when the system is under high load. Then, one could multiply the rate of individuals entering the survive and death compartments to 1 minus this logistic function. If no beds are available and the hospital still admitted a small amount of patients over its capacity, the rate of individuals entering those compartments will approximate to zero. On the other hand, if the health system is not under high strain, individuals' rate will not be affected by this function. For intermediate cases, the ward and ICU compartments could accommodate a fraction of the individuals who require care. Thus, this strategy enables to model the health system overwhelming through a continuous function. The model admits a small level of hospital admissions above its capacity, which might be realistic under a pandemic (e.g using transport beds placed in hallways as ward beds).

Similarly, (1 − σ W,i ) and (1 − σ U,i ) are the analogous proportions of those ones 85 who will die.The individuals that did not receive the needed care are transferred to the death compartment D, with probability ρ W or ρ U accordingly to each required bed type (ward or ICU respectively). This compartment also receives individuals leaving the W death and U death compartments. Entries occurring due to lack of beds because of health system overwhelm are assumed to be instantaneous whereas those 90 from W death and U death occur at a specific rate.This rate is proportional to the average length of stay at each compartment (los W death,i and los U death,i ). The following equation describes the death compartment dynamic:People in the U survive leave the compartment to W discharged U survive at a rate proportional to los U survive,i , the average number of days from ICU admission to ICU discharge. They remain in this compartment for an average time of los W discharged U survive before being discharged:Finally, people at W survive leave this compartment at a rate proportional to los W survive,i , the average number of stay for this group of patients, representing the patient discharge to home.In our work, we defined two age groups: the young and elderly. The former corresponds to the 95 individuals aged less than 60 years and the latter those aged 60 years or over. We retrieved the demographic data regarding Brazilian population from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.perpetuity.Both age groups defined in the present study have distinct general social behavior. Young people have 100 higher contact with other individuals when compared to elder people. In order to account for distinct contact patterns throughout age groups, we employed a contact matrix separating young and elderly citizens. As no empirical survey was conducted for Brazil, the matrix adopted here is derived based on the work of Prem et al. [20] , where contact matrices for several countries were estimated based on POLYMOD information [21] together with Health and Demographic Surveys and socio-demographic 105 factors.The total number of non-critical care hospitalization beds (ward beds), and critical care beds (intensive care unit beds) that could be eligible to receive COVID-19 patients were obtained from the Ministry of Health of Brazil [22] . For each simulated city, we considered that only 50% of beds could receive 110 patients, as patients with other health conditions would occupy the remaining beds.We adopted the range reported by Li et al. [23] for the basic reproduction number (r 0 ), with mean 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.9). In order to assess uncertainty, we sampled different values of a log-normal distribution assuming its 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles as the 95% confidence intervals of the We adopted the mean incubation period (α −1 ) and infectious period (γ −1 ) reported by Hao et al. [24] , 2.9 and 2.9 days respectively.The average length of stay in ward and ICUs for each outcome and age group were obtained from 120 238681 hospitalized COVID-19 cases from Brazil [25] and can be found at Table 2 . We adopted 5 days as the mean time from infection to hospitalization, based on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data [26] .The simulation starts at day 0, with 300 exposed, 200 infected and 0 removed individuals as initial conditions for the system. The number of susceptible individuals at day 0 is calculated by the city population minus the number of exposed and infected individuals at day 0. The simulation ends at day 140 250. As the present study's goal is to compare distinct scenarios, day 0 does not necessarily matches any date of specific events from the current pandemic.The distinction between unmitigated scenario and vertical isolation is done by the contact matrix. The results of Prem et al. [20] are divided by the places where the contact occurs (at work, school, home or others). For the unmitigated case, the full matrix is considered for both young and elderly, without 145 modification. For the vertical isolation case, the contacts for elderly are reduced to only those ones performed at home.Simultaneously, the contact patterns for the young are adjusted for accounting on this new behavior of the elderly. In other words, a young individual could meet an elderly one just at home, but would find another young with the same frequency as in the unmitigated scenario.A total of 1000 runs were performed for assessing uncertainty of each evaluated scenario.We run 1000 simulations for all state capitals of Brazil, accounting for their hospital bed capacity and population. We evaluated the effects of a hypothetical scenario where either no intervention was 155 adopted, or the vertical quarantine was adopted during the entire simulated period. Many of these cities may have implemented distinct COVID-19 mitigation strategies from those that we analysed.Since some of these strategies are out of our assumptions, our simulations may not precisely match the current observed epidemic behavior. Figure 2 presents the number of individuals that recovered or died (removed individuals) at the end of 160 the simulation period, for each simulation scenario, accounting for the 95% uncertainty interval due to uncertainty on model parameters. It is noteworthy that all the box plots within this work represent the whiskers at 1.5 interquartil range. For São Paulo, when compared to no isolation, the vertical quarantine resulted in a 4% reduction in the total number of removed people at the end of the epidemic.However, in the elderly group the reduction was considerable, with a 53% reduction on median values. ). This scenario also occurred for ward beds in some cities, yet in a lesser extent. When compared to no isolation, the vertical quarantine scenario reduced the demand of hospital beds slightly; 170 however, the reduction was not enough to avoid a healthcare system overwhelm, especially for ICUs.For São Paulo, when compared to no isolation, the vertical quarantine achieves some reduction in the total hospitalization demand (9% on number of bed-days median), even with a substantial reduction in hospitalization demand for elder patients (52% on number of bed-days median). The reduction on the number of ward and ICU beds by age group can be seen in figures 6 and 5. Despite young individuals 175 have a proportionally lower hospitalization rate compared to elderly people, as the younger population comprises about 86% of the Brazilian population, the contribution of all young people cases surpasses the hospitalization of elder patients on both scenarios.The vertical quarantine produced analogous effects on deaths. Figure 7 shows the estimated number of (cumulative) deaths at the end of the simulation. Although the vertical quarantine reduced 53% of the 180 deaths in the elderly population compared to no isolation, the overall reduction of deaths was 16%.Our simulations provide a better understanding of the possible impacts of adopting a vertical quarantine in the Brazilian context. When compared to no isolation, the vertical quarantine strategy 195 might reduce overall COVID-19 cases, mortality and hospital demand by a small factor. However, the sole adoption of vertical quarantine does not seem to be enough to avoid a healthcare system collapse by exceeding the supply of available beds to receive patients with COVID-19, especially ICU beds. This collapse is responsible for a huge fraction of the total death counts. If standard critical care were available, part of these deaths would be avoided. Thus, other strategies might also be required in order Broader isolation strategies should be more suitable for controlling epidemic growth and reducing 205 health system load. In this context, Walker et al. [16] suggested that a 75% reduction in contacts in all age groups would bring the effective reproduction number R t to less than 1 for a basic reproduction number r 0 = 3.0. This approach would produce a suppression in cases and reduce the number of deaths and health system strain as long as it stays in place. However, as the authors point out, this strategy might be challenging due to the high informal labor level in low-income and low medium income 210 countries [30] . Even Brazil being considered an upper-middle-income economy by the World Bank [31], pursuing this strategy would be challenging.In order to control the epidemic, more suitable strategies could be followed apart from age group based on isolation or indiscriminate isolation. Lu et al. [32] list some successful examples available worldwide.Strategies like contact tracing, quarantine of confirmed and suspected cases and eventually broader 215 cluster isolation strategies could be done as the number of cases grows up.In our model, we considered only the age to distinguish risk groups. More sophisticated models could add more factors e.g., considering those with heart or respiratory diseases. By increasing the number of people isolated by the vertical quarantine strategy, it would be probable more effective, reducing death 220 as well as hospitalization numbers. However, using a broader inclusion criterion for the risk group is likely to include the economically active population in the isolation group, which could have considerably different economic and social impacts.Our model assumes a standard population pyramid based on the Brazilian population pyramid for all simulated cities. However, the population pyramid for the simulated cities can vary significantly, 230 changing the expected number of deaths for each city, since there is a strong positive relationship between age and COVID-19 infection fatality ratio [33] . Further studies should address this issue by using different population pyramids accordingly to each city.The vertical quarantine strategy would result in a small decrease in COVID-19 deaths and 235 hospitalizations compared to the no isolation strategy. Our model shows that this reduction in hospitalizations would probably not be enough to prevent a health system overwhelming in Brazilian state capitals. Thus, a considerable number of deaths could occur due to the lack of medical care.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.perpetuity.perpetuity.","Brazil","first author","2021-01-15",1

The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new virus (SARS-CoV-2) was then denominated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). Since its first notification, the virus has spread around the world in record time despite rigorous attempts to contain the disease. In March 8, 2020 , statistical data showed that the outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes an epidemic threat worldwide, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2) .Real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (3) (4) (5) and it is an indicator of isolation, discharge, or transferring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (6) . However, the detection of the viral nucleic acid takes hours to be completed and requires specialized instrument and expertise. In addition, diagnostic reports may take days to reach the patient and medical team, weakening decision making about hospitalization and isolation of patients, which has great impact on hospital's total operating costs.While waiting for the diagnosis of patients with suspected COVID-19, hospital are forced to decide for isolation which, in turn, involves approximately one-third of hospitals' total operating costs and several areas as emergency room, intensive care unit, outpatient clinic, laboratory, diagnostic radiology, and general routine inpatient care (7) .The introduction of rapid antigen tests in hospitals and clinical laboratories is recent, as is the assessment of its accuracy. In the interim guidance of September 11, 2020, WHO has presented this option as a new technology for COVID-19 detection that is simpler and faster to perform than currentlyrecommended nucleic acid amplification tests (8) . Rapid antigen tests are based on the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in nasopharynge, oropharynge or possibly nasal swabs. Platforms are centered on a lateral flow immunoassay that provides results in up to 30 minutes. Though the sensitivity of these antigen detection tests are under evaluation in some countries, they offer the possibility of rapid and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases with no requirement of special equipment or expertise, enabling conscious decision about isolation of patients in appropriate settings.Considering that highly sensitive and specific tests are crucial to identify and manage patients and implement control measures to limit the outbreak and the appearance of new epidemic peaks, this work describes the performance of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (ECODiagnostica, Brazil) when introduced in a COVID-19 specialized hospital in Brazil. The selected test combines immunochromatography with monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies conjugated with gold particles forming an antigen-antibody complex when detecting the viral nucleocapsid (N) viral protein.Performance of the test was correlated to RT-qPCR results, demographics, baseline comorbidities, baseline symptoms, and outcomes of the first sequentially hospitalized and tested patients with suspected COVID-19 in a hospital that provides health services for the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde -SUS) of the Brazilian Federal Government.The SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test used in this work was the first method approved by the National Health Surveillance Agency of the Brazilian Federal Government, COVID-19 Ag ECO Test (ECODiagnostica, Brazil). The nasopharynge sample for analysis was obtained by dipping a swab through the nostril parallel to the palate. Swab was gently rubbed and rolled, and was slowly removed and introduced into the extraction buffer provided by the kit, where swab was rotated at least 10 times.Three drops of the mixture were added to the sample port of the antigen assay and the results were interpreted after a 15-min incubation.The data retrieved from the medical records were explored using the Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD) from the FactoMineR package (11) . The comorbidities and symptoms were used as variables to build models to predict the outcome -death or hospital discharge -independently for COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients. The Random Forest algorithm implemented in R (12) was used to create the models and measure de predictors' importance. Eighty per cent of the patients were randomly selected as the training set, and the algorithm performed 20 repetitions of cross-validation.Patients dead or discharged alive Died, N (%)Length of stay among those who died, mean (SD)* Discharged alive, N (%) Length of stay among those who discharged alive, At the hospitalization date, 116 patients were submitted to lung x-ray and chest tomography scans.A similar analysis was used to identify the patterns and factors related to patients' symptoms ( Figure 2 ).The Eigenvalue for the first two dimensions were 15.3% and 12.4% for axis 1 and axis 2, respectively.The boxplots reflect a concentration of deaths on the positive section of the axis 2and the axis 1 negative side ( Figure 2A) . Again, we observe the distribution of the ages along the axis 1, with a concentration of older patients on the left side of the plot. The variables that most contributed to driving the individuals along the axis 1 are productive cough, odinophagy, headache, myalgia, nausea, age, and anosmia; while through the axis 2 were dry cough, odinophagy, dyspnoea, myalgia, asthenia, tachypnea, age, productive cough, and nausea ( Figure 2B ).In order to identify variables with predictive potential, we built random forest models to predict the outcome -death or hospital discharge -for COVID-19 positive and negative patients. The mean GiniWe collected two nasopharyngeal samples from each of the 150 patients at the same time. The first sample was immediately submitted to SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test and the second sample was directed to RT-qPCR. According to RT-qPCR results, 55 samples were positive and 84 were negative, while 11 samples presented inconclusive results. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were only made available by the Reference Center for 5 patients thus it was not possible to determine the median ct value. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test revealed 40 positive samples and 110 negative samples. Diagnostic results and agreement/disagreement between methods are described on Table 4 and Table 5 . and 98%, respectively. The probability that the disease was present when the test was positive and not present when the test was negative was determined by predictive values (97% and 83%, respectively), while accuracy was 87%. The performance of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test in diagnosing COVID-19 in different age and gender groups is reported in Table 4 . No significant difference was seen on the test performance when evaluating patients by age (group 1: 60-99 years, group 2: 7-59 years) with accuracies of 89% and 86%, respectively. Sensitivity (79%), positive and negative predictive values (100% and 88%, respectively) and accuracy (92%) of the rapid test in diagnosing COVID-19 were significantly higher in female patients (p = 0.001). Together, number of days with symptoms was decisive on the test performance. Accuracies of 91% and 90% were reached when diagnosis was done on days 1-3 and 4-7 of symptoms in that order, while only 67% when diagnosis were performed after 8 days of symptomatology (p = 0.001). Sensitivity and negative predictive value were significantly low when diagnosis were performed after 8 days of symptoms onset (p = 0.001).One RT-qPCR negative patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test after 2 days of symptoms. This patient were admitted with fever, dry cough and dyspnea, presented chest tomography with multifocal ground-glass opacities on both sides and reduced hemoglobin. Despite dyspnea, he did not required oxygen supply and remained hospitalized for 5 days before hospital discharge.From the 11 RT-qPCR inconclusive results, 5 were on the first and second days of symptomatology, 1 of them were on the 8th and 1 on the 15 th of symptoms. Only 2 patients were on the 5 th day of symptoms while no report was found for 2 of them. Two patients presented chest tomography with bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities and 4 needed oxygen supply due to strong dyspnea and desaturation (2 of them evolved to death). Only 1/11 of these patients with inconclusive RT-qPCR were positive for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test. This patient (1 day of symptoms) presented odynophagia and dry cough.'Substantial' agreement was found between the rapid antigen test and RT-qPCR performed both on the same day (κ = 0.72), an agreement that was maintained for the first seven days of symptoms when diagnosis period were separated. For female patients, an 'almost perfect' agreement was found (κ = 0.82) regardless of the number of days and, agreement was reduced to 'fair' with a poorest performance of both tests revealing the highest number of discordant results when diagnosis were performed after the 8th day of symptoms. The fact that testing may be initially negative in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those who will later develop overt COVID-19, is not really surprising considering the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The incubation period for coronavirus is believed to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptomatic onset (29) . It appears that transmission is possible for approximately 8 days after symptoms appear. The period from the first day of detection to virus clearance is usually 12 days in those who became instead symptomatic (40, 41) .The rapid antigen test reproduced RT-qPCR results on 87.1% of patients and did not showed any inconclusive result, preseting strong colorimetric reaction on positive samples and completely absence of color on the negatives. On the other hand, RT-qPCR presented 11 inconclusive results (7.3% of the cases). Of all these inconclusive cases, 1 was positive for the SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test on the first day of symptoms presenting odynophagia and dry cough. Although the other 10 patients were negative for the antigen test, only 2 patients were on the right diagnosis timing on samples collection day (5th day of symptoms). Among others, 2 patients presented chest tomography with bilateral multifocal groundglass opacities compatible to COVID-19, 4 needed oxygen supply after presenting strong dyspnea and desaturation, and 2 of them evolved to death. Although RT-qPCR testing fills a crucial role in accurately detecting SARS-CoV-2 on a case-by-case basis, it also has inherent problems that limit its utility.Molecular detection of the virus failure are related to the quality of the examined kit as well as to the novel coronavirus' characteristics, sampling location, sampling volume, transportation, and storage, as well as laboratory test conditions and personnel operation (44) . In brief, these typically encompass instrument malfunctioning with inappropriate cycling conditions, use of insufficient or inadequate material, non-specific annealing of PCR to homologous sequences, misinterpretation of expression profiles and so forth (41) . It is reported that many suspected cases with typical clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and chest tomography images were not diagnosed by RT-qPCR (45) . Results from a technique using primers in different genes can be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences.Together, 17 patients (12.2%) were considered positives on the molecular diagnosis and negatives on the rapid antigen test, while 1 (0.7%) were positive only on the rapid antigen test. Amongst the 17 patients positive only for RT-qPCR, only 6 were diagnosed between days 3 to 8 of symptoms. Seven presented chest tomography compatible to COVID-19 findings, but no lung infiltrate on chest x-ray, and none of the patients presented low saturation or needed ventilation or oxygen supply. Patient that tested positive only for the rapid antigen test were on the second day of symptoms, presented fever, dry cough and dyspnea, and chest tomography with multifocal ground-glass opacities on both sides. As noticed before, a single negative test does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in highly exposed persons, if the test is performed using a nasopharyngeal swab specimen and at the beginning of the infection (37, 44, 45, 46) . False negative RT-qPCR would be expected, to an extent difficult to estimate, related to conditions already discussed here and, although the specificity of the RT-qPCR seems to be very high, there may be false positive results due to swab contamination (47) .Limited information was available to describe laboratory exams of the patients requiring hospitalization and it was not possible to analyse a correlation of the exams results to the severity and outcomes. In terms of imaging, the incidence of lung infiltration and bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in elderly patients (> 60 years) was higher than in young patients, as reported before (48, 49) . Amongst RT-qPCR positive patients, 38.8% presented chest tomography alterations in comparison to 16.4% of negative patients with same alterations. These data reinforce that chest imaging is extremely helpful in the diagnosis of the disease and has an irreplaceable role in the early detection as well as monitoring the disease's clinical course (50, 51).","Brazil","first author","2021-01-08",1

It was quickly declared a pandemic and represents a global health emergency (Chhikara et al., 2020) . Since its identification in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 84 million people, and led to 1,848,704 deaths (WHO, 2021), posing a worldwide challenge. It is most common modes of human-human transmission include direct transmission via droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, and talking (Doremalen et al., 2020) , and indirect transmission via contaminated inanimate objects (Lai et al., 2020) . Some infected people can be asymptomatic (Lai et al., 2020) . Most symptomatic cases present with symptoms including fever, cough, and acute respiratory disease syndrome (SARS). Severe cases can progress to pneumonia, kidney failure, and death .SARS-CoV-2 is a Coronaviridae family member, and is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus (Hsu et al., 2020, p. 2) . The viral structure is primarily determined by structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Kim et al., 2020, p. 2) . SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells is not well understood, and the complete mechanism remains to be elucidated. However, knowledge of another coronavirus may suggest how SARS-CoV-2 replicates in host cells.The SARS-CoV-2 genome has two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the nonstructural proteins (nsps) (Andersen et al., 2020) . ORF1a encodes the polypeptide pp1a, which is cleaved into 11 nsps, and ORF1b encodes the polypeptide pp1ab, which is cleaved into 16 nsps (Kim et al., 2020; Lai & Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977) . Proteolytic cleavage is performed by viral proteases Nsp3 and Nsp5 (Chan et al., 2020) , enabling complex assembly from other nsps to form the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) (Gordon et al., 2020) . The RTC consists of several enzymes, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), the main protease (Nsp5), an endonuclease (Nsp15), and a papain-like protease (Nsp3) (Chan et al., 2020) .Nsp9, encoded by ORF1a forms a six b strand core that projects extended loops outward, and includes an N-terminal b-strand, and a C-terminal a-helix (Figure 1a ) (Littler et al., 2020) . The N-and C-terminal regions are essential for Nsp9 dimer's replicase function (Figure 1b) (Littler et al., 2020) and are important for replication of CoV family viruses, including SARS-CoV (Frieman et al., 2012) . SARS-CoV Nsp9 has been demonstrated to bind RNA (Egloff et al., 2004) , stabilizing the nascent nucleic acid as it emerges from the nsp7-nsp8 complex during viral replication, and protecting it from nucleases Zhai et al., 2005) . In addition, Nsp9 may interact with a secondary structure element at the 3 0 end of the viral genome in several coronaviruses (Robertson et al., 2004) . The loops connecting the b2-3 (L23) and b3-4 (L34) strands of Nsp9 are positively charged and glycine rich, suggesting that these regions participate in RNA binding and interaction (Littler et al., 2020) . Soluble SARS-CoV Nsp9 dimerizes via interaction of an a-helical GxxxG motif, and any disruption in key conserved residues can impair RNA binding, consequently suppressing SARS-CoV viral replication (Frieman et al., 2012) . Mutations in the GxxxG motif of Nsp9 from porcine delta coronaviruses disrupts nucleotide binding capacity (Zeng et al., 2018) . Nsp9 replicase is considered an important SARS-CoV virulence factor (Miknis et al., 2009) . Since SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 is 97% homologous to SARS-CoV Nsp9 (Littler et al., 2020; Ponnusamy et al., 2008) , this protein may play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. It therefore represents a potential target for design and development of antiviral drugs.Natural products isolated from plants used in traditional herbal remedies have had a huge impact on drug development against various diseases (Dias et al., 2012) . Naphthoquinones are natural metabolites found in plants, bacteria, and fungi that show extraordinary synthetic versatility, and are of great interest in medicinal chemistry (da Silva J unior et al., 2019) . Some naphthoquinones are currently used as medicinal drugs (Aminin & Polonika, 2020) . Lapachol is a 1,4-naphthoquinone compound originally extracted from the Bignoniaceae family, first isolated in Tabebuia impetiginosa, but also present in other plants (Hussain & Green, 2017 (Pinto et al., 1987; Sacau et al., 2003) . In addition, lapachol and its derivatives have been used in pre-clinical and clinical phases of drug development, demonstrating significant promise for cancer treatment (Block et al., 1974) .Owing to widespread use of naphthoquinones, especially lapachol (I), b-lapachone (II), and a-lapachone (III) (Figure 2) , and their derivatives, there is great interest in studying their biological applications and their use as templates for synthesis of new derivatives. The chemistry of lapachol derivatives has been widely and extensively studied, and derivatives such as nor-b-lapachone (XII), hydroxylapachol (XI), and oxime derived from b-lapachol (IV) have been chemically synthesized Santos et al., 2016; Nasiri et al., 2013) . Therefore, lapachol derivative chemistry is a source of inspiration for the design and synthesis of new molecules, such as lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, IX and X ( Figure 2 ), which to our knowledge are novel, and currently under study in our laboratory. There is a dearth of knowledge on the antiviral activity of lapachol against coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our in silico data provide evidence that lapachol and its derivatives may serve as SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 ligands, providing leads for development of candidate drugs against COVID-19.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) non-structural protein (nsp) 9 replicase protein structure (PDB:6W4B) (Figure 1 ) was used as a target to search for protein-ligand interactions with lapachol and its derivatives ( Figure 2 ). Virtual screening comprised prospecting for potential SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 ligands from a library of 12 lapachol-related compounds. The GOLD 5.8.1 program (Jones et al., 1995) was used to calculate flexible anchoring between proteins and ligands. This program uses specific parameters for its virtual search of compounds in the selected databases. The GOLD program uses a genetic algorithm, propagating multiple copies of flexible ligand models in receptor active sites, randomly recombining segments of these copies until a set of structures converges. The position of the Nsp9 RNA-binding site was obtained from a study of SARS-CoV conducted by Sutton et al. (2004) , which defined the RNA binding site as composed of the L23, L45, and L7H1 loops ( Figure 1a ). These data were corroborated by virtual prediction using the metaPocket 2.0 server (Huang, 2009) .The scoring function used for ranking was ChemPLP, which is defined by its use of a hydrogen bonding term, and multiple linear potentials to model van der Waals and repulsive terms. The parameter for searching an interaction's degrees of freedom was defined as ""Very Flexible,"" corresponding to a search efficiency of 200%. All other parameters used options pre-defined by the program. All selected ligands were subjected to 10 iterations using this genetic algorithm. When the best three iterations of each molecule converged to the same docking pose, the five best compounds, according to PLP ranking and convergence, were selected for the next stage. Docking results were also analyzed by generation of 2 D diagrams using LigPlot þ (Laskowski & Swindells, 2011) . To evaluate potential toxic features, selected molecules were submitted to in silico toxicity prediction using the pkCSM webtool (Pires et al., 2015) .The complexes selected from the results of molecular docking, and the Nsp9 apo protein were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS 2016 (Abraham et al., 2015) . Parameterization of each ligand was performed on the SwissParam server (Zoete et al., 2011) , and the MD of each protein-ligand complex was simulated using the CHARMM27 force field with the TIP3P water model. The MD unit cell was triclinic in shape, and water and ions were added to the system. System energy was minimized using the steepest descent algorithm, and minimization was stopped when the maximum force was less than 10.0 kJ/mol. NVT and NPT equilibrium phases were performed at 100 ps each. Solutions were subjected to 100 ns simulations, comprising 10 million simulation steps during the production phase under NTP conditions. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using particle mesh Ewald (PME) for long-range electrostatics (Essmann et al., 1995) . Temperature was maintained constant at 300 K using a modified Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) , and pressure was maintained at 1 atm using the Parrinello-Rahman method (Parrinello & Rahman, 1980 ). Shortrange van der Waals and electrostatic forces were set to 1.2.To assess ligand stability, molecular dynamics results were evaluated using tools provided by the GROMACS program. Analyses performed were as follows: root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and number of hydrogen bonds between protein and ligand.The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method (Massova & Kollman, 2000) with energy decomposition was used to calculate binding free energy between Nsp9 and each ligand. According to (Genheden & Ryde, 2015) crude approximations, it succeeds in rationalizing observed differences between docking studies. The MM-PBSA method was performed using the g_mmpbsa tool (g_mmpbsa-A GROMACS tool for high-throughput MM-PBSA calculations), which calculates three energetic terms: potential energy in vacuum, polarsolvation energy, and non-polar solvation energy.Principal component analysis (PCA) or covariance analysis can be used in molecular dynamics to calculate overall protein molecular motion by analyzing a protein's dynamic nature and its atomic positional fluctuations (Aarthy et al., 2020) . The covar Gromacs tool was used to perform covariance analysis to create and diagonalize a covariance matrix using protein backbone atoms. The two most dominant eigenvectors were used to calculate the overlap between principal components and coordinates of the trajectory.To prospect for ligands to non-structural protein (nsp) 9 of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Figure 1 ), we selected lapachol and 11 lapachol derivatives ( Figure 2 ) for in silico analysis. These compounds were subjected to molecular docking targeting the RNA binding site of Nsp9 composed of loops L23, L45, and L7H1 ( Figure 1a ) (Sutton et al., 2004) . The top five compounds (V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI) were chosen based on best ChemPLP scores, and on their capacity to converge to a single pose within three iterations after docking. Comparison of 3 D docking with an analysis of 2 D diagrammatic docking demonstrated that all five molecules formed a minimum of one hydrogen bond within the RNA binding site from Nsp9, together with hydrophobic interactions (Figures 3 and 4) . Molecule V formed two hydrogen bonds to Ser35 in the Nsp9 RNA binding site (2,86 and 2,56 Ð) and seven hydrophobic interactions (to Met8, Arg35, Val37, Phe52, Thr63, Ile61, and Lys54), producing a docking score of 54.52. Compound VI formed one hydrogen bond to Val37 (2,88 Å), and ten hydrophobic interactions (to Gly33, Gly34, Arg35, Ser55, Met8, Pro53, Phe52, Ile61, Phe36, and Thr63), with a docking score of 56.34. Compounds VIII and IX formed two hydrogen bonds to Arg35 (2.65 and 2.91 Ð) or one hydrogen bond (3.09 Ð), respectively. Compounds VIII and IX also established six hydrophobic interactions (to Ser55, Phe52, Ile61, Val37, Thr63, and Gly34), producing docking scores of 51.05 and 64.23, respectively. Molecule XI formed two hydrogen bonds to Arg35 (3,00 and 2,96 Ð) and one to Pro53 (2,65 Ð), and formed six hydrophobic interactions with residues Gly33, Gly34, Ile61, Val37, Phe52 and Ser55, with a docking score of 52.25 (Figure 4 ).Toxicity predictions evaluated eight features related to potential toxic effects of the selected molecules (Table 1) . Except for molecule V, all compounds yielded negative results for AMES toxicity, which assesses potential mutagenicity. The maximum tolerated dose in humans gave the highest values for compounds VIII and IX and the lowest for compound V. Values below or equal to 0.477 log(mg/ kg/day) were considered low according to the PKCSM webserver. All molecules showed negative results for hERG inhibition. This feature evaluated the potential for potassium channel inhibition that could lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmia. All molecules except compound VIII displayed negative hepatotoxicity results. All molecules yielded negative skin sensitization results. T. pyriformis is used as a model in toxicity studies. All molecules displayed log(ug/L) values above the limit expected for low toxicity (-0.5 log(mg/L)). Minnow toxicity tests, using fathead fish minnows as a model, gave positive results in silico for all molecules. Expected high acute toxicity occurs at low compound concentrations, with log LC 50 scores below 0.3. In general, the molecules displayed little toxicity, except for hepatotoxicity and T. pyriformis toxicity. Molecule V gave the broadest range of toxicities, and molecule VIII displayed the lowest predicted toxicities. It is important to note that as yet, no experimental data corroborate or disagree with these predicted results, as these lapachol derivatives have not been tested in vitro or in vivo.Lapachol derivatives form a highly stable complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 RNA binding siteComplexes between the selected lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI and the Nsp9 RNA binding site were subjected to molecular dynamics assays to assess the stability of each complex via RMSD. During the 100 ns dynamic simulation, all complexes showed a stable profile ( Figure 5) , except for the complex with derivative XI. This was confirmed by mean RMSD and low standard deviation values (Table 2) . Complexes with lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, and IX displayed similar stabilities compared with the apo enzyme RMSD ( Figure 5 ) and by the mean ± standard deviation (Table 2 ). However, XI showed a slight variation in the last 25 ns compared with the apoenzyme. The ligand-binding site is mainly comprised of residues 25 to 65 in Nsp9 chain A ( Figure 6 ). Visual inspection of RMSF analysis ( Figure 6 ) reveals a similar profile of residue fluctuation in all analyzed structures. However, the RMSF mean and standard deviation fluctuate less in residues 25 to 65 in complexes with molecules V, VI, and VIII, compared to apo enzyme (Table 2) . These results indicate increased residue restraints, probably due to ligand interactions with these residues.Analysis of hydrogen bonds formed within each complex showed that lapachol derivative VI (Figure 7b ) had the most stable hydrogen bond profile with a mean of 1.51 hydrogen bonds plotted along the MD (Table 3) . By contrast, complexes with molecules V and XI showed lower means and standard deviations. Similarly, the Nsp9-VIII and IX complexes did not demonstrate a tendency to stabilize, showing high standard deviations (Table 3 ) and sporadic increased values for hydrogen bonding (Figure 7c and d) .Binding energy and stability of lapachol derivative/Nsp9 RNA binding site complexes according to MD simulationsThe MM/PBSA method is an approach used to estimate free energies of small ligand complexes with macromolecules that requires a small number of computational processes. It has been useful for analyzing binding energies of docked structures and rationalizing observed differences in biological macromolecules' behaviors (Genheden & Ryde, 2015) .Within each 100 ns simulation, 100 snapshots of the trajectory were obtained at constant intervals of 1 ns for analyses. All complexes showed negative binding energy profiles, with the exception of molecule V (Figure 8) . Molecule VI had the most stable profile (Figure 8) , and together with molecule IX, showed the lowest mean binding energy among the ligands (Table 4 ). Molecule IX also showed the lowest standard deviation. These results indicate that van der Waals interactions contribute the most energy to these protein-ligand interactions, and molecules VI and IX display the highest binding affinity.A simple comparison of the dynamics over time of each ligand Nsp9 complex was performed. The protein-ligand interactions are illustrated by the complexes at 0, 50, and 100 ns in each simulation (Figure 9 ). Lapachol derivative VI displayed the most constant number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds over the course of the simulation compared to the other ligands ( Figure 9b ). This result corroborates prior analysis defining VI as the most stable ligand.PCA eigenvector projections represent the overlap between the first two principal components and coordinates of each trajectory. They plot the essential subspace occupied by each protein during molecular dynamics. The results show that complexes V, VI, and VIII filled conformational space similar to the apo protein ( Figure 10) . Thus, complex compactness was maintained during the simulation. By contrast, molecules IX and XI showed exploration of a different conformational space, and a less compact profile compared to the apo structure ( Figure 10 ).To compare results with another coronavirus target, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Nsp9 replicase protein (PDB:3EE7) was subjected to docking and dynamics with ligand VI, using the same parameters described in Methods. Lapachol derivative VI interacted with Ser59 from the Nsp9 RNA-binding site, and formed nine other hydrophobic interactions (to Met12, Pro57, Ser59, Arg39. Val41, Phe56, Thr67, Ile65, and Lys58), producing a docking score of 57.12 (Figure 11a ). Although the RMSD profile of SARS-COV Nsp9 does not seem to reach a stable plateau (Figure 11b ), the number of hydrogen bonds seems to increase from one bond to stabilize at four bonds over 100 ns of molecular dynamics (Figure 10c ). In addition, binding energy values were under À50 kJ/mol (Figure 11d ), similar to SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9-lapachol VI derivative complex values. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has threatened the global health system (Hsu et al., 2020) and accentuated the urgent need for drugs to combat viral outbreaks. The lack of antivirals and/or vaccines directly impacts our ability to bring pandemics under control, increasing morbidity/mortality, and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This situation also impacts populations' quality of life, overloading healthcare systems worldwide, and resulting in economic hardship. Therefore, drugs that abrogate SARS-CoV-2 replication are needed.In this study, we docked ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein (nsp) 9 RNA binding site (a promising drug target) to identify candidate antiviral agents. This methodology has been used to design and identify potential ligands for viruses including Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV. For emergency development of antiviral agents, studies have focused on identifying drug targets among essential proteins in virus replication, primarily targeting conserved structures and enzymes such as RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (M PRO ), or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Bharadwaj et al., 2020; Buonaguro et al., 2020; Rout et al., 2020) . However, many other targets are predicted to impact viral activity (Gordon et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . Nsp9 is an essential enzyme in the replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC) required for coronavirus replication, that binds to genomic RNA, ensuring production of new RNA genomes, and protecting them from nucleases (Egloff et al., 2004, p. 9) . Additionally, it is highly conserved among coronaviruses (Littler et al., 2020; Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . Therefore, Nsp9 may represent a good target for direct-acting antivirals, given that inhibiting the RNA binding site of Nsp9 prevents it from binding to the nascent RNA from the nsp7-8 complex during SARS-CoV-2 replication. Once released from the nsp7-8 complex, the nascent RNA does not form a stable secondary structure Zhai et al., 2005) , and can be degraded by nucleases if Nsp9 action is blocked. Nsp9 has three loops (L23, L45, and L7H1) that have been associated with the RNA binding site and forms an OB-fold that is predicted to interact with oligonucleotides (Flynn & Zou, 2010; Sutton et al., 2004) . Moreover, the b-barrel in which the L23, L45, and L7H1 loops are found allows RNA binding capacity through nonspecific interactions (Sutton et al., 2004) . In this context, considering that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 is a conserved structure among coronaviruses (Littler et al., 2020) , we explored the RNA binding site formed by the cited loops as a possible target for lapachol and its derivates to assess their antiviral potential.Lapachol and its derivatives have been associated with several biological activities in preclinical and clinical trials (Block et al., 1974; Hussain & Green, 2017) . Here, we evaluated lapachol, and eleven lapachol derivatives as possible ligands for the RNA binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9. Among the analyzed compounds, lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI demonstrated strong interactions with the target site in molecular docking studies.Lapachol derivatives have been shown to exhibit improved activity and solubility when associated with new radicals (Oliveira et al., 2002 (Oliveira et al., , 2017 . Our data corroborate this literature, since chemical modifications of lapachol were able to increase hydrophobic interactions with regions of the RNA binding site, and create new interactions with specific amino acids, as demonstrated by lapachol derivative VI.To assess the overall stability of each complex (lapachol or a lapachol derivative bound in the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 RNA binding site), molecular dynamics analyses were performed to obtain RMSD profiles. Lapachol has previously been described as very stable in molecular dynamics assays against ZIKV nsp3 (Oguntade et al., 2017) . However, in our analyses, lapachol did not yield the best docking score. Lapachol derivative VI presented one of the best docking scores, showing stable interaction behavior in RMSD and RMSF. In addition, molecular dynamics assessed hydrogen bond formation in each complex over the course of a 100 ns simulation. Hydrogen bonds are essential for stabilizing ligands within a binding pocket (Kostal, 2016) , and are mediators of strong interactions (Mar echal, 2007) . Lapachol derivative VI showed a tendency to stabilize existing hydrogen bonds, while the other compounds, especially compound IX, showed an increasing number of hydrogen bonds as the simulation progressed. When the lapachol derivative VI/SARS-CoV Nsp9 complex was compared to that of compound VI/SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, the results showed similar interactive behavior. The main discrepancy in molecular dynamics performance was that the protein RMSD profile of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 protein did not stabilize over time. The hydrogen bonds formed, and the binding energy profiles were highly similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9-lapachol derivative VI complexes. The high sequence identity between these two Nsp9 homologs (90%), obtained by the EMBOSS Needle sequence alignment tool (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) , and structural similarity (RMSD ¼ 3.89 Å), obtained by structural alignment using the Chimera program (Pettersen et al., 2004 ) may explain these functional similarities ( Figure S1 ). Moreover, derivative VI bonding with SARS-CoV Nsp9 displayed similar affinity to that of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, suggesting broad-spectrum activity (Littler et al., 2020; Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . The affinity of these molecules for other non-structural SARS- CoV-2 proteins is being investigated by our research group. In addition, potential toxic characteristics can be corrected with other rational modifications during in vitro and in vivo tests.In summary, we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 may be a viable target for antiviral development. We also showed that lapachol derivatives, mainly VI and IX, may function as potential ligands for the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 RNAbinding site. Our work shows the importance of studying protein-ligand complex stability via dynamics to corroborate docking studies. Although the results seem promising, it is important to validate this activity. Therefore, these molecules should be further investigated for in vitro and/or in vivo antiviral activity. They may also be used as templates for development of future drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Thus, these data may provide relevant information to advance our ability to combat COVID-19.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. ","Brazil","first author","2021-01-22",1

Despite the historic approval of a COVID-19 vaccine tested in a large clinical trial in the United Kingdom [2] , epidemic control still critically depends on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, and early detection and effective isolation of infected individuals [3] .Compared to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, has two characteristics that make early case detection and isolation of infected individuals particularly critical for epidemic control.First, the virus is an efficient spreader, with an average of about 2.5 secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a susceptible population [4] . Second, the highest risk of transmission occurs very early in the disease, before or within the first days of symptom onset [5] . These characteristics hinder transmission control because early case detection and effective isolation are challenging. Thus far, COVID-19 surveillance has been primarily based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, considered the most reliable diagnostic test for COVID-19 [6] . However, RT-PCR positivity varies among infected patients depending on, for example, the timing of sample collection in relation to symptom onset or the sampling technique used (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum) [7] .Accurate testing results are critical to prevent onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community and hospital settings. As the second wave of infection continues to grow in Europe and the United States, straining health system capacity even further, critical workers with known exposures to the virus will continue to use RT-PCR tests to discard SARS-CoV-2 infection. False-negative RT-PCR results are particularly problematic among healthcare and other essential workers (e.g., firefighters, police), which may inadvertently become ""superspreaders"" [8] . As social distancing measures are relaxed, RT-PCR falsepositives also affect community control measures if workers with suspected infection are cleared to return to work. If negative RT-PCR results are treated as evidence of no-infection, there is a non-negligible risk of preventable transmission of the virus.We addressed this problem by designing a readily available, easy-to-use online tool to estimate the probability that an individual is infected with SARS-CoV-2 conditional on having one or more negative RT-PCR test results (https://midas-uc.shinyapps.io/Calculadora-COVID19/). Our tool, based mainly on the work by Kucirka et al. [9] , requires users to first choose between one, two, or three consecutive negative RT-PCR tests. Second, to provide (i) the estimated probability of being positive before taking the RT-PCR diagnostic test (range: 0 to 1), and (ii) the number of days elapsed between the first symptoms and the first, second, or third RT-PCR test (range: -4 to 16 days). The tool is available in English and Spanish.We build on Kucirka et al.'s [9] work and adjusted a hierarchical logistic model to estimate the rate of false negatives for different moments in time from the onset of symptoms. We implemented the model using JAGS and the RJAGS library in R [10] . We generated a Markov chain of 420,000 samples; the first 20,000 samples were discarded, and the rest were re-sampled to generate a sub-chain of size 20,000. In contrast to Kucirka et al. [9] , we estimated a non-study-specific marginal rate of false-negative RT-PCR tests. Our online tool assumes a specificity of one of the RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and independence of the results of different tests when considering more than one test (specific details are shown in the Technical Appendix).To show the tool's utility, we input data from a healthcare worker in a hospital setting in Chile who was not working with COVID-19 patients. The worker was inadvertently exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by an asymptomatic patient who later developed symptoms and had confirmed COVID-19. The worker had a negative nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR result three days following exposure. She reported symptoms the day after the first negative RT-PCR and had a second RT-PCR test that showed positive results (Technical Appendix). Because she was exposed for a relatively long period, we used a 50% pre-test probability of infection (Figure) .Our online tool enables users to estimate the probability of having COVID-19 with one or more negative RT-PCR results. The tool is available in English and Spanish. We hope this publicly available online tool will help decision-makers to avoid preventable transmission of SARS-CoV-2.This work was supported by the ANID Millennium Science Initiative grants MIDAS NCN17_059 and MICROB-R NCN17_081.which generates a conditional (study-specific) estimate of the false-negative rate.We partially reproduced the analysis carried out by Kucirka et al.

Specifically, we considered the same data and hierarchical model, which was implemented using the following prior distributions:Unlike Kucirka et al.'s [9] work, we estimated the false-negative rate using the expressionOur online tool assumes a specificity of one of the PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus and independence of the results of different tests when considering more than one test.

However, this time the infection caused, called COVID-19, is a bit worse and capable of collapsing the lungs very quickly, killing the patient if no respiratory support is provided, being declared a worldwide pandemic in 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In most countries the shortage of enough respirators, as well as, specialized personal to operate them, aroused a big fear of collapsing in the health systems. Therefore, social distancing and/or lockdown of the entire population was the most immediate response to this situation in order of smoothing the progress curve of the disease, and saving the Governments some time for preparing their health systems for facing properly this pandemic (Bedford et al., 2020; Cucinotta & Vanelli, 2020; Ortiz-Prado et al. 2020; Velavan & Meyer, 2020) .However, improving the health infrastructure is not enough and the situation will be totally under control only after the naturally achieving of herd immunity by the population, the development of a vaccine, or emergence of a drug capable of avoiding the respiratory complications of COVID-19 (Fierabracci et al., 2020; Gates, 2020) . As the first two options can take months, maybe more than a year, the most immediate solution to beat COVID-19 is the search for new drugs based on the repurposing approach (Pushpakom et al., 2019) . On this sense we performed a comprehensive virtual screening (VS) study on a library comprising FDA approved drugs in a search for molecules capable of hitting the three main molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 currently available in the protein data bank (PDB) (https://www.rcsb.org/) (Berman et al., 2000a) .In order to select which proteins would be studied in terms of their interactions with small molecules, we analyzed the role that different proteins play in SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of replication or cell entrance, and the availability and quality of their three-dimensional structures in the PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/) (Berman et al., 2000a) . All selected proteins are part of the viral machinery responsible for the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome or play important roles in the viral mechanisms of entrance inside human cells. Main protease (M pro ) is responsible for proteolysis of polyproteins 1a and 1ab, generating smaller proteins that are necessary for the virus replication Rathnayake et al., 2020) . Spyke protein is a homotrimer located in the external surface of the virus and contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which directly binds to the peptidase domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and consequently promotes the entrance of the virus inside the cell (Cao et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . Finally, papainlike protease (PL pro ) is responsible for processing the viral polyprotein, a process that is required for the release and maturation of several non-structural proteins, and thus is essential for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (B aez-Santos et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2020; Klemm et al., 2020) .Our search screened 1930 compounds contained in the FDA-approved drugs data set available at the Cheminformatic tools and Databases server (ChemoInfo) (https://chemoinfo. ipmc.cnrs.fr/) (Douguet, 2010 (Douguet, , 2018 against the targets cited above, and the 50 best molecules were selected for further docking studies using Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD V R ) 6.0 (Thomsen & Christensen, 2006) , in order to confirm their potential for drug repurposing against COVID-19. The 7 drugs that showed potential to bind the three protein targets selected in this study were submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM-PBSA calculations in order to corroborate the docking results. We also performed the same theoretical studies for remdesivir in complex with each target protein, since this drug has been reported in literature as presenting promising in silico and experimental results for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (Grein et al., 2020; Hendaus, 2020; Naik et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .The molecular targets selected from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000b) and their respective binding pockets chosen to run the VS study, are listed on Table 1 . The search space of each molecular target in Table 1 were centered in the respective co-crystalized ligands.The spherical search spaces for the VS studies on each target were determined with MVD V R (Thomsen & Christensen, 2006) as centered in the respective binding pockets defined in Table 1 . The coordinates and radius used for each search are listed in Table 2 .As mentioned above we used the FDA-approved drugs data set (called here FDA-library) available at ChemoInfo server (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/) that provided 1930 FDAapproved drugs ready for docking (Douguet, 2010 (Douguet, , 2018 . Those molecules were evaluated regarding their interactions with each of the protein targets listed in Table 1 .A Receptor-based Virtual Screening (RBVS) was carried out for each target protein separately using the ChemoInfo VS tool, which employs the docking algorithm Protein-Ligand ANT System (PLANTS) (Korb et al., 2009) . For each target protein, the respective .pdb file and coordinates of the center of the binding site, as defined in Table 2 , were given as inputs. After evaluation of the FDA-library, the ChemoInfo VS tool returned the results consisting on a list of the molecules ranked by the PLANTS (Korb et al., 2009 ) scoring function. The top results correspond to molecules that stablished the most favorable interactions with the target.For each target, the best 50 results returned by the ChemoInfo VS tool were retrieved and these results were filtered in order to remove drugs that mainly act in the central and/or peripheral nervous system, renal system and/or cardiovascular system, because these effects would make it impossible to use those types of drugs in patients infected with COVID-19. After the filtering, we looked for drugs that showed potential to interact with more than one target protein and, therefore, triggering a synergistic effect, enhancing their potential to stop or slow down the SARS-CoV-2 action inside the human body. The drugs were then reranked in decreasing order of the number of protein targets that they interacted favorably with and, the ones showing favorable interactons with the three targets, were submitted to MVD V R and rounds of MD simulation and MM-PBSA calculations. A flowchart summarizing the VS procedure used in this study is illustrated in Figure 1 .The drugs that showed favorable interactions with all three targets selected in this work were submitted to MVD V R , using the same protocol validated before (Botelho et al., 2020) , in order to re-evaluate the protein-ligand interactions using the Moldock Score, a docking algorithm more accurate than PLANTS (Korb et al., 2009) . For this task their 3 D structures were constructed in the Spartan 08 software (Hehre et al., 2006) , using the semi-empirical method Parametric Method 3 (PM3) (Stewart, 2004) for geometry optimization, and the Natural Population Analysis (NPA) (Reed et al., 1985) method for atomic charges calculations. For each protein-ligand complex, 10 runs were carried out in the search spaces defined in Table 2 , with 30 poses returned for each run. Those poses were analyzed regarding their MolDock Score and the residues they formed hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with. After, the best pose of each drug in each target was selected to be submitted to MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations. The complexes remdesivir/targets were also generated with MVD V R , following the same protocol described above and the best poses also selected for the further MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations. The interaction energies of the ligands found inside the crystallographic structures listed in Table 1 were also determined using MVD V R for reference purposes.The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies were performed applying the bonded and non-bonded parameters for the all-atom force field OPLS-AA (Kaminski et al., 2001) . The three-dimensional coordinates and topologies of the targets listed in Table 1 were generated by the pdb2gmx software, which is part of the GROMACS 5.1.4 package (Berendsen et al., 1995; Hess et al., 2008; Pronk et al., 2013; Van Der Spoel et al., 2005) , used in this work to perform all MD simulations. Since the OPLS-AA force field (Kaminski et al., 2001) has no parameters for the ligands studied, the AcPype software (Sousa Da Silva & Vranken, 2012), was used to generate topology and coordinates files of all ligands submitted to MD simulations. The Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) method Cornell et al., 1993; Ribeiro et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2000) parameterized to reproduce the method Hartree-Fock and the basis set 6-31 G Ã (Jakalian et al., 2002) , was applied to calculate the atomic charges.The target proteins complexed with the selected ligands were confined inside boxes under periodic boundary conditions (Mart ınez et al., 2007) where the effect of the solvent was reproduced by the water model TIP4P (Harrach & Drossel, 2014; Jorgensen et al., 1983; Mark & Nilsson, 2001) . For each target protein, the box format and size were selected seeking optimization of simulation time and absence of undesired artifacts. The boxes volumes and approximate numbers of water molecules of each system are listed in Table 3 . All systems were submitted to two minimization steps using the steepest descent algorithm with the convergence criterion of 100.00 kJ mol À1 nm À1 . The first step with position restrained (PR) and the second without PR. The equilibration of pressure and temperature was achieved through 100 ps of simulation using the canonical ensemble (NVT) (Bosko et al., 2005) , keeping the number of particles, volume and temperature constant. This was followed by 100 ps of simulation with an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) (Bosko et al., 2005) , keeping the number of particles, pressure, and temperature constant. After the equilibration step, all systems were submitted to a production step of 50 ns. All MD simulations were performed at 310 K and 1 bar, using 2 fs of integration time with the lists of pairs being updated at every 5 steps. The cut-off for Lennard Jones and Coulomb interactions were between 0 and 1.2 nm. The leap- frog algorithm was used in the production step with the Nose-Hoover thermostat (Evans & Holian, 1985) (s ¼ 0.5 ps) at 310 K and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello & Rahman, 1981 ) (s ¼ 2.0 ps) at 1 bar. All Arg and Lys residues were assigned with positive charges and all Glu and Asp residues were assigned with negative charges. The Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (Humphrey et al., 1996) software was used to visualize the simulation trajectories, and the Grace program (Turner, 2005) was used to build graphs of energy and root mean square deviation (RMSD). Additionally, the same procedure described above was used to run 100 ns of MD simulations with the three crystallographic complexes listed in Table 3 , in order to validate our MD simulation protocol.MM-PBSA calculations of the binding free energies of each ligand after the MD simulations were carried out in order to support the former results. Through this method it is possible to predict the binding free energy of the ligands considering the vacuum potential energy, which includes both bonded and nonbonded interactions, as well as the free energy of solvation, which considers both polar and nonpolar terms (Kumari et al., 2014) . After MD simulations, the ligands were submitted to the g_mmpbsa tool (Kumari et al., 2014) The search for potential multitarget drugs returned the 7 drugs listed in Table 4 , which have the potential of interacting with all targets listed in Table 1 , suggesting that further repurposing studies of those drugs might lead to the discovery of an existing drug with potential to treat COVID-19. The structure of remdesivir is also shown in Table 4 . Some of the drugs presented in Table 4 have very similar structures that justify their similar results. Cobicistat and ritonavir, two antiviral drugs, share several common characteristics as well as nystatin and amphotericin B, which are also very similar to each other. Although having different structures, deferoxamine, itraconazole and elbasvir also showed potential to form stable complexes with all targets. Despite the structural differences, all drugs in Table 4 share the common feature of having several highly electronegative atoms linked to hydrogen atoms, i.e. spots where H-bonds can be formed, which probably contributed to their ability to form stable complexes with multiple proteins.As mentioned above the 8 drugs presented in Table 4 were submitted to more docking calculations, with each molecular target chosen in this work, using MVD V R , so multiple poses per drug per protein could be analyzed regarding their stability.The results of docking calculations using MVD V R shown in Figures 2-5 , Table S1 and Figures S1-S25 , confirmed the RBVS results, showing that the best poses of all 7 selected drugs are capable of binding to the targets, presenting large negative values of interacting energy (most below À100.00 kcal mol À1 ) comparable with the results for the reference ligands inside SC2M pro and SC2PL pro . In the case SC2Spyke the interaction energy of the reference ligand is not comparable to our ligands once the peptide LCB1 is a much larger ligand. This peptide is capable of establishing many more interactions with the RDB domain of SC2Spyke (see Figure S25 ), reflecting in the much more negative binding energy value shown in Figure 5 . Our ligands, however, presented binding energies with SC2Spyke similar to the other targets which is enough to qualify them as potential good binders to this protein. It was also observed that remdesivir showed similar energy values with all targets. This suggests that it can also qualify as a multi-target drug against SARS-CoV-2. Among the residues observed in interactions with the best poses of each ligand, it's possible to see in the 3D plots of Figures 2-4 and the 2D plots of Figures S1-S24 that most of the residues listed in Table 1 present some kind of interaction with the ligands and, also, that at least one residue of the respective binding site forms H-Bond with the ligand. This confirms that the selected drugs are capable of binding in the binding sites pointed in Table 1 and, therefore, have potential to inhibit the selected targets. Elbasvir was the best binder to all targets according to the docking results, with energy values always below À150 Kcal/mol, while deferoxamine presented the worse (highest) energy values with all targets except SC2MPro, where it was the second worse (Table S1 ). The other 5 ligands presented oscillating results among the targets, ranking well with some and not so well with others.The selection of the best pose of each drug in each target resulted in 24 systems ligand/target that were submitted to additional rounds of MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations.In order to corroborate the docking results, 50 ns of MD simulations were performed with the 24 systems described above (one pose per drug of Table 4 in complex with each protein described in Table 1 ), plus the three crystallographic complexes listed in Table 3 , following the protocol described in the methodology section.Plots of total and average energy of the crystallographic complexes ( Figure S26) show that the systems achieve stability since the beginning of the simulation and allowed reducing the simulated time to 50 ns in order to save computing resources.Figures S27-S29 and the RMSD of each protein/ligand complex (Figure 6 ), confirm the stability of the systems during all simulated time. It's possible to see in those figures that the majority of the systems stabilized since the beginning of the MD simulations and that the RMSD of the ligands and proteins never oscillated over 0.7 nm. Deferoxamine and itraconazole were the ligands with worst behavior, showing larger RMSD oscillations with SC2Spyke (deferoxamine) and SC2M pro (itraconazole). Elbasvir (shown in blue in Figure 6 ) behaved well when in complex with all three proteins, indicating the favorable interactions between this ligand and the SARS-CoV-2 targets. Nystatin, shown in pink, presented stable RMSD values specially when complexed with SC2PL pro and SC2Spyke. As for SC2M pro , ritonavir (shown in purple) had a good behavior regarding RMSD values; pointing to the possibility of the administration of combined drugs for treating patients with COVID-19. Additionally, remdesivir, which has already shown promising clinical results for COVID-19 treatment (Grein et al., 2020; Hendaus, 2020; Naik et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , seems to form more stable complexes with SC2PL pro and SC2Spyke than with SC2M pro , enlightening aspects of this drug action regarding SARS-CoV-2. The protein presenting worst behavior was SC2M pro when complexed with amphotericin B.The H-bonds formed between each protein and each drug during the MD simulations were also analyzed in order to verify if such interactions, predicted by docking studies (Figures 2-4) , could also be observed during the MD simulations. The reference ligands were also analyzed in this aspect so the drugs could be compared to them in terms of Hbonds. Figures 7-9 show the H-bonds formed between each molecule and each protein. According to Figure 7 , the reference ligand to SC2M pro tends to form H-bonds mainly with Glu166 (pink) and Gln189 (green). Amphotericin B, deferoxamine and remdesivir seems to be more promising ligands than the reference in terms of H-bonds, since they interacted with a larger variety of residues during the MD simulations. Regarding interactions with SC2PL pro (Figure 8) , elbasvir is not shown because it did not form H-bonds during most of the MD simulation, although this drug presented good docking and RMSD results. As for the other ligands, none seem to be able to form numerous H-bonds with this protein; indicating that there may have non-polar interactions contributing for the complexes stabilities. Remdesivir seems to be the only drug capable of forming more H-bonds with SC2PL pro than the reference ligand. This results contributes to explain the already observed good clinical results of this drug. Considering SC2Spyke, Figure 9 shows that most drugs tend to form H-bonds mainly with Tyr449 (red) and Gln493 (blue), while the reference ligand formed H-bonds with multiple residues over the MD simulation time, mainly Lys417 (cyan), Asn487 (dark green), Gly502 (yellow), and Tyr449 (red). This is not unexpected since the reference ligand is a peptide and has nearly 60 amino acids (Cao et al., 2020) , so its size favors the formation of multiple interactions with SC2Spyke residues. Among the studied drugs, deferoxamine, nystatin and remdesivir are the ones that formed H-bonds with SC2Spyke residues during most of the MD simulation time, indicating that they tend to stay bound to this protein. The results of the MM-PBSA calculations are shown in Figure  10 . The negative binding energies predicted for all ligands (most below À50 Kcal mol À1 ) with all targets corroborated the docking and MD simulations results, confirming their stability and capacity of binding to these targets. Reference ligands of SC2M pro and of SC2PL pro had similar results to the other drugs, confirming their potential to inhibit those proteins. SC2Spyke reference ligand presented a significantly lower binding energy than all the other ligands, probably due to its high similarity with the SC2Spyke natural substrate (Cao et al., 2020) and consequent extremely low IC 50 value (Table 3) . However, other drugs such as elbasvir, itraconazole, nystatin and ritonavir also had good MM-PBSA results for SC2Spyke. Comparing the drug performances for the three proteins, elbasvir and ritonavir are the drugs presenting best general results.We performed a comprehensive theoretical study applying the methods of RBVS, docking, MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations, that allowed the selection of 7 potential hits amongst 1930 drugs approved by the FDA (https:// chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php#ref1). Our 7 hits, together with remdesivir, showed capacity of effectively binding to the three main SARS-CoV2 targets SC2M pro , SC2PL pro and SC2Spyke, qualifying as potential preapproved multi-target drugs. These results suggest that these drugs, worth being immediately submitted to in vitro evaluation against SARS-CoV2. Also, the fact of being multi-target hits suggests that these compounds could have a synergistic effect if administered simultaneously against COVID-19. The most promising drugs for this, according to our results, are remdesivir, elbasvir and ritonavir.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.

IMT M pro exhibited only 6% of the catalytic efficiency compared with mature M pro . As previously reported, the M pro N-terminal is fundamental for dimerization and any additional residues would reduce or even abolish its activity 9, [16] [17] [18] . As expected, C145S M pro has only shown residual activity (Fig. 1) . All three M pro constructs exhibited similar thermal-stability profiles, indicating similar folding (Fig. 1) .Analysis in solution using SEC-MALS suggests that M pro behaves as a dimer in the tested conditions, as expected 11 . For IMT M pro , the additional residues at N-terminal seem to prevent dimerization completely. For C145S M pro , however, the additional residues allow the protein to adopt multiple conformational states ranging from monomers to tetramers (Fig. 1) .Despite the site-direct mutagenesis of the C145S M pro , the enzyme exhibited residual proteolytic activity which allowed us to observe self-processing by SDS-PAGE in the course of two days. Despite the efficiency of M pro , its addition to the reaction does not seem to enhance significantly the rate of self-cleavage, suggesting cis-cleavage as main mechanism of N-terminal cleavage (Fig. 1 ).Crystal structure of M pro M pro was crystallized in several conditions and its X-ray structure was determined at 1. 46 Å in C21 space group. All 306 residues were refined at the electron density to a final Rwork/Rfree of 0.16/0.18, with 99% of Ramachandran in favored positions (Table S2 ). The crystal asymmetric unit contains one monomer which could be symmetry expanded to the biological dimer, following the same pattern of the majority of known structures deposited in PDB (r.m.s.d of 0.2 Å vs PDB 5RGG, for all Cα 306). The M pro protomers are formed by three domains (DI, DII and DIII), with its catalytic region located at the double-barreled DII 9 (Fig. S2 ).The crystal structure of IMT M pro at 1.6 Å was determined using 3 merged datasets ( Fig  S3, S4 , Table S1) in P212121 space group, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, packed in similar shape to the known biological unit of M pro . The structure was refined to a final R work /R free of 0.20/0.22, with 97% of Ramachandran in favored positions (Table S2 ). In the recent published structures of GM-M pro , both apo and ligand-complexes exhibited minor differences with the mature form 16 . However, in our structure there are distinguishable differences in the overall structure, especially in the position of DIII helices (Fig. 2) . Although IMT M pro asymmetric unit resembles the biological dimer form of native protein, PISA 19 analysis indicate that the dimer packing is unstable in solution, with an interface area of 1,256 Å 2 (vs 1,557 Å of M pro ), calculated free energy ΔG of -13.4 kcal/mol (vs -14.9 kcal/mol of M pro ) for 26 potential hydrogen bonds (vs 49 of M pro ) and 5 potential salt bridges (vs 10 of M pro ).While IMT M pro DI and DII are less affected by the N-terminal insertion (r.m.s.d of 0.34 Å vs Mpro mat for Cα of 1-184), DIII appears to adopt a more open conformation relative to M pro (r.m.s.d of 1.33 Å for Cα of 201-301) (Fig. 2) , with the interfacing residues Ala285 at a distance of 10 Å in the IMT M pro (vs 5.2 Å in M pro ) (Fig. S5 ). This conformation is more accentuated at chain A where the electron density of the N-terminal insertion is clearly visible in the model. For this chain, the N-terminal insertion pushes chain A helices αF and αH further of chain B active site, opening a cleft for Phe140 rises to the surface of the molecule, leading to major conformation alterations of the chain B active site souring residues, such as Glu166, Pro168 and Gln189 ( Fig. 2 and S6). The plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro active site was already reported when apo X-ray structures collected at cryo and room temperatures were compared 20 , and its expected given the broad spectrum of endogenous substrates that M pro is expected to process. However, the IMT M pro revealed major structural alterations in the oxyanion hole, likely affecting enzyme processing. Despite the significant changes of the active site, relative position of the catalytic dyad Cys145-His41 remains unchanged in this form (Fig. 2) .Recently, a small-fragment library of more than 1,250 unique fragments were screened against SARS-CoV-2 M pro , identifying 74 high-value fragment hits, including 23 non-covalent and 48 covalent hits in the active site, and 3 hits close to the dimerization interface 21 . In here, we applied the same technique to probe new druggable cavities in IMT M pro . Although the difference in scale of our experiment, we were able to identify five distinguishable sites in this form of the protein (Fig. 3) . Site #1 is the active site of chain A, in which fragment f2xe03 was identified interacting with Glu166 N and Cys145 S. Interesting, a unique cavity marked as Site #3 was identified in our experiments, bound to fragment f2xg02 by Arg4 main chain O. That cavity lies between the interface of chains A and B, and is not present in M pro which adopt a more closed conformation. This new site and fragment could serve as an anchor for development of new inhibitors targeting M pro dimerization process, a mode of action that was too date only theorized 22 . Details about data processing and statistics are given in Table S3 .The tetramer peaks were crystallized and X-ray structure determined at 2.8 Å and Rwork/Rfree of 0.20/0.24 (Table S2) , revealing a new crystal form in which N-terminal chain B residues are trimmed in the active site of chain A, occupying subsites S1-S5 (Fig. 4) . Despite the site directed mutagenesis of the catalytic cysteine to serine, electron density shows that Gln0 and Ser1 are noncovalently bound in the amino region, clearly indicating that the N-terminal cis-cleavage was completed. At the S1 subsite, Gln0 NE2 interacts with Glu166 OE1 by a hydrogen bound (2.7 Å), while Gln0 form interacts with Ser145 in the position of the native oxyanion hole (Fig. 4, Fig S8-S9 ). To accommodate the hydrophobic sidechain of Leu-1 at P2, Met49 and Met165 are pushed further of each other (Fig. S10 ), leading to a more opened groove of this subsite relatively to the apo-state, explaining the ability of this subsite to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic side chain residues, such as Leu, Met, Ile, Val and Phe 6, 23 . Yet, from the eleven endogenous recognition sites of coronaviruses, S2 Leu carrying sequences are the ones in which M pro display higher catalytic efficiency, highlighting the importance of this conformation for drug design. At subsites S3-S5, the interactions of Val-2, Ala-3 and Ser-4 are mainly maintained by hydrogen bounds between the polar residues of protein and peptide side chains (Fig. 4) , which explains the ability of M pro to recognize a large variety of chain sequences at those positions.The crystal structure of C145S M pro revealed another important step in the maturation process of M pro . At the same time that chain B N-terminal additional residues are processed by chain A, its C-terminal residues (301-306) are almost 180 o twisted from its original position (Fig. S11) and trimmed in the active site of a symmetric related chain B (Fig. 4) a phenomenon that was also recently described by another group in both native and in a C145A M pro mutant 24 . During this event, two C145A M pro dimers appear to be linked by the interaction of the C-terminal and a respective active site, assuming a tetrameric conformation (Fig. 5 ). Within the active site, Gln306 occupies the respective position of Gln0 at S1, while S2 is occupied by Phe305, increasing the distance between Met49 and Met165 relatively to chain A bound to N-terminal (Fig. S10) . As the N-terminal residues, subsites S3-S5 interactions with C-terminal are mainly maintained by hydrogen bounds between main chains (Fig 4) .M pro is firstly produced as the Nsp5 domain of the viral polyproteins before they are proteolytically processed into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins 12 . Immediately after translation, the immature form of M pro would contain both N and C-terminal insertions that need self-processing to generate the mature form of the enzyme 13 .The biochemical assays of IMT M pro revealed that a minor insertion at the N-terminal produces a protein form that behaves as a monomer in solution and its almost depleted of enzymatic activity, even though the general folding remains similar to the full mature form. The same process occurs to C145S M pro with native N-terminal inserted residues, although, in this case, a slow cleavage of the N-terminus results in the formation of dimers overtime (Fig. 1) . It is important to highlight that when M pro is added to C145S M pro , the N-terminal cleavage and dimer formation does not seem to be enhanced, strongly suggesting that this initial maturation step is a cis-cleavage event. This is in agreement with the model proposed by Li and colleagues (2010) in which two M pro form a transient dimer that is stabilized by the binding the N-terminal site of its substrate (another M pro in polyprotein) and further cleave to free its N terminus 14 .After the active site region is matured (or even concomitantly), dimeric M pro , C-terminal seem to assume an unusual twisted position (Fig. S11) , allowing it to be docked into the active site of another mature or half-mature M pro dimer (Fig. 4) . In this step, the trans-cleavage processing of the C-terminal residues would serve as an anchor for a transitory tetrameric state of the protein, herein captured with the construct of the mutant C145S M pro with the processing of the N-terminal residues (Fig. 5) . As a result, full mature M pro is produced and its ready to process other parts of the viral polyprotein. During all those maturation processes, both M pro active site and surface undergo significant conformational changes, which could guide targeted drug development ( Figures S1-S13Tables S1-S5References (25-48) Scheme S1 Overview of the tetrameric intermediary formed by C145S M pro during self-processing. Chain A is colored as yellow surface, chain B as cyan surface. Trans-cleavage M pro partner is show as green cartoon. N-terminal residues are depicted as blue spheres, and C-terminal residues are depicted as red spheres. The viral cDNA template (GenBank MT126808.1), kindly provided by Dr. Edison Durigon (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), was synthetized using the SCRIPT One-Step RT-PCR kit (Cellco Biotec) and random hexamers primers. For production of IMT M pro , coding region of M pro (residues 3264-3569) was amplified using primers: Fw 5' CAGGGCGCCATGAGTGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTC 3' and Rv 5' GACCCGACGCGGTTATTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGAC 3', and the sequence was inserted into the pET_M11 vector, which encodes an N-terminal 6xHis-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQ↓GAM), using the LIC method (25), forming the plasmid pET_M11-IMT-M pro . To obtain the mature form of M pro , native N-terminal residues (GAMSAVLQ↓SGFRK) were inserted into pET_M11-IMT-M pro by inverse PCR using primers: Fw: 5' GCTGCAGAGTGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTC 3' and Rv: 5' ACGGCTGACATGGCGCCCTGAAAATA 3'. Amplified product was treated with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK, Thermo Fischer Scientific) and T4 Ligase (Cellco Biotec), forming plasmid pET_M11-M pro . For C145S M pro construct, pET_M11-M pro was used as template for inverse PCR with primers Fw 5' CCTTAATGGTTCATCTGGTAGTG 3' and Rv 5' AATGAACCCTTAATAGTGAAATTGG 3'. The PCR product was digested with DpnI (NEB), followed by treatment with PNK and T4 DNA ligase, forming the pET_M11-C145S-M pro . All plasmids were transformed in DH5α E. coli competent cells. All PCRs were conducted with FastPol (Cellco Biotech). Positive clones were selected and confirmed by sequencing. Schematics of constructs are given in Fig. S1 .For protein production, E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with respective plasmids and cultured in ZYM-5052 (26) After expression, a large amount of IMT M pro had its 6xHis-tag cleaved by autoproteolytic process. The small fraction of 6xHis tagged protein was removed from the lysate using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The cleaved protein was purified by adding 1 M ammonium sulfate to the cell lysate followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/100 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. Purified fractions were aliquoted, flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C for enzymatic assays and crystallization. For crystallization, protein was concentrated to 14 mg.mL -1 using 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrators (Vivaspin, Sartorius). Protein concentrations were determined using the measured absorbances at 280 nm and the theorical extinction coefficient of 32,890 M -1 .cm -1 . Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1 ).M pro was purified similar to IMT M pro , with an additional step of cation exclusion chromatography. After the size exclusion chromatography, the protein was buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, and then injected into a Mono-Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl and 1 mM DTT. Finally, fractions containing the purified protein were buffer exchanged to gel filtration buffer. Purified fractions were aliquoted and protein was concentrated and quantified similarly to IMT M pro (Fig. S1 ).For C145S M pro , protein was purified by immobilized metal chromatography (IMAC) using a 5 mL HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). After column washing with buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Imidazole), protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. Sample was buffer exchanged using a 5 mL HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. To remove the 6xHis-tag, 2 mg of TEV protease and 4 mM DTT were added to the sample and incubated for 16 h at 4 ºC. Next day, non-cleaved protein and TEV were removed by a second step of IMAC in buffer A. Finally, the protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. Purified fractions were aliquoted, and protein was concentrated and quantified as described for other constructions (Fig. S1 ).Crystallization screening was performed with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 96 -well plates using a Phoenix Liquid Handling System-Gryphon LCP (Art Robbins Instruments) and commercially available kits at 20 °C. For M pro , crystals appeared after 1 day in 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 25% PEG 3,350, which were cryoprotected using the reservoir solution and 30% PEG 400. Crystals of IMT M pro were observed in several conditions. After optimization, crystals grown in 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 10% 2-propanol, 20% PEG Smear Low (BCS Screen, Molecular Dimensions) were used as seeds for the diffraction crystals, obtained in 0.1 M MES pH 6.7, 5% DMSO, 8% PEG 4,000 (21) . Crystals of C145S M pro were obtained after 3 days in 0.1 M phosphate/citrate, pH 5.5, 20% v/v PEG Smear High (BCS Screen, Molecular Dimensions).During the initial commissioning phase (July to October 2020) the MANACA (MAcromolecular Micro and NAno CrystAllography)(27) beamline adopted an emergency commissioning plan to deliver the basic instrumentation to perform data collection of SARS-CoV-2 related samples. Thus, during this period, the beamline has operated on a fixed-energy regime (9 keV) with manual crystal mounting, single-axis goniometry, beam flux estimated to be about 1·10 11 ph/s/10 mA at 9.15 keV and adjustable beam size from about 18 (h) x 20 (v) µm² to 100 (h) x 80 (v) µm² (FWHM). This project was the first external user session at MANACA beamline and the first operating beamline at Sirius (SIRIUS, Brazil). The focus was optimised to 61 (h) x 48 (v) µm² at sample position (Fig. S3) . Even without the full capabilities, the beamline opening was very important to SARS-CoV-2 structural biology studies.X-ray data for apo IMT M pro was collected from three isomorphous independent crystals, that were processed by XDS via autoPROC (28, 29) . Data herein was used for confirm reliability of the beamline (Fig. S5 and Table S1 ). Datasets were then scaled and merged using Aimless (30) , and the resulting dataset was used for structural determination of IMT M pro by molecular replacement with Phaser (31) using PDB 5RGQ as template. Model was refined with COOT(32) and BUSTER (33) at 1.6 Å and deposited under the code 7KFI.X-ray data for mature M pro and C145S M pro were processed by XDS via autoPROC (28, 29) and scaled using Aimless (30) . Mature M pro and C145S M pro were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (31) using template models 5RGQ and 7KFI, respectively. Mature M pro and C145S M pro were refined with COOT(32) and phenix.refine (34) , and are respectively deposited under the codes 7KPH (at 1.4 Å) and 7KVG (at 2.8 Å). Details of data processing parameters and statistics are given in Table S2 .For the fragment screening of IMT M pro , we used the settled plates fragment libraries of FragMAXlib (Talibov et al., to be published) and F2XEntry (35, 36) . In those plates, the content of each drop-well was resuspended in 1.0 µL of 0.1 M MES pH 6.7, 5% DMSO (v/v), 8% PEG 4,000 (w/v), 30% PEG 400 (w/v), and crystals were added afterwards. After 4 h soaking at room temperature, crystals were manually harvested and flash cooled for data collection.During the commissioning phase of MANACA, 166 of those crystals were tested, leading to 77 usable datasets. To analyze the data, a simplified version of FragMAXapp was configurated in our laboratory end-station computer. Within FragMAXapp, restrictions libraries were generated by phenix.eLBOW (37) using rm1 force field for geometry optimization, and datasets were processed through autoPROC/STARANISO or DIALS via XIA2 (28, 38, 39) . Molecular replacement and initial refinement were performed using DIMPLE (40) using PDB 7KFI as template. To highlight electron density of weak binding events, map averaging and statistical modelling were performed by PanDDA software (41) . Models were refined with COOT(32) and phenix.refine (34) . Details of data processing and refinement statistics are given in Table S3 .Activity assays All enzymatic assays were carried out using FRET-based substrate DABCYL-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-E(EDANS)-NH2 in assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). M pro , IMT M pro and C145S M pro assays were performed at final concentration of 0.14 μM, 0.3 µM and 0.3 µM, respectively. Prior to reactions, enzymes were incubated in assay buffer at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by substrate addition. To determine the kinetics parameters (Km, Vmax and kcat), the substrate was diluted to a range of concentrations from 100 μM to 0.78 μM. Initial velocity was derived from the slope of linear phase of each time-curse reaction, and Michaelis-Menten fitting was obtained using Origin Pro 9.5.1 Software (OriginLab). Fluorescence measures were performed in SpectraMax Gemini EM Microplate Reader with λexc/λemi of 360/460 nm, every 30 s over 60 min at 37º C. All assays were performed in triplicates.To test C145S M pro auto-cleavage activity, 6xHis-tagged C145S M pro was buffer exchanged in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Two reactions were prepared for comparison, one containing 10 µM C145S M pro and other containing 10 µM C145S M pro and 5 nM of mature M pro . Aliquots of each reactions were collected for the period of 40h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel.For differential scanning fluorimetry assays (DSF), SYPRO Orange at 5X final concentration was added to protein diluted to 25 μM protein in gel filtration buffer. Denaturation curves was obtained ranging temperature from 25°C to 75°C increasing one degree per cycle and fluorescence was measured in the end of each cycle. Experiment was conducted in a qPCR system Mx3000P (Agilent). The melting temperature was obtained using the Boltzmann fitting on Origin Pro 9.5.1 Software (OriginLab).The in solution oligomeric states of the purified samples were evaluated by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) in running buffer composed by 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and 100 mM NaCl. For that, 50 µL of each M pro construct at concentration of 10 µM were injected in a Waters 600 HPLC system (Waters) coupled in-line with an UV detector, a miniDAWN TREOS multi-angle light scattering apparatus (Wyatt Technology), a column Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare), and a refractive index detector Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technology). The light-scattering detectors were normalized with bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Data were collected and analyzed with the ASTRA 7 integrated software provided by Wyatt. The flow rate used was 0.5 mL/min. Results are summarized in Table S4 . Scheme S1. Schematic showing steps of SARS-CoV-2 M pro maturation process. The immature monomeric form of M pro form an intermediary dimer during cis-cleavage of N-terminal. With a mature N-terminal, the M pro is then transcleaved by the dimeric association with another dimer, producing full mature M pro . M pro chain A and B are shown in blue and salmon, respectively. N and C terminals are marked in green and blue, respectively. Polyprotein is shown as black lines.

After the initial outbreak, which occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [2] , the virus rapidly spread across China, and reached Europe and both Americas [3, 4] . On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic [2] , and the number of new cases and deaths are currently increasing around the world.Human coronaviruses typically cause respiratory and enteric infections [5] , and the main common reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnea, sore throat, headache, gastrointestinal issues, and neurologic symptoms, including altered mental status, ageusia, and anosmia [6] [7] [8] [9] . In this context, there are already studies showing psychiatric symptoms in people infected by COVID-19 [10, 11] . It is notable that mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety (ranging from 6 to 48.3%), have already been found in patients unaffected by COVID-19 [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] .The increasing menace of the COVID-19 pandemic, measurements of social distancing to avoid the spread of the virus, disrupted travel plans, and media information overload are some of the possible factors associated with this scenario [16] . Dissatisfaction with health information, a high risk of contracting COVID-19, high deaths number, low educational levels, and economic worries are other cited factors associated with poor mental health [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, both physical activity and physical fitness levels have an important role in managing mental health status [17] [18] [19] . In this direction, despite the concern about the mental health being a common problem to the whole world, it is possible that the severity of the problem differs between countries that have a different economic situation and that are facing the pandemic differently and, for this reason, are showing different results in terms of the number of cases and deaths [20] . In this vein, the comparison of mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic between countries can bring illuminating results on how the COVID-19 pandemic is able to compromise the health of unaffected people.In this sense, Switzerland and Brazil are two countries that are facing the pandemic quite differently, and consequently with a substantial differences in the number of cases and deaths. The number of confirmed cases in Brazil, up to September 2020, was more than three times higher (22, 196 per million) than the number of cases in Switzerland (6193 per million) [2] . The number of COVID-19 deaths is also three times higher in Brazil (676 deaths per million) than in Switzerland (242 deaths per million) [2] . The average economic status is also worse in Brazil, where the income per capita is $14,750, compared to the income per capita in Switzerland which is $56,580 [2] . Together, these particularities of each country can result in differences in both physical activity levels and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety symptoms) and physical activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic in a convenience sample from two countries (Brazil and Switzerland) that dealt with the pandemic in a different manner. Secondarily, we aimed to compare the restriction level adopted and the family income between participants from these two countries. The hypothesis of the present study was that there is a significant association between the country and the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms.All participants voluntarily gave their informed consent to participate in the study after having read the purpose of the study in the first section of the electronic survey. The study was approved in 12 June, 2020 by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo UNIFESP (Approval number: 4.073.442) and conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.Residents from Brazil and Switzerland were invited to participate through websites, e-mail, and social networks (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) of the involved researchers and institutions. The inclusion criteria included the following, participants had to be: (i) over 18 years old, and (iv) from urban regions in both countries. Participants who did not complete the questionnaire or answered it inappropriately were excluded from the survey. A convenience sample comprised of 114 participants (57 from Brazil and 57 from Switzerland) of both sexes (65 male and 49 female), from 28 to 85 years old, took part in this study.This was a cross-sectional study based on self-administered questionnaires applied from 2 to 12 June, 2020. Both countries were at different stages of national outbreaks according to the pandemic's progression. The recommendations for social distancing from the corresponding ministries of health in Brazil and Switzerland, at the time of data collection, were different as follows: The Brazilian government was implementing nationwide shutdowns of schools, universities, bars, restaurants, and commerce, while the Swiss government was reopening the country respecting physical distancing policies.The questionnaires were structured and shared using the digital platform Google she lives (open-ended question), and total family income measured in multiples of the minimum wage (less than 1 minimum wage, minimum wage between 1-2, minimum wage between 3-6, minimum wage between 7-10, more than 11 minimum wages). A minimum wage corresponds to less than 200 dollars US per month.The second section contained questions related to the current level of restriction on daily activities during the quarantine (taking complete measures of social distancing and did not go out to perform any activity, leaving only for essential non-work activities, leaving only for essential activities including work activities, and not taking any measures of social distancing), the number of days participants adopted social distancing measures in their own daily lives independently from their government's instructions (less than 30 days, between 30-60 days, more than 60 days).The third section was dedicated to physical activity level. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) proposed by the WHO in 1998 was used. This instrument has acceptable measurement properties to estimate physical activity levels with international validation results previously reported and validated for Brazilian Portuguese and German [2, 21] . According to the answers provided by the subject, the level of physical activity was classified initially into five categories, according to Matsudo et al. [22] : very active (those who perform vigorous activities 5 days per week and ≥30 min per session or vigorous activities ≥3 days per week and ≥20 min per session and moderate activities ≥5 days per week and ≥30 min per session), active (those who perform vigorous activities ≥3 days per week and ≥20 min per session; or moderate activities ≥5 days per week and ≥30 min per session; or any combined activity: ≥5 days per week and ≥150 min per week such as walking and moderate and vigorous), irregularly active A (those who perform physical activities but it is insufficient to be classified as active because it does not comply with the recommendations regarding frequency or duration), irregularly active B (those who perform physical activity but it is insufficient to be classified as irregularly active A because it does not comply with either the frequency or duration recommendations), and not active (those who do not perform any physical activity for at least 10 continuous minutes during the week). For data analysis purposes, irregularly active A and irregularly active B categories were grouped into a single irregularly active category. For analysis purposes, scores from 0 to 3 were assigned to activity levels, where 0 referred to the lowest level of activity (not active) and 3 to the highest level of activity (very active). After that, the IPAQ questionnaire was also used to assess the exercise routine in the period prior to quarantine and the recommended social distancing measures (prior to March, 2020). To analyze the effect of social distancing on the level of physical activity, a comparison between the two periods was performed. For analysis purposes, scores from −1 to 1 were assigned to the change in the level of physical activity between current and previous pandemic period, where −1 referred to a reduction in the physical activity level, 0 referred to no difference in physical activity level, and 1 referred to an increase in physical activity level.The fourth section aimed to screen mental health. We used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess the current symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. PHQ-9 is an instrument widely used to identify individuals at risk of depression and, in the current study, the validated PHQ-9 for Brazilian Portuguese and German [22, 23] was used. The PHQ-9 provides a final score ranging from 0 to 27. Scores less than 4 suggest a minimal depression, scores 5 to 9 suggest a mild depression, scores 10 to 14 suggest a moderate depression, scores 15 to 19 suggest a moderately severe depression, and scores 20 or greater suggest a severe depression. For analysis purposes, scores from 0 to 2 were assigned to the levels of depression, where 0 referred to the minimal depression, score 1 to mild depression and score 3 referred to moderate, moderate severe or severe depression. GAD-7 aims to identify possible generalized anxiety disorders and also has a validated Portuguese and German version [24] [25] [26] . The questionnaire provides a final score ranging from 0 to 21. Scores less than 4 suggest no anxiety disorder, scores 5 to 9 suggest a mild anxiety, scores 10 to 14 suggest a moderate anxiety, and scores 15 or greater suggest a severe anxiety disorder. For analysis purposes, scores from 0 to 2 were assigned to the anxiety symptoms, where 0 referred to the no anxiety disorder, score 1 to a mild anxiety and score 2 referred to moderate or severe anxiety disorder.According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, only the variables age, weight, and height presented a normal distribution. The Student's T-test was used to verify differences between the two countries according to age, body mass, and height. The measures of the effect size were calculated by dividing the mean difference by the standard deviation. The magnitude of the effect sizes was judged according to the following criteria: d = 0.2 was considered a 'small' effect size; 0.5 represented a 'medium' effect size; and 0.8 indicated a 'large' effect size [27] . To compare between the countries, a chi-square test was employed using the PHQ-9 score, GAD-7 score, IPAQ actual level, change in IPAQ level, educational level, restriction level, and social distancing duration. Data were grouped so that all expected frequencies were higher than five. Cramer's V was used as a measure of effect size for chi-square tests [28] . When data could not be grouped and there were expected frequencies lower than five, a Fisher test was employed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v 21.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). In all comparisons, p values < 5% were considered statistically significant.Participants from Brazil and from Switzerland presented no difference according to age, body mass, and body height (Table 1) . According to the analysis on participants' family income, in Switzerland, 100% of the respondents received the equivalent of more than $2000 per month, while in Brazil, only 38.5% of the respondents received an equivalent amount. In Brazil, 3.5% of the participants received up to $200, 5.5% received up to $400, 24.5% received up to $1200, and 28.0% received up to $2000. There was a higher frequency of Swiss residents than of Brazilian residents who received the equivalent of more than $2000 per month.The frequency of male participants was 54% for Brazil and 60% for Switzerland. There was no significant difference between countries in relation to the male and female participation in the present study (Table 2) . There was no association between the country and the social distancing duration that each participant had implemented in their daily life ( Table 2) . Of total participants, 8.8% (14.0% of the Brazilians and 3.5% of the Swiss) were taking complete measures of social distancing and did not go out to perform any activity, 41.2% (57.9% of the Brazilians and 24.6% of the Swiss) maintained partial restrictions, leaving only for essential non-work activities, 25.4% (26.3% of the Brazilians and 24.6% of the Swiss) maintained partial restrictions, leaving only for essential activities including work activities, and 24.6% (1.8% of the Brazilians and 47.4% of the Swiss) were not taking any measures of social distancing. There was a significant association between the country and the level of restriction (p < 0.001, and effect size = 0.56). There was a higher frequency of Swiss residents who were not taking any measures of social distancing (Table 2) .During the social distancing period, 8.8% (12.3% of the Brazilians and 5.3% of the Swiss) were not active, 10.5% (15.8% of the Brazilians and 5.3% of the Swiss) were irregularly active, 39.5% (31.6% of the Brazilians and 47.4% of the Swiss) were active, and 41.2% (40.4% of the Brazilians and 42.1% of the Swiss) were very active. There was no association between the country and the current physical activity level (Table 2) .Regarding the change in the physical activity level currently adopted compared to what was adopted before the pandemic period, 23.7% (31.6 of the Brazilians and 15.8% of the Swiss) reduced the physical activity level, 68.4% (63.2% of the Brazilians and 73.7% of the Swiss) maintained the physical activity level, and 7.9% (5.3% of the Brazilians and 10.5% of the Swiss) increased the physical activity level. There was no association between the country and the change in physical activity level ( 10 .5% (17.5% of the Brazilians and 3.5% of the Swiss) had moderate or severe anxiety. There was a significant association between the country and depression (p < 0.001, and effect size = 0.48) or anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001, and effect size = 0.43). Switzerland presented a higher frequency of people without symptoms of depression and anxiety than Brazil ( Table 2 ). The association between the restriction level and the depression or anxiety status were also studied. The results showed a significant association between the restriction level and depression symptoms (p = 0.01, and effect size = 0.25) but not with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.21, and effect size = 0.16) ( Table 3) .

The main findings of the present study according to the preliminary results were (i) Swiss participants presented a higher frequency of people without symptoms of depression and anxiety than Brazilian participants, (ii) Brazil was strongly associated with depression symptoms (effect size = 0.48) and anxiety symptoms (effect size = 0.43), (iii) currently physical activity level and the change in physical activity level were not different between the populations of the two countries, (iv) the restriction level was higher in Brazil compared to Switzerland, and (vi) the restriction level was moderately associated with depression symptoms (effect size = 0.25) and not associated with anxiety symptoms.The total number of people living with depression in the world was~322,000,000 (~4.4% of the global population) and with anxiety was~264,000,000 (~3.6% of the global population) in 2015. This number has been steadily increasing around the world in recent years [29, 30] . According to the data published by the WHO (2017), prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Brazil was 5.8% and 9.3%, respectively, and in Switzerland the prevalence of depression was 5.0% and anxiety 4.9%.The COVID-19 pandemic brought not only the risk of becoming seriously ill but also unbearable psychological pressure to the world's population [31, 32] . In this vein, the need to maintain social isolation to avoid the virus spread exacerbates the vulnerability of the population to psychological conditions. The present preliminary results showed that 22.8% of the Brazilian participants investigated by the current study presented a moderate or severe depression and 17.5% presented a moderate or severe anxiety. This frequency was significantly lower in the Swiss participants investigated in the current study, where 7% presented depression and 3.5% presented anxiety. The discrepancy between the two countries was even higher considering those who had no symptoms of depression (31.6% Brazilians and 78.9% Swiss) or anxiety (35.1% Brazilian and 77.2% Swiss). A higher prevalence of these mental diseases was expected to occur in low-and middle-income countries like Brazil [29] . Of all the present study participants, 100% of the Swiss and only 38.5% of the Brazilians received more than 2000 dollars per months. In 2017, the difference in the economic situation between the two countries was similar and the difference in mental health was much smaller (5.8% and 9.3% of the Brazilians presented depression and anxiety, respectively, and 5.0% and 4.9% of the Swiss presented depression and anxiety, respectively (WHO, 2017). Therefore, the current large difference in mental health symptoms cannot be attributed simply to the economic status of the two countries, despite the importance of this variable.According to the restriction level, there were significant differences between the two countries. In the Swiss sample, there was a much higher frequency (47.4%) of people who were living without adhering to social distancing than in the Brazilian sample (1.8%). Therefore, this difference could explain in some manner the anxiety and depression symptoms between the two countries, which requires a more careful analysis of this possible bias. The frequency of anxiety symptoms was significantly higher in the Brazilian than in the Swiss sample. This higher frequency of anxiety symptoms could be associated with the greater level of restriction that the Brazilians were experiencing. However, as there are no significant association between the level of restriction and the symptoms of anxiety, we can conclude that the different levels of restriction did not influence the anxiety symptoms. The same analysis was also performed with respect to the symptoms of depression. The results showed that there was a significant association between the level of restriction and the frequency of depression symptoms and Cramer's V value was 0.22. However, when the level of association between the countries' samples and the frequency of depression was studied, the Cramer's V value was 0.48. Thus, it can be observed that there was a greater level of association of depression with the country sample than with the level of restriction. Therefore, despite the higher level of restriction of Brazilians was influencing the higher frequency of depression symptoms in this population, it cannot totally explain the association between country and depression symptoms.Differences according to the age or sex of the volunteers, knowing factors that could influence the mental health [12, 13, 33] , are not difference between Brazilian and Swiss sample, therefore these factors are not influencing the countries mental health differences.It is known that regular physical activity can minimize the risk of developing depression [34] ; therefore, differences in this level or differences according to the changes in the physical activity level could influence the prevalence of mental illnesses. However, the preliminary present results showed no difference between Brazilians and Swiss residents according to their physical activity level or according to the change in physical activity level adopted during the pandemic period. However, it is possible that the small sample size was not sufficient to evidence a significant difference between the groups.Besides the points discussed above that may be associated with mental disorders, there are many other stressors related to the symptoms of anxiety and depression, such as dissatisfaction with health information, high risk of contracting COVID-19, lower hospital beds available, low economic status, and high unemployment rate, that are also considered risk factors for mental health [12] [13] [14] . In Brazil, there is a great divergence of information about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic provided by the Health Ministry and the Republic President, which can leave the population confused about the quality of the information received [35] . In addition, divergent information can also decrease preventive care by the population (mask use, hygiene care, social distancing, etc.), increasing the contamination risk. In fact, the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases is 22,196 per million in Brazil and 6193 per million in Switzerland by September, 2020 [2] . This situation is even more serious in Brazil since the number of hospital beds (per 1000 inhabitants) is 1.95 in Brazil and 3.57 in Switzerland. Corroborating this scenario, the number of COVID-19 deaths is also much higher in Brazil compared to Switzerland, which presents 676 deaths per million, while Switzerland presents 242 deaths per million [2] .Apart from these potential risk factors for mental health, there are broad differences in the economic situation of the two countries. The total expenditure on health per capita is $1318 in Brazil and $6468 in Switzerland. Moreover, the income per capita is $14,750 in Brazil, and $56,580 [2] in Switzerland. In the same direction, the unemployment rate is also a bigger problem in Brazil than in Switzerland. Despite both countries presenting an increase in the unemployment rate, it will rise to 4% in Switzerland (from 2.3% in 2019) and to 13.3% in Brazil (from 11.9% in 2019). Therefore, the higher number of cases and deaths by COVID-19, the lower number of hospital beds, the poorer economic conditions, and the higher unemployment rate may be contributing to the comparatively worse mental health of Brazilians. However, further studies are needed to clarify why the mental health of Brazilians was more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than that of the Swiss. Considering that the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a large economic and social disruption and political crisis, it is expected that the populations of more vulnerable and under-developed country like Brazil will suffer more than a stable country like Switzerland.A limitation of the present study is that it was a cross-sectional study, and the answer about the level of physical activity adopted before the COVID-19 pandemic was answered retrospectively. In addition, the questionnaire was applied in both countries in the same month (first half of June 2020), but the phase in which each country was in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic was different, which might have influenced the outcomes achieved. Moreover, some possible confounding factors, such as: information on marital status, households (i.e., living alone, with children), race, and ethnicity were not asked to the volunteers.Another limitation is the sample size. Although the sample size was sufficient to identify a significant difference between the two groups for the main variables of the present study (i.e., anxiety and depression), it may not represent the total population of Brazil or Switzerland. Therefore, it is important to note that these are preliminary results and caution should be taken when generalizing the results for the entire countries' population, particularly for groups with different characteristics from the samples evaluated in the present study.Despite these limitations, these preliminary results showed a large percentage of people presenting symptoms of both anxiety and depression highlighting the need of further investigations with larger sample sizes. The world is not yet free from COVID-19 and currently many European countries are restricting daily lives again against a new increase in the number of cases.In conclusion, despite the limitations, the preliminary results showed that the mental health of Brazilians residents is more compromised than that of Swiss residents, and this difference is not related to physical activity levels. Although the level of social isolation adopted by the two countries is impacting the results, it is not the main reason for the mental health difference between the evaluated countries.

Inequalities lead to pandemics having uneven impacts throughout the world 1 . Understanding the risk of death from COVID-19, both as an individual and within communities, is crucial for adopting new behaviours. Health authorities need to implement sustainable change in health systems to reduce health inequalities 2 .In Brazil, where significant socio-economic differences exist (Gini coefficient in 2018 = 53. 9, 9 th highest in the world) 3 , the evidence of an association between the socio-economic characteristics and COVID-19 mortality remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in Brazil.Data were obtained from the national surveillance system.This study is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 hospitalised adult patients in Brazil. Data were extracted from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe), the national surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), which was established after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic by the Ministry of Health, and is the main repository of notifications of COVID-19 hospitalisations (see Table S1 in the supplementary material) 4 . Notification is mandatory and each observation includes patient demographic information, such as age, sex, self-reported race (or skin colour), self-reported level of education, region of residence, self-reported symptoms and comorbidities, use of respiratory support, date of onset of symptoms, date of hospital admission, date of intensive J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f care unit (ICU) admission and date of outcome (i.e. hospital discharge or death) 5, 6 .Brasil.IO 7 , a consortium that compiles epidemiological forms from the Health Secretaries of each state.We included all patients who (i) were admitted to hospital between 16 February and 8August 2020, (ii) were aged ≥20 years and (iii) had a positive quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. Individuals with only serological or clinicalepidemiological diagnoses were excluded. The current analysis considered only COVID-19 adult hospitalisations with a defined outcome (i.e. hospital discharge or death).The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results were also stratified by sociodemographic factors, with a focus on self-reported race (or skin colour), which was originally defined in the data dictionary as White (Branca), Black (Preta), Brown (Parda), Asian (Amarela) or Indigenous (Indígena) 6 .The associations between sociodemographic characteristics and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 adult patients were evaluated. A multivariable analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sociodemographic variables on in-hospital mortality, adjusting for clinically relevant characteristics, such as sex, age and comorbidities. The main analysis was based on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f complete-case data, computing the odds ratios (ORs) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each variable. In the SIVEP-Gripe system, although several variables are mandatory, others have the 'Ignored' option. Some variables present a considerable amount of missing information, such as comorbidities, self-reported race and level of education. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by considering missing or ignored values as a single 'Not reported' category in the multivariable analysis.All analyses were performed using version 4.0.2 of the R programming language, with the 'tidyverse' packages 8 : 'dplyr', 'tidyr' for data wrangling and 'broom' for model analysis. presented with at least one comorbidity (Table 1) . Most patients were from the South and Northeast regions of Brazil (57% and 20%, respectively) and almost half were educated up to high school (45%, 34,964/78,511). Total in-hospital mortality was 37% (85,171/228,196) ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ). In-hospital mortality peaked in weeks 18-20 (almost 40%) and then decreased until the end of the study period ( Figure S1 ). In-hospital mortality for Black/Brown patients was higher than for White patients during all time periods ( Figure S1 ). Black/Brown and Indigenous patients had a higher in-hospital mortality (42% and 43%, respectively) than White and Asian patients (37% and 39%, respectively) (Table 1, Figure 2 ). In terms of age and number of comorbidities, Indigenous and Black/Brown patients showed higher in-hospital mortality, except for patients with more than three reported comorbidities, where the mortality in Asian patients was higher ( Figure 2 , Table S3 ). Regarding the level of education, illiterate patients showed the highest in-hospital mortality (>50%); this was especially true for Black/Brown patients with low education levels ( Figure 2 , Table S3 ).Complete cases for in-hospital mortality and the sociodemographic variables are reported.The association between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality was evaluated. In the complete-case multivariable analysis (Table S4 , Figure 3 ), the sociodemographic variables remained associated with in-hospital mortality, even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities. The results were similar when considering missing or ignored values as a single 'Not reported' category in the sensitivity analysis (Table S5 ).Variables were adjusted for the presence of nine comorbidities: cardiovascular, diabetes, renal, neurologic, hematologic, hepatic, chronic respiratory disorder, obesity, and immunosuppression. Self-reported race (or skin colour) is originally defined in data dictionary as White (Branca), Black/Brown (Parda), Asian (Amarela), Indigenous (Indígena). Complete cases for in-hospital mortality are reported.Considering the results of complete cases, only Black/Brown race (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22) was associated with increased mortality. A higher risk of mortality was related to education levels lower than College/University, especially the illiterate (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.58-1.98) and Up to High School level (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.4-1.65) groups. Increased mortality was also seen in the residential regions in the North (OR 2.76; 95% CI 2.45-3.1) and Northeast (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.86-2.26) of Brazil.The relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and mortality of 228,196 COVID-19 hospitalised patients in Brazil was evaluated. Racial differences in the use of health services and outcomes were observed. Black/Brown and Indigenous patients were admitted less frequently to ICU and were more intubated, especially outside the ICU, compared with White and Asian patients. Furthermore, Black/Brown race was associated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with high in-hospital mortality after adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, level of education and residential region.Race, educational level and region of residence presented different risks of mortality.These variables highlight the wider social determinants of health, differences in access to health care and the quality of care throughout Brazil. Race and educational level are strong predictors of mortality. Historically, many Black/Brown communities, with limited access to education, living in poor areas, especially in the North and Northeast regions of the country, also have the lowest access to healthcare services 9 . These populations are more likely to have chronic conditions, which increases their risk of COVID-19-associated mortality 1 . However, even when considering the underlying comorbidities, the effects of sociodemographic factors remained. Previous studies have not found a significant association between race and COVID-19 mortality in the US [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, an ecological analysis in UK participants noted a robust association between non-White race and COVID-19 mortality 14 . The effect of race on COVID-19 mortality in Brazil may be related to the social inequity presented in the country 15 , but also to the colonial heritage and the structural racism that is frequently not admitted by Brazilian elites or policymakers.In terms of Brazilian regions, the presence of higher mortality in the North and Northeast regions may be related to several aspects. First, there was a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in these regions 16 As the global economy gets into an economic crisis, funding allocation must aim to reduce inequalities rather than exacerbate them. Public health decision-makers must ensure that prevention activities prioritise communities and racial groups that are most impacted by COVID-19. Much of the racial inequalities are not related to biology, but to socio-economic disadvantages that ethnic minorities face (e.g. deprivation, lack of opportunities and societal oppression) 19 . In Brazil, Black/Brown individuals with low education levels who live in the most impoverished regions are the most impacted by COVID-19 and require special attention. Regular income support to low-income households, access to testing, proactive contact tracing, emphasis on home diagnosis and care, providing shelter to the homeless and improving health care access to vulnerable communities have the potential to reduce the burden of short-and long-term morbidity and mortality 20, 21 .This study presents strengths and limitations. Although the notifications of COVID-19 hospitalisations in the SIVEP-Gripe system are mandatory, we cannot ensure that all of Brazil's hospitalised cases are covered in this study. However, data were retrieved from the national surveillance system, which is the principal repository of COVID-19 hospitalisations nationwide. Second, a significant amount of data were missing or 'not reported' due to the data collection and manual entry in the system, which may be aggravated by the increased volume of patient data requiring to be entered by physicians. However, a large amount of information was provided and a sensitivity analysis was performed by categorising the missing values and adding them to the model. Third, only RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases were evaluated, which is the main testing procedure for hospitalised COVID-19 patients; however, this likely lead to a study sample with more severe cases enrolled in the SIVEP-Gripe system. It is important to note that serological/clinical-epidemiological tests are also used for diagnosis, especially in regions with low health care resource availability.In Brazilian COVID-19 hospitalised adults, Black/Brown patients showed higher inhospital mortality, less frequently used hospital resources and had potentially more severe conditions than White patients. Therefore, public health decision-makers should ensure that prevention activities prioritise these population groups, providing regular income support to low-income households, access to testing and shelter to the homeless, in addition to improving health care access in the most vulnerable communities.Not required.

This possibility is explored here by using a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) that is trained to predict virus outbreaks for a geographic region. It learns from multivariate time series of signals obtained from a novel set of massive online surveys about COVID-19 symptoms. Once trained, the neural ODE is able to capture the dynamics of the interlinked local signals and accurately predict the number of new infections up to two months in advance. Moreover, it can estimate the future effects of changes in the number of infected at a given time, which can be associated with the flow of people entering or leaving a given region or, for instance, with a local vaccination campaign. This work gives compelling preliminary evidence for the predictive power of widely distributed social media surveys for public health applicationDuring a pandemic, the ability to identify and forecast local virus outbreaks is key in order for health officials to take appropriate action. However, the intrinsic parameters that represent the biological properties of the virus, used by the predicting models, can only be estimated once the pandemic has occurred. While a pandemic is happening, parameter estimation carries a large degree of uncertainty, meaning that the first principles models that use them inherit this uncertainty in their predictions. An epidemiologist recently pointed out in the New York Times 1 : ""You tell me what numbers to put in my equations, and I'll give you the answer ... But you can't tell me the numbers, because nobody knows them..."" , a statement that illustrates the difficulties that currently exist in predicting new infections during a pandemic.A large amount of data is being generated, directly or indirectly, related to the spread of the virus, on various spatial and temporal scales. Sources include social media, mobile phone GPS, and mobile fitness devices, with other tools such as contact tracing or contact simulations 2 . It is clear that it is necessary to include this information in the first principles models or combinations with data-driven models 3,4 through a learning process or optimization.In this work we investigate the predictive power of data-driven models using survey data related to COVID-19 captured through Facebook. Signals in function of time are extracted from the data for a given geographic region. They are obtained after processing the survey by extracting numerical indicators (signals) from questions related to people's symptoms, infections among their social circle, visits to the hospital, quantity of on-line searches about COVID-19, average time away from home and more related questions. For instance, a person response about how many of his friends tested COVID positive will be somehow correlated with the new infected cases in his region.There is no clear first principles model for connecting the factors of the survey with the COVID-19 statistics. However, it is reasonable to expect that the local variation in time of the survey responses for a region is correlated with new virus infections in that region. Moreover, these signals have the potential of being early indicators 5 , as they are not subject to intrinsic delays related to the officially reported variables, local policies or testing capacities.In order to learn this relation, a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) 6 was used to parameterize the signals rate of change. This object uses a parameterized universal approximator in order to represent all possible phase space dynamics with a finite set of parameters that can be learned on the training data. In this work the neural ODE is trained on these potential early indicators and is able to predict virus outbreaks even two months in advance. Moreover, once trained, these phase space methods allow for forecasting possible future scenarios.Since April 2020 universities and public health officials, in collaboration with Facebook, have been conducting a massive daily survey to monitor the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The survey 7 is an ongoing operation that is advertised through Facebook's platform and is taken by nearly 55,000 people every day. Respondents provide information about COVID-related symptoms, contacts, prior medical conditions, risk factors, mental health, demographics and the economic effects of the pandemic. The information allows researchers to examine countylevel trends across the US. Around 16 million responses have been collected so far.The survey has four sections and it contains 35 questions. The first section gathers information about a set of symptoms used to define a condition called COVID-like illness (CLI), defined as fever of at least 100°F , along with shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or a cough 8 . Two key quantities are estimated with this information, for a given location and day:1. the percentage of people with CLI, 2. the percentage of people who know someone in their local community with CLI illness (CLI-incommunity).The second section gathers more details on testing, symptoms, and medical-seeking behavior. The third section collects info on contacts and risk factors, and the fourth section on demographics. A sample of the exact questions asked can be found in the Supplementary Materials. Numerical indicators (signals) are extracted from the set of questions 7 that results in a set of time series (one for each indicator), for a given location. The aggregated data is publicly available on the Delphi Group websites 9 , 10 .A person normally experiences viral symptoms before seeking a COVID-19 test or medical care. Therefore, data related to how many people are self-reporting CLI symptoms in a given location could potentially give an early indicator of COVID activity in that location. Moreover, the data is not subject to reporting delays, unlike formal testing metrics of confirmed daily COVID-19An analysis that provides evidence that the surveybased CLI signals can be early indicators of COVID activity is provided in the Delphi Group 11 where it is shown that the ""CLI-in-community"" signal rises alongside confirmed COVID-19 cases. Indeed, more people report that others are sick in their community at times when COVID-19 tests confirm more cases. Interestingly, the indicator begins to rise steeply days before COVID-19 cases begin their steep ascent. This analysis is an informal way of looking at the recall of the indicator and opens up the possibility of using these kind of noisy and indirect signals as early indicators of new cases.Although the survey cannot be used to draw definite conclusions about the true prevalence of coronavirus disease in the studied region, changes in self-reported symptoms over time could still be a meaningful reflection of the changes in coronavirus infections over time and therefore could help predicting changes in the number of new infected cases that will happen some days into the future.The use of these signals for the prediction of new cases could be done by means of a model that relates the rate of variation of the different indicators to the model's state variables. However, unlike the case of common epidemiological models, the deduction of a quantitative expression that relates the new cases as a function of the different signals extracted from the surveys is far from obvious. Even if the relations were found and the model described for example as an ordinary differential equation system, it would surely have unknown parameters involved and would be subject to uncertainties. Taking advantage of the amount of data and indicators obtained from the surveys, a data driven approach would be a logical alternative to obtain a model for predicting the new infected cases for a geographical region.Therefore, for a specific region, we define a vector with a suitable set of indicators / variables as components (among them the number of new cases) and define the model via a function that approximates the temporal evolution of this vector. With such a function, the number of new cases is expressed as function of time and thus a prediction could be made. For example, in the case of the classic SIR compartment model 12 , the vector components are the variables number of suspectible individuals (S), the number of infected individuals (I) and the number of recovered individuals (R) and their temporal variation expressed with via an ordinary differential equation based on intuition and qualitative knowledge of the dynamics of contagions. But for the case of the vector formed with the surveys indicators as components, since it is not clear how to define the relationship between them from first principles, we cannot directly define such a model.Given the lack of a known function form, we turn to the neural ODE 6 as a way to directly derive the differential equation from data. A Neural ODE is a neural network parametrization of an ordinary differential equation which allows for learning the dynamics of any possible dynamical system due to the universal approximation theorem 13, 14 (assuming a sufficiently large neural network). In particular, we represent our dynamical system via:where N N is a neural network given by weights θ. This neural network has an explicit t dependence since it is parameterized based on the time-dependent input signals from the data. The goal is to learn the underlying dynamics of change. The ""forward pass"" through a neural ODE is equivalent to solving an initial value problem where y(t 0 ) is the input features and we replace handcrafted equations with a neural network. A single forward pass gives us an entire trajectory. In contrast to other architectures used for time series like residual neural networks (RNNs) 15 , this model is continuous in time, allowing for incorporating non-uniform data and predictions. The parameters of the neural ODE are learned from the data as diagrammed in Figure 1 . The learning process is performed by minimizing the following loss functionwith respect to the networks parameters θ. Here, y data (t i ) represents the multivariate time series as a vector whose components are the values from the chosen set of signals at time t i while y(t i ) is given by the numerical solution to Equation 1. Minimization is performed by gradient-based local methods, specifically ADAM 16 . Thus in order to perform the minimization the gradient of the loss function with respect to all parameters θ must be computed. Given the large Lipshitz constants seen due to rapid changes during the onset of the growth, the adjoint technique of the original neural ODE publication is potentially unstable on the case of interest [17] [18] [19] , and thus we opted for stabilized techniques which avoid reverse solving 20,21 .The raw signals for each USA State were downloaded using the Delphi Group API 7,10 . A smoothing was performed via a cubic spline interpolation for all the signals/indicators 22 time series. The 7-day averaged of reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases was used as the main indicator of interest 23 for accounting for the new cases. We chose the following set of variables as components in order to build the state vector y(t) for each location:1. New daily cases (7 day averaged), The resultant multivariate time series were split into two sets, a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to update the weights θ in the network while the validation set was used for monitoring over-fitting and training generalization. Training was performed using a mini-batched 24 form of multiple shooting [25] [26] [27] which involved computing the loss between intervals of data points. Specifically, a data point was randomly selected to be the initial condition and the neural ODE was solved from the point y i at time t i to time t i+1 with the Tsit5 method 28 using the DifferentialEquations.jl implementation 29 to get the prediction for the next point y(t i+1 ). This was then compared to the true data point y data . The loss was calculated as the mean squared error (MSE) between the true point y data and the predicted point y(t) (see eq. 2). Backpropogation was performed using the adjoint implementations of the DiffEqFlux.jl library 3 .The neural networks used for parameterizing the ODE consisted of four interconnected layers with 64 , 32 , 16 and 8 neurons each and swish activation functions 30 .Once the weights of neuronal net (θ) are found, the network defines the rate for the temporal evolution of the state variables (See eq. 1). Note that such an equation can be solved beyond the training interval to assess its ability to accurate forecast. It is expected that this prediction will deteriorate as it moves further in phase space from the training data, nonetheless we will show that there will be a highly predictive time frame.The model (the neural ODE), once it learnt the dynamics from the local signals, is capable of obtaining a prediction of new contagions, but also allows studying possible future scenarios in the event of signal disturbances. For example, if there is an abrupt change in the number of new cases in a given time, the model can predict the effect on the forecast without having to be re-trained. This translates into changing the initial condition in the integration and can be used to estimate forecasting errors due to uncertainty in the signal related to the current number of cases. Figure 5 demonstrates a projection which includes such uncertainty in current epidemic statistics.Moreover, a change in the number of infected can be for instance due to the flow of people traveling in or out of the location, which would result in an overall perturbation in the number of infected. Figure 6 showcases the differing levels of the predicted peak with respect to different choices for the amount of migration. The change and its consequences can be estimated by looking at the perturbed solution. This opens the possibility, for locations with strict closed borders to be able to predict the effect of the flow of people on the curve of infected. Moreover, the effects of vaccination in the region could also be estimated in this way .Using multivariate time series associated with a geographic region, obtained by quantifying indicators from massive online surveys on COVID symptoms offered through the Facebook platform, we show how a neural ODE is able to learn the dynamics that connect these variables and detect virus outbreaks in the region. Analyzing data from different US states, we show that the neural ODE is capable of predicting up to sixty days into the future in different kinds of virus spreading environments.We show that once it learnt the dynamics of the local signals/variables, the neural ODE is capable of not only forecasting new contagious in the region but also analyzing possible future scenarios in the case of abrupt changes in the number of infected in a given day, for example due to transit of people to or from the analyzed region or to a vaccination campaign. This opens the possibility for locations with strict closed borders, to be able to predict the effect of the flow of people on the curve of infected and thus design policies accordingly in a controlled way 35 . Likewise, it could be useful for the design of the strategies of vaccination campaigns.The neural ODE was trained with data from a single location (state), however it would be expected that the dynamics that connects the local signals in one region will have similar attributes in another. Thus it would be interesting to explore different training schemes, where the model also learns from other regions. Including graphical models into the neural ODE, possibly via graph neural networks, is a compelling avenue for future research.It is possible to combine this class of data-driven models with first principles models such as compartment models with a scientific machine learning approach 21 . If one region is describable with an analytical model and another is not, but signals can be extracted from it, a hybrid model for the combined region can be designed, with first principles for the first region and with a trained neural ODE for the second.This work represents a first step, a proof of concept. It is necessary to explore different signals and combinations, and compare its generalization capabilities. Accurate usage of the uncertainty quantification also needs much more research before being deployed in public health scenarios. Still, these results showcase promising results for future real-time forecasting from predictive social media data.The code supporting the current study have not been deposited in a public repository because is part of an ongoing research.

The Ministry of Health reported the first COVID-19 case in the country on March 3rd, and several epidemic control measures quickly followed [40, 41] . Less than three weeks following the first reported case, the government had announced the closure of schools and universities, national night curfews, border controls, closure of non-essential businesses, and a strategy of localized lockdowns starting March 22 in seven municipalities. In mid-May, Greater Santiago (~40% of the Chilean population) was put under lockdown, and by mid-June, half the population in Chile was under lockdown [40] . Research suggests that these mitigation strategies significantly slowed down epidemic growth [42] but generated a large drop in mobility and economic activity [6, 43] . The reduction in economic activity does not affect all social groups in the same way, which calls for research on the impact on vulnerable populations such as those in informal settlements.We base our analysis on a three-wave panel (longitudinal) study of households living in Chile's informal settlements. The baseline was conducted in person in August 2019 (n=5,622). We conducted two telephone follow-up surveys with a representative subsample of 990 individuals in May and September 2020. The second panel (May) occurred when the government began implementing stay-at-home orders in many urban areas. We conducted the third panel in September when the government began relaxing some of the stricter control measures. The data allows us to compare individuals' socioeconomic situation in informal settlements before the pandemic and at the beginning and the end of the period when strict regulations were implemented.The article provides granular data about the changes in the socioeconomic situation of informal settlements during the pandemic. Our findings show that informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their employment loss is substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, even compared to individuals with low educational levels. We also document that the immigrant population has been particularly affected during this health crisis. We complement this finding by describing the change in participation in government programs and the level of collaboration between neighbors that could potentially attenuate the consequences of employment loss among this particular group of the population.The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some contextual information on informal settlements in Chile. Section 3 describes the data and methods used. Section 4 presents the main findings of the data analysis. Section 5 discusses the findings and suggests some policy implications.Relative to other Latin American countries, Chile has a small number of informal settlements. According to a cadaster conducted by the Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo (44) (Ministry of Housing, MHU) in 2019, there are 802 informal settlements in Chile with 47,050 households. However, there is evidence that the number of settlements has rapidly increased in the pandemic [45] . The MHU defines these places as ""precarious settlements of eight or more households that inhabit on a piece of land that they possess irregularly, without at least one of three basic services (electricity, water, and sewer), and where all the housing units composed a defined social and territorial unity"". The number of informal settlements has been growing in the last decade, from 657 in 2011 to 802 in 2019 [44] . Most of this increase has occurred in the country's northern region, which is likely explained by an accelerated migration from neighboring countries in the last years. Many low-income individuals find a place to live in an informal settlement to transition to better opportunities in the country. 73% of all informal settlements in Chile are located in urban areas.The military dictatorship (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) ) that followed Allende's government took an aggressive approach toward informal settlements. The land invasions were particularly problematic for an administration that put a high value on private property to implement a market-oriented economic transformation. Thousands of families were forced to move to low-income, segregated housing projects located in the periphery of Chile's urban areas [47] . A large-scale socioeconomic urban segregation pattern became the dominant reality of Chile's urban development. This socioeconomic spatial segregation persists until today.Since 1990, democratic governments have addressed housing deficits through a large-scale housing policy that, to a significant extent, has maintained the institutional architecture of the dictatorship [50, 51] .A substantial portion of low and middle-income individuals have obtained access to formal housing through government programs, including many former residents of informal settlements. From a quantitative perspective, the success of the policy regime implemented since the 1990s in Chile is clear.However, a substantial failure of Chile's housing policy has been the agglomeration of low-income individuals in segregated urban areas [52] [53] [54] .Chile has set up a policy scheme that has provided a substantial portion of informal settlers with a formal housing unit that they own [39] . However, the number of informal settlements has been growing in the past decade [49] . This growth, particularly in the north of Chile, may be partly explained by a growing influx of low-income migration from neighboring countries. Another reason relates to the dramatic increase in the price of urban land in many Chilean cities, which makes the government's subsidies ineffective [49] . Housing quality and location have become increasingly important for families living in informal settlements [39] . Recent studies have suggested that for some essential dimensions of urban welfare, households living in informal settlements have access to a better geography of opportunities than those living in low-income housing projects where they own their dwellings [55, 56] . These improved opportunities may reveal a mismatch between the government's housing options for the low-income population and the actual expectations of those seeking access to formal housing, including those living in informal settlements.We collected data in collaboration with TECHO-Chile (Techo), the Chilean branch of the largest Latin American non-governmental organization working with residents of informal settlements in the region. households. The second wave was implemented in September and reached a total of 703 households from the first wave. Therefore, we built a panel of 703 individuals that were surveyed at three different moments over eleven months. Table 2 examines the balance across the three waves. The attrition rate was around 29% from wave two to wave three. However, based on the observable characteristics identified in 2019, the three waves are not significantly different in almost all observable categories (see supplementary material Table S2 ).We aim to measure the changes in a set of outcomes over time. We exploit the individual-level panel data to analyze how each of the outcomes has changed over time. We estimate equation (1) as follows:Where 1 and 2 are our coefficients of interest and represent the change in the outcome observed in May and September, 2020 respectively. In most specifications, we include an individual fixed effect ( ) that controls for all time-invariant characteristics that may affect the different outcomes. We also discuss the robustness of the results to the inclusion of individual fixed effects. We analyze the evolution over time of outcomes related to employment status, cooperation among neighbors, and government assistance.We carefully compare our results to different population groups from the ENE-Survey. ENE is the main employment survey run by Chile's National Institute of Statistics, and we exploit individual microdata to examine the employment evolution during the same period. ii We further examine the results for a particular subset of individuals available in the sample. In particular, we look at whether or not the results are driven by some underlying conditions related to informal dwellers that make them particularly vulnerable to the type of crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.We present two sets of results that allow us to provide robust information about the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on informal settlements. The first set refers to the observed changes in employment status over time, where we can examine their magnitude relative to other estimates obtained from national population surveys. Here we find a dramatic employment loss among informal dwellers during the pandemic, which is significantly larger than the labor decline in the general population. We complement this finding by examining changes in cooperative behavior among neighbors and the magnitude of the government policy take-up rate, which may ameliorate the economic impact suffered by individuals in the settlements. Although our information does not allow us to assess the overall change in economic wellbeing, we detect some responses oriented to reduce the dramatic loss in employment. Table 1 summarizes the evolution of employment status. We compare coefficients under different model specifications. Columns (1) and (2) show results from a pooled cross-section model, while column (3) shows our preferred specification, including individual fixed effects. The results are remarkably robust across specifications. Post-1 and Post-2 capture the change in employment status observed in May and September 2020, respectively, compared to the pre-pandemic period in August 2019. After the pandemic, labor participation in the informal settlements drops 30 percentage points (Table 1, (Table 1 , column 3, Post-2, p<0.01), from a pre-pandemic level of 75 percent.These lockdowns may affect people differently, depending on the district where they live [6] . Although one can imagine several reasons why these two populations may differ, such as the type of employment, the magnitude of the difference shows that unemployment affected informal dwellers more severely.We further examine the extent to which the larger drop in employment can be explained with some observable attributes of informal dwellers that have been more affected by the pandemic at the national level. Figure 2A examines whether the large proportion of immigrants living in informal settlements may account for the larger employment loss. Figure 2B shows the employment impact disaggregated by gender.The COVID-19 pandemic has altered everyday life dramatically for most of the world's population, imposing new costs, restrictions, and risks on everyday life. These changes also affect individuals living in informal settlements, but their options to cope with these changes are worse. This study's empirical evidence of the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in informal settlements shows a grim situation.Compared to the baseline in August 2019, our results showed a dramatic drop in employment status in May and September 2020. This drop was more extensive for settlement dwellers than for the rest of the population and also when compared to individuals with low education (a proxy for low income) in the same districts. Our analysis shows that the pandemic has triggered some level of neighborhood cooperation on some basic needs, but that cooperation has decreased over time. Last, we describe the number of informal households that have received assistance from the government, which has increased during the pandemic but has not reached the majority of the population examined.There is substantial evidence of the harmful effects of the pandemic and viral transmission control strategies, such as lockdowns and school closures, on economic activity. These effects have resulted in substantial employment loss [7, [9] [10] [11] 58] . Residents of informal settlements are more economically vulnerable to external shocks in the economy than the general population because a large proportion perform informal jobs earning subsistence wages. Our findings are consistent with this evidence.The pandemic has also exacerbated pre-existing social inequalities. For example, our results also show that the drop in economic activity has more negatively affected immigrants than non-immigrant residents of informal settlements. The situation of the most vulnerable populations is maybe even worse than we found in our study, as there is increasing evidence of xenophobia, racism, and stigma against the poor and migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic [59] [60] [61] [62] .Our results also suggest neighborhood cooperation within informal settlements increased at the onset of the pandemic but has decreased over time. This decrease may be an essential source of vulnerability, as individuals living in these settlements often depend on local networks to access resources, including food, labor, and childcare [26] . We also found that immigrant householdsare are substantially less likely to receive any government assistance, such as the Bono COVID or in-kind food transfers. Informal settlements often attract less public assistance because they are installed on land without a proper legal title [34] . This complex relationship with governments could be more problematic during the pandemic.Strategies to prevent the spread of the virus need to consider the chronic vulnerabilities of individuals living in informal settlements and the comparative advantages of these communities. Some of these communities' vulnerabilities to infectious diseases include inadequate water, sewage, and hygiene infrastructure; insufficient or nonexistant waste collection; material deprivation; space limitations; and overcrowding [26, 63, 64] . These characteristics need to be considered when implementing large scale regulations and policies to control a pandemic, as the livelihoods of people in informal settlements are more vulnerable to external shocks in the economy. Some researchers have conceptualized these communities as ""poverty traps"", which prevent low-income families from accumulating the economic and social resources necessary to improve their disadvantaged situation [37] . Other authors have provided a more complex picture of informal settlements, conceiving these urban enclaves as low-cost housing options for vulnerable individuals that aim to take advantage of the access that the settlements provide to the economic and social opportunities that a city brings [36] . Individuals in some informal urban settlements may have better access to economic and social urban opportunitiessuch as connectivity, jobs, social networks, and community organizationsthan low-income individuals in governmentsubsidized housing projects [39, 55, 56] . Urban informal settlements may be a relevant source of economic activity and income in a city and may run social, political, and cultural initiatives [39, 65, 66] .Governments, non-profits, and the community need to act quickly to provide economic support, urban infrastructure, and protections to individuals living in informal settlements. The value of lives saved and disease burden averted will probably far exceed the economic costs of providing immediate support to families facing severe hardship [20] . Schools provide essential meals and nutrition to children living in poverty, including those in informal settlements. The closure of schools, implemented nationally in Chile since March 16 [40] , likely has affected child nutrition and other essential services, such as routine vaccination programs [67] . This urgent support should not come at the expense of long-term efforts to improve informal settlements and their residents' other immediate needs [21] . Governments need to innovate with policies targeted at the informal sector, including immigrants and single-headed households. This crisis may also be an opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.We thank Laura Marshall (P.

The survey contains information of all individuals older than 15 years within a selected household, and it corresponds to the main instrument to monitor the evolution of employment, among other labor market outcomes. The sample of the survey considers approximately 12.000 households which correspond to approximately 35,000 individuals each month. The survey considers as employees those who answer with ""yes"" to the question if last week they worked for at least one hour. This survey is managed by the Chilean national Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas, INE).iii While we do not observe monthly evolution of employment among informal dwellers, an obvious concern may relate to employment seasonality. Given the magnitude of the drop, seasonality seems to be a second order issue that could affect the magnitude of the observed change. By using the same nationally representative survey during 2019, we observe a fair degree of stability over time among the national population and the subgroup of respondent with incomplete education residing in municipalities with at least one slum. See supplementary material Figure S1 . iv In supplementary material Table S4 we analyze these results using our individual-level panel data and including heterogenous changes by immigrant status and gender. Coefficient results show a disproportionate drop among informal immigrant dwellers in May, but no significant difference between Chileans and immigrants in September. In terms of gender, we observe a larger drop --but not statistically significant at conventional levels --among females. v We analyze heterogenous responses by immigration status and gender in supplementary material Table S5 . In this case, we are constrained by the fact that these questions were later incorporated in the 2020 surveys. We observe several important facts. First, while we do not detect differences between Chileans and immigrants in any of the two periods for the unemployment insurance program, differences in COVIDtransfers are substantial. In May, 2020, while 40 percent of Chilean informal dwellers had received the transfer, only 20 percent of immigrants had participated. In terms of gender, we observe that women exhibit a 16 percent higher participation rate in COVID-transfer program in May, 2020 and the gender gap drops by 7 percentage points in September, 2020. In the case of unemployment insurance program participation, we observe no difference by gender among informal dwellers in any of the two periods of analysis.","Chile","abstract","2021-01-20",1

With new cases and deaths being reported daily, there is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiological basis of the disease's progression, especially in the most severe cases. This may accelerate the discovery of effective treatments, thus increasing survival rates and consequently alleviating the disease's social impact. There is considerable biochemical, physiological and pathological evidence to show that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in COVID-19. Here, we propose two hypotheses regarding the RAAS, its related receptors, enzymatic synthesis and degradation routes to address Angiotensin II (ANG II) involvement in the range of clinical prognoses of COVID- 19. This study is divided into three main parts. The first provides a description of the RAAS, detailing its receptors, molecular synthesis and degradation routes. The second deals with changes in the RAAS during SARS-CoV-2 infection, including biological scenarios for the best and worst COVID-19 prognoses. The final section discusses the physiological pathways and reasoning for the proposed early changes in the RAAS in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 development.The RAAS regulates blood composition and circulating volume, having a role in blood pressure homeostasis in various animal species (2) . The classic RAAS pathway involves the production of Renin by juxtaglomerular cells whose only substrate is angiotensinogen, forming Angiotensin I (ANG I) (3) . In turn, ANG I is then cleaved into ANG II by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), which is primarily transcribed as a membranebound enzyme and later detached from the cell membrane by proteolytic cleavage (4, 5) . Specifically, the C-terminal portion of ACE (also known as ACE/Kininase II) is responsible for ANG I metabolization to ANG II, while the N-terminal portion cleaves Bradykinin into other peptides (6, 7) . However, ANG II might also be generated by other enzymes in tissue-specific RAAS (cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal) (8) . The main enzyme involved in ANG II generation in tissue-specific RAAS are serine proteases (specially kallikrein-like enzymes also called tonins), and also cathepsin G and chymase (9) . In the kidneys, 40% of ANG II is generated by non-ACE pathways, while in human heart, coronary arteries and atherosclerotic aorta, chymase is the dominant generator of ANG II, suggesting that these nonclassical pathways might have a role in the development of several diseases (9, 10). The best described physiological effects of ANG II involves its binding to AT1 receptors (AT1R), leading to vasoconstriction and reducing renal sodium excretion, via aldosterone stimulation (11) .A recent description of the RAAS has revealed several ANG II derived peptides, highlighting the importance of this system as well as providing a better understanding of its role (3). ACE2, which was initially described as an ACE homologous, sharing 40% sequence similarity with ACE (12) , counteracts the effects of ANG II by converting ANG I into Angiotensin 1-9 (ANG 1-9), and ANG II into Angiotensin 1-7 (ANG 1-7) (13) . While binding to both ANG I and II, ACE2 preferentially binds to ANG II, with a catalytic efficiency 400 times greater than for ANG I. Consequently, plasma levels of ANG 1-7 are higher than those of the other isoforms, such as ANG 1-9 (12, 14) . ANG 1-7, by the actions of ACE and aminopeptidases, generate two other peptides, Angiotensin 1-5 and Angiotensin 2-7, respectively (3). Angiotensin 2-7 will then generate Angiotensin 3-7 via aminopeptidases action, while Angiotensin 1-5 is converted into Angiotensin 1-4 by neprilysin or carboxipeptidases. Finally, both Angiotensins 3-7 and 1-4 are converted into Angiotensin 3-4 by aminopeptidases and endopeptidases (3) . Besides ANG 1-7 generation, ANG II, when cleaved by a carboxylase, will generate Angiotensin A, whereas when cleaved by aminopeptidase A, ANG II generates Angiotensin III (3) . Angiotensin III is then cleaved by aminopeptidase N, forming Angiotensin IV, which is then cleaved by another aminopeptidase, forming angiotensin 5-8. The pathway ends with angiotensin 5-8 being processed by a carboxypeptidase, generating angiotensin 5-7 (3). Most of these new RAAS members are ANG II-derived peptides, and also exert their actions via AT1R and AT2R, having local physiological effects that can be similar to those produced by ANG II, according to the tissues and systems were they occur.ACE2 is expressed in multiple human epithelial cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, nasal and intestinal epithelial cells, and within the airways, in alveolar epithelial type II cells of the lung parenchyma (15) . It is a metalloproteinase type I transmembrane enzyme, characterized by a small cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region and an ectodomain (16) . Due to conformational differences in the catalytic site, ACE2 is not blocked by classic ACE inhibitors (12) nor angiotensin-receptor blockers. The ACE2 ectodomain is recognized as a cleavage site for ADAM-17 and TMPRSS2 sheddases (17) . ADAM-17 is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 domain (17) that cleaves ectodomains of diverse cytokines, receptors and enzymes anchored in cell membranes (18) . TMPRSS2 is a type II serine protease, acting in conjunction with ADAM-17. Both enzymes share the same specificity for transmembrane ACE2 (tACE2), however, the final product, soluble ACE2 (sACE2), is different (19) . ADAM-17 cleavage leads to the shedding of a form of sACE2 that is still biologically active, being able to cleave ANG II and counteracting its effects, but also blocking circulating viral particles (14) . Studies using recombinant sACE2 have demonstrated that it also cleaves ANG I into ANG 1-9, which also counteracts ANG II effects. However, little is known about physiologically produced sACE2 and ANG I cleavage (20) . tACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2, on the other hand, does not release the biologically active form of the enzyme (21) and has been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, being the main pathway by which the virus enters the cell (13, (22) (23) (24) . Therefore, the balance between the two sACE2 forms generated by both enzymes might have an important role in COVID-19 outcomes. This is summarized in Figure 1A and is relevant to COVID-19 symptoms.The putative pathways involving the RAAS and disturbances caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized in Figures 1B, C. Figure 1B summarizes our hypothesis regarding the best prognosis in COVID-19, while Figure 1C details the worst prognosis. The best prognosis involves an early ANG II peak in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, being related to outcomes were the inflammatory process is controlled, with little tissue damage, no or short hospitalization as well as mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. The worst prognosis would result from the inability of the organism to produce an ANG II peak as soon as SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell. It is related to those cases where severe COVID-19 develops, with the presence of a cytokine storm, tissue damage, organ failure and long hospitalization, frequently culminating in death. As highlighted, the key point is a peak in ANG II following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or a strong AT1R activation. A step-by-step description of the pathways that may lead to a best prognosis is described in Figure 1B , below. The hypotheses outlined here will be supported by data from the literature and discussed in more depth in the discussion section. Figure 1B On the other hand, an absent/low ANG II peak, or absent AT1R activation and, consequent low ADAM-17 activation would lead to a worst condition associated with COVID-19. In this situation, sACE2 levels resultant from TMPRSS2 would be higher than its biologically active form, originated from ADAM-17 cleavage, thus facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 1C ). Figure 1C sequence:1. Increase in TMPRSS2 activity. Origin: TMPRSS2 activation by SARS-CoV-2 (25) (26) (27) . Observation: Note that, in this case, the higher tACE2 levels present when compared to the better prognosis, allows more TMPRSS2 activation due to SARS-CoV-2 binding and an increase in virus entry (21 (31, 32) concomitantly to a mild increase in biologically active sACE2, combined to a decrease/equal levels of ANG II due to reduced ACE activity. ANG II exerts its actions by binding to AT1R. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), is responsible for converting ANG I to Angiotensin 1-9 (ANG 1-9) and ANG II to Angiotensin 1-7 (ANG 1-7). ANG 1-7 has opposite effects to ANG II, counterbalancing ANG II physiological outcome. ADAM 17 and TPMRSS2 are sheddases responsible for cleaving tACE2 into its soluble form, sACE2. ADAM17 cleaves tACE2 in a constitutively manner, while TMPRSS2 is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting virus entry the cell host. (B) COVID-19 Best Scenario (for a better understanding, follow the order of numbers). Increased TMPRSS2 activity due to viral entry resulting in reduced tACE2 and consequent increase in sACE2, unable to convert ANG II in ANG 1-7. This will lead to increased ANG II levels, and increased AT1R activation, resulting in higher ADAM-17 activity. Higher ADAM-17 activity will increase biologically active sACE2 levels, able to convert ANG II in ANG 1-7, resulting in no alteration in ANG 1-7 levels. In this scenario, the intense tACE2 cleavage promoted by ANG II/AT1R/ADAM-17 axis will reduce virus entry into the cells. (C) COVID-19 Worst Scenario Note that this scenario is closely related to an incapacity in promote the ANG II peak or AT1R down-regulation, as suggested to the use of ACE inhibitors, genetic factors (i.e. A blood type), diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. (for a better understanding, follow the order of numbers). Increased TMPRSS2 activity due to viral entry resulting in a mild reduction tACE2 as well as a mild increase in sACE2, unable to convert ANG II into ANG 1-7. Consequently, ANG II levels will remain equal or even decrease, as well as AT1R activation, and resulting in ANG 1-7 decrease. In this scenario, the equal or low levels of ANG II, AT1R, and ADAM-17 activities will be associated to a mild decrease in tACE2 and a substantial increase in sACE2 produced by TPMRSS2, increasing the virus entry into the cells. Our hypothesis suggests the RAAS may have a greater role in modulating the physiological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, consequently, to COVID-19 outcomes than previously reported. Here we present two hypothetical scenarios-the best and the worst-involving the RAAS in COVID-19, both of which involve ANG II as a primary response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. All proposed changes are related to the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, being relevant to the onset of the physiological response, and influencing COVID-19 outcomes. Figure 2 summarizes the proposed hypothesis for both bets and worst-case scenario.The best scenario is probably related to a limited entry of the virus into the cell and consequently a better prognosis. The first step implicates TMPRSS2 and ADAM-17 sheddases, which are involved in tACE2 cleavage. The mechanisms leading to tACE2 shedding by TMPRSS2 are different from the ADAM-17 pathway (16) . Studies with SARS-CoV suggest tACE2 shedding by the virus involves TMPRSS2 activation in the short cytoplasmic domain of tACE2. By contrast, ADAM-17 constitutively sheds tACE2 to produce its soluble form (sACE2), which retains its biological activity (14, 16, 21) . Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, ADAM-17 and TMPRSS2 provoke opposite effects. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to tACE2, which then is partially or fully internalized to the cell cytoplasm along with the virus (24) . In this process, TMPRSS2 is activated, leading to tACE2 shedding and thus reduced tACE2 levels (14, 24, 28, 36, 37) . As a consequence, TMPRSS2 activation leads to increased SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cell penetration in the host cell as well as to increased ANG II levels, as shown in Figure 1B (13, 16, 22, 24) . It has been shown that African Americans and the elderly present increased levels of TMPRSS2, which might to some extent explain the increased severity of COVID-19 seen in these two populations (19) .Interestingly, ANG II is known to upregulate ADAM-17 activity in different tissues, such as heart muscle, kidney, pancreas, etc (38) . In this case, if ANG II and ADAM-17 levels increase, some of the tACE2 may be shedded, which might be an FIGURE 2 | Summary of proposed changes in the RAAS, and downstream effects following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the best-case scenario, a peak of ANG II occurs immediately after SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell. The virus reduces tACE2 levels due to increased TMPRSS2 and ADAM-17 activity. Reduced tACE2 levels decrease virus entry into the cell, and, consequently, the viral load. The ANG II peak will also increase AT1R activation, modulating not only the ANG II effects, but also the host immune response, which produces TNF-a and IFN-g in an appropriate time and amount, favoring better clinical outcomes. In the worst-case scenario, the host is unable to elevate ANG II levels. Even with reduced tACE2 due to virus TMPRSS2 activation, ANG II levels remain unaltered or reduced. Consequently, ADAM-17 activation is lower or unaltered, thus, more tACE2 is available, allowing more virus to enter the cell and replicate. Moreover, AT1R activation is also low or unaltered, which leads to an inappropriate early immune response, favoring poor clinical outcomes.important biological response to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in some tissues. Moreover, studies have demonstrated sACE2 generated from ADAM-17 cleavage is capable of binding SARS-CoV-2, sequestrating the virus and preventing it from attaching to the tACE2 (28) . Curiously, people from blood group A are at higher risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 and exhibit lower plasmatic ACE levels (39) . Hence, patients with blood group A are more likely to have lower levels of ANG II, negatively regulating AT1R activation and ADAM-17, which seems to support our theory.In the same context, AT1R activation by ANG II downregulates tACE2 expression, reducing ANG 1-7 and favoring ANG II vasoconstrictor activities (40) . Chronic AT1R blockade has been shown to lead to a fivefold increase in tACE2 levels in rat aorta (40) . These data indicate tACE2 reduction following AT1R activation by ANG II may trigger a positive feedback mechanism in ANG II regulation (40) . Positive feedbacks are self-limiting and are rarely the best biological choice to control essential physiological mechanisms, such as blood pressure control. Nevertheless, an ANG II peak may be an interesting biological strategy to reduce viral entry into the cell via tACE2, reducing its expression and attenuating the possible viral damage ( Figure 1B ).The worst-case scenario would occur if ANG II production and/ or AT1R activity are reduced for any reason, e.g. using ACE inhibitors (30) ( Figure 1C ). In this case, ADAM-17 would not be consistently activated, leading to two concomitant situations: a) there would be more tACE2 available to facilitate the entry of the virus into host cells, and b) less biologically active sACE2 might result in more circulating free virus, with the potential to enter host cells via tACE2. Therefore, the TMPRSS2/ADAM-17 balance would be shifted towards TMPRSS2 activation, thus favoring infection by the virus. Corroborating this idea, recent studies have suggested ACE inhibitors are associated to poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients (41, 42) . Paradoxically, a literature review from Mackey et al. (43) concludes direct ANG II suppression with ACE inhibitors would stabilize cell membrane complexes between tACE2 and AT1R, thus reducing the ability of the virus to enter host cells, which would be beneficial in COVID-19. This observation requires additional research and the assessment of intervening variables in infected patients (43) .While increased ANG II levels in COVID-19 has been reported (44) , as yet there are no studies addressing sACE2 levels in the disease. A similar increase in ANG II levels is also seen in H5N1 avian influenza and H7N9 patients, indicating this biological response could be common in some viral infections (45, 46) . Indeed, tACE2 levels are significantly reduced after H1N1 infection, which is probably related to tACE2 degradation via the proteasome pathway (directly cleaved by the influenza neuraminidase protein) (47) . Moreover, mice infected with H5N1 show tACE2 expression downregulation in the lung and increased ANG II plasmatic levels, as proposed in our model (45, 46, 48) . The literature suggests different viruses, not only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, might use tACE2 as a carrier. One accepted theory is that bat coronavirus can infect small mammals, such as the palm civet (49) . This would suggest this biological defense against viral entry is a well conserved mechanism in mammals. These animals act as intermediate hosts, providing a suitable environment for the coronavirus Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to develop point mutations compatible with tACE2 binding (50, 51) . Studies based on sequences from coronavirus found in bats suggest their RBDs contain deletions spanning key residues needed to mediate viral and tACE2 interaction (49, 52) .Several studies corroborate the occurrence of the tACE2 and sACE2 changes proposed in Figure 1B (14, 24, 36, 37) . The increased sACE2 resultant from TMPRSS2 cleavage, and the decrease in its biologically active form from ADAM-17 cleavage, will lead to a mild increase in sACE2, which might not be sufficient to generate ANG 1-7 from the already low levels of ANG II, which is proposed in Figure 1C . Moreover, sACE2 from TMPRSS2 will favor increased SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host cell (21) .These physiological changes produce an imbalance favoring the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, which is a pro-inflammatory, vasoconstrictor, fibrotic pathway, while reducing the ACE2/ANG 1-7/MasR signaling pathway that promotes vasodilatation and anti-inflammatory effects (53) . Indeed, a recent study suggests the activation of the ACE2/ANG 1-7/MasR axis in order to prevent excessive inflammatory response, especially in lungs (54) . Currently, there are three ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of ANG 1-7 administration on hyper-inflammatory response in critically ill COVID-19 patients (55) .sACE2 is a marker of severity and clinical prognosis in several inflammatory diseases. In patients with chronic obstructive coronary artery disease, sACE2 levels were higher than in healthy controls, which was considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality (53). sACE2 levels have been shown to increase in type II diabetes mellitus and coronary arterial disease, being a potential marker for atherosclerosis (56) . Also, increased sACE2 levels are considered a marker of poor cardiac outcomes in several cardiovascular diseases (57) . Proinflammatory cytokines IL1-B and TNF-a also induce ADAM-17 activation, thus increasing sACE2 levels (16) . It is worth noting that patients with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are risk groups for COVID-19, presenting the worst outcomes (58, 59) . Some interesting hypotheses may be related to poor prognosis. First, in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, ANG II plasmatic levels are typically high, indicating the RAAS is hyperactive (60) . Consequently, it would be unlikely to produce a new peak of ANG II to combat the virus infection. Second, the increased ANG II plasmatic levels may also lead to AT1R downregulation. These two hypotheses support the patterns of ANG II and AT1R levels proposed in Figure 1C .An observation should be made regarding the circadian variations in the levels of the RAAS components, which might also affect COVID-19 outcomes (61) . It has been shown, in both animals and humans, that several components of the RAAS present a circadian pattern throughout the day (62) (63) (64) ; in mice, for example, both ACE and tACE2 expression follows a circadian pattern, and the ACE/tACE2 ratio is reduced during the night (65) . The pathogenicity of a virus has also been shown to be affected by the circadian rhythm through direct regulation of viral replication inside the host cell (61) . It is not only the time of day in which the infection occurs that influences the disease outcome, but also disruption of the circadian rhythm increases the viral replication, as observed in herpes and influenza A infections (66) . This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity might be influenced by time of infection due to circadian alterations in the ACE/tACE2 ratio. A lower ACE/tACE2 ratio means reduced ANGII levels and increased tACE2, lending SARS-CoV-2 increased pathogenicity; while with a high ratio, the virus would be less pathogenic. This is also supports our hypothesis that ANG II peaks in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since ACE2 counteracts the ANG II effects by cleaving it to ANG 1-7, a high ACE/tACE2 ratio would favor a peak in ANG II levels. In fact, a study by Liu and colleagues (2020) , observed markedly high ANG II levels in COVID-19 patients when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, these levels were negatively correlated to both viral load and lung injury, suggesting an important role for ANG II during early SARS-CoV-2 infection (44) .TheThe massive neutrophilic infiltration observed in the lungs from critically ill patients has an important role as an early response to infections (67) . In this sense, ANG II plays a role in attracting neutrophils to the lung, since it recruits pro-inflammatory cells to the site of infection (68) . Not only is ANG II a chemotaxis factor for mononuclear cells, it also upregulates both chemoattractant cytokines and adhesion molecules such as P-selectin, Intercellular cell adhesion molecule type I (ICAM I) and Vascular cell adhesion molecule type I (VCAM), on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, leading monocytes and neutrophils to adhere to endothelial cells (69, 70) . An increase in ANG II is one of the early responses during inflammatory processes (68) . However, these processes are counterbalanced by the sACE2 levels, which are pivotal in controlling neutrophilic infiltration in lungs (71) . During the onset of infection, the combination of reduced sACE2 and increased ANG II trigger neutrophilic infiltration to the lungs and initiation of inflammatory processes. The ANG II peak increases ADAM-17 via AT1R activation, leading to increased sACE2 and favoring the ANG 1-7/MasR pathway, modulating the ongoing inflammation and preventing further tissue damage (71) (72) (73) . Taken together, we can speculate that, in COVID-19, the inflammatory process, in lungs, is also importantly coordinated by both ANG II and sACE2 levels. In best-case scenario with COVID-19, since SARS-CoV-2 uses tACE2 to enter the cell, its levels are reduced and ANG II peaks as an early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, triggering an inflammatory response to fight the viral infection. In the lungs, sACE2 levels will start to increase in response to viral entry in the cell. The sACE2, produced by ADAM-17, will both bind to viral particles blocking their entry into the cells, and thus protecting the organism from infection, while also cleaving ANG II, thus controlling both the neutrophilic infiltration and the inflammatory response. After which, late immune responses take place in order to control the infection. By contrast, in the worst-case scenario, even with reduced tACE2 levels, the individual is unable to produce an ANG II peak in response to early infection, with the levels remaining normal or even reduced. Thus, the early neutrophilic response necessary to fight the viral infection does not take place, or is delayed. In a mouse model of bacterial lung infection, it has been shown that reduced neutrophilic infiltration will not trigger the inflammatory response necessary for infection resolution (71) . Once infection takes place in the lungs, sACE2 levels start to rise, cleaving ANG II and reducing its levels even more, resulting in a delayed, or even blunted, immune response to early infection concomitantly to the viral proliferation.ANG II also plays a role in inflammatory responses, acting as a co-stimulatory molecule to T lymphocyte activation, promoting cellular proliferation, differentiation, effector function, migration and adhesion (74) (75) (76) . The T lymphocytes are able to produce both AT1R and ANG II, activating immune cells via autocrine mechanisms ( Figure 3) (75, 76) . Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that AT1R expression in T lymphocytes is upregulated during the activation process. This finding suggests ANG II plays a role in augmenting immune responses (75) (76) (77) . AT1R is expressed in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, which are T helper lymphocytes and T cytotoxic cells, respectively (76) . Attention should be paid to AT1R expression in CD8+ T cells, which are effectors in antiviral responses (78) . Interestingly, AT1R is also expressed inside T cells, which suggests that endogenously produced ANG II may act in those receptors via the intracrine pathway (75) .ANG II autocrine and intracrine AT1R activation will stimulate superoxide production which, in turn, stimulates TNFa production ( Figure 3 ) (75). In addition, TNF-a upregulates AT1R, thus enhancing ANG II signaling (79) . Even though TNF-a is produced by several immune cells such as macrophages, B cells and neutrophils, TNF-a production by T cells has an important role during antiviral adaptive responses, since it promotes apoptosis of infected cells as well as modulating the CD8+ T cells effector phase during viral infections (80, 81) . AT1R and AT2R blockade or deficiency show significantly reduced production of TNF-a by T cells in mice models (75) . Moreover, ANG II induces T cells to express interferon-g (IFN-g), one of the first cytokines to be produced in antiviral responses, thus inducing immune cell differentiation to a TH1 phenotype (i.e., an inflammatory profile- Figure 3A ) (76, 82) . Interestingly, a delayed IFN-g response leads to exacerbated inflammation in mice infected with SARS-CoV and MERS (83, 84) . This also supports our hypothesis, as lower ANG II levels would lead to unaltered or lowered IFN-g production by CD8+ cells ( Figure 3B ).Regarding T lymphocytes, a marked decrease in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown in critically ill patients (28, 85, 86) . The CD8+ decrease may be significant in patients with death outcome in comparison with those who recovered. Recent studies (85) demonstrated that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 patients presented severe inflammatory and antiviral activity compared to healthy controls (85, 87, 88) . Therefore, reduction in CD8+ T cells observed in COVID-19 might actually represents an exhaustion-related effect in this cell subpopulation due to clonal expansion of activated cells. As a result, there is an imbalance between the adaptive response and the disease progression.The RAAS has a critical role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, consequently, COVID-19 better or worse prognoses. In addition, ANG II plays an important role in the onset and progression of inflammatory responses. Taken together, it is possible that an ANG II peak is our first biological response against virus entry (89, 90) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first viewpoint to explore the logical interaction of these pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, monitoring ACE, tACE2, sACE2, ANG I, ANG II, ANG 1-7, and ANG 1-9 during COVID-19 may provide clues to develop effective treatments.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

The accelerated contagion and the need to avoid the collapse of the capacity to provide health services has required government authorities to enact measures of isolation and social distance. COVID-19 patients have extremely limited social contacts. Ethical issues come up in the face of the need for screening in the supply of breathing apparatus. Exaggerated sanitary measures adopted by local authorities prevent physical or visual contact from family members even though guidelines on the subject have already been issued by WHO. The severity of this situation has impacted the mental health of hospitalized patients, health professionals, family members, individuals in isolation at home, and the population in general. Given the facts, this academic essay warns of the need to use spiritual and religious care as a contribution to coping with the effects of COVID-19. Resilience in coping with trauma, seeking meaning, spiritual comfort, and reducing the possibilities of compromising the mental and physical health of those involved, and the population in general are some of the benefits. Proposals are made for safe procedures for the provision of religious services directed to the asymptomatic population and to the people directly or indirectly affected by COVID-19 based on protocols of religious support in environments of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination (CBRN) already developed by US military forces. This academic essay also makes references to examples already implemented both in religious support to the military and in what is offered in the environment civil hospital, which can contribute to reflections on the best practices of this type of assistance. The studies referenced in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, among others, leave no doubt that the adequate confrontation of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot do without the resource of religious support, which can bring comfort and discernment to help prevent the emergence of effects to mental health and its consequent impacts on the physical health of the patients themselves, the professionals involved and the population in general.leaders and spiritual counselors for the treatment of trauma. Ippolito et al. (2006) highlighted the importance of the participation of spiritual counselors in multidisciplinary planning and assistance teams in hospitals that care for victims of bioterrorism or contagious diseases. Among the spiritual factors of psychological effects caused by a traumatic event are changes in how the affected individual believes that life should be lived on a daily basis, changes in belief in God, and changes in acceptance and understanding between good and bad (Lemyre et al. 2005) . A study of young adults in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic pointed to the occurrence of negative mental health symptoms, related to the loneliness of social isolation and the expectation of probable financial problems. It was concluded that ""the lack of important social ties can reduce someone's motivation to minimize the risk related to the disease"" (Okruszek et al. 2020, p. 16) . Studies carried out in the field of psychoneuroimmunology have demonstrated the direct relationship between emotional factors and the immune system (Maia 2002) . Even with regard to the immune response of patients who are victims of several influenza viruses, it has been shown that those patients who have a greater social relationship are less likely to develop severe symptoms, while social isolation is considered to be a factor affecting the immune system (Cohen et al. 1993 ). According to House et al. (1988; as cited in Maia 2002, p. 215) , ""The effect of social isolation in terms of health is comparable to the effect of other risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids, obesity, and physical activity."" Koenig and Cohen (2002, p. 22) , when linking several studies on the relationship between religion and health, pointing to a probability of a religion positively influencing the immune system, consequently, physical health, through stress reduction: ""By providing a more positive, optimistic worldview, religion may improve coping with acute or chronic stress, thereby ameliorating the effects that the stress has on the immune system."" One of the aggravating factors of the respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is precisely the patient's low immunity. Religious support has the ability to establish connections, not only between patients and their beliefs, but also between patients and their faith and family communities. WHO considers religious leaders ""to be the main source of support, comfort, guidance, direct health care, and social service to the communities they serve"" (World Health Organization 2020b, p. 1). Given this, there is a need for victims of traumatic events such as the pandemic of COVID-19 to be accompanied also by professionals in the religious area in order, not only to contribute to mental health but also to the health system itself, since the improvement of the immune system's response to infections would make it possible to reduce the length of hospital stay. The challenge is how to offer religious support in order to prevent further contagion. To facilitate the delivery of this type of assistance, it is important to distinguish the characteristics of religious support.Religious Support or Chaplaincy are commonly characterized as Religious Care, Spiritual Care, or Religious Advisement. Religious Care is more related to rituals that seek the reconnection of the victim with God or with his beliefs and values. In this assistance, there is a well-defined dogmatic identification. They are well-established rites, operated almost exclusively by religious leaders and generally marked by forms and objects of worship. It usually finds it difficult to perform in an environment with a high risk of contamination because it often uses objects of worship such as, for example, ""anointed oil,"" ""holy water,"" ""sacred herbs,"" printed literature, vestments, sculpture images, or rites and procedures specific to each denomination/ religion, such as bathing, physical touching, sharing symbolic/consecrated foods, among others. Spiritual Care is the development of individualized religious support activities related to accompaniment and emotional support, also aiming at reconnecting with spiritual beliefs and values, but without necessarily using forms and objects of worship. They are provided by religious leaders but also by trained health professionals and are aimed, among other things, at encouragement, comfort, confidence, hope, resilience, and strengthening of faith. This differentiation is made clear in the Manual of Spiritual Care of the National Health Service (NHS) Education for Scotland (2009): Spiritual Care, usually provided in an individual relationship, is completely person-centered and makes no assumptions about personal belief or life orientation. Religious Care is provided in the context of the religious beliefs, values, liturgies, and lifestyle of a community of faith. Spiritual Care is not necessarily religious. Religious Care at its best should always be spiritual. (p. 21)Religious Advisement is directed to managers and health professionals about religious aspects that impact the treatment of infected patients. About this, Carter and Amlôt (2016) observed some complicating factors:A key issue that can go against religious and cultural values is to undress in front of others. Therefore, it is crucial that every effort is made to maintain the privacy and dignity of those affected; this is true for everyone, not just for those with different religious and cultural values. (p. 18)The presence of religious leaders in the hospital team should contribute to clarifying these aspects, include in bioethical decisions regarding the screening of patients.For all types of religious support, it is essential that religious leaders receive adequate training in protection actions, safe care protocols, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and decontamination procedures. Military and civil organizations with experience in support and remediation actions at events CBRN are a reference for the development of this type of training, both for military chaplains and for religious leaders and civil chaplains.The United States Air Force (USAF) issued on June 17, 2019, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 52-104 (Secretary of The Air Force 2019) guiding the operational employment of its chaplains, including at CBRN events. Although the document specifies that the religious support team should not take unnecessary risks, it admits Spiritual Care within a protected collective environment, in an area at risk of contamination, using appropriate personal protective equipment according to the level of contamination. The USAF's core doctrine on weapons of mass destruction operations guides the provision of Spiritual Care in consideration of the trauma caused by the psychological impact of CBRN contamination events and recommends that these professionals be continually trained and included in the planning of operations for disaster management consequences of CBRN events (Curtis E. Lemay Center for Doctrine Development and Education 2016). These chaplains participate in training for CBRN Defense operations lasting 20 months. In addition, it has the duty to keep the personal CBRN ensemble always ready and available for use (United States Air Force Chaplain Corps 2008).In Brazil, the reference on the employment of the military chaplain in CBRN Defense is the EB70-MC-10.240, Campaign Manual ""Assistência Religiosa em Operações"" (Religious Support in Operations) of the Exército Brasileiro (Brazilian Army), which restricts religious support to the uncontaminated area, with a view to offer comfort to those present and ""provide due religious assistance to the dead"" (Comando de Operações Terrestres 2018, p. 28). Within the scope of the Força Aérea Brasileira-FAB (Brazilian Air Force), studies are being carried out at the Universidade da Força Aérea-UNIFA (University of Air Force)-in order to propose more effective measures for the performance of its Religious Service in CBRN Defense and other traumatic events.In the context of social isolation, voice and image communication resources have played a fundamental role in maintaining social ties. How does religious support fit in this context? Would virtual contact replace physical presence? It is observed that there are both opportunities and challenges for effective religious support in the context of confronting COVID-19.WHO recognizes the role of religious leaders in confronting COVID-19 by promoting mental health, well-being, and resilience through personal contact (with protective measures) and virtual contact via social media and other electronic means (World Health Organization 2020b). In Brazil, the Ministério da Saúde (MS) (Brazilian health organization) instructed local health services to suspend visits to patients affected by COVID-19, although it did not issue specific guidelines for the performance of religious services in hospitals (Departamento de Atenção Hospitalar, Domiciliar e de Urgência 2020). Although many hospitals have canceled chaplaincy activities because of the risk of contagion from COVID-19, others have maintained chaplaincy activities with the necessary safety recommendations.The Associação de Capelania em Saúde (ACS) is an evangelical religious entity that coordinates hospital chaplaincy activities in 10 hospitals in the State of São Paulo (Brazil), including the Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas. On the role of ACS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eleny Vassão Aitken, General Director of the entity, declared in a letter-report addressed to the maintainers:In mid-March we had to withdraw from the chaplaincy work in hospitals, at the request of their Directors, for protection and also for saving masks, gloves, and aprons, already so scarce, for the use of health professionals on the front lines of the battle against Coronavirus. About 10 days ago, some of the directors and many health professionals in these hospitals cried out for us, as they were tired of looking after so many sick people in an emergency and very mentally and spiritually worn out, in the face of so many concerns about the dangers of contamination of their patients. family members, and themselves. Our Teams are back in hospitals, in a reduced way, and respecting all the guidelines of the Ministério da Saúde, giving special attention to Health Professionals, through devotionals called MINUTES WITH GOD, and also in contact with the patients' relatives, who are distressed and unable to visit them. Precious moments of spiritual singing have also been brought to patients in the corridors and daily sending of recorded messages by our chaplains and visitors, which has eased the burden and stimulated the faith of those who are suffering more closely from the pandemic. (E.V. Aitken, personal communication, May 7, 2020).In addition, the ACS chaplains participate in daily meetings of Palliative Care Teams in order to collaborate with decisions related to bioethics (E.V. Aitken, personal communication, May 7, 2020).From Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, Father Giovanni, chaplain at the Hospital Polivalente Luigi Sacco, in Lombardy, reported his experience in an interview with the Rádio Renascença (Frazão and Miguel 2020) , when visiting patients with COVID-19:Can you talk to the sick? Today, I met 14 COVID patients who had asked to meet me. Most wanted to receive communion. What feelings do they express to you? Everyone is afraid. But, on the other hand, all the people I met today were moved. They were moved by the fact that I was there [emphasis added], even a person who declared himself not a practitioner, not a believer, when he saw that I had gone to find his roommate to give him communion, asked me for the blessing and he accepted to pray a prayer with us. All this can only last, three to five minutes, it is the maximum time to be in each room. Do you usually take Holy Unction to the sick? I go there, when asked, I administer it to the sick and I bless the whole room. The last was yesterday, to the father of a doctor who works at the hospital. What about funerals? When family members contact the chaplaincy, I celebrate as I can, in an empty square, next to the coffin. I say a few prayers and bless the coffin before they take it to the cemetery. Here, there is no longer the usual burial apparatus, according to Christian tradition. But the Church is still present. [Emphasis added].As can be seen, fear is the common feeling that leads the sick to ask for the prayers and services of the religious, but the presence of the chaplain brings comfort.The Swiss Association for Palliative Medicine, Care and Support, Palliative ch, created a task force to confront COVID-19 involving medical representatives, nurses, and religious professionals in order to minimize the effects of anxiety, including in the decisions that involved screening in the treatment, where religious professionals actively participate offering Spiritual Care, including in the grief of families (Domenico et al. 2020 Face-to-face religious support contributes to emotional support for health professionals. Many of these are exhausted with the intense pace of care or in ethical dilemmas due to decisions regarding the screening of patients. Chaplains can participate in meetings with these professionals during their rest breaks or after the end of the working hours, in addition to participating in the Bioethics teams (Roser et al. 2020 ).In the US military chaplaincy, there is a concept known as the ministry of presence, where only the physical presence of the chaplain, not necessarily the service, is already capable of transmitting comfort. On this, Tinsley (2013) states:The ministry of presence affirms that the military chaplain's presence among his troops encourages hope for the future and comfort for the present, fosters a realization of the genuine presence and providence of God […] Indeed, it is the physical, emotional, and spiritual presence of the chaplain that actuates efficacy in ministry. (p. 9) Therefore, there is a need for hospital managers to provide means for patients with COVID-19 to receive face-to-face or virtual spiritual and religious care in real time. Such provision is both a humanitarian and preventive measure because, in addition to dignifying the patient in their beliefs, it can prevent the disease from worsening due to causes related to mental health and make frontline professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) more resilient to carry out their tasks.In view of the possible scarcity of chaplains for face-to-face demand, virtual religious support is a possibility. However, electronic media must allow chaplains and patients to interact in real time so that the mechanisms of spiritual/religious care can be delivered in a personalized way and adapted to the patients' momentary needs. Thus, the technology can be used with more humanization and socialization, without prejudice to the patient's perception of spiritual/religious care. In this sense, in addition to the use of personal electronic devices, robotics can be used for building a system virtual contact with a real-time patient without the risk of contamination to the chaplains: voice and image transmission devices taken to bed by robots connected to a central religious support where chaplains trained to manage the system, give individual messages or blessings live and broadcast religious ceremonies virtually to the patient, also enabling connection with family and friends. In this way, chaplains could serve more patients in personalized and live communication, with less physical wear, no risk of contagion, without prejudice to medical treatment and greater focus on the patient being treated, that is, less risk of distractions if compared to face-to-face assistance. If there is a need for emergency medical care during spiritual/religious assistance, the chaplain can call the medical team by an electronic signal from his position, without the need to lose contact with the patient. For that, it is necessary to create performance protocols, production of adapted robots, provision of media devices, and system management structure. A prototype of this system is being developed in Brazil at the Universidade da Força Aérea-UNIFA. Evidently, systems like this would not be available to all patients who need spiritual/ religious care. Therefore, another suggested measure, at the government level, is that volunteer religious professionals be registered and trained, similarly to what was done by the MS (Brazil) with the call for health professionals through Ordinance No. 639 of March 31, 2020 (Gabinete do Ministro 2020), to offer spiritual/religious care to COVID-19 patients in hospitals that do not have an organized religious service or the possibility of implementing a robotic system. This summons may even form a database for future actions in the event of tragedies and other mass events.The post-mortem religious ritual is considered fundamental for coping with grief. At funerals whose deceased have been contaminated with COVID-19, considerations of respect for religious rituals have been challenged. The WHO recognized the need to offer dignified treatment to the dead and family members in line with their beliefs (World Health Organization 2020a). In Brazil, although does not recommend funerals for confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, the MS (Departamento de Análise em Saúde e Vigilância de Doenças não Transmissíveis 2020) advises family members, if the funerals are held, to adopt safety measures:Keep the funeral urn closed during the entire viewing and funeral, avoiding any contact (touch/kiss) with the body of the deceased at any post-mortem moment; Provide water, soap, paper towels and 70% gel alcohol for hand hygiene throughout the wake; Make the urn available in an open or ventilated place; Avoid, especially, the presence of people who belong to the risk group for worsening COVID-19: age equal to or above 60 years, pregnant women, lactating women, those with chronic diseases and immunosuppressed; Do not allow the presence of people with respiratory symptoms, observing the legislation regarding quarantine, and compulsory hospitalization within the scope of the Public Health Emergency of National Importance (ESPIN) by COVID-19; If it is essential, they must wear a common surgical mask, stay as little as possible in the location and avoid physical contact with others; Do not allow the provision of food. For drinks, the measures of not sharing glasses must be observed; The burial ceremony should not include a crowd, respecting the minimum distance of at least two meters between them, as well as other measures of social isolation and respiratory etiquette; It is recommended that the burial takes place with a maximum of 10 people, not because of the biological risk of the body, but because of the contraindication of agglomerations. Deceased due to COVID-19 can be buried or cremated. (p. 14)Another interesting suggestion given the insufficient number of religious leaders to assist the bereaved is the support of spiritual counseling groups, guided and coordinated by religious leaders (Roser et al. 2020 ). According to Silva and Alves (2020) , in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there should be no funerals (long duration), but only funeral services (short duration) restricted to some people closest to the deceased, or broadcast live over the internet. One suggestion is to place the funeral urn in an open or ventilated place, separated by a glass or acrylic structure, in order to avoid physical contact with the funeral urn, but preserving visual contact. This would help to prevent not only the spread of the virus but also excesses motivated by the emotion of family members when approaching the funeral urn. Certainly, there are included all other protective measures, among the family members and friends present, already listed.WHO issued considerations and recommendations to religious leaders and communities of faith about their performance during the COVID-19 pandemic period (World Health Organization 2020b). The document makes clear the importance of the role of religious leaders in directing public health policies to communities and recognizes that religious services are essential to promote safe information, prevention, and reduction of fear in the population. Even if the adoption of electronic means for the delivery of the religious service is suggested, WHO does not rule out the possibility of face-to-face celebrations as long as in agreement with local, regional, or national government authorities. However, it establishes several safety parameters for such celebrations. The following recommendations are: (a) maintain a minimum distance of 1 m at all times between people; (b) prevent physical contact between participants; (c) prevent contact with other objects of worship that are usually shared during ceremonies; (d) encourage healthy hygiene habits at all meetings; and clean the places of worship, seats, and buildings frequently; (e) inform participants about the flow of people through worship spaces using signs and notices visible to all; and (f) when possible that face-to-face celebrations take place in an open environment or, when this is not possible, in a ventilated environment (World Health Organization 2020b).In Brazil, despite the fact that there are open-air ceremonies, the result of the creativity of religious leaders, where the faithful are served in their cars for Catholic confession, for example, it is still a challenge to hold face-to-face religious ceremonies. There are still many religious communities without access to technological means, whether for technical or financial reasons, who also suffer from the effects of social isolation. To meet these challenges, there is a need for protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Government of the State of Goiás (Brazil) has initiated a procedure in this regard. On April 19, 2020, it issued Decree No. 9653 (Atos do Poder Executivo 2020) authorizing religious organizations to hold face-toface meetings respecting certain rules. Among them are the occupation of a maximum of 30% of the temple's capacity, the observation of hygiene, the obligation to use masks, and the distance between the participants. The Government of the State of Santa Catarina (Brazil) has taken similar and even more detailed measures, in accordance with Ordinance SES No. 254 of April 20, 2020 (Secretaria de Estado da Saúde 2020), standardizing even the celebrations that involve handling food during the celebrations. The prior scheduling of the presence of believers considering the maximum number of places must be adopted.All of these measures are subject to review; however, the understanding that religious support is an essential activity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is fundamental for prevention in relation to society's mental health.In the face of the global crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, many protective measures are necessary to avoid the population becoming ill and the worsening of the crisis even in economic terms. Every effort to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs to be undertaken. However, the measures adopted by the countries need to take into account a broader spectrum, in addition to the sanitary measures to contain the spread. It is also necessary to assess the impacts of these measures on the mental health of the population. It is clear that isolation and social detachment are effective from the health point of view, in order to prevent the collapse of health systems; however, such measures must be accompanied by processes of promotion of mental and spiritual health that aim to minimize psychological damage in citizens and families. In addition, it is necessary to undertake or reinforce a culture of human dignity where fundamental values are preserved in order to maintain an organized and healthy society in all aspects. In this scenario, governments, whether national, state, or municipal, should not fail to offer populations options to meet their spiritual and social needs. Examples such as the USAF military chaplaincy serve as a reference for the development of similar religious support programs, both in the context of military chaplaincy and hospital civilian chaplaincy.Technological advances in the areas of robotics and image and sound transmission have provided a lot of resources in the search for social contact, which makes Pandemia COVID-19 different, in this aspect, from other past pandemics. However, technology is not available to everyone and, by itself, does not fully satisfy people's spiritual needs. Therefore, it is urgent that measures be taken to promote safe socialization and religious support, even among asymptomatic citizens. The proposals presented above represent a reflection on the use of religious support resources with a view to the contribution of religious entities in addressing the effects of COVID-19. These resources are, almost always, of low cost to the governments, but they can represent a great benefit for the populations, under aspects of spiritual, mental, and physical health that, consequently, will result in benefits for other areas, including for the areas of public security and the economy. In this sense, it is concluded that the use of religious support is essential in facing the pandemic of COVID-19.","Brazil","first author","2021-01-06",1

Pandemic coronavirus disease (CoVID-19) has a 0.25%-3.0% case-fatality risk estimate, mainly due to pneumonia [1]. Despite the severity of respiratory symptoms, other manifestations have also drawn the attention of the scientific community. Several reports have been described of different cutaneous lesions in CoVID-19 cases. The frequency of skin lesions in these patients varies between 1.8% and 20.4% [2] . The major dermatologic morphologies described in CoVID-19 cases were morbilliform, pernio-like, urticaria, macular erythema, vesicle, papulosquamous and retiform purpura [3] . We describe here a case of cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (CSVV) in a patient affected by CoVID-19.A 27-year-old previous healthy male presented to internal medicine department with a 7day history of skin lesions and low-grade fever, in addition to pain, hyperemia and major testicular edema. The cutaneous lesions had upward progression, located in the larger amount in the lower limbs and, to a lesser extent in the region of the back and upper limbs, sparing the palms and soles of the feet. He denied having any new medications, insect bites, and family history of autoimmune disorders. Flu-like syndrome with anosmia and ageusia was reported seven days before the skin lesions, during peak cases of CoVID-19 in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Treatment had been started in the emergency department with acyclovir and ceftriaxone, with no improvement in injuries.Dermatological examination showed painful purpuric papules and vesicobullous lesions, strained from 0.3 to 5 cm in diameter with hemorrhagic content, some with central necrosis and erythematous halo (Figures 1-2) . On admission, blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and coagulation profile were normal. C-reactive protein level (37 mg/L), D-dimer (7540 ng/mL), and serum ferritin were increased. A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis was made and a punch biopsy of one palpable purple papule was performed. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and prophylactic enoxaparin were initiated.Vasculitis work-up included negative antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody, and cryoglobulins with normal serum complement levels. Herpes simplex, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and VDRL test were also negative. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive in a nasopharyngeal swab.The patient improved during hospitalization with significant pain relief, with no more fever and no new lesions on the third day of corticosteroid therapy. He also had a reduction in testicular edema and an improvement in skin lesions by the fifth day of therapy. Histopathological study showed leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis (LCV) affecting small vessels, microthrombi occluding some vessels and absence of IgA, IgG, IgM and C3 on direct immunofluorescence examination (Figures 3-4) . In the context of pandemic CoVID-19, a confirmatory test for such infection and a negative vasculitis investigation, a diagnosis of CSVV secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was established. The patient was discharged using prednisone in good clinical condition.Few cases are described in the literature of CSVV associated with CoVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] , including one case of IgA vasculitis [8] . In researching this diagnosis, we performed histopathology with immunofluorescence, but it was negative. Our patient had more extensive and exuberant bullous hemorrhagic eruptions than similar cases published in Italy and Dubai. The Italian patient, however, had a more severe systemic and pulmonary condition and died, while the other patient was asymptomatic respiratory at the beginning of the skin lesions [5, 6] .Most cases of CSVV emerged in mild cases of CoVID-19 [4, 6, 7] . Authors postulated that, even in these cases, endothelial damage may occur due to an immune response against viral antigen deposition or by an elevation of IL-6 during infection [4] . The ""cytokine storm"" (an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6) could achieve the skin and activate dermal dendritic cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils, promoting the vasculitis process [2] . The present In summary, we present a case of exuberant bullous CSVV with microvascular thrombosis attributed to mild CoVID-19. We believe that cases of CSVV in undiagnosed patients during this pandemic should be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. ","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-12",1

Special emphasis was made on gastrointestinal symptoms and comorbidities as they relate to lethality of the disease in Latin America.We conducted a systematic literature search of published articles using electronic databases such as PubMed, OVID, Scopus, Google Scholar, LANCOVID (Latin America research network on COVID), and other resources from o cial health organizations of countries in Latin America such as Ministries of Health, National Institutes of Hygiene, or Hospitals from January 1 through July 30, 2020. We included the following terms in the search bar: COVID-19, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Hispanic and Latin America or South America. Additionally, we searched for o cial and non-o cial press releases of patient and hospital data from government health institutions of the leading COVID-19 virus-infected Latin American countries. We searched leading reference databases, primary published sources and press releases from the various Ministries of Health of the respective Latin American countries. Case characteristics were described, including demographics, exposures, comorbidities and symptoms.Selection and Identi cation of Relevant Literature: Using the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria, we rst sorted the Latin American COVID-19 studies by title and abstract; then we compiled the papers by relevance and conducted a new selection process by a thorough review of the data. Based on detailed insights derived from the most relevant papers, we revised our reference search criteria to obtain more re ned papers for our systematic review. We incorporated studies that reported patients' characteristics and symptoms of interest. From the selected papers, tables were generated for each dataset on Microsoft Excel. These tables included the following information for extracted data of each study: Study author (year, location, hospital or city, state and country), date of the report, location, con rmed cases, deaths, lethality rate, average age, sex, headache (cephalea), cough, myalgias, fever, odynophagia, anosmia, dyspnea, ageusia, diarrhea, thoracic pain, abdominal pain, tachypnea, cyanosis, sore throat, nasal congestion, nausea and vomiting, fatigue or tiredness, joint pain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic neurological disease, cancer, in ammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis ( Fig. 1 ).Inclusion Criteria: The following inclusion criteria were adopted to validate article selection: There were 728,282 con rmed cases in our study from 8 countries ( Cough and fatigue were the top symptoms in Latin American COVID-19 patients According to the combined overall weighted average, the most common symptoms reported in the 8 Latin American countries for positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough with 60.1%, fatigue or tiredness with 52.0%, sore throat with 50.3%, and fever with 44.2% (Table 1) . Bolivia was the country that reported the highest positivity for cough ( Fig. 2A) 78.8% and fever (Fig. 2B) ; at least 12% more than Mexico in second place. Ecuador reported the highest prevalence for fatigue followed by Peru and Bolivia with 52% and 51.5%, respectively (Fig. 2C ).Fever was not one of the main symptoms in Latin American COVID-19 patientsWhile fever is probably one of the most common symptoms for COVID-19, that was not the case for the population we studied in Latin America. Fever was the 4th most common symptom with a mean of 44% and 3rd was Sore Throat (50.3%), dry cough and fatigue (Table 1 ). In our report, Bolivia was the region that reported 83.3% of fever, followed by Mexico with 76.6% and then at a much lower rate Peru with 49.4% (Fig. 2B ).Our cohort of patients reported a different array of gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea was the most reported symptom being present in 11.5% of patients (Table 3 ). There was no characterization of the type of diarrhea, whether or not it contained blood; mucus or pus. It is important to mention that only Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru (Fig. 3 ) reported diarrhea on their symptoms and Mexico was the country with the highest prevalence (22.9%), followed by Peru with 13.6%. Diarrhea was followed by nausea and vomiting in 7.2% of patients and lastly abdominal pain in 4.3% in the whole group analysis ( Table 2) . As for gastrointestinal diseases, the prevalence of chronic hepatic disease was 0.31% in positive cases and as such the least common comorbidity ( Table 2) . Hypertension was among the top comorbidities in Latin America COVID-19 patients Among comorbidities, the reports showed that hypertension was the most common with an average of 12.1% followed by diabetes with 8.3% and obesity with 4.5% (Table 2) . Overall, 12.1% of the cohort had at least one comorbidity. It's also important to note that patients can have multiple symptoms and comorbidities. Differences for comorbidities were present among different countries. Mexico was the country with the highest prevalence of hypertension with almost 28.8% followed by Chile with 16% ( Fig. 4A ) and for diabetes as well (Fig. 4C ). Mexico reported the highest prevalence with 20.6% followed by Chile with 8%. As for obesity (Fig. 4B) , Mexico had the highest prevalence with 25.6% followed by Brazil with a 23.7% of the total of their cohorts. As such, the cohort from Mexico was the most hypertensive, diabetic and obese of all 8 countries.We analyzed the lethality rate for the 8 countries, and there are some important differences between them. Lethality is de ned as the number of deaths as end result of COVID-19 over number of positive COVID-19 (x100) (also known as Case Fatality Rate) in the population. The overall weighted average for the total population of our study (Table 1 Suppl.) showed that the lethality rate was 3.4%. In relation to the strati cation of the lethality rate per country (Fig. 8) , there were mixed results, with Mexico reporting a lethality of 16.6%, followed by Brazil with 7.6% and then Bolivia with 5.6%. Venezuela reported the lowest lethality rate with 0.9%.The variables result related to lethality rate (Fig. 5) showed that Mexico reported the highest rate with 16.7%, followed by Brazil with 7.6% and Bolivia with 5.6%. Venezuela reported the lowest lethality rate with just 0.95%. Overall, there were several differences in the reported lethality rates.We explored the association of lethality rate as a dependent variable in univariate and multivariate analyses with several independent variables such as obesity ( Table 2 Suppl), hypertension, diabetes, and asthma ( Table 2 Suppl.). Each of these analyses was statistically signi cant except for asthma (Table 2 Suppl.). This data shows that hypertension, diabetes and obesity are associated with lethality in COVID-19 patients in Latin America. A multiple regression analysis shows that the most in uential factor is obesity followed by hypertension and diabetes.We explored the association of lethality rate as a dependent variable in univariate and multivariate analyses with several independent variables such as GI symptoms. None of the symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting individually or collectively was associated with lethality in Latin America.Coronavirus infections attack mainly the respiratory system [15] . Probably, because of the con ned geographical nature and short-lived SARS-CoV-1 and MERS epidemics, the medical and scienti c community did not explore other potential and secondary targets of coronaviruses. In this regard, the expansion of the current pandemic clearly showed that SARS-CoV-2 can target other systems that display ACE2 receptor. This receptor is expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) system which makes it a potential target for the virus and can lead to GI symptoms [16] . Indeed, viral RNA particles have been detected in stool samples which raised another issue that pertains to fecal-oral transmission, be it in con ned clinical and domestic settings or through sewage systems [16] . However, we do not know the prevalence and frequency of SARS-CoV-2-associated gastrointestinal manifestations in Latin America and the virusassociated symptoms and outcomes, especially in the presence of comorbidities.There are few reports or publications made by health institutions or investigators from Latin America. Nevertheless, at this time that we are writing this paper, one of the epicenter of the disease is located in this region of the world. Taking into consideration some factors such as di cult access to healthcare in several regions of Latin America, the high index of poverty, the low availability of clean water, and waste management that further exacerbate the pandemic's outcome [17] , it would be prudent to study the most common symptoms and comorbidities to distinguish the high risk categories in order to utilize the scarce resources intelligently and wisely in every day practice in a country/population-speci c manner. Here we report the results of our systematic analysis using the published and available data to date, and demonstrate that gender distribution, age range, symptoms and comorbidities are different among the 8Latin American cohorts. Hypertension and obesity were the predominant comorbidities and diarrhea the top GI symptom.Our study revealed that COVID-19 manifests differently in Latin America among the various regions.These differences are important to consider since their impact can in uence management, treatment and prevention approaches for better outcomes when addressing the infection. In our study, the most common symptoms in Latin America are dry cough, fatigue, sore throat and fever. Also, the most common comorbidities are obesity, hypertension and diabetes [18, 19] . This contrasts with what was reported by Maechler et al, from a Berlin testing center that indicates that the most common symptoms were fatigue, myalgia and cough while top comorbidities were chronic lung disease and chronic heart disease [14] . These discrepancies could emanate from the methodologies or sources of data collection in the two studies. Furthermore, our data are more recent and include larger cohorts. The conclusive evidence gathered in our systematic review can make a signi cant impact on screening, tagging, and separating patients into suspected and hospitalization candidate cases that are amenable for follow-ups such as contact-tracing. It is worth noting that these symptoms and comorbidities did not distribute similarly among the eight studied nations. Mexico and Chile followed a similar pro le as far as comorbidities are concerned.There is a special mention about GI symptoms in our study. The prevalence of diarrhea was much higher than reported in other investigations [20] [21] [22] . This is probably because a higher prevalence of diarrhea in Latin American populations exists prior to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the consumption of contaminated foods [23] . In our study, we examined the clinical aspects of the disease and also compared the different demographics from every population and analyzed their association with lethality, incidence and mortality. According to our research, the cumulative lethality in Latin America is 3.4%, very close to the one reported worldwide based on the current data published by John Hopkins University [7] . We also understand that the current lethality rate (a.k.a. case fatality rate) may be in ated compared to the actual risk of death because the people most likely to get tested for COVID-19 are those with severe symptoms and not those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients. This rate might also be de ated as many COVID-19 related deaths in Latin American countries are very likely under-reported.Regarding the demographics of our population, there is a notable difference between sexes, females being the most affected. This is different than what Conti et al. reported on their study where males were the primary target; which they explained as an indication that women were less susceptible to viral infections due to a difference in innate immunity, steroid hormones and the presence of two X chromosomes and the immune regulatory genes associated with chromosome X [24] . Here again, we must note that underlying factors such as age, sex and pre-existing health conditions make the individual risk different from the overall risk. This is important to highlight because while certain reports of case fatality rates include some of these demographics, these numbers also have the same context-based biases as the overall lethality or case fatality rates discussed above.Since lethality is the main outcome to avoid in this stage of the pandemic, we performed different analyses in order to compare the impact of the top comorbidities on lethality. We found that obesity, hypertension and diabetes were highly correlated with lethality, and that the presence of these conditions exacerbates the severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. This is similar to what was reported by other studies [18, 19] .Another pertinent element to highlight, is that the prevalence of tuberculosis in our study was above 1.2%.There is a well-known high prevalence of tuberculosis in the region and the usage of BCG vaccination in Latin America. Many studies reported a potential effect of the BCG vaccine in providing heterologous protection [25] against other infections like the one from SARS-CoV-2. While the BCG vaccine role is still debated, future large and well-designed comparative studies might reveal whether it played any role in the pandemic's outcome in Latin America.Hospital/healthcare structures and some of the observed differences between countries have to do with pandemic management and data availability. Indeed, Venezuela for example showed the least lethality, which might be explained by free access to healthcare system and the fact that the treatment protocol includes hospitalizing every positive case reported [26] . This is in contrast to other countries such as Mexico where only severe disease patients are hospitalized and less access to advanced care is available for the general population [27] . In addition, the lockdown strategies differed between countries which affected the dynamics of transmission and infection rates. The availability of medical records of the patients is very critical for the precise interpretation of the data. Some publications like the one from Chile presented complete clinical data, while the same detailed data was not available for the other regions since most of them use manual medical records and managing such data is di cult.A limitation of our study is its retrospective nature. Some of our reports are from several months ago when the pandemic started, also we only listed studies that were available as published reports (Table 1) or on the web. Many of the health authorities in these countries have limited data sharing capability to provide solid recommendations to the healthcare sector on how to handle the pandemic. Furthermore, some of them reported merely symptoms, others only comorbidities. Therefore, there were disparities in the way they reported patients' information. There are many variables such as immune reaction and blood test, imaging, treatment, liver enzymes and other underlying diseases that are very important for the analysis but are missing in the analyzed data. There is a need for standard collection of data for such a massive and lethal pandemic. For global standardizations, organizations such as WHO or PAHO, can recommend/provide useful tools for both electronic and manual medical records in order to collect precise data for dealing with either endemic or pandemic infections. It is relevant to comprehensively study the clinical conditions of the pandemic so each country can evaluate the most common trends in their population and get better management and treatment protocols.GI and liver manifestations such as anorexia, dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and discomfort are common among patients with COVID-19. Hepatic involvement in this condition is re ected by abnormal liver enzymes and much less frequently elevated bilirubin values. Few studies [28, 29] showed that patients with the severe disease more often have GI symptoms and hepatic involvement.While the mechanisms of GI manifestations elicited by SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown, it is clear that ACE2 expression in the esophagus, small and large intestines, plays a role. Indeed, ACE2 was reported to be coexpressed with TMPRSS2 that is needed for the cleavage of the spike protein and the facilitation of the virus entry into the host GI system aggravating systemic effects of the virus and elevating the rates of transmission. While millions of patients have been discharged and tested negative in their nasopharyngeal specimens, a sizable portion of them still tested positive in their stools [30] . This group of patients should be the focus of next stringent monitoring methods as they are likely to play a role in the dissemination and recurrence of the disease. It will also be worth monitoring whether SARS CoV-2 persistence in the GI system will impact overall GI system functions.In conclusion, while the pandemic is still raging and vaccines and therapeutics are still in development, the only direct interventions readily available now are modi cations of human behavior measures such as hygiene, social distancing and mask-wearing to limit exposure and future infections. Since this disease is here to stay in the foreseeable future, strict measures need to be taken in Latin American countries to act on comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes, all part of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, public health interventions to modify these comorbidities will have a positive impact on COVID-19 overall outcome in Latin America.

Since then it has spread widely around the world, leaving more than 53.5 million positive cases and 1.3 million deaths (WHO) as of November 2020. The first case of COVID-19 in Chile was reported in March 3 rd , 2020 and from that point most of the country has had cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection leaving more than 450000 cases and 15000 deaths (Chilean Government official data).COVID-19 presents in patients with fever, cough and chest discomfort that frequently evolves into pneumonia [1] . Nowadays it is known that COVID-19 can also present with a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 minimal or no symptoms at all, which can significantly influence silent viral transmission among the population via droplets, direct contact or fomites [2] . It is estimated that at least 50% of viral transmission among the population is accounted for by asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals [3] . Hence, active screening and isolation of these individuals is critical for stopping viral transmission [4] . In this context, the role that nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can have among patients has become relevant, especially in health care workers (HCWs) [5] Healthcare workers are a high-risk population for viral transmission, particularly because social distancing is not always possible while caring for patients. This is despite all the efforts to provide adequate personal protection elements (PPE) and for establishing protocols to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the workplaces [6] . Previous studies show conflicting evidence suggesting that nosocomial transmission between HCWs could reach up to 44% [7] or 89% [8, 9] , while other studies show that HCWs are mainly infected through contacts within their communities outside of their working places [10] .Here we investigate asymptomatic infection of HCWs in a private clinic in the city of Santiago, Chile. Our study was conducted during the peak of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile and aims to assess whether the correct use of PPE and the infection control protocols established at most health institutions are sufficient to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.A total number of 413 asymptomatic HCWs were enrolled into the final study. Only 14 tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, representing a 3.4% of positivity in asymptomatic HCWs. Importantly, our results show that there is no relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values or viral load of an individual and the subsequent development of any symptoms related to COVID-19. Moreover, sequencing of the viral genomes confirms that there are at least 5 different infection sources among the infected individuals, suggesting that these HCWs became infected at their individual communities outside of the clinic.All HCWs from Clinica Indisa that had not been infected by SARS-CoV-2 previously and did not present any symptoms at the time of enrollment were able to join the study. Public announcements in the clinic were posted to recruit volunteers. Enrollment to our study was completely voluntary. We were able to reach~30% of the total HCWs in the clinic. (413/1379). Before sampling, an online questionnaire was applied to all asymptomatic subjects to record: Sex, age, profession, residence commune, comorbidities (chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, rheumatic diseases, others), and other variables related to their occupation as a service in which they work, and exposition. Also, written consent of every enrolled HCW was obtained. This study was approved by the Medical Director of INDISA Clinic and the Scientific Ethical Committee of Universidad Andres Bello.Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from enrolled subjects and kept in viral transport media at 4˚C until processing, following the protocols established by the World Health Organization and the Chilean Public Health Institute (ISP). Samples were collected in the morning and results were informed in the following 8-10 hours. This rapid processing of samples allowed efficient detection of new asymptomatic cases, thereby drastically reducing any potential nosocomial transmission by the subjects. HCWs did not return to work until the result from their qPCR test was informed and was negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.For isolation of viral genomes, we made use of a Kingfisher Duo Prime automated system using the MagMAX Viral/pathogen nucleic acid isolation kit (Thermofisher, USA), following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 μL were taken from nasopharyngeal swabs and mixed with 5 μL of proteinase K solution and 275 μL of binding solution/magnetic beads mix. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, inside a laminar flow hood, to inactivate any viral particles. After incubation, samples were transfer to the Kingfisher Duo Prime system and the protocol was run for 25 minutes, which included 3 washes and then the RNA was eluted in 50μL with elution buffer. To quantify the viral genomes in the samples, the Ligth-MIX SARS-COV-2 RdRP Roche kit was used using a Roche Lightcycler 480 II PCR machine, following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μL of eluted samples (2-10ng/μL) were used as template for RT-PCR reactions together with a master mix and a set of primers targeting de RdRP gene. An incubation for 5 min at 55˚C was performed for RT reaction to proceed. 45 PCR cycles were carried out to amplify SARS-CoV2 genomes. SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values <39 were considered positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as indicated by the manufacturer. All HCWs positive in our study were re-tested by an official government licensed laboratory.We performed the reverse transcription and PCR based on information provided by the Artic Network initiative (https://artic.network/) to obtain complementary DNA and sequencing libraries using the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep kit (illumina Inc.). All samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the 500-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 Nano (Illumina) at Universidad Andres Bello. All genomic data from sequenced samples were deposited in NCBI with the following NCBI ID Seq: SAMN16255338, SAMN16255337, SAMN16255336, SAMN16255335, SAMN16255334, SAMN16255333, SAMN16255332, and SAMN16255331.We checked the quality of the raw reads using Fastqc v0.11.8, and then, the reads were filtered and trimmed using Trim_galore v0.5.0. We discarded the reads with a Phred score less than 30 and a minimum read length of less than 50bp. We assembled the SARS-CoV-2 genomes by IRMA v0.9.3 using as reference NCBI sequence ID NC_045512.2, and we performed the sequence alignment using MAFFT [11] . We constructed the phylogenetic tree by IQ-TREE v1.6.12, considering a bootstrap of 1,000 iterations. We used our eight assembled genomes and 162 full-genomes available in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/).We aimed to screen the HCW population that were in direct contact with COVID-19 patients at Clinica Indisa in Santiago, Chile. Our study was carried out between May 1 st and July 1 st 2020, which was concomitant with the peak of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the city of Santiago. At the start of the pandemic in March, Clinica Indisa had 79 high complexity intensive care unit (ICU) beds. In response to the drastic increase in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and in the admission of COVID-19 patients to ICU, the clinic increased its capacity to 172 beds in June (Fig 1A) . Albeit this significant increase during the infection peak, the occupancy of these beds remained always close to the limit, reaching 94% of occupancy in June (Fig 1B) . This reconversion of beds to ICU also required that different wards in the clinic had to be converted, hence increasing the exposure of HCWs from all different services of the clinic to COVID-19 patients.Subjects were enrolled voluntarily from all services in the clinic. If subjects had previously been infected with SARS-CoV2 they were not able to enroll in the study. Subjects were asked to fill a questionnaire including personal information where they had to detail whether they had presented any COVID-19 symptoms, the presence of any comorbidities and if they had been in direct contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected people. Only volunteers that had not shown any symptoms related to COVDI19 at the moment of sample collection were enrolled in the study. At the same time, an informed consent document was signed. A nasopharyngeal swab was then taken from each individual to pursue the analysis. Our study was conducted to target most of the HCW that had been in contact with COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a total number of 413 asymptomatic HCWs were finally enrolled into the study. Ninety-five point four percent of these HCWs declared that their work had required close physical interaction with patients that may have had COVID-19, that is a distance shorter than 2 meters away. Out of the total individuals enrolled, 75.5% of them were women, with a median age for entire group of 33 years old ([IQR] = 29-40 years) and where only 27.1% claimed to have comorbidities. The study group congregated different professionals in the clinic with a higher representation in the sample of nursing technician (NT) (38.7%) and professional nurses (32.9%) ( Table 1) . Importantly, all HCWs that were in direct contact with patients suspected of having COVID-19, declared having used the protective elements that are required for their work in these pandemic conditions. From the 413 HCWs that participated in the study, only 14 of them tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR (2 males and 12 females, Table 1 ), representing this a 3.4% of positivity in asymptomatic HCWs. We found that HCWs working in high-risk areas, where a high rotation of patients occurs, and PPE must be changed constantly such as in Bronchopulmonary ward (BC; 14.3%) and Emergency Services (ES; 12.8%) showed a higher percentage of positive cases (Table 1) . Among the positive HCWs the higher proportion of individuals infected were professional nurses and NTs with 6 cases each. Out of the 14 positive cases for SARS-CoV-2, 7 corresponded to HCWs that carried out functions in the ICU, 5 at the emergency service, 1 at bronchopulmonary consultations unit and 1 at the general hospital wards ( Table 1) . Half of the 14 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs developed symptoms within 3 weeks of testing whereas the rest remained asymptomatic. Interestingly, the SARS--CoV-2 PCR Ct values obtained by asymptomatic or individuals that finally developed symptoms did not show any significant differences, suggesting that viral load is not correlated with the development of symptoms. The most common symptoms observed were anosmia (6/7), ageusia and headache (4/7), myalgia (3/7), fever, chest pain, respiratory distress and cough (2/ 7). Other less frequent symptoms reported were malaise, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Importantly, we did not observe a significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values in asymptomatic versus pre-symptomatic HCW (Fig 2) . From the infected HCWs that were enrolled in our study, none of them had to be admitted at any time in a hospital service.Positive samples from HCWs with Ct value <30, were used for subsequent sequencing of the viral genome. All the samples clustered at the GR GISAID clade (equivalent to clade 20B), as all the genomes presented the polymorphisms C241T, C3037T, A23403G, G28882, S-D614G, and N-G204R (Table 2 ). GR has been the most frequent clade detected in Chilean cities, including in Santiago. Although some of the sequenced genomes were highly similar, samples Cov-176 and Cov-268 showed numerous differences relative to other genomes in the GR clade (Fig 3) . Therefore, these data suggest that there are at least five putative infection sources (Cov-176, Cov-268, Cov-43/Cov-232, Cov-75/Cov-330, Cov-252/Cov-296).In summary, these results indicate that only a minor fraction (3.45%) of the HCWs tested from Clinica Indisa were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, sequencing of the viral genomes shows that there are at least 5 different infection sources among the infected individuals, supporting the idea that these HCWs became infected at their individual communities outside of the clinic.Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, countries have taken different approaches to stop spreading of the virus. They all coincide at this point that testing and tracing SARS--CoV-2 infected subjects is primordial for slowing down the spread of the virus. However, limited resources and the dependency of diagnostic reagents produced overseas, have diminished the ability of each country to adequately respond to this challenge, especially in Latin America.It is now known that an elevated proportion of infected people is asymptomatic. Some studies have shown that these individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may represent up to 45% of the cases [3] . More importantly, it has been suggested that the asymptomatic population is capable of spreading the virus for more than 14 days without knowing it [2, 3] . Therefore, having a good system in place for tracking and isolating asymptomatic subjects is imperative to control the pandemic as it has been recently demonstrated in Italy [4] . Nevertheless, in most places testing has been mainly focused on symptomatic individuals with only few studies reporting about asymptomatic subjects that are directly exposed to COVID-19. Especially important among this last group are HCWs that are in the front-line attending patients with COVID-19 and that could then represent a hot spot for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care institutions.Our study focused on the identification of asymptomatic HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of infection rates in Chile. It was found that only 14/413 (3,4%) of HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of symptoms, a significantly small proportion compared to a 9.1% of asymptomatic infections in the country during the time our study was conducted (https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/cifrasoficiales). Out of these 14 individuals and within 3 weeks after testing, 7 did not develop any symptoms and 7 of them became symptomatic, suggesting that the true asymptomatic carriage rate was 7/413 (1,7%). Our data is comparable to that of recent studies testing HCWs in hospitals of USA and UK, which show asymptomatic infection rates close to 3% [12, 13] .Our study has some limitations, which include the number of enrolled subjects. This was a voluntary study open to all 1379 workers in the clinic, but it was limited by the time of sample collection and HCWs shifts due to law requirements of a mandatory quarantine after a RT-PCR test was run and results were informed. Nevertheless, we were able to reach approximately 30% of the HCWs in the clinic. Our study was conducted in a private clinic in Santiago, Chile. Thus, our results do not necessarily reflect the public hospital system where the use and availability of PPE was limited at the time. At the moment the study was conducted, no testing was performed routinely at either private or public hospitals to detect symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 HCWs infections. Nowadays in hospitals HCWs are routinely being screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of their protocols.The higher percentage of positive cases in Bronchopulmonary ward (14.3%) and Emergency Services (12.8%) suggests that these 2 areas are at higher risk of infection than the ICU or general wards. This could be due to the constant changes of PPE that HCWs are required to do between patients, thus at least for these two areas we cannot completely discard nosocomial infection.Interestingly, the comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values obtained from asymptomatic individuals and those from individuals that finally developed symptoms, did not show any significant differences. This result suggests that there is no direct relationship between viral load at the moment of testing and the emergence of symptoms associated with COVID-19. As asymptomatic subjects may exhibit elevated viral titers they can be cataloged as ""super-spreaders"", capable of silently transmitting the virus among the population to a large number of people [14] , our study strongly support the need for systematic testing among asymptomatic HCWs.Previous studies have shown high nosocomial transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 between HCWs and/or patients [15] . However, our sequencing results suggest that infection of HCWs occurred in their respective communities, outside of the clinic and was not nosocomial. These results support the strategy of tracing asymptomatic individuals to prevent nosocomial infection among HCWs and patients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The broad strategy implemented to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Clinica Indisa included for all HCWs working in the hospital wards and urgent care working with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, the mandatory use of N95 or KN95 masks, eye protection, a disposable gown with arm coverings and disposable gloves. All HCWs in the clinic were required to alert if any symptoms arose, maintain frequent hand hygiene, avoid any physical contact with colleagues, avoid presential meetings or gatherings, use a protective surgical or N95/KN95 mask at all times covering mouth and nose, maintain proper physical distance of 1 meter or more, regular disinfection of common areas, equipment, desks, telephones, etc. These efforts likely played a major role in avoiding the generation of infection clusters in the clinic facilities due to asymptomatic carriers. These results also provide strong evidence in favor of using appropriate PPE and following established infection control protocols to limit the impact of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Chile","abstract","2021-01-28",1

For example, some states such as San Francisco in the United States reported seroprevalences as low as 0.26% 8 ; Wuhan China, 3.2-3.8% 9 ; while Switzerland, 11% 10 ;New York City, 19% 11 , and more recently the highest reported in Manaus, Brazil, with 55.1-61.4%. 12 In Peru, preliminary results from two seroprevalence studies, one carried out in July, reported a seroprevalence of 29.7% in the region of Lambayeque. Another one has carried out in December, a seroprevalence of 39.3% in Lima and Callao's regions using population-based sampling techniques. 13 Herein we report SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates from Iquitos, Peru, one of the first and hardest-hit cities during the pandemic in Peru. In Iquitos city, over two-thirds of the total excess of deaths occurred over one month (April 19-May18), including the death of 23 physicians and the health care system collapse. 14 The study was carried out by the Directorate of Epidemiology, Executive Directorate of Prevention and Control of Diseases, Regional Directorate of Health of Loreto, from July-August 2020, following a Public Health Emergency in April and May 2020 when over one thousand Iquitos residents, including over 50 health workers, died during the first wave of the Pandemic.This study informs decision-making aimed at mitigating the further impact of COVID- 19 .The study was approved by the hospital health network Institutional Scientific Committee and Institutional Review Board of the Regional Hospital, Iquitos. Written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants and parents or a legal representative of all children < 18 years of age. Also, written assent was provided by children >13 to <18 years of age. Participants' data were coded to protect their identity. Study forms and codes were protected and handled only by the study researchers.The minimum sample size was determined for an underlying crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 18% or higher during the study period. Sampling effects were calculated to weight for the district population and population distribution by gender and age groups (< 12 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 29 years, 30 to 59 years, and > 60 years).The effective sample size was approximately 400 subjects to estimate a seroprevalence of 18% with a precision of ±2.5% (50% relative error) at the 95% confidence level. In anticipation of a 20% response rate, 20% loss in follow-up, and 20% missing values, the minimum sample to be selected increased to 692 subjects. Based on this estimate, we decide to enroll 726 participants to account for a 5% loss of information due to contingencies like robberies, assaults, or similar.We carried out a population-based 3-month cohort study between July-August 2020 of a geographically stratified sample across Iquitos city. We obtained a representative sample of the Iquitos city population using the 2017 census data, which the Ministry of Health updated on January 20, 2020, for vaccination purposes. This information includes detailed maps with the limits of each of the four levels considering in our sampling procedure, including four districts, 40 sectors, 2500 blocks of households, and 90,354 households.We included in our study all the inhabitants of Iquitos, Loreto, Peru, since the arrival of We performed a quality control double read and use a third independent interpretation to resolve any disagreement between the first two readers.We performed a descriptive analysis summarizing the participant's demographics and clinical history with absolute and relative frequencies if categorical and with their mean and standard deviation if continuous. We use Student's t-test for mean comparisons and Fisher's exact test for proportion comparisons between those that tested seropositive versus those that tested seronegative. Then, we estimated the seroprevalence using a twostep process. First, we estimate the seroprevalence by accounting for the survey sampling weights using STATA survey (svy) commands and, second, we adjusted these estimates to account for the sensitivity (95.8%) and specificity (100%) using the diagnostic (diagti)command. Finally, we explored associated factors to three outcomes of interest, including COVID-19 seropositivity (defined as positive at baseline), and test-re-rest positivity (defined as positive at baseline and positive at the first month follow up), and incidence of new COVID-19 exposure (defined as negative at baseline and positive at the first month follow up). In all cases, we estimated the prevalence ratio as the magnitude of association of interest using log-binomial regression models with robust variance and a confidence interval of 95%. We performed all the data analysis using the statistical package STATA tm MP version 14.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas).We included a representative sample from each of the Iquitos four districts (Table 1 ).Participant's mean age was 29.2 years of age (range: 3 months to 89 years of age). Most patients were women (51.0%), from San Juan (42.0%) or Iquitos (36.6%) districts, and proceed from urban areas (86.5%). Most patients denied any history of previous existent conditions (85.6%), whereas the following were reported: cardiovascular diseases (6.0%), diabetes (2.8%), chronic respiratory diseases (2.0%), obesity (1.3%), and kidney disease (0.9%). Likewise, the study sample included four pregnant women and one subject with Down's Syndrome.At baseline, we observed seropositivity of 73.7% (528/716) either to IgM (7.0%) or IgG (73.5) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. After adjusting for the study sampling effects and the independently reported sensitivity (95.8%) and specificity (100%) of the rapid test, we estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0% to 73.4%) at baseline. At the first month follow-up, we observed a positivity of 68.0% (422/621) either to IgM (7.5%) or IgG (70.0%) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. After accounting for the study sampling effects and the test sensitivity and specificity, we estimated seroprevalence of 66.0% (95% CI: 62.0% to 70.1%). Here is important to highlight that the study baseline was carried out two months after the peak of the epidemic curve in Iquitos (Figure 1) .We performed a test-retest analysis in the 621 (86.7%) participants that completed the first month of follow-up (Figure 2) . Among them and after adjusting for the study sampling effects and the test's sensitivity and specificity, we estimated a COVID-19 testre-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0% to 68.3%). Likewise, we estimated an incidence of new COVID-19 exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9% to 3.2%).At baseline, we observed that the COVID-19 seroprevalence was associated with age, with subjects 18 to 29 years of age having significant lower COVID-19 seroprevalence than subjects <12 years of age (Prevalence ratio =0.85 [PR]; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.98; pvalue =0.029). Similarly, we observed that among those that completed the first-month follow-up, the rest-re-test seropositivity was associated with age, with subjects 18 to 29 years of age having significant lower COVID-19 seroprevalence than subjects <12 years of age (PR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.88; p-value =0.002). Additionally, we observed that among those that completed the first month of follow-up, the incidence of new COVID-19 exposures was associated with the origin of the participant being lower if the proceed from an urban area compared to from a rural area (PR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.68; pvalue =0.009). We attempt to progress to multivariable regression analysis, but AICs suggested that we keep the first-order models at each regression.To our knowledge, our study describes one of the highest seroprevalences of COVID-19 in the world. Previously, high seroprevalence estimates were reported in Mumbai, India, and Manaus, Brazil. In Mumbai, between June 29 and July 19, 2020, local researchers reported a seroprevalence between 55.1% and 61.4% using a population-based sample. 12 While in Manaus, using blood donors samples, researchers reported in July 2020 a seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between 44% and 66%. 19 With a population of around 426,000, the city of Iquitos was one of Peru's cities that was hit the harder by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the peak of Iquitos COVID-19 epidemic, in the first week of May, the regional authorities declared a major sanitary crisis with over 100 deaths per day, which added up to around 2500 registered deaths either confirmed (~1200) or suspected (~1300) and many more deaths due to natives unregistered burials. Despite government efforts, hospitals became overwhelmed, and medical oxygen shortages contributed mainly to these deaths. The tragic news reports gave us a sense of the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in Iquitos. Known as the world's largest city that cannot be reached by road, Iquitos suffered a COVID-19 epidemic of a catastrophic proportion, despite imprecisions in exact case counts and incomplete deaths attribution. Our study estimates show that the vast majority of Iquitos inhabitants were infected with COVID-19 before our baseline measure. However, the transmission did appear to continue at a low level, as seen by a slight increase in seroprevalence in the test-retest findings.Seroprevalence studies are essential to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections, mainly because of the high rate of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic that often undergo testing. 21 In an example, the USA reported that the estimated number of total COVID-19infections ranged between 6 to 24 times the number of confirmed cases, after accounting for the asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals that undergo testing. 22 Furthermore, seroprevalence studies are becoming essential to assess the risk of second and third waves of COVID-19 in all countries. For example, in mid-August, it was estimated that the pooled seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at a global level was 3.38% (IC95% 3.05-3.72), with Latin America having just 1.45% (IC95% 0.95-1.94). 23 This means that the risk of a second wave and a third one, in the absence of a vaccine, remained high and gave the marked variability of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among and within each geographic region; such waves also will vary substantially.approaches. While Brazil mostly decided to pursue herd immunity, Peru implemented one of the longest and strict lockdowns early in the pandemic. However, Iquitos was one of the last cities in Peru to enforce the lockdown policies and experienced one of the most tragic COVID-19 epidemics globally. In less than four weeks, Iquitos COVID-19 epidemic peak increasing 6-8 times in cases and 4-5 times in deaths reaching the higher mortality in Peru at the time. Currently, mortality rates in Iquitos have returned to baseline, which provides support for our findings.Iquitos appears to have become one of the first cities worldwide to surpass the herd immunity threshold, which has been estimated for COVID-19 to be 60-70% 25 . Although it is clear that also Iquitos paid a huge cost in terms of human suffering and deaths, our findings appear to support model-derived estimates for the level of seropositivity needed to provide herd immunity.

The virus rapidly spread all over the world originating an unprecedented pandemic. Within one year, about 80 million individuals were infected, leading to nearly 1.8 million deaths globally.Nearly 80% of patients affected by COVID-19 have only mild symptoms, recovering with conventional medical treatment, or even without any treatment (2, 3) . Around 20% of affected patients, however, develop respiratory distress, requiring oxygen therapy or even mechanical ventilation and nearly 10% of them need admission to intensive care units (ICUs) (4) . Moreover, mortality of late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in consequence of COVID-19 is remarkably high. Around 48-90% of patients intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation do not survive, a percentage significantly higher than that associated with intubation for other viral pneumonias, which is nearly 22% (5, 6) . In addition, for non-survivors, median duration from admission to hospital to death is 10 days (6) . Considering the high virulence of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective therapies, the high rates of mortality among critical patients, as well as the short period between admission to hospital and death, the development of new approaches that allow early assessment of which cases will likely become critical, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets are crucial.Alterations of plasma proteins are good indicators of pathophysiological changes caused by several diseases, including viral infections. In this sense, plasma proteomics is widely used for biomarker discovery (7) . Only a few studies so far have performed proteomic profiling of plasma/serum of COVID-19 patients (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Among them, some enrolled only a few COVID-19 patients (9, 11, 12) , while another one enrolled patients with no need of hospitalization that were compared with hospitalized ones, without distinguishing the severity of the disease among hospitalized patients (8) . The study by Overmyer et al. (10) evaluated plasma samples of 102 and 26 patients who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These samples were collected from April 6 th , 2020 through May 1 st , 2020 from patients admitted to Albany Medical Center in Albany, NY, USA, presenting severe respiratory symptoms probably related to COVID-19. The positive patients were divided into two severity groups, based on admission to an ICU or not. The authors identified proteins and metabolites offering pathophysiological insights of the disease, as well as offered therapeutic suggestions. The main limitation, however, was the lack of association of omics data with survival, which is the most remarkable outcome measure (10) . Here we profiled the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 by performing shotgun label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma samples from a cohort of 163 COVID-19 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (HEB), Brazil, between May 4 th , 2020 and July 4 th , 2020. Plasma samples were collected upon admission and patients were divided into 3 groups, based on the course of the disease, including both survivors (mild and severe patients) and non-survivors (critical patients). The proteomic findings were associated with the severity of the disease, as well as with the laboratory findings.This project was approved by the Ethical Committee of Bauru School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo (CAAE 31019820.8.0000.5417) upon acquiescence of the Nucleus of Teaching and Research of the HEB. Patients participated after they (or their relatives) signed an informed consent document. Figure 1 illustrates the main characteristics of the study that had a cohort design. All patients admitted to the HEB (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4 th and July 4 th , 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples and provided a signed informed consent document were included. Exclusion criterium was refusal to participate in the study by the patient or relative.All patients received the basic routine support established by the hospital that included oxygen support, invasive and non-invasive mechanic ventilation, use of antibiotics, use of vasopressor, use of anticoagulant, renal support therapy and use of corticoid if necessary.The patients were divided into 3 groups, based on the course of the disease, as follows: a) patients with mild symptoms that were discharged without admission to an ICU; b) patients with severe symptoms that were discharged after admission to an ICU; c) critical patients, who were admitted to an ICU and died (Figure 1 ).At admission, blood samples were collected for routine laboratory analyses at the hospital, as follows: white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, platelet count, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, ferritin, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (TGO), alanine aminotransferase (TGP), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), urea, creatinine, C-reactive protein (PCR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer. Shortly after collection, an aliquot of blood samples was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min and the plasma fraction was stored at -80°C for proteomic analysis.Initially, the samples were submitted to depletion, as previously described (13) . For this, 60 μL of plasma were diluted in 180 μL buffer A (Equil / Load / Wash; Agilent) and vortexed. In sequence, the solution was loaded on Filter Spin (0.22 um; Agilent) and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 min, collected in a tube and then followed to Multiple Affinity Removal Column (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Buffer A (Agilent) was used for washing and balancing column, while Buffer B (Agilent) was employed for elution of the bound proteins from the column. The lowabundance flow-through fraction was collected and stored at -20 ° C until analyses.In order that the samples followed to proteomic analyses, it was necessary to exchange the depletome buffer with 50 nM ammonium bicarbonate, using Amicon® Ultra 4 mL Centrifugal Filters (Merck). The final volume was 600 µL. The same volume of urea solution (8 mM Urea in 50 nM ammonium bicarbonate buffer) was added. Samples were then quantified (14) and a volume corresponding to 100 μg proteins was reduced with dithiothreitol (100 mM, 40ºC, 30 min) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (300 mM, 30 min, room temperature, in the dark). Then, samples were digested with Pierce™ Trypsin Protease, MS Grade (Thermo Scientific) at a ratio of 2: 100 (w / w trypsin / protein) for 14 h to 16 h at 37ºC. Digestion was quenched with 5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g, 6ºC for 30 min. The supernatant was recovered, and the samples were purified and concentrated using Pierce C18 Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific). In sequence, samples were quantified (14) , dried and stored for proteomic analyses..The analysis was performed in a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a Xevo Q-TOF G2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA), as previously described (15) .The raw data were processed with ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) 3.0.3. Data were extracted, aligned, and searched against the Uniprot human proteomic database, version 2020-01, appended with the enolase (S. Cerevisae) sequence. The ion accounting algorithm used has been described previously (16) . PLGS utilizes the drift time of mobility separated peptides to increase the specificity of alignment/association for precursor and product ions. PLGS also assigns peptide identifications to proteins through an iterative matching process (16) . Data were further processed with Microsoft Excel for additional data analysis and for the generation of figures and tables.Label-free proteomic quantification was performed using PLGS software. Difference in expression among the groups was calculated using Monte-Carlo algorithm embedded in the software and expressed as p<0.05 for proteins present in lower abundance and 1-p>0.95 for proteins present in higher abundance.The software CYTOSCAPE 3.7.2 (JAVA) was used to build networks of molecular interaction between the identified proteins, with the aid of ClueGo and ClusterMarker applications.The software GraphPad InStat (version 3.0 for Windows; GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, Ca, USA) was used. Data were checked for normal distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and for homogeneity using Bartlett´s test for the selection of the appropriate statistical test. The significance level, in all cases, was set at 5%.The number of patients included in each group was 76, 56 and 31 for mild, severe and critical patients, respectively, totaling 163 patients (82 men and 81 women). The median age of critical patients (73.0 years) was significantly higher than that in mild (51.0 years) and severe (56.5 years) patients that did not significantly differ from each other (Table  1) . Critical patients were significantly older than mild and severe ones, whose ages did not significantly differ. The percentages of females/males were 53.9/46.1, 53.6/46.4, and 35.5/64.5 for mild, severe and critical patients, respectively. The characteristics of the patients in each of the groups regarding comorbidity and lifestyle conditions are summarized in Table 1 .For full blood counts, no significant differences were found among the groups for red cells, hemoglobin and eosinophils. White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. On the other hand, lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. The other differences were not significant (p>0.05) ( Table 2) .As for the biochemical tests, no significant differences among the groups were found for TGP levels. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. The other differences were not significant (p>0.05) ( Table 2 ).Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the functional classification according to the biological processes with the most significant term, for the comparisons severe vs. mild, critical vs. mild and critical vs. severe, respectively. For the comparison severe vs. mild, the categories with the highest percentages of associated genes were: Phagocytosis (25%), Blood coagulation (14%), Endopeptidase inhibitor activity (9%), Antimicrobial humoral response (7%) and Acute inflammatory response (7%) (Figure 2 ). Regarding the comparison between critical vs. mild, the most affected categories were: Complement activation (29%), Blood coagulation (13%), Endopeptidase inhibitor activity (9%), Antibacterial humoral response (7%) and Acute inflammatory response (7%) (Figure 3) . As for the comparison critical vs. severe, the most affected categories were: Regulation of humoral immune response (22%), Blood coagulation (13%), Negative regulation of endopeptidase activity (12%), Antimicrobial humoral response (7%) and Acute inflammatory response (6%) (Figure 4 ).In the comparison between severe vs. mild patients ( Table 3) , 18 proteins were increased and 26 were exclusively found in the first. Proteins with the highest increases were Plasminogen-like protein (Q02325; 6.2-fold), Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON-1; P27169; 5.1-fold), Serum amyloid A-2 (P0DJI9; 3.2-fold) and A-1 (P0DJI8; 2.2-fold). Other increased proteins were C-reactive protein (CRP; P02741), Apoliprotein-C-III (P0265) and Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (P01011). Among the proteins exclusively found in the patients with severe symptoms are those related to antimicrobial humoral response, such as Galectin-10 (Gal-10; Q05315), also known as Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein, and blood coagulation, such as C4b-binding protein beta chain (P20851) and Coagulation factor XII (P00748). macroglobulin (∝2-M; P01023)] and acute phase inflammatory response (Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AGP-1; P02763) and 2 (AGP-2; P19652) and Transthyretin (P02766)]. Serotransferrin (P02787) was also decreased. Moreover, 55 proteins were only identified in the plasma collected from patients with mild symptoms ( Table 3 ). In the interaction subnetwork, proteins with change in expression interacted mainly with Microtubule-associated protein tau (P10636), Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit (P19838) and Histone-lysine Nmethyltransferase NSD2 (O96028) ( Figure 5) .As for the comparison between critical vs. mild patients ( Table 4 ), 46 proteins were increased and 8 proteins were exclusively found in the first. The proteins with the highest increases were Beta-2-microglobulin (P61769; 6.9-fold), Complement C1s subcomponent (P09871; 3.1-fold), Serum amyloid A-1 (P0DJI8; 2.7-fold) and Serum amyloid A-2 (P0DJI9; 2.2-fold). Other increased proteins were Retinol-binding protein 4 (P02753), Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP; P02774), Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1 (ITIH1; P19827) and H2 (ITIH2; P19823), Alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG; P04217), proteins involved in coagulation, such as Fibrinogen alpha, beta and gamma chains (P02671, P02679 and P02675, respectively), Kininogen-1 (P01042), Plasminogen (P00747), Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4; Q96S96) and Beta-2-glycoprotein (P02749), as well as several components of the complement system, such as Complement C4-A (P0C0L4), Complement C4-B (P0C0L5), Complement Factor B (P00751) and Complement Factor H (P08603). Endopeptidase inhibitors, such as Pregnancy zone protein (P20742), ∝2-M (P01023) and Alpha-1antitrypsin (∝1-AT; P01009) were also increased. Among the proteins uniquely found in the critical patients are Gal-10 (Q05315), as well as several proteins related to cardiovascular disease, such as Myoglobin (P02144), Asialoglycoprotein receptor 2 (ASGR2; P07307), Coatomer subunit epsilon (COPE; O14579) and V-set and transmembrane domain-containing protein 4 (VSTM4; Q8IW00).When critical patients were compared to severe ones, 47 proteins were increased and 10 proteins were exclusively found in the first. The proteins with the highest increases were associated with blood coagulation, such as Heparin cofactor 2 (P05546; 5-6-fold) and Plasminogen-like protein A (Q15195, 3.6-fold) as well as with humoral immune response, such as Retinol-binding protein 4 (P02753; 5.3-fold). Other increased proteins were also increased in the critical patients when compared to mild ones. Among them are VDBP, ITIH2, A1BG, proteins involved in coagulation, such as Fibrinogen alpha, beta and gamma chains (P02671, P02679 and P02675, respectively), as well as several components of the complement system, such as Complement C4-A (P0C0L4), Complement C4-B (P0C0L5) and Complement Factor B (P00751). Endopeptidase inhibitors, such as Pregnancy zone protein (P20742), ∝2-M and Alpha-1-antitrypsin (∝1-AT; P01009) were also increased. Other increased proteins in the critical patients when compared to the severe ones, not found in the comparison between critical vs. Table 5) .The present study was designed to find out biomarkers of prognosis for COVID-19 patients upon admission to hospital, as well as to search possible therapeutical targets. We had a prospective cohort design. All patients admitted to the HEB within a 2-month period were enrolled. Upon admission, we collected blood samples for laboratory and proteomic analyses and the results were related to the course of the disease, being the patients classified into 3 severity categories: mild (survivors, no need of admission to an ICU), severe (survivors, after admission to an ICU) or critical (non-survivors, after admission to an ICU). Critical patients who died were older than mild and severe ones and there was also a predominance of men, in-line with previous studies (6, 17, 18) . The higher susceptibility of males in comparison to females has been attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women or to stronger immune response with higher levels of cytokines in men (19, 20) . The most common comorbidity among the patients was hypertension, followed by diabetes (Table 1) , as has been shown in previous studies (6, 17, 18) . Alterations in the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), with consequent activation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor 3) inflammasome is the probable reason why hypertensive patients are more susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19 (21).In the laboratory exams ( Table 2) , the hemoglobin levels did not change among the groups, which is consistent with more recent findings showing no evidence of hemoglobin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection (22) . In the present study, severe and critical patients had increased plasma ferritin levels compared to mild ones, as has been reported in other studies (23, 24) . Ferritin is a mediator of immune dysregulation. Increased ferritin levels contribute to the cytokine storm via direct immune-suppressive and pro-inflammatory effects (25) . The increased levels of ferritin in severe and critical patients might be due to the lower expression of IREB2. This protein was found exclusively in the plasma of mild patients. It binds to iron-responsive elements (IRES) in the 5'-UTR of ferritin mRNAs, repressing translation (26) . Thus, increasing the expression of IREB2 might be a therapeutic possibility to reduce ferritin levels and, in turn, the severity of COVID-19 ( Table 6) . Critical patients had also decrease in serotransferrin when compared to mild ones, in-line with findings showing high ferritin and low transferrin levels associated with increased risk for ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation (27) .Hypercoagulability, with predominance of thrombosis in venous or arterial macro and microcirculation, worsens prognosis of COVID-19 (38-40). The etiology of COVID-19associated coagulopathy seems to follow Virchow's Triad, including abnormalities of blood flow, vascular injury and abnormalities within the circulating blood (38). Besides the formation of NETs, other mechanisms are potentially involved in the development of this systemic coagulopathy. Complement-mediated microvascular injury involving lung and skin, with marked deposition of C5b-9, C4d and Mannan-binding lectin serine protease (MASP)-2, suggesting activation of lectin-based and alternative pathways was reported among autopsy findings from decedents with severed COVID-19 and ARDS (41) . In the present study, several components of the complement system, as well as their activators were increased in critical patients, compared with those presenting mild symptoms ( Table 4) , such as Complement C1s subcomponent, Complement C4-A, Complement C4-B, Complement Factor B, Complement Factor H and Plasminogen (activates C1 and C5). Another potential mechanism involved in hypercoagulability is endothelial injury provoked by SARS-CoV-2 binding, membrane fusion and viral entry since endothelial cells are characterized by broad expression of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptors. This leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells and reticular inclusions (phospholipids and glycoproteins originated from rough endoplasmic reticulum that accumulate in endothelial cells in response to high levels of interferon) that damage endothelial cells and provoke expression of prothrombotic genes (38). In sites of endothelial injury, release of VDBP (increased in critical patients compared to severe and to mild ones) enhances the chemotactic effect of C5a, leading to attraction, aggregation and activation of monocytes and neutrophils, generating an oxidative burst (42) . Vitamin D competes for the same binding site on VDBP, reducing this chemotactic effect and controlling the course of the disease (43) . In the present study, D-dimer levels were significantly increased in plasma of severe and critical patients, compared to mild ones ( Table 2) , indicating a state of hypercoagulability in the first two groups. This laboratorial result is consistent with the proteomic findings, since D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product found in the peripheral blood, after fibrin is formed from fibrinogen and degraded by plasminogen activators (38).GELS and CAZA1 were exclusively found in mild patients, compared to severe and critical. These calcium-binding proteins scavenge circulating filamentous actin, thus possessing anti-inflammatory properties. For this reason, reduced levels of GELS have been shown in serum (9, 11) and plasma (10) of COVID-19 patients with worse outcomes, in-line with our results. In fact, GELS supplementation has been suggested as a potential therapy for COVID-19 (9) and a clinical trial of recombinant plasma form GELS is currently being conducted (NCT04358406) ( Table 6 ).A couple of interesting protective proteins were uniquely found in mild patients compared to critical ones ( Table 4) . One of them is SFTPD that participates in the turnover of pulmonary surfactant and modulates the action of leukocytes in immune response, contributing to lung´s defense against inhaled microorganisms (26) . Another protein, PON1, possesses aryadialkylphosphatase activity, being involved in the protection of low-density lipoproteins against oxidative damage and the subsequent series of events leading to the formation of atheroma (26) . It is also important for innate immune response and is reduced during hepatitis virus B infection, correlating with the functional status of the liver (47) . Moreover, in a recent study involving in silico discovery of candidate drugs against COVID-19, it was reported that genes correlated with ACE2 are enriched in aryadialkylphosphatase activity (48) . ULBP6 is a member of the MHC class I superfamily that binds and activates the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor, localized in the surface of immune cells, mediating natural killer cell cytotoxicity (49) . NKG2D ligands play a central role in immunological control. SNPs within the ULBP6 gene have a profound influence on the clinical outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (50) and are also associated to diabetic nephropathy (51) and alopecia areata (52) . Moreover, arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 increases the affinity of the NGK2D/ULBP6 interaction, thus reducing NKG2D-mediated activation (53) . It is possible that critical patients might have this polymorphism leading to increased affinity and, for this reason, ULBP6 was not found in their plasma, thus leading to impaired immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 6) . Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the occurrence of this polymorphism in patients with critical and mild symptoms of COVID-19 to confirm this hypothesis.On the other hand, some proteins were only present in critical patients compared to mild ones ( Table 4 ) and their trend to increased expression might be associated with the poorer clinical outcome in the first. Among them are several proteins related to cardiovascular disease. One of them is myoglobin, an early biochemical marker of acute myocardial infarction, although non-specific since it is present also in skeletal muscle (54) . Its presence in the blood of critical patients might indicate damage to cardiac or skeletal muscles. Other proteins in this category are COPE, increased in patients with atherosclerosis (55) and ASGR2, whose deficiency reduces non-HDL cholesterol and activates platelets (56) .According to our findings, potential therapies to COVID-19 might include supplementation with plasma form GELS, increasing the expression of POLR3D in initial stages of infection, administration of antibodies against CLCs, increasing the expression of IREB2, increasing pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins, increasing in PON1 and modulation of the interaction between ULBP6/NKG2D receptor ( Table 6 ).In conclusion, our results indicate several plasma proteins involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 that might be useful to predict the prognosis of the disease, when analyzed upon admission of the patients to hospital. These proteins are mainly associated with inflammation, immune response, and blood coagulation. Targeting their pathways might constitute potential new therapies for the disease, which should be evaluated in further studies. Validation of some of the identified candidates is currently being conducted.

Its absence in severe and critical patients might be responsible for the higher plasma ferritin levels found in these patients in the laboratory exams. Ferritin is a mediator of immune dysregulation. Increased ferritin levels contribute to the cytokine storm via direct immune-suppressive and pro-inflammatory effects (25) .Increasing the expression of IREB2 might help reducing ferritin levels and, in turn, the severity of COVID-19.was found exclusively in patients with mild symptoms.Calcium-binding protein that scavenges circulating filamentous actin, thus possessing anti-inflammatory properties. Reduced levels of GELS have been shown in serum (9, 11) and plasma (10) of COVID-19 patients with worse outcomes.GELS supplementation has been suggested as a potential therapy for COVID-19 (9) and a clinical trial of recombinant plasma form GELS is currently being conducted (NCT04358406). POLR3D was found exclusively in patients with mild symptoms.This enzyme is involved in innate immune response, playing a key role in limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and viruses. It is involved in the production of type I interferon (26) . Its increased expression might be associated with more favorable prognosis of COVID-19.Increasing the expression of POLR3D in the initial stages of the disease.SFTPD was only identified in mild patients compared to critical ones.Participates in the turnover of pulmonary surfactant and modulates the action of leukocytes in immune response, contributing to lung´s defense against inhaled microorganisms (26 This enzyme possesses aryadialkylphosphatase activity, being involved in the protection of low-density lipoproteins against oxidative damage and the formation of atheroma (26) . It is also important for innate immune response (47) . In a recent study involving in silico discovery of candidate drugs against COVID-19, it was reported that genes correlated with ACE2 are enriched in aryadialkylphosphatase activity (48) .Increasing the activity of PON1.Modulating the interaction ULBP6/NKG2D receptor.Gal-10 was identified exclusively in critical and severe patients, compared to the mild ones. It was also increased in critical patients, compared to severe ones, i.e., it showed a doseresponse pattern, with increasing levels accompanying the increase in the severity of the disease.CLC is a hallmark of eosinophil death. It suffers a phase transition to a crystalline state, originating the Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) that promote type 2 immunity. Moreover, CLCs have proinflammatory effects in the lungs, leading to an influx of neutrophils and monocytes after 6 and 24 h, respectively, after injection, which is accompanied by the production of large quantities of IL-6 and TNFα in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of IL-1β and of CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant) in lung tissue. Furthermore, CLCs boost adaptative immunity to co-administered antigens (57) . Thus, the increase in Gal-10 in critical and severe patients, in a dose-response fashion, might be associated to the ""cytokine storm"" that is characteristic of the poorer outcomes of COVID-19. Recently, a preclinical study showed that antibodies against Gal-10 to preformed CLCs completely dissolved the crystals present in the mucus within 2 hours (57).","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-02",1

The World Health Organization recognizes at least three types of coronavirus capable of generating epidemic outbreaks, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus [2] . These viruses are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently described coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3] .Since the first reports of a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China on December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 has quickly spread across the globe [1, 4] , infecting more than 40 million people and causing more than 1.1 million deaths worldwide until October 20 th , 2020. One of the main reasons the virus has spread so rapidly is due to droplet transmission from both symptomatic and asymptomatic people, making it difficult to test, trace and isolate new cases effectively [2] .Understanding the transmission dynamics in different settings can provide important clues about the advance of the pandemic, especially in areas with unequal access to health services, high population density and a high burden of neglected tropical diseases [5, 6] .In this study, we present the findings of an interim analysis of the epidemiological situation in Ecuador, describing the clinical characteristics and epidemiological behavior of the first 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. standard of care treatment for patients with COVID-19. The information from those reports were posteriorly anonymized ensuring no sensitive information was shared with any member of our research project. According to the international good clinical and research practices and in accordance with Ecuadorian law, observational studies that do not jeopardize the rights of patients are exempt from obtaining full ethical approval.We conducted a country-wide population-based analysis of the epidemiology of COVID-19, using case data reported in Ecuador between 27 February and 18 April 2020 (S1 Fig). The database comprised men, women and children from 0 to 100 years old with a positive RT-PCR COVID-19 diagnosis, using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, during the first 54 days of the outbreak, including the first imported and the subsequent community-acquired cases.The study was conducted in Ecuador, a country located in South America, bordering with Colombia to the North, Peru to the South/East and the Pacific Ocean to the West. The country is divided into four geographical regions: 1) the coastal region, 2) the highlands or sierra region, 3) the Amazon region and 4) the insular region (Galapagos Islands). The population of Ecuador was estimated to be 17,510,643 inhabitants based on the latest available projections for 2020 [7] . Ethnicity in Ecuador is distributed as follows: 7.1% indigenous (1,059,863), 7.2% Afro Ecuadorian (1,077,878), 79.3% Mestizo (11, 910 ,702), 6.1% self-reported white or Caucasians (909,741) and 0.4% other groups according to the 2010 national census [8] .We obtained socio-demographic variables, such as age, sex, marital status and place of residence from the Ministry of Health (MoH) registries. Clinical data including date of onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis and date of death, as well as the presence of comorbidities, pregnancy and influenza vaccination history were also obtained. Epidemiological information including city and province of registration, elevation, occupation, travel history and institution of diagnosis were analyzed. We also obtained the results of tests performed nationwide up until 18 th April 2020 and developed testing trends per days, including positive, negative, suspected and not processed tests. The information was transferred to our research team after presenting a formal petition and signing a confidentiality agreement with the MoH to protect patient's rights.From the online self-reporting tool delivered through the MoH surveillance department, clinical information about signs and symptoms, as well as civil status and educational attainment were obtained from the 856 outpatients (COVID-19 positive) that completed the voluntary self-reporting tool.The number of deaths used in this analysis were officially reported as COVID-19 using the 10 th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code: U07.1 COVID-19, virus identified, U07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified.In order to estimate the number of additional deaths that were not diagnosed as COVID-19 during March and April 2020, we compared the COVID-19 database with the National Death Registry, including fatalities registered as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ICD J80).This study included 9,468 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and the first 474 officially reported deaths.In terms of the number of patients required (x) to complete the self-reported symptoms tool distributed by the MoH, the sample size (n) and margin of error (E) were given by the following formula:Where N is the population size (9,468), (r) is the fraction of expected responses (50%), and Z(c/100) is the critical value for the confidence level (c).The total number of completed answers required according to the calculations was 621 in order to achieve a 99% confidence level. Through a convenience-based sampling technique 856 patients were included. The self-reporting tool was sent to all patients not hospitalized who were under epidemiological surveillance by the MoH and we included only those who voluntarily agree to provide information on educational attainment, symptomatology and civil status.The overall incidence (attack rate), mortality rate, and case fatality rate were computed according to the entire population at risk living in a canton or a province. Information from the first 9,468 COVID-19 confirmed patients in Ecuador were compared with the population at risk, obtained from the publicly available canton-and province-level sex-specific projections. Measurements of frequency (counts, absolute and relative percentages), central tendency (median), dispersion (interquartile range) and absolute differences were calculated for all categorical and continuous variables. Case fatality rates (CFR%) were computed using the number of cases officially reported while the dichotomized variable (alive or died) was used as an outcome of the confirmed cases. CFR% were adjusted to mitigate the effect in crude CFR% estimation. We adjusted the naive estimates of CFR% to account for the delay from hospitalization-to-death for those cases that were fatal using a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio proposed by Russel et.al 2020.Positive test rates (PTR%) were calculated using the number of positive test results divided by the total number of tests conducted. The attack and crude mortality rates per canton and province were computed per 100,000 inhabitants. Important landmark dates are included in S5 Fig. To examine associations, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were computed for all age groups using female cases as the reference level. We performed a relative risk (RR) analysis of the total number of expected cases by the population at risk in all the groups to obtain the likelihood of dying due to COVID-19. In order to control for the effects of sex, age and comorbidities, an adjusted logistic regression was performed using the final outcome (alive or died) as a response variable. The geographical distribution of residence was divided into high (> = 2,500 m) and low altitude (< 2,500 m), in order to analyze the differences within these populations using a t-test with a 0.05 significance level.The number of years of healthy life lost due to COVID-19 among the reported cases were calculated using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY). DALYs are the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) caused by the consequences of the disease [9] . YLL were calculated from the number of deaths per age group multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death. We used the life expectancy table developed by the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, with a life expectancy at birth of 86 for both males and females [10] . To estimate YLD, the total number of cases in the study period was multiplied by the average duration of the disease reported by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 database and the disability weights corresponding to the different degrees of severity of infectious diseases included in the 2013 Global Burden of Disease study [11, 12] .There were 9,468 positive cases of COVID-19 and 474 officially reported deaths in Ecuador from 27 February-18 April 2020 (54-day period). 99.3% of COVID-19 patients were Ecuadorians (n = 9,400), 0.30% (n = 44) were from other countries in Latin America and the other 0.40% (n = 24) were either from Europe, North America or Asia.Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5,247) of all cases with an incidence rate of 60.5 per 100,000, while women accounted for 44.6% of cases (n = 4,221) and an incidence of 47.2 per 100,000. The median age of COVID-19 patients was 42 (IQR: 32-56) in men and 39 (IQR: 30-54) in women. The median age of patients who had died from COVID-19 was 62 (IQR: 51-70) in men and 65 (IQR: 56-74) in women.We also found that men were more likely to die from COVID-19 in almost every age group (Fig 1) , although case fatality rate for patients aged between 85-94 was higher amongst women (Table 1) .Ethnicity. The majority of COVID-19 cases occurred among Mestizos 78% (n = 7,367), followed by indigenous 0.79% (n = 75), Caucasians 0.84% (n = 40) and Afro-Ecuadorians/ Black with~0.1% (n = 16) ( Table 2) .Education attainment and marital status. In Ecuador, the results of the demographic survey (n = 856) show that 0.7% (n = 6) of COVID-19 patients had not completed their elementary school, 1.9% (n = 16) reported a complete elementary school education, 5.8% (n = 50) had not completed their high school education and 22.5% (n = 193) had completed their entire high school cycle. At least 6.8% (n = 58) are technicians, 46.3% (n = 396) have completed their undergraduate degree and 16.0% (n = 137) have formal postgraduate training. In terms of civil status 39.3% (n = 336) are single, 38% (n = 327) are married, 13% (n = 114) are cohabitating with their partners, 5.4% are divorced (n = 46), 1.3% widows (n = 11) and other responses 3% (n = 22).Occupation and work-related risk. The results of COVID-19 mortality by occupation showed that 19% of infected people (n = 1,800) are health professionals (Table 3) . From this group medical doctors (n = 876) were the most affected professionals in Ecuador, representing at least 9.3% of all reported cases (Fig 2) Nurses are the second most affected group with 3.3% representing at least 309 people ( Table 2 ). The majority of people testing positive work in manual labor (n = 1,390). In terms of fatality, the small number of inmates seem to be at the highest risk of dying, with a RR of 7.75 [p value: 0.020, 1.3-44.0], followed by retired elderly people with a RR of 5.6 [p value: <0.0001, 3.5-9.0] and unemployed with 4.47 [p value: <0.0001, 2.8-6.9]. The results from the likelihood of dying is increasingly higher among 'blue collar' workers, civil servants (police officers, soldiers, members of the navy, firefighters and other agents), unemployed, retirees and prisoners (Table 3) . Although a small number of cases were reported among politicians (n = 18), the CFR% for this group was zero, followed by nurses (0.3%), other health care professionals (0.7%) and medical doctors with a CFR% of 1.6%.Vaccination history, comorbidities and pregnancy history among COVID-19 patients. The current analysis of the immunization history of influenza showed that 99.1% of patients (n = 9,384) did not report any vaccination history in the last year and only 0.9% Table 2 ).In our study, 1.4% of women (n = 60) were pregnant and 4 of them died (6.7%) due to COVID-19. The RR of pregnant women dying was not found to be statistically significant (RR: 2.05 [0.785 to 5.36] p value: 0.14).The median age of COVID-19 patients reporting comorbidities in Ecuador was 59 (IQR: 49-68) years old,while those with no comorbidities had a median age of 42 years old (IQR: 32-55). When the presence of comorbidities was incorporated in an adjusted logistic regression model, the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years old increased the risk of dying by almost 130% (Table 4) .Symptoms assessment. The most common symptom reported among COVID-19 patients in Ecuador was fatigue or general tiredness (53.2%), followed by headaches (43%), and dry cough (41.7%). 37.1% of the patients reported loss of taste (ageusia), 36.1% reported loss of smell (anosmia) and 35% reported muscle and joint pain (S2 Fig). The median time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the time before receiving medical attention was four days (IQR: 1-8 days). The average time between onset of symptoms in patients and case notification was nine days (IQR: 5-14 days). When observed retrospectively using the date of the onset of symptoms, 29 undocumented patients were already sick but only 6 were diagnosed, a trend that continued to be high until March 24 th , the day when strict government interventions were implemented in Ecuador (Fig 3) . Epidemiological analysis Contact tracing. The results from the self-reporting tool (n = 856) suggested that 42.6% (n = 365) of patients did not have contact with anyone after diagnosis, 11.8% (n = 101) might have contacted 1 to 5 people, 4.9% (n = 42) might have contacted 6 to 10 people, and 5.8% (n = 50) might have contacted more than 10 people after diagnosis. The other 34.9% (n = 299) of the cohort did not recall such information.Travel history and nationality. In Ecuador, 99.3% of the patients were Ecuadorians (n = 9,400), 0.30% (n = 44) were from Latin-America and the other 0.40% (n = 24) were either from Europe, North America or Asia. In terms of the number of imported cases, at least 11 patients with confirmed COVID-19 had travelled from 5 countries, while at least 132 cases had a recognized epidemiological connection with people who had travelled to at least one of more than 25 different countries (S3 Fig) Days since diagnosis. Among 9,468 patients, the median time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the time of medical attention was 4 days (IQR: 1-8 days). However, from the onset of symptoms to the day of notification 9 days elapsed (IQR: 5-14 days).Only 6 cases had been diagnosed at the end of February. However, when observed retrospectively using the date of the onset of diagnosis, 29 patients were already sick (Fig 3) . Unconfirmed cases continued to be high until 24 th of March, the day when a lock-down was implemented in Ecuador (Fig 3) .The median time elapsed from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 11 days (IQR: 7-15 days) for the 474 patients that died due to COVID-19 in Ecuador (S6 Fig). The median time between first day of medical attention until death was 5 days (IQR: 2-8 days). The median time between case notification and death was 4 days (IQR: 2-7 days). Attack rate (confirmed cases per 100,000 people). The overall attack rate was 51.1 per 100,000 people. Sex-specific attack rates of COVID-19 was 60.5 per 100,000 for men and 47.2 per 100,000 for women. In terms of age-adjusted attack rates per 100,000, the lowest attack rate was found among children from 0-4 years old (2.86 per 100,000), while the highest attack rate was found in patients aged between 55 and 59 years (111 per 100,000).Mortality rates (confirmed deaths per 100,000 people). The overall confirmed mortality rate was 2.7 per 100,000 people. This value ranged from 0.1 to 20.1 per 100,000 people at risk, with 90-95 years of age being the most affected group with a crude age specific mortality rate of 20 per 100,000 people. From the official reports, 474 deaths were recorded as COVID-19 (RT-PCR confirmed).During March and April 2020, Ecuador experienced a unique increment in its overall mortality. In 2018, at least 23,973 deaths were officially reported between January to April, in the following year, 25,061 and during January to April 15 th , 2020, 29,392 were registered, indicating an increase in more than 15% compared with the previous year. The increase over the same period from 2018 to 2019 was just 4.4%.We analyzed the total number of deaths included in the National Registry. From March 1 st to April 18 th , 2020, 4,780 reported deaths were related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Ecuador (37%). From the total of ARDS-related deaths, 1,283 were probable COVID-19 (U07.2 clinically-epidemiologically diagnosed), 809 were registered as suspected COVID-19 (U07.2) and 474 confirmed COVID-19 cases (U07.1). Table 3 . Case fatality rate (%), relative risk and risk likelihood due to COVID-19 in Ecuador by occupation. Relative risk was estimated using White-Collar jobs as a reference group. P-values below or equal to 0.05 were considered significant. We found an 11-day lag (IQR: 7-15 days) between COVID-19 cases symptoms onset and the reported number of COVID-19 related deaths (S4 Fig). Basic reproduction number (R0). We calculated the basic reproduction number (R0) for the entire country using the exponential growth criteria. During the first months of the pandemic while numbers were increasing exponentially, the R0 was found to be 3.54 (CI: 3.46-3.63). When computing the R0 by provinces, we found R0 values as high as 3.68 (CI: 3.18-4.28) in Los Rios, followed by 3.68 (CI: 2.53-5.28) in Esmeraldas and 3.67 (CI: 3.56-3.78) in Test performed. In Ecuador, since the start of the outbreak, a total of 19,875 tests have been carried out nationwide, which results in 1,126 tests per million inhabitants. Of the accumulated total, 48% of these were positive and less than 0.5% were not conclusive or suspicious. There were 12,751 unprocessed tests up to April 18 th , 2020 even though nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken ( S5 Fig and S1 Table) .The positive testing rate % (PTR%) was 43 Result by region and elevation. We found that coastal regions had higher attack rates than the highlands (p-value: 0.011) and living above 2,500 meters was associated with a lower risk of mortality (RR: 0.63 [CI 95% 0.50-0.79]), compared to populations living at lower altitudes (S6 Fig). Daily new cases and deaths by province. Galapagos (157.3/100,000), Guayas (146.9/ 100,000), Cañar (49.1/100,000), Santa Elena (37.8/100,000) and El Oro (35.6/100,000) were the provinces with the greatest attack rate per 100,000 (S6 Fig). In terms of the crude mortality rate, the provinces of El Oro (7.82/100,000), Chimborazo (4.7/100,000), Guayas (4.44/100,000), Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas (4.14/100,000) and Bolivar (2.85/100,000) are the provinces with greatest mortality crude rate per 100,000 (S6 and S7 Figs). Burden of disease analysis. In terms of years of life lost prematurely (YLL), COVID-19 predominantly caused mortality among older adults, especially men. From the start of the outbreak at least 3,207 years were lost prematurely among women and more than 8,847 among men. COVID-19 also caused a loss of 12,112 healthy life years, with an average of 1.27 DALY per case. From the estimated burden of COVID-19, 99.5% is attributable to years of life lost due to premature mortality, with an average of 25.4 YLL per death. The population in Ecuador between 20 to 64 years old contributed to 74.4% of disease burden, followed by the elderly with 24.2% of the burden (S1 Data).Ecuador has been the worst hit country in the Latin American region from the COVID-19 pandemic [13] . Since the first case confirmed in Ecuador on 27 Feb 2020, at least 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were officially registered over a 54-day period.The images of corpses in the streets and the difficulty of burying the dead occupied the main pages of all the newspapers around the world [13, 14] . Overcrowded hospitals and laboratories were overwhelmed by an excessive number of cases, causing a confirmed toll of 474 COVID-19 related deaths and 809 registered suspicious deaths up to April 18 th 2020 [15] . On April 18, the National Emergency Operations Committee reported 1,061 patients discharged from hospital, 369 hospitalized patients, and 7,564 COVID-19 positives cases, who were stable in-home isolation [16] . Data from the region indicates that Ecuador, along with Brazil, Mexico and Peru are among the top ten most affected countries in Latin America, but when excess mortality is taking into account, Ecuador ranks 1 st worldwide in the numbers of deaths per million inhabitants [17] [18] [19] .At the beginning of the pandemic, Ecuador registered a single case on February 27, when in reality, looking retrospectively, there were already 29 undetected cases. Only two weeks later, only 11 cases were officially registered, but data shows that at least 119 cases were actually circulating within the country (Fig 3) . After 54 days, a total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 officially reported deaths, with a sex distribution (55.4% men) that was similar to that reported in China (58% men) and Italy (59.8% men) [20] [21] [22] .According to the high PTR% found in Ecuador, the excess mortality that was not correctly diagnosed and reported as COVID-19 and other variables; we inferred that the epidemiological surveillance system and contact tracing strategies were not correctly implemented. At the beginning of the outbreak, every confirmed patient was followed and tracked by the health authority. However, when the number of new COVID-19 cases began to increase exponentially, the system's capacity was overstretched. At the same time, testing capacities were collapsed and only those patients who presented symptoms, those who were in contact with any positive case or those lucky enough to get tested under the surveillance program obtained the diagnosis.The mortality rate for women (3.35%) is almost half of that for men (6.86%). The median age was 42 in men and 39 in women and the age group most affected was the group from 19-50 years old representing 59.6% of the entire cohort, almost doubling the same age group reported in Italy (24.0%) and very similar to the age distribution from China [21, 22] . The reason behind these trends might be due to the fact that Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world. According to the latest data, Italy has 14 million residents over the age of 65 (22%) with an average age of 45.7 years, while in Ecuador the average population is 26.6 years old [7, 23, 24] .In terms of age, the patients between 0 and 50 years old reported a CFR of 1.6%, compared to 0.4% in Italy, 0.4% in China and 0.6% in Spain from the same age groups [24] [25] [26] . When adjusting for sex, age and the presence of comorbidities, mortality increased significantly among elderly men, which is consistent with other regional studies [21, 27] .The existence of comorbidities is linked with augmented age and therefore increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The age of patients reporting comorbidities in Ecuador was higher than those without comorbidities. In terms of risk, patients with comorbidities had a CFR% of 10.3% in women and 16.9% in men, higher than those without comorbidities and in both sexes CGF% averaged 4%. These findings are equivalent to previous studies that have shown that the presence of comorbidities increases the risk in COVID-19 patients to be admitted to the ICU or die due to this disease [27, 28] .In terms of ethnicity, it is important to point out that self-identified Montubios and Indigenous had a CFR% of 14% and 9% respectively, which is surprisingly higher than Mestizos (6%) and other ethnic groups living in Ecuador. This is probably due to reduced healthcare access for vulnerable groups [29] . For influenza, ethnic minorities have the highest estimated fatality rate, most likely due to their social determinants of health, social inequalities and reduced access to health care, especially in rural areas [30, 31] .Although the clinical features of COVID-19 are widely studied in moderate and severe hospitalized patients, information on patients with a less severe symptoms is scarce. We collected self-reported data on symptoms from a sample of patients in home isolation. 53% presented with fatigue, 43% headaches and 42% a dry cough which is in agreement with studies from other settings. However a higher proportion of patients reported ageusia (37%) and anosmia (36%), when compared to studies from China (5.1% and 5.6%, respectively) and Italy reporting anosmia in 19.4% of patients [32, 33] .In January, alarms went off with the first suspected COVID-19 case in Ecuador, alarms that denoted the poor readiness of the public health system that took more than 15 days to rule-out a highly suspicious COVID-19 patient, who died with the diagnosis of hepatitis B and atypical pneumonia [34, 35] . At the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized the importance of testing capabilities in order to improve contact tracing and diseases detection worldwide (S5 Fig). Nevertheless, Ecuador has not enough capabilities to perform molecular diagnosis (RT-PCR), limiting epidemiological surveillance strategies and contact tracing [17, 36] . For this reason, the number of samples taken exceeds the local molecular diagnosis capabilities, resulting in testing delays [13, 14] . Despite the limitations, in some areas of the country, especially richer areas, such as Samborondon, testing rates are as high as those seen in Iceland or even close to those seen in the US (S1 Table and S1 Data) [37] . This trend might be driven by those patients who were able to pay for their diagnosis and their medical treatment. Therefore, their high attack rate is interpreted as better access to health resources and that is why mortality is also low among these cantons. Although social status and monthly income was not assessed, in Ecuador, blue collar workers have less monetary income than health care and white-collar workers [38, 39] . In Ecuador, it is hypothesized that labor workers and the unemployed have less access to health services, therefore the high case fatality rates among these groups is significantly higher than those in more privileged positions such as politicians, medical doctors or health workers (Table 2) . These results could indicate that poor working conditions, poverty and therefore limited access to health services could be linked to the high mortality rates reported among the most vulnerable groups, a situation described previously [40] . The working environment and the confinement was also associated with a high prevalence of persons presenting at least mild symptoms of anxiety (58.1%) and depression (52.6%) [41] .Low testing capabilities and high number of suspicious COVID-19 deaths likely distort the calculation of age-specific attack and mortality rates across cantons. We found a median delay of two days (IQR: 1-7) between the day of sampling to the day of notification and a low number of reported tests (test per million people and the overall count) in the region [17] . Therefore, the lack of molecular testing capabilities causes a high positive test rate comparing with other countries in the region [17] . This impacts the ability of contact tracing and other prevention strategies to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission [42] . As evidenced by the high R0 in the provinces closest to the start of the pandemic, where prevention measures were weak and scarce, due to multiple social and political factors. Likewise, other Latin American countries with deficient health policies and lack of timely actions, such as Peru and Brazil, obtained a higher average transmission potential of 2.97 [43, 44] and 3.1 [45, 46] , respectively.In terms of elevation we found that people living in cantons and provinces located in the highlands had lower attack rates and lower mortality rates than the populations living at lower altitudes. We suggest that the virus spreads faster at lower altitudes due to demographic and cultural differences. We hypothesized that harsh weather (cold and windy) invites people to stay indoors while at sea level and due to warmer tropical climate, people tend to be more socially active and have greater mobility than the highlands [47] . Additionally, demographic density is lower in the highlands according to the latest INEC data in Ecuador, a situation that might influence the speed of the spread in terms of viral transmission.Analyzing the years of life lost due to SARS-CoV-2 is challenging due to the uncertainty around the length of the different phases of the disease and the clinical spectrum of the severity of the disease. These uncertainties make it difficult to estimate disability weights that are a crucial component for the DALY calculation. In our study 99.5% of the burden was attributable to the years of life lost due to premature mortality among the study population, with an average of 25.4 YLL per death, and 1.27 DALY per each case of COVID-19. Even though COVID-19 related deaths are higher among elderly populations in developing countries with weakened health systems, mortality is also overstretched among younger populations [48] .The limitations of this study are the lack of specific data during the given time period regarding the type of comorbidities and the presence of clinical manifestations during the initial evaluation. This limitation is also evident when reviewing the follow-up file, which includes only the date of death and the date when the case was discharged and closed. Moreover, the database does not indicate the severity of the disease and whether or not they required hospitalization. Another important fact to consider is that testing was done mainly in symptomatic people diagnosed COVID-19 cases, probably because of limited test availability.This is the first study of the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Ecuador. The results demonstrate the vulnerability of the health system to contain, mitigate, treat and adequately diagnose this type of new viral disease that spread across the country at a speed that exceeds the speed of response. We found that there were a high number of COVID-19 infections among medical personnel, which likely occurred during the first weeks of the outbreak in the Ecuador. Although the attack rate was high, mortality in this group was very low, which could be due to greater access to healthcare. We also found that the occupations of patients and whether they were unemployed was strongly associated with overall mortality due to COVID-19 in Ecuador, suggesting that poverty is an important driver of the final outcome for this disease. Lastly, strengthening of community-based surveillance and contact tracing response capacities is essential to prevent further advance of the disease within the community. Table.

Social distancing affects people in reducing the probability of encounters between infected 56 and susceptible individuals. Thus, we simulate this condition by reducing the infection rates β, β A , 57 β I and β Im for the specific age groups. Due to imperfect application of social distancing intervention, 58 each intervention is controlled by a success rate. 59 The fact that the model is stratified by age groups opens a new range of different scenarios, e.g.,Another intervention possibility is when tests are applied to the individuals, and a quarantine 71 is applied where symptomatic cases are isolated with a probability σ and asymptomatic with a 72 probability σ A , this condition is labeled as TQ-C. In this scenario, we modify the susceptible flow 73 equation toIf we only isolate the severe cases (scenario TQ), we change the susceptible individuals flow 75 equation toThe scenario where we only isolate the severe cases is termed TS, and we modify the susceptible 77 flow equation toThe exposed, vaccinated, and falsely immunized are changed just like the susceptible flow, 79 depending on the scenario.The Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the model with their respective values and 81 references.The parameter β is calculated from the previous definition of R 0 value, the asymptomatic value 83 f A , the probability of developing symptoms ρ S , and the incubation time τ inc withFrom 28 March 2020 to 4 April 2020 (day 87 to day 107), social distancing becomes more 109 widespread, and therefore we consider a social distancing of all age groups. From 5 April 2020 to 110 14 May 2020, the interventions become more restrictive, and now the isolation of cases extends to 111 symptomatic cases when confirmed by testing. A higher isolation rate is considered between the dates To better fit the model to the real notification data, we estimated R 0 = 2.6, the reduction factor 119 of the social distancing to be 0.72, the success in isolating symptomatic cases to be 0.60, while 0.20 for 120 the asymptomatic cases. Also, we considered that the first cases were imported on 11 February 2020..Reporting rate of severe cases (SARI) are 96% of the real cases, accounting for small under-reporting, 122 whereas under-reporting of notified ARI disease cases are 20% of the actual number of ARI cases.The number of SARI cases notified in the city of Rio de Janeiro, daily aggregated, is evaluated 124 from January to the end of October of 2020. Regarding the ARI notified cases, the data is evaluated 125 from January to the end of September of 2020. This data range is considered an acceptable range to 126 avoid the effect of dramatic sub notification due to notification delay. Vaccination schedules are still being studied for SARS-CoV-2, with different strategies being applied 129 due to diverse factors [10] . However, we expect that this schedule might closely follow other 130 respiratory syndromes' vaccination, like influenza. In this work, we will consider an effective, tight, 131 and compromised vaccination program to assess if this would be enough to halt the pandemic 132 effectively. Therefore, our vaccination schedule is comprised of 4 phases, each lasting for 15 days.As our model is stratified by age groups, we also observe how the different interventions change 151 the number of deaths and hospitalizations by age, as shown by Fig.3 . The quarantine of all cases, the 152 social distancing of all individuals, and the combination of this intervention with the quarantine of 153 symptomatic cases are the three most effective interventions, as also seen by Fig.2 . In all cases, despite 154 isolating or distancing different age groups, the pattern of hospitalizations and deaths regarding age 155 groups is very similar. The major difference is observed in delaying the pandemic peak and the 156 pandemic's length, broadening its profile through time, but not through age groups. Hospitalizations 157 are centered around older groups, mainly individuals around 60 years old and older, in all interventions.All SARI and ARI notification data are publicly available at OpenDataSUS database, maintained by the Ministry of Health, located at https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-31",1

Surveillance and testing are fundamental in controlling viral spread and understanding pandemic evolution. Detection of viral RNA by qPCR is the gold standard for diagnosis of acute infections. Measurement of humoral responses has been used as a complement to nucleic acid testing, for diagnosis of suspected cases with negative qPCR results, and for detection of acute or past infections in asymptomatic cases [1] . However, serology became an essential tool for the management of the pandemic, including seroprevalence assessment of immunity in the population, measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent patients and antibody response upon vaccination [2, 3] .Antibody mediated immunity is thought to protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection by interfering with viral entry and/or viral replication. Antibody responses appear within the first week of symptoms onset in about 30 to 40% of infections and, in most cases, simultaneous or close seroconversion for IgM and IgG were observed [1, 4] . Antibodies have been detected in more than 90% of infections after the third week of symptoms onset [5] . However, the duration and degree to which recovery from COVID-19 disease, or asymptomatic infection, confers prolonged immunity from reinfection is still unclear, even among individuals with high antibody titers [6, 7] . We are still learning about the dynamic nature of antibody response linked to severe, mild, and asymptomatic COVID-19 manifestations and, as the pandemic progresses, algorithms and strategies to implement serologic testing in different epidemiological settings are under evaluation. For understanding this complex process, it is essential to have highly specific and sensitive serologic assays [8, 9] . Based on the urgent need to attain reliable tests that measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we redirected resources of a basic molecular virology laboratory, as part of a national task force for the emergency, for the development and production of an affordable and robust serologic assay for Argentina and neighboring countries. The COVIDAR serologic test was generated early after the first COVID-19 case in Argentina, and over half million tests have been already produced and distributed for free in the country.An important application of serology measurement is the assessment of humoral responses to vaccines and identification of plasma from convalescent donors for possible therapies [10] [11] [12] . During the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, convalescent plasma therapy was used compassionately and has since been implemented in the United States and many other countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Randomized clinical trials to evaluate the usefulness of convalescent plasma in different stages of the disease are ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov). Success of this intervention likely increases with the antibody titer of the donor as recently shown [15, 16] . Thus, it is important to screen potential convalescent donors to select plasma with the highest antibody titers. This screening can be accomplished by measuring the amount of antibodies by titration and defining the virus-neutralizing activity of the plasma. However, the lack of standardization and correlation between antibody levels and neutralizing capacity of antibodies complicates implementation and evaluation of plasma therapy protocols for COVID-19. Studies using SARS-CoV-2 in plaque reduction assays or pseudotyped particle-based systems indicate that plasma derived from convalescent patients has potent neutralizing activity related to IgG molecules recognizing the spike protein, suggesting that IgG antibodies against spike have high potential to fulfill neutralizing functions in vivo [18] [19] [20] [21] . We developed standardized protocols for antibody quantification using COVIDAR IgG and provided data showing a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody measurements. This information allowed the implementation of protocols in hospitals throughout the country assessing plasma donors for compassionate use (https://www.groupcpc-19.com/) and for randomized multicenter clinical trials [22, 23] .Due to the urgent need for tools to cope with the pandemic, the Argentine Ministry of Science redirected scientific capacities to generate COVID-19 control means. In this context, the COVIDAR group developed a quantitative serologic test based on ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which gained emergency approval by the National Administration for Drugs, Food and Medical Devices (ANMAT) by May 4 th . The assay uses two viral proteins, a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD), expressed in human cells. Combining these proteins in one assay provided higher sensitivity and reproducibility than using each protein in independent plates for IgG and IgM testing [24] .For this study, four different cohorts of patient samples were used. First, a full data set of 535 acute or convalescent COVID-19 qPCR positive serum samples; second a data base of antibody measurements and specific information of suspected COVID-19 with 3500 entries; third, 1074 serum samples from longitudinal studies of a cohort of 93 patients; and fourth, 561 COVID-19 convalescent plasma from potential donors.IgG and IgM responses were initially evaluated in 535 qPCR positive patients ( Fig 1A) . Samples were grouped according to days of symptoms onset (SO). In the early phase, within 7 days of SO, the IgG sensitivity was 35% (Fig 1A) . The sensitivity for IgG detection increased from 72% to 74% between 2 and 3 weeks, and seroconversion increased up to 90.4% after 3 weeks. In addition, within 100 samples with >45 days of SO, 5 did not show presence of IgG, indicating that 5% of the patients displayed undetectable levels of IgG or they were non- responders up to 45 days. Regarding IgM, within 7 days of SO, sensitivity was 46%. IgM levels were highest between 15 and 21 days, and although IgM positivity increased after 3 weeks, the antibody level observed by optic density (OD) at 450 nm clearly decreased (Fig 1A) .Assessment of 277 pre-pandemic samples, including acute infections of other pathogens (dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and seasonal coronaviruses), were performed. The cut off for IgG and IgM were defined to maximize specificity, ensuring no false positives. Thus, the cut off was defined as the mean of negative control plus 10 or 5 standard deviations for IgG and IgM, respectively (Fig 1B) . High specificity of COVIDAR IgG has been supported by baseline seroprevalence studies of heath care professionals (HCP). In this regard, seroprevalence in HCP at region VIII of Buenos Aires Province, performed in June 2020, showed 0.74% of IgG positivity [25] .A data set of IgG and IgM, including 1379 samples of acute and convalescent infections with complete medical records, was used to analyze distribution of age, gender and symptoms. No significant differences concerning gender were observed. The amount of patients with high IgG levels in the group of severe symptoms was larger than those in the moderate and mild groups. The distribution of IgG levels for patients with severe symptoms were significantly different from those with mild symptoms (Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value<0.0001). The median OD level at 450 nm for IgG was 2, 2.9 and 3.9 for mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively (scale up to 4). This trend of antibody levels with symptoms was also evident for IgM, median 0.8, 1.4 and 2.9 for mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively ( Fig 1C) . The distribution of IgM levels for patients with severe vs mild symptoms was significantly different (Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value<0.0001). Antibody measurements also correlated with age, covering a range from 16 to more than 65 years showing the highest antibody levels associated with older COVID-19 patients (Fig 1D) . Antibody level distribution significantly differed between patients that were < than 45 versus those that were > than 45 years old (Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value<0.0001).Serological courses were also followed in a separate cohort of 93 hospitalized patients, most of which (90 patients) underwent seroconversion during the follow-up period (Fig 2A) . From this, 1074 antibody determinations were performed. We represented the seroconversion time for IgM and IgG for each patient, as the first moment in which antibodies were detected. In most cases, synchronous seroconversion of IgG and IgM was observed (67 patients, 72%). IgM seroconversion was earlier than IgG in 21% of the patients, while IgG appeared earlier than IgM in 7% of the patients (Fig 2A) . This longitudinal study indicates that in the first week of SO 34% of the patients were IgG positive and 38% IgM positive, in agreement with data provided in Fig 1, obtained with a different data set and analysis. In addition, considering patients that were followed for at least 45 days of SO, the seroconversion rate in this cohort was 96.7%.For other infectious diseases, information regarding the duration of IgM is relevant for identification of possible active infections. In our cohort of COVID-19 subjects, longitudinal studies of antibody responses showed a considerable heterogeneity of IgM kinetics ( Fig 2B) . Antibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections between 40 and 60 days of SO, IgM dynamics were also very diverse ( Fig 2C) . IgM titrations indicate that, while in some patients the antibody levels abruptly or slowly dropped before 30 days, in others IgM levels remained high (titers above 1/12,000), even at 60 days of SO ( Fig  2C) , suggesting that IgM detection should be used with caution in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Serology testing has been performed systematically in HCP and nursing homes using COV-IDAR in asymptomatic populations for surveillance. Data indicate that asymptomatic infections were detected by IgG and IgM testing, though at lower levels compared with symptomatic patients (Fig 3A) . In addition, longitudinal studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the absence of symptoms also indicated simultaneous or close seroconversion of IgM and IgG ( Fig 3B) .Well-designed serosurveys are essential to determine how prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection is in the general population, in selected subsections of the population (such as health care workers), or in specific risk groups. Highly specific and sensitive assays are desirable for accurate seroprevalence studies; however, it is also necessary to have methods that are suitable for simple and fast sample collection. ELISA assays use venipuncture, and require refrigerated storage of samples during transportation, making the assay incompatible with massive testing. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the COVIDAR IgG and IgM assays to work with whole blood samples obtained by finger prick. A self-contained Serokit was validated for storage and transportation of whole blood using a glycerin based preservation system [26] . Similar methods have been extensively used in serosurvey studies of Chagas disease conducted in rural areas of Argentina [27] .To validate the process, 68 paired serum and whole blood samples from confirmed SARS--CoV-2 qPCR positive patients were used. All serum specimens were kept at 4˚C, while whole blood samples collected from the same individuals were divided as follows. Fifty two whole blood samples were kept at room temperature and, to evaluate stability, 16 samples were placed at 37˚C for 7 days using the Serokit preservation system. IgG and IgM antibody reactivity from serum samples showed 100% agreement with those from the same individual's whole blood samples stored using Serokit, either at room temperature or at 37˚C (Fig 4) .The validation of finger prick capillary whole blood sample application with Serokit storage widened COVIDAR use to field serosurveys. Until now, seroprevalence studies in nine slums of Buenos Aires, and surveillance studies among HCP in 30 hospitals have been conducted [28] [29] [30] .An important limitation to evaluate antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the lack of standardized quantitative assays that can be easily performed in different institutions. Antibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections Previous analysis using serologic tests assessing IgG titers directed to RBD and/or spike have shown a positive correlation with antibody neutralization [7] . Due to the urgent need for tools, we validated an IgG titration protocol using COVIDAR and performed correlations with neutralizing antibody titers. Protocols and COVIDAR kits for IgG titration were freely distributed in private and public institutions in 20 out of 23 provinces of the country, in which more than 100,000 tests have already been performed.Five hundred and sixty-one convalescent donor plasma samples were titered in our laboratory for standardization. A distribution analysis of the amount of donors and IgG levels indicate that more than 80% of the samples displayed spike specific end point IgG titers above 1/ 400. Hyper-immune plasmas with titers as high as 1/400,000 were observed (Fig 5A) . A significant difference of IgG titers was observed between donors that experienced mild symptoms and those that experienced moderate or severe symptoms, median of 1/800 and 1/6400, Antibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections respectively (p = 0.0001) (Fig 5A) . Full titration curves are shown in heat maps to illustrate this distribution (Fig 5B) .The data using the IgG titration protocol was correlated with virus-neutralizing activity using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped VSV particles (CoV2pp) [31] . Plasma from 176 potential donors were used to assess neutralizing activity. Neutralization curves were fit using a 4-parameter logistic regression model and used to determine 50 and 80% CoV2pp absolute infection inhibition concentration (AbsIC50 and AbsIC80, respectively) by measuring luciferase reporter activity encoded in the CoV2pp. AbsIC50 and AbsIC80 values were correlated Antibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections with spike/RBD specific end point IgG titers (r = 0.717, p<0.0001 and r = 0.716, p<0.0001 respectively, Fig 5C) .Convalescent plasma samples with low IgG titers between 1/50 to 1/200, displayed detectable neutralizing antibodies, with IC80 from the reciprocal of 16 to 132, highlighting that all COVID-19 convalescent individuals with positive anti-spike IgG showed neutralizing antibodies (Fig 5C) . A positive correlation between spike binding IgG titers and CoV2pp infection neutralizing activity was observed with convalescent donor plasma titers above 1/200 (Fig 5C) . Plasmas with high spike IgG titers invariably displayed high neutralization activity estimated by IC50 or IC80.We conclude that using end point titrations for total IgG against spike with COVIDAR is suitable for large scale studies, especially in areas of limited resources, as surrogate of neutralization potency and guidance for convalescent donor plasma selection.The development and appropriate application of serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are essential to determine the pandemic evolution and establish mitigation policies. Here, we developed and produced a widely available serologic tool to assist health authorities for pandemic management. Protocols and reagents were distributed to evaluate immune status of hospitalized patients, surveillance of at risk groups, seroprevalence studies in different populations and evaluation of plasma from convalescent donors for possible therapies. The biggest challenge still stands regarding how to deploy this tool in a strategic manner to bring communities out of the current suffering.We provided a robust serologic test for health institutions throughout the country and generated highly needed information of humoral responses of acute and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specific IgG and IgM responses were found to be highly heterogeneous among different individuals. We observed early seroconversion within the first week of SO in at least 34% of the patients (Figs 1 and 2) . This raised the question of whether IgM and/or IgG seroconversion time indicates the end of infectiousness or whether early antibody appearance may overlap with active infection and possible transmission. Although this is an issue that requires further attention, periodic serology testing has been useful for guiding focused qPCR testing, asymptomatic case identification and contact tracing.The fraction of asymptomatic but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates pandemic potential. Viral load and antibody responses in asymptomatic individuals are both important to understand transmission and pandemic extension. It is still unclear how many people carry SARS-CoV-2 infection asymptomatically. It has been shown that the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases changes in different settings. Ratios from 2:1 to near 1:8 symptomatic to asymptomatic cases have been reported [28, 32, 33] . The factors that influence this large variation are still unknown. One concern is that the low level of antibodies found in asymptomatic cases may lead to their underestimation [34] . Our studies show wide individual variations in the antibody response and kinetics in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. We found that asymptomatic individuals displayed lower overall antibody levels than those observed in COVID-19 symptomatic patients (Fig 3) . A positive correlation between disease severity and levels of IgG and IgM in acute and convalescent stages was also observed (Fig 1C and 5A ), in agreement with previous studies [6, 35] . Another important issue is the duration of IgM antibodies. Our longitudinal study using 93 infected individuals showed that IgM levels wane in 60% of the cases within 30 days of SO (or first qPCR detection for asymptomatic cases). However, IgM levels were still detected after 30 or even 60 days in 40% of the cases, suggesting that IgM detection does not necessarily reflect a recent infection.Another important question is whether all infected individuals mount a robust antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, we found antibodies in 90% of the qPCR positive cases after 3 weeks of SO and, considering patients that were followed for at least 45 days, the seroconversion rate reached 95%. Thus, at least 5% of infected individuals resolved the infection with undetectable levels of antibodies. This observation could be assigned to low antibody responses, below the detection limit, or to non-responder individuals. In this regard, previous studies have shown the relevant role of T cell responses in infection resolution [36, 37] .Factors that affect the spread and dynamic of the virus in different geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic areas are still unclear. Reliable reagents to perform large and periodic serosurveys are urgently needed. Here, we provided a tool for using whole blood by finger pricking, followed by IgG and IgM tests, to facilitate large sampling together with a robust ELISA assay. This approach has been used in different neighborhoods and defined at-risk populations in Argentina with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence from less than 1 to more than 50% [28, 29] , supporting the convenience and utility of the application.It is important to stress the relevance of widely available quantitative serologic assays. Passive antibody transfer is a treatment strategy that has been used for COVID-19, including plasma and purified immunoglobulins derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors. Although the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment remains uncertain, recent reports indicate a clinical benefit associated with high-titer units administered early in the course of the infection [16] . In this regard, an important limitation has been to obtain harmonized antibody titers information used in different clinical trials and therapeutic applications. By titering more than 500 convalescent plasma samples, we showed a diversity of titers, which correlated with donor disease severity (Fig 5A) . We provided a standardized protocol, widely distributed and used in Argentina for quantitative IgG measurements. A positive correlation between IgG quantitation, using COVIDAR, with neutralizing activity measured by a pseudotyped virus was shown (Fig 5C) . This protocol has been useful to normalize quantifications at hospitals and heath institutions using plasma for compassionate therapies and for different clinical trials [22, 23] . Although IgG titers correlated with neutralizing activities, the relevant open question is how they correlate with protection [38, 39] .While the pandemic still progresses, scientists, public health workers, and policy makers are being challenged to create new strategies based on evidence and experiences in different parts of the world. A consensus has emerged that serological testing provides an essential tool in the pandemic response, nevertheless, serology testing strategies should be dynamic and adaptable to specific needs and resources available in different regions. Our work provides widely and freely available robust serology reagents, protocols, and data on humoral responses of SARS--CoV-2 infected individuals that hopefully helps finding better control measures for the current pandemic.The ectodomain, soluble version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (residues 1−1208 of Gen-Bank: MN908947) including a T4 foldon trimerization domain, a GSAS substituted at the furin cleavage site (residues 682-685), and an octahistidine tag was cloned into a pCDNA mammalian expression vector. A SARS-CoV-2 version S-2P (spike with two proline substitutions at 986 and 987) was originally used. However, due to the difficulty of purifying the necessary amount of spike protein for producing the ELISA plates, substitutions that increased protein yields and stability were incorporated. In this regard, a variant with four additionalAntibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections proline substitutions was generated, HexaPro variant, as recently described [40] . The sequence of the receptor binding domain (RBD, amino acid 319 to 541, RVQP. . ..CVNF) along with the signal peptide (amino acid 1-14, MFVF. . ..TSGS) plus a hexahistidine tag was obtained from the Krammer laboratory [41] and subcloned into a pCDNA human expression vector.For protein expression, FreeStyle 293-F (293-F) cells or adherent HEK 293-T (293-T) cells were maintained at 37˚C with 8% CO 2 and 5% CO 2 , respectively. 293-F cells were grown and transfected in Expi293 expression medium and 293-T cells were grown in D-MEM high glucose supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum 100U/ml penicillin, 100ug/ml streptomycin and transfected in Opti-MEM reduced serum media. Plasmids encoding spike and RBD were transiently transfected using polyethyleneimine hydrochloride. Transfected 293-F suspension cultures were maintained at 32˚C and transfected 293-T cells were maintained at 37˚C. The cultures supernatants were harvested at five days after transfection by centrifugation of the culture at 4000 g for 20 minutes at 4˚C, new medium was added and a second harvest was performed after four days. For FreeStyle 293-F cells viability was monitored and kept above 75% at all times.Culture supernatants were applied using a peristaltic pump to HisTrap excel columns (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 2-3 ml/min, using 1 ml of media for each 100 ml of supernatant. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of buffer A (NaH 2 PO 4 57,5mM, NaCl 300 mM, pH 7.8) and next with 60 volumes of buffer A with 10 mM imidazol. Then, columns were connected to an HPLC system (Kanuer) and washed at 2 ml/min with the last buffer until absorbance at 280 nm reached a value below 0.005. Proteins were eluted with a 12 minute linear gradient from 10 to 1 M imidazole in buffer A. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Buffer of fractions containing protein was exchange to PBS with NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) and pooled. Typical yields were around 6 and 45 mg/l for spike and RBD, respectively, with a purity level of at least 98%.The ELISA protocol was adapted from previously established protocols used for Chagas disease by Laboratorio Lemos S.R.L. [42] , and for SARS-CoV-2 by the Krammer Laboratory [41] . Ninety-six well high binding plates (Jet Biofil, Guangzhou, China) were coated overnight at 4˚C with 75 μl per well of a solution containing 100 ng of a mixture of full-length trimeric spike and RBD proteins in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The next day the coating solution was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Serum samples diluted in PBS-T containing 0.05% Tween and 0.8% casein were added to the wells (100 μl of a 1:100 dilution for IgM and 200 μl of a 1:50 dilution for IgG determination), and incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. For end point titrations, samples were serially diluted in IgG SARS-CoV-2 negative serum or fetal bovine serum (FBS), added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. Following a washing step with PBS-T, 100 μl of diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated with goat anti-human IgM (Sigma), or with mouse anti-human IgG antibodies (BD pharmingen), was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min. at 37˚C. Subsequently, the plates were washed with PBS-T, and the peroxidase reaction was visualized by incubating the plates with 100 μl of TMB solution for 30 min at 37˚C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1M sulfuric acid, and optical densities (OD) were immediately measured at 450 nm. For whole blood analysis, 50 μl of blood were preserved in collecting tubes containing 90 μl of buffered glycerin from the Serokit system [26] . Stored samples were then diluted in PBS-T containing 0.8% casein for quantification of IgG or IgM levels.Antibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infectionsHuman plasma and serum samples were obtained from a number of different sources following the subsequent inclusion criteria: people aged over 16 A pre-pandemic serum panel of samples selected based on the date of collection (July and September 2019) was provided by the Blood Bank of the Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín. Positive and negative controls were donated from the CEMIC blood bank. Longitudinal studies were performed using samples from de-identified patients from Sanatorio de La Trinidad Mitre and Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín (n = 118). Samples were taken every 2 to 4 days until the patient was discharged from the hospital. Additional samples were collected when patient assisted for controls. Samples were collected between 1 to 90, or more days, of symptoms onset.Asymptomatic patients identified by contact tracing of COVID-19 positive patients were obtained from BBEI COVID-19 collection, Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín, Sanatorio de La Trinidad Mitre and Swiss Medical. Paired whole blood and serum samples used for Serokit validation were obtained from the BBEI COVID19 collection.Sample collection and processing were performed from April 2020 to October 2020.Neutralization assays were carried out with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp), generated in Benhur Lee's laboratory [31] . CoV2pp carries vesicular stomatitis virus as viral backbone, bearing the Renilla luciferase gene in place of its G glycoprotein (VSVΔG-rLuc), and expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on its envelope. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressing 293T cells (293T-ACE2+TMPRSS2 clone F8-2), were used for these assays [31] . Cells were maintained with DMEM high glucose with 10% FBS and were seeded in a 96-well plate the day before infection.Patient sera were heat inactivated at 56˚C for 30 minutes and serially diluted in DMEM high glucose with 10% FBS. Serum neutralizations were performed by first diluting the inactivated sample 8-folds and continuing with a 2-fold serial dilution. A pre-titrated amount of pseudotyped particles (diluted to give approximately 5x10 5 Relative Luminescent Units) was incubated with a 2-fold serial dilution of patient sera for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to infection. Approximately 20 hours post-infection cells were processed for detection of luciferase activity. Cells were lysed and transferred to white, F-bottom 750 Lumitrac plates (Greiner, 655074). Plates were read via the GloMax Navigator Microplate Luminometer (Promega, GM200) using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E2820).Absolute inhibitory concentrations (absIC) values were calculated for all patient sera samples by modeling a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) regression with GraphPad Prism 8. The 4PL model describes the sigmoid-shaped response pattern. For clarity, it is assumed that theAntibody kinetics and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections response can be expressed so that the slope increases as the concentration increase. Absolute inhibitory concentration (absIC) was calculated as the corresponding point between the 0% and 100% assay controls. Fifty % and 80% inhibition were defined by the controls for all the samples on the same plate. For example, the absIC50 or absIC80 would be the point at which the curve matches inhibition equal to exactly 50% or 80% of the 100% assay control relative to the assay minimum.

Along with a significant impact on physical health, COVID-19 has caused a significant economic impact (Guan et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020 ) as well as a significant increase in mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and stress (Gallagher et al. 2020; Pfefferbaum and North 2020; Rajkumar 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Zvolensky et al. 2020c) . Recent research documenting the prevalence of mental health problems during COVID-19 suggests that upwards of 35% of people report elevated anxiety symptoms and upwards of 20% of people report depressive symptoms (Huang and Zhao 2020) . Additionally, those with pre-existing anxiety disorders show greater stress response and poorer coping than those without a pre-existing diagnosis (Asmundson et al. 2020) .Importantly, while the virus has impacted the entire world, there is emerging evidence that COVID-19 negatively impacts low income or developing countries, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, including Latinx, at disproportionate rates, including those in South America (Burki 2020; Rodriguez-Morales et al. 2020) . Recent reports published by Johns Hopkins University suggest that, out of the countries with the highest mortality rates, three of the top ten countries are in South America, and Argentina reports one of the highest death rates from COVID-19 in the world (Johns Hopkins University 2020). This distinction is clinically important, as research shows that compared to non-Latinx Whites, Latinx adults report higher rates of anxiety symptoms and disorders, with an emphasis on somatization and physical functional impairment (Escovar et al. 2018) . Examining literature from past large-scale epidemics, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Black and Latinx individuals were disproportionately affected and focusing research and clinical efforts on these high risk populations can reduce health disparities (Macias Gil et al. 2020; Ojikutu and Stone 2021 ). Yet, empirical knowledge about psychological vulnerabilities related to COVID-19 among Latinx in South America are presently highly limited.Anxiety sensitivity (AS), defined as fear of fear (physical, cognitive, and social sensations) (Reiss et al. 1986; Reiss and McNally 1985) , is a malleable trait-like individual difference factor that may increase vulnerability to the negative mental health effects of COVID-19, and has been specifically linked to heightened mental health complaints among Latinx (Viana et al. 2020; Zvolensky et al. 2020b) . Although literature examining AS in terms of COVID-19-specific mental health factors, particularly among Latinx persons, is non-existent, past related work suggests that AS may partially explain (mediate) the relationship between stressful life events and anxiety symptoms (McLaughlin and Hatzenbuehler 2009 ). Additional work from past large-scale natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, suggests that AS is related to panic disorder symptoms over and above the variance accounted for by trauma exposure (Hensley-Maloney and Varela 2009) , and AS amplifies the effects of trait anxiety on somatic symptom presentation (Hensley and Varela 2008) . Prospective research following a school shooting found that AS was significant associated with anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Boffa et al. 2016 ). However, past work has not explored AS in the context of COVID-19 sequelae.The AS construct also is theoretically relevant to the Latinx population, but to date no work has examined AS in terms of COVID-19 outcomes among Latinx persons. Indeed, past work suggests that, compared to non-Latinx White adults, Latinx adults report higher levels of somatic symptoms, independent of anxiety diagnosis (Koss 1990) . Other work has found that higher levels of somatic symptoms are associated with poorer chronic illness outcomes among the Latinx population (Vasquez et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, since AS amplifies the affective response to somatic perturbation (Drahovzal et al. 2006; Varela et al. 2007 ), AS may be particularly important to the Latinx population. Consistent with this formulation, non-COVID-19 related research has found that AS is associated with greater anxiety (Zvolensky et al. 2018b) , depression , stress (Viana et al. 2020) , posttraumatic stress (Zvolensky et al. 2020d) , pain Kauffman et al. 2019) , and substance use problems ) among Latinx adults. Work among trauma-exposed Latinx samples, which is likely relevant to the current COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that AS is associated both with elevated mental health complaints as well as acculturative stress (Zvolensky et al. 2018a) . In terms of COVID-19-specific mental health concerns in a population of adults in Argentina (Latinx adults), it is possible that COVID-19 anxiety and stress may principally manifest as somatic symptoms and worry about their consequences. AS may theoretically amplify these somatic symptoms where individuals may interpret them as catastrophic, thereby leading to greater overall symptoms and associated functional impairment. Additionally, given that many COVID-19 symptoms are common in everyday life (e.g., coughing, upset stomach), AS may further exacerbate the severity of these symptoms. Importantly, while AS may be more salient for Latinx individuals, preliminary research suggests that the magnitude of association between AS and other mental health facets is similar between Latinx and non-Latinx populations (Jardin et al. 2018) .The current study aimed to examine the role of AS total score, as well as sub-facets, in terms of COVID-19 worry, anxiety, functional impairment, and symptom severity among two samples of adults from Argentina. One sample included adults from the community. Given that preexisting anxiety disorder may be associated with poorer COVID-19 stress coping (Asmundson et al. 2020 ), a second sample of adults with a pre-COVID-19 anxiety disorder was included. It was hypothesized that AS total score would be significantly positively associated with COVID-19 worry, anxiety, functional impairment, and symptom severity, and these effects would be evident over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, COVID-19 exposure, and pre-existing medical conditions. Additionally, given the documented relations between AS and somatic symptoms, it was hypothesized that AS physical concerns would be associated with COVID-19 worry, anxiety, functional impairment, and symptom severity.Par ticipants were 105 Spanish-speaking adults (M age = 38.58, SD = 14.07, 69.5% female) participating in a survey about COVID-19 and mental health in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between May 12 and May 28, 2020 (country wide lockdown in Argentina began on March 19, 2020). Inclusion criteria for the current study included being over the age of 18, residing in Buenos Aires (selfreport), and provided full and complete data. Using a convenience sampling method, participants were reached via local social media advertisements and completed the study online. Participants provided informed consent prior to study participation. Participants completed a series of selfreport measures assessing a range of physical and mental health conditions in Spanish. The study was approved by the IRB of the sponsoring institution.Demographics. Demographics, including age, gender, marital status, education level, current employment, and presence of co-morbid medical conditions, including conditions such as autoimmune disorders, HIV, asthma, etc., were collected from participants. Anxiety sensitivity index-3 (Taylor et al. 2007 ). The ASI-3 is an 18-item measure (adapted in Spanish; Solari and Bogiaizian 2016), based, in part, upon the original ASI (Reiss et al. 1986 ) in which respondents indicate the extent to which they are concerned about possible negative consequences of anxiety-related symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) and summed to a total score (ASI-3-total). The ASI-3 has been successfully used in past research in Argentina ) and other Spanish-speaking samples (Zvolensky et al. 2014 (Zvolensky et al. , 2018b . In the present investigation, internal consistency was excellent for the global score (α = 0.91) as well as the sub-facets: physical (α = 0.90), social (α = 0.80), and cognitive (α = 0.90). COVID-19 screening and symptoms. Participants were asked to provide information regarding COVID-19 diagnosis (""Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19?""), exposure to confirmed cases (""Have you been exposed to someone who has confirmed COVID-19?""), and international travel (""Have you traveled to/from an area with community spread COVID-19 within the past 3 months""). This information was used for descriptive purposes. Additionally, for participants that endorsed being diagnosed with COVID-19, suspecting COVID-19 diagnosis, or being in close contact with someone with COVID-19 a composite COVID-19 exposure variable (yes/no) was included as a covariate in regression analyses. COVID-19 worry index. Informed by established measures of worry (Meyer et al. 1990 ), the COVID-19 worry index is a 15-item measure developed by the current research team to specifically assess worry about contracting and becoming ill from COVID-19, including worry about related symptoms (Buckner et al. under review) . Respondents are asked to rate their worry about each item (e.g., ""I worry that I will come into contact with someone that has COVID-19.""). Responses are rated on a scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (A great deal), and responses were summed for a total score, with higher scores indicating greater COVID-19-related worry. The COVID-19 worry index demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.93) in the present study. COVID-19 functional impairment (Zvolensky 2020a) .Participants were asked to rate the amount of difficulty they have had with seven activities in the context of COVID-19, rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (Not at all true) to 3 (Totally true). Participants were asked to rate difficulty in a number of domains, including maintaining daily hygiene, sleep problems, maintaining contact with friends and family, eating less healthy food, feeling motivated to do work around the house, having problem maintaining a daily routine, problems exercising, and feeling more fatigued (α = 0.73). COVID-19 anxiety. COVID-19-specific anxiety was assessed using a newly-developed measure, by asking participants to rate the degree to which they experience anxiety about 22 specific domains indirectly related to COVID-19, rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme). In contrast to COVID-19-related worry, COVID-19-specific anxiety is not focused on contracting the virus and fear of illness, but rather, on the anxiety about the consequences of COVID-19. For example, participants were asked to what degree they are experiencing anxiety about ""losing their job"" as well as ""not receiving necessary medical care if needed,"" among others, and the scale showed good internal consistency (α = 0.88). Severity of COVID-19 symptoms (Zvolensky 2020b) . Based in part on the structure of previously established illness symptom severity measures (Ader 2007) , participants were asked to rate how often they experienced a number of COVID-19-related symptoms over the past 2 weeks, rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 5 (Almost) always. The contents of the specific scale were COVID-19 specific, taken from the Center for DiseaseParticipants were asked about the following symptoms: dry cough, phlegm in throat, chest tightness/pressure in chest, stuffy/runny nose, sneeze, fatigue, difficulty breathing when sleeping, difficulty breathing when doing light activities, walking slowly due to shortness of breath, intense pressure in chest, feeling of choking, fever, confusion/disorientation, and stomach problems (α = 0.80).Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. First, descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlations were examined among variables. Then, four, 2-step hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, including covariates (age, sex, COVID-19 exposure, co-morbid health conditions) at step 1, and AS total score included at step 2, for each of the outcome variables (COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, and anxiety). Additional exploratory analyses were examined for the sub-facets of AS, including the same covariates at step 1, and all three subscales simultaneously in step 2. Squared semi-partial correlations and change in R 2 were used as indices of effect size to indicate the amount of variance in the outcome that is attributed to each variable (Aiken and West 1991) . Examining the mean and variance of COVID-19 symptom severity revealed over-dispersion (variance larger than the mean), suggesting the use of a negative binomial regression using a Generalized Linear Model framework (Hilbe 2011) . For this outcome, 95% confidence intervals were presented as indices of effect size.In terms of marital status, approximately half (47.6%) of participants reported being single, 43.8% reported being married or cohabiting, and 8.6% reported being separated, divorced, or widowed. About one third (31.4%) of the sample completed high school or less, with 21.9% completing some college, 22.9% graduating from college, and 23.8% completing post-graduate education. In terms of COVID-19 exposure, 0% of participants had a confirmed diagnosis, but 1.9% reported believing they had COVID-19, 1.0% were exposed to someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and 1.9% reported being exposed to someone with a suspected COVID-19 diagnosis.For bi-variate relations among all variables, see Table 1 . Of note, AS total score was statistically significantly associated with all criterion variables; AS physical and cognitive sub-facets were associated with all outcomes except for COVID-19 anxiety. Further, despite the potential overlap in content between COVID-19 worry, anxiety, and symptom severity, the correlations between the total scores suggest construct independence. Finally, it is important to note that the AS sub-facets are correlated with each other in the moderate range.Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, did not account for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 worry (F (4, 100) = 0.739, p = 0.57, R 2 = 0.03). Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 worry (F (5, 99) = 9.36, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.32), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.81, se = 0.14, β = 0.55, p < 0.001, sr 2 = 0.29; see Table 2 ).Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, did not account for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (4, 100) = 1.50, p = 0.21, R 2 = 0.06). Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (5, 99) = 6.06, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.23), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.16, se = 0.04, β = 0.43, p < 0.001, sr 2 = 0.18; see Table 2 ). COVID-19 anxiety.Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, did not account for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (4, 100) = 1.71, p = 0.15, R 2 = 0.06). Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (5, 99) = 3.08, p = 0.01, R 2 = 0.13), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.18, se = 0.06, β = 0.27, p = 0.006, sr 2 = 0.07; see Table 2 ). COVID-19 symptom severity. In predicting COVID-19 symptom severity, the model showed good model fit (χ 2 (99) = 65.08, p = 0.66). Parameter estimates indicate the AS total score was statistically significantly positively associated with COVID-19 symptom severity (b = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.05), se = 0.01, p < 0.001).Exploratory analyses of AS sub-facets suggest differential patterns of associations for each outcome. Specifically, AS physical was the only sub-facet statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 worry (b = 1.50, se = 0.38, p < 0.001) and COVID-19 symptom severity (b = 0.06, se = 0.02, p = 0.01), whereas AS cognitive was the only sub-facet statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 functional impairment (b = 0.26, se = 0.26, p = 0.02). Additionally, AS social was the only sub-facet statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety (b = 0.42, se = 0.20, p = 0.04).The current study explored the role of AS in terms of COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity among a community sample of adults in Argentina. Results provide evidence that AS is robustly related to these constructs over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, COVID-19 exposure, and pre-existing medical conditions. Additionally, analyses of the AS subscales found differential associations with outcomes, such that physical concerns were associated with COVID-19 worry and symptoms severity, cognitive concerns was associated with functional impairment, and social concerns was associated with anxiety. These results provide initial empirical evidence for the role of AS in terms of COVID-19-related mental health problems among a vulnerable sample of Latinx adults in Argentina.Participants were 99 Spanish-speaking adults (M age = 34.99, SD = 10.83, 66.7% female) with a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder who participated in a study about COVID-19 and mental health in Buenos Aires, Argentina; data were collected between May 12 and May 28, 2020. Inclusion criteria for the current study included being over the age of 18, seeking mental health services for anxiety or depression at Asociacion Ayuda Anxiety Disorder Clinic, and providing full and complete data. Using a convenience sampling method, participants were referred to the study by their treating therapist. Participants provided informed consent prior to study participation. Participants completed a series of self-report measures assessing a range of physical and mental health conditions in Spanish. The study was approved by the IRB of the sponsoring institution.Measures were identical for Study 1 and Study 2, and all measured showed good internal consistency in study 2: ASI 3-total (α = 0.90), physical (α = 0.91), cognitive (α = 0.89), social (α = 0.85); COVID-19 worry index (α = 0.90); COVID-19 functional impairment (α = 0.70); COVID-19 anxiety (α = 0.83); COVID-19 symptom severity (α = 0.84). Anxiety disorder diagnosis. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID; First et al. 1996) was administered to the clinical sample to establish the presence of a current anxiety disorder. The SCID was conducted by licensed mental health professionals and confirmed by either a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist.Data analytic methods remained the same for Study 2 as for Study 1.For anxiety disorder diagnoses, participants met criteria for the following primary diagnoses: 31.3% panic disorder, 36.4% generalized anxiety disorder, 22.2% social anxiety disorder, 8.1% obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1% specific phobia, and 1% illness anxiety disorder. In terms of marital status, 46.5% of participants reported being single, 49.5% reported being married or cohabiting, and 4.0% reported being separated, divorced, or widowed. In terms of education, 27.3% of the sample completed high school or less, with 23.2% completing some college, 34.3% graduating from college, and 15.2% completing post-graduate education. In terms of COVID-19 exposure, 1.0% of participants had a confirmed diagnosis, but 3.0% reported believing they had COVID-19, 0% were exposed to someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and 1.0% reported being exposed to someone with a suspected COVID-19 diagnosis.For bi-variate relations among all variables, see Table 1 . Of note, AS total score was statistically significantly associated with all outcomes, but AS physical was not associated with COVID-19 functional impairment, and AS cognitive was not associated with COVID-19 anxiety.Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, accounted for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 worry (F (4, 94) = 3.897, p = 0.006, R 2 = 0.14). Examining individual predictors suggests that possible COVID-19 exposure was statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 worry (b = 33.86, se = 9.11, β = 0.36, p < 0.001, sr 2 = 0.13; see Table 3 ). Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 worry (F (5, 93) = 10.98, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.37), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.68, se = 0.12, β = 0.52, p < 0.001, sr 2 = 0.23; see Table 3 ).Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, accounted for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (4, 94) = 3.30, p = 0.01, R 2 = 0.012), and age (b = −0.09, se = 0.04, β = −0.21, p = 0.045, sr 2 = 0.04; see Table 3 ) and possible COVID-19 exposure (b = 5.87 se = 2.32, β = 0.25, p = 0.01, sr 2 = 0.06; see Table 3 ) were statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (5, 93) = 4.49, p = 0.001, R 2 = 0.19), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.10, se = 0.02, β = 0.29, p = 0.005, sr 2 = 0.07; see Table 3 ).Step 1 of the model, including covariates only, accounted for statistically significant variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (4, 94) = 3.02, p = 0.02, R 2 = 0.11), and age was statistically significantly positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety (b = 0.178, se = 0.06, β = 0.28, p = 0.006, sr 2 = 0.07; see Table 3 ). Including AS total score in the model accounted for statistically significantly more variance in COVID-19 anxiety (F (5, 93) = 6.35, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.25), and AS total score was a statistically significant predictor (b = 0.20, se = 0.05, β = 0.40, p < 0.002, sr 2 = 0.14; see Table 3 ). COVID-19 symptom severity. In predicting COVID-19 symptom severity, the model showed good model fit (χ 2 (93) = 58.39, p = 0.63). Parameter estimates indicate the AS total score is statistically significantly positively associated with COVID-19 symptom severity (b = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.04), se = 0.01, p = 0.008).Exploratory analyses of AS sub-facets suggest differential patterns of associations for each outcome. Specifically, AS physical (Worry-b = 1.03, se = 0.25, p < 0.001; Anxietyb = 0.23, se = 0.10, p = 0.03) and AS social (Worry-b = 1.03, se = 0.27, p < 0.001; Anxiety-b = 0.32, se = 0.11, p = 0.005) were statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 worry and COVID-19 anxiety. Additionally, AS physical was the only sub-facet associated with COVID-19 symptom severity (b = 0.05, se = 0.02, p = 0.005), but no sub-facets were statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 functional impairment.The current study examined the association of AS with COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity among a sample of adults with anxiety disorders in Argentina. Like the results from study 1, results indicated the AS total score was significantly associated with each of the outcomes. In terms of AS sub-facets, physical and social concerns were significantly associated with worry and anxiety, and physical concerns along were associated with symptom severity. These results highlight that AS is also an important vulnerability factor for Latinx adults with pre-existing anxiety disorders and may be an important treatment target to mitigate mental health disparities.Parameter estimates for AS total score-clinical sample The current manuscript examined the relationship between AS and COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity across two samples of adults (general population and a sample with anxiety disorders) from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Results from both samples provide evidence that AS is significantly positively associated with COVID-related worry, anxiety, functional impairment and symptoms severity, and these associations were evident over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, and possible COVID-19 exposure. These results are in line with past work among Latinx adults documenting associations between AS and mental health outcomes (e.g., Viana et al. 2020; Zvolensky et al. 2020d) , and extends the findings to COVID-19 specific mental health and functional outcomes. Additionally, the finding that AS is related to more severe COVID-19 symptoms independent of COVID-19 exposure is particularly clinically important, as AS has been shown to be associated with increased risk of chronic medical conditions (Horenstein et al. 2018; Lipsitz et al. 2004) , and may worsen COVID-19 outcomes for those with the virus.It is worth noting that inspection of effect sizes indicates that the magnitude of the association between AS and all criterion variables differs between the community and clinical samples. Although no formal tests were conducted to compare the magnitude of the effects, it appears that the magnitude of the association between AS and COVID-19, as well as functional impairment was largest for the community sample, and the relationship between AS and COVID-19 anxiety was largest of the clinical sample. This finding provides initial evidence that among a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders, AS may contribute strongly to exacerbated COVID-19 anxiety, but to a lesser degree worry and functional impairment, whereas AS may be a driver of worry and impairment for the community sample.Exploratory analyses of AS subscales indicated some differential associations between the community and clinical samples. Across both samples, AS physical concerns were associated with COVID-19 worry and symptom severity. In line with past work suggesting that AS physical concerns is specifically related to vigilance to somatic symptoms common in both worry and medical illness (Gelenberg 2000; Zvolensky and Forsyth 2002) , AS physical concerns may be driving the observed relations across community and clinical samples, suggesting this may be a particularly good target for intervention among Latinx individuals, as has been found in past work on Latinx samples . Additionally, AS social concerns was associated with anxiety across both samples, which has been associated in past work with poorer disease outcomes and functional impairment (Dixon et al. 2018) . Finally, while AS cognitive concerns was only associated with functional impairment in the community sample, there may be importance to better understanding this facet given that past work specifically links AS cognitive concerns to increased suicide risk (Oglesby et al. 2015) . Relatedly, AS cognitive concerns was not associated with COVID-19 anxiety in either sample, which is in contrast with past literature suggesting that targeting AS cognitive concerns improves mental health complaints (Schmidt et al. 2014 ). Yet, given the fact that Latinx samples have been shown to somaticize anxiety symptoms (Escovar et al. 2018) , and no work has examined AS cognitive in Latinx only samples, it is possible that AS physical concerns accounts for more of the variance in the current sample. Further study of AS sub-facets in terms of COVID-19 mental health outcomes is warranted.The results of the current study may have important clinical implications for a high-risk group particularly vulnerable to the negative health consequences of COVID-19. It is also possible that the results of the study may generalize to other Latinx populations and South American countries, given that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect Latinx communities both abroad and in the United States. Additionally, the medical infrastructure in Argentina (Portes and Ross 1976) , suggests that these countries may not have all the medical resources needed to handle a large-scale pandemic or its aftermath. Therefore, focusing clinical and research attention on the mental health impact of the pandemic is of utmost importance. Given the robust associations between AS, mental health, and functional outcomes in prior literature and in the current study, assessing and targeting AS may be considered ""good clinical practice"" during and after COVID-19, even among those with mild symptoms. However, it is important to consider interventions that can be modified according to social distancing practices to curtail the spread of the virus. Previous research examining the efficacy of brief, computer-delivered AS treatments suggests that targeting AS in this fashion is associated with reductions in mental health symptoms (Schmidt et al. 2014; Timpano et al. 2016) , and these treatments could be easily adapted to home delivery and delivery via mobile phone application. Developing this intervention may be critical for Latinx adults during and following COVID-19. Finally, due to data collection limitations, there was no variable to control for trait level of negative affect. It would therefore be important to replicate the findings in another sample, controlling for trait level of negative affect, to elucidate the unique effects of AS over and above general negative affect. That said, it is important to note here that past work has recurrently demonstrated AS maintains incremental predictive power relative to trait level negative affect across decades of research (Eifert et al. 1999; Schmidt et al. 2006; Zvolensky et al. 2005 Zvolensky et al. , 2019 .The current study is not without limitations. First, the data were cross-sectional, prohibiting causal claims to be made regarding the associations. Future prospective modelling is critical to understand the temporal ordering of the association between AS and COVID-19 psychological constructs. Additionally, the majority of the sample indicated that they had not been exposed to COVID-19, and it would be important to replicate the current findings, particularly those regarding symptom severity, to those with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 to increase the generalizability of the findings. Further, it is possible that some participants in the community sample had mental health symptoms, but they were not in treatment and thus not included in the clinical sample, and replication and extension of the findings in other, larger populations is warranted. Fourth, due to data collection limitations for the anxiety disorder sample, there is no information regarding the amount of time these individuals had been in treatment, as well as the presence of any comorbid diagnoses. Although the current sample was screened to have a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis, anxiety disorders are commonly comorbid with other conditions and this may limit the generalizability of the current results to all clinical populations.Overall, the current study presents the first investigation of AS and COVID-19 related worry, anxiety, functional impairment, and symptom severity among two samples of adults in Argentina, and results provide strong evidence for these associations. These results provide important evidence for psychological vulnerability factors that may increase the mental health impact of COVID-19 and developing interventions that target AS may reduce this looming public health crisis.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.Informed Consent All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (national and institutional).

In Brazil surpassed 190000 people killed by Covid-19 in 2020, with a total of 7447625 people infected since the beginning of the pandemic. This fact places the country in the second place with the highest incidence of deaths caused by Convi-19, being surpassed only by the United States of America, which account for more than 330000 deaths [2] .According to Treweek et. al (2020) [3] the COVID-19 toll is not the same for everyone. Some studies show global evidence that elderly people, male, with comorbidities and in poverty are at a disproportionate risk of serious complications and deaths from COVID-19 [4, 5] . Groups of ethnic minorities, who have these factors, have shown worse clinical results that include higher mortality and a higher rate of admission to Intensive Care Units [6] . 2020).In Brazil, the Indigenous tribes have already seen their communities ravaged by exogenous diseases in the past. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, their death rate was 4.5 times higher than the rest of the Brazil's general population [7] . Even with the creation of the Emergency Plan to Combat COVID-19 in Indigenous Lands, through Law No. 14201, of June 7, 2020 [8] , at the height of the pandemic that occurred in July 2020, mortality among indigenous peoples came to be 6.5 times greater than the rest of the population of Brazil [9, 10] .Although geospatial tools are a strategic device, in terms of understanding situational diagnosis and monitoring disease progression, studies using these tools in the context of the indigenous population are still scarce [11, 13] .Thus, considering the high degree of vulnerability of the indigenous population and the urgent need to identify priority territories, this study aimed to analyze the geographical distribution of COVID-19 and to identify areas of high risk for the occurrence of cases and death by disease in the indigenous population of Brazil.This is an ecological study using spatial analysis techniques [14] , the units of which were the Special Indigenous Health Districts (SIHDs).In Brazil, the self-declared indigenous population is estimated at 817000 individuals, representing 0.4% of the country's total population. There are approximately 305 ethnic groups and 274 languages spoken, which represents one of the highest levels of sociodiversity in the world [15] .First, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the cases and deaths that occurred in the period, calculating the absolute number and the incidence and mortality rates according to each month investigated. Then, the same calculations were performed according to sex and age group. To calculate the incidence and mortality rates, the ratio between the total number of cases or deaths that occurred during the study period and the total indigenous population was used. The result was subsequently multiplied by 100000. The same rates were calculated by SIHD, using the number of cases or deaths recorded in each SIHD and the indigenous population of each SIHD.To verify the spatial association of the incidence and mortality rates by COVID-19, were used techniques Getis-Ord General G and Getis-Ord Gi*[17]. The Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation tool in the ArcGis V.10.5 software was used to obtain the best distance at which the spatial clusters were most pronounced [18] .The High/Low Clustering (Getis-Ord General G) statistic tool gives a general analysis of the area.The null hypothesis states that there is no spatial clustering of feature values.To examine spatial patterns in detail, the hot spot technique (Getis-Ord Gi*) was used, which analyzes the spatial association locally, based on a spatial concentration indicator. In Getis-Ord Gi* the values for each locality, that is, each SIHD, are considered from a neighborhood matrix. In this technique, statistically significant spatial clusters of high values This analysis also generates a z-score for statistically significant census sectors. The higher the z-score, the more intense the grouping of high values (Hotspot), while the lower the value, the more intense is the grouping of low values or less occurrence of the event (Coldspot). In addition to the z-score, the p-value and significance level (Gi-Bin) are providedThe technique of spatial scan statistics developed by Kulldorff and Nagarwalla (1995) [20] was used to identify areas at risk of COVID-19-related occurrences and deaths.Scan statistics are performed through windows that move along the study territory around the centroid, corresponding to the centre of each analyzed territorial unit (SIHD). The formation of spatial clusters is based on the calculation of the number of events found within each window [21] .Thus, the null hypothesis was that the number of cases and deaths observed are geographically distributed at random. And the alternative hypothesis was that there is some agglomeration, that is, the cases and deaths from COVID-19 observed are higher than expected. For the analysis of this study, the following criteria were adopted: identification of essentially high-risk spatial clusters, use of the discrete Poisson model with no geographical overlap of the clusters, circular shaped clusters and 999 Monte Carlo replications. The size of the exposed population stipulated by the Gini coefficient [22] . A p value <0.05 was adopted for statistically significant clusters and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated.The tabulation and descriptive analysis of the data set used spreadsheet software.SatScan® software version 9.6 was used for the spatial scan statistic technique. The spatial association and the construction of maps were performed using ArcGis® software version 10.6.Because it is research with secondary data of public access using data in an aggregated form and without the nominal identification of the subjects, the opinion by a Research Ethics Committee was waived, according to the National Health Council Resolution 510/2016.When applying the scan statistic, 8 high-risk spatial clusters were identified for the occurrence of COVID-19 cases that were statistically significant. In total 14 DSEI were part of the risk areas and were located in the north, central west, south and southeast regions ( Figure 7) . The largest spatial cluster of risk was formed by the DSEIS Altamira, Kaiapó of Pará, Rio Tapajós and Kaiapó of Mato Grosso. The population at risk in this cluster was 28,693 indigenous people and the RR was 4.11 (p <0.001), which indicates that indigenous people from these DSEI are 4 times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 compared to those who do not belong to these locations. The characteristics of the other risk spatial clusters identified are specified in Table 1 .Admittedly, the indigenous population has a high degree of vulnerability for both COVID-19 and other diseases, and our study showed that this population suffers strongly from the impacts of this worldwide pandemic, since it has indicators that far exceed those of the general population.Most of the deaths investigated occurred in males, following the worldwide trend, in which the majority of deaths occurred in the elderly male population [2] . Our findings also showed that incidence and mortality rates increase with the aging of the indigenous population, regardless of gender, which is in line with data from the general population of Brazil [9] .In order to better understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to consider some questions about vulnerabilities present in the Brazilian indigenous population.Firstly, these individuals already have a higher prevalence of infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, in addition to high rates of malnutrition and obesity [24] . Second, the social issue related to the source of income, with indigenous peoples being among the lowest income in the country [15] . Third, it should be noted that the indigenous population has many sociocultural specificities, which influence their relationship with the environment in which they live, their way of life and also the health-disease process. An example that can be mentioned is the high number of residents per household, sharing of personal utensils and collective ceremonies, such as weddings and funerals [25] .Fourthly, we highlight territorial vulnerability. A large part of the indigenous population suffers from the devastation of their lands due to the lack of demarcation, illegal invasion, mining and deforestation [26] . Finally, it is necessary to draw attention to the precarious health structures, lack of supplies, equipment, lack of training and high turnover of professionals, difficulty in removing patients who need assistance in medium and high complexity systems. In addition, health care is still focused on palliative and emergency practices, due to the lack of strengthening of primary care [27] .The study by Silva et al (2016) [30] points out the main problems related to indigenous health in the Amazon region: scheduling appointments; long wait for hospital procedures (consultations, exams and surgeries); financial difficulty to buy medicines or to make private consultations and exams and the precarious physical structure of the services.Another factor that may be favoring the transmission of COVID-19 in the North region is the number of residents per household, with households with up to 41 residents, approximately the double that is found in the South and Southeast regions. In addition, the indigenous population of the North region suffers from a high level of illiteracy, low income and poor sanitary conditions [15, 24] .The Midwest region had a high incidence of COVID-19 and was the second region with the highest number of risk for the occurrence of the disease. The Midwest also draws attention on the national scene because it is an area with high mortality due to COVID-19.Our results showed that the two high-risk death clusters that were identified, belong to this region. Among the five SIHDs that were part of these clusters, the SIHD Xavante stands out, which is the most populous in the Midwest region and is located in the state of Mato Grosso. This SIHD differs from the others in that it is composed of only one ethnic group, totaling more than 21000 individuals [16].Despite not belonging to the risk clusters of incidence of COVID-19, the SIHD Xavante was part of the risk cluster for deaths. In the month of July that was the peak of the pandemic, this SIHD reached the highest mortality rate and highest lethality among all Brazilian SIHDs, reaching 139.7 deaths per 100000 inhabitants with a lethality of 9.7% [10].In addition, the form of organization of the Xavante villages, with very close houses and many residents, combined with the practice of collective events, such as the burial of their dead, may explain the high spread of COVID-19 in these territories [31] .In view of the above, the current vulnerability of these peoples is not only the result of an unforeseen pandemic, but part of a history of political and social exclusion that has historically violated their citizen rights and fundamental dimensions of their ways of life High transmission of the virus combined with the low resolution of actions aimed at controlling the disease has culminated in a constant threat to life within indigenous communities. Although there is a national COVID-19 contingency plan for the indigenous population, the efforts made so far are reactive and late in nature. The control of the disease is difficult and becomes even more complex with the specificities of the indigenous population, requiring multisectoral actions. If control strategies are focused on areas of potential risk, it is likely that the impacts of COVID-19 will be mitigated and deaths will be avoided, especially in view of the current trend of reducing protection measures.This study allowed the identification of hot and cold areas for occurrence and deaths by COVID-19 in the Brazilian indigenous population. High-risk clusters were also identified for both events, which were mainly concentrated in the North and Midwest regions of the country. In this sense, we suggest that actions to combat COVID-19 in indigenous territories be strengthened and better targeted, considering mainly the risk areas identified in this study. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-forprofit sectors.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-13",1

The mechanisms that explain the loss of smell probably relate to an inflammatory obstruction of the olfactory clefts [37] . Recent studies have identified molecular factors involved in the sudden loss of smell [38] . SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and protease TMPRSS2 as receptors to invade host cells [39] . Both proteins are expressed in various cell types and are particularly abundant in the nose, throat, upper bronchial airways, and alveolar epithelial type II cells. Protein expression in the nose has only been determined in supporting cells and stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, but not in olfactory neuronal receptors directly responsible for smell [37, 40] . These results suggest inflammation of these cells leads to early loss of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients. However, olfactory dysfunction is seldom self-recognized and reported except in the most severe cases [41, 42, 43] , which makes self-reported partial (hyposmia) and total (anosmia) olfactory impairment associated with COVID-19 infection unreliable [35, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] . In contrast, the prevalence of olfactory impairment in COVID-19 patients is high (75-98%) based on clinical psychophysical tests [49, 50, 51, 52, 53] .We have developed a model-based COVID-19 screening framework using a Bayes network symptom model and a low-cost olfactory function test (KOR, Kit Olfativo Rápido) for frequent and immediate prediction of COVID-19 status. To support mass testing, we have deployed a secure web platform to store and track participants' health state with automated reports. We present validation results of the Bayesian network model incorporating KOR test measurements on a sample of suspect COVID-19 patients (n = 926, 32% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and asymptomatic healthy mining workers (n = 1365, 1.1% prevalence of infection). All participants had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmation by RT-PCR assays. The KOR test and the results gathered in the platform can provide critical support for routine mass screening of COVID-19 symptoms for a safer and gradual reopening of society.The KOR test is a standardized six-odor, forced multiple-choice identification test. Briefly, each participant is presented with six familiar odors, such as orange or vanilla, in a random sequence, one at a time. After the recognition of an odor, the individual is asked to select the term that best describes it from four options in a tablet or mobile phone ( Figure 1A ). Details of the KOR test design as well as the application protocol can be found in the corresponding Methods sections. After each identification, the selected choice is stored and used for model training using RT-PCR results as indicators of COVID-19 status. Figure 1B shows the proportion of individuals who recognized aromas, by RT-PCR status. 79−93% of participants with a negative RT-PCR recognized all aromas and 56 − 74% of participants with a positive RT-PCR recognized all aromas.We developed an anosmia score based on the odors each participant was able to identify (see Methods). A higher score means a better sense of smell. Figure 2 compares anosmia score by RT-PCR status ( Fig. 2A ) and by self-reported anosmia (Fig. 2B ), for all participants in the UC-Christus sample. Healthy individuals (RT-PCR negative) had a higher anosmia score than COVID-19 cases ( Fig. 2A) , and also showed higher anosmia scores than participants who reported normal sense of smell (Fig. 2B) . The latter result suggests that some anosmic participants were not aware of their olfactory dysfunction, consistent with previous studies [48] . Participants with COVID-19 (RT-PCR positive) also showed a higher anosmia score than self-reported anosmic participants, suggesting there are normosmic participants among COVID-19 cases as reported elsewhere [36, 35] .A large proportion of COVID-19 cases develop some olfactory dysfunction [49, 50, 51, 54, 52, 53] . However, because olfactory dysfunction is a rare condition in the general population, participants with self-reported anosmia are a less biased sample. We thus estimated the distribution of the anosmia scores for the truly anosmic participants based on the scores obtained from self-reported anosmic participants (mean = −1.81; std = 2.1). Similarly, we estimated anosmia scores for the non-anosmic participants based on the score of the participants with negative RT-PCR ignoring outliers from the left tail (mean = 1.22; std = 0.97). We used these two distributions to build a Gaussian mixture classifier to identify individuals with olfactory dysfunction (refer to Methods). The results from the anosmia classifier are summarized in Figure 2C .We constructed a Bayesian network model ( Figure 3A illustrates the model structure) to estimate whether a participant had COVID-19 (P). The model included self-reported cold (F) as a confounder, seven COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, muscular pain, breathing difficulty, selfreported anosmia, ageusia, and anosmia score), five indicator variables (sI1 recognized more than four odors; sI4 reported more than one symptom among cough, fever, breathing difficulty and muscular pain and sI1; sDays had 2-3 days with symptoms; sI7 had headache, diarrhea, or chest pain and recognized four or less odors; sI8 had ageusia, stomach pain, or fatigue, and sI1), and gender. The contribution of each variable to the probability of having COVID-19 can be found in Supplementary Figs. S1-S2.We evaluated the performance of our model based on the UC-Christus dataset (n = 926, 32% positive RT-PCR). To this task, a 10-fold cross-validation was performed. Figure 3B displays the average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the full model in black. To assess the contribution to the model of the objective measurements of olfactory impairment, we estimated the model with all variables except the ones that include information from the KOR test. Figure  3B shows the ROC curve of this model in red. The complete model displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.785 with 95% confidence interval [0.754;0.816] and 76% accuracy, whereas the partially complete model yielded an AUC of 0.733 with 95% confidence interval [0.696;0.768] and 72% accuracy. The difference in the AUC is significant at an 87% level.Anosmia score predicts COVID-19 status with higher fidelity than selfreport in asymptomatic casesWe further applied the KOR test to 1, 365 workers from a mining company that had not been previously infected and did not present any symptoms, such as fever, cough, and muscular pain. These workers were also tested with RT-PCR. Among all the workers, only 15 had a positive RT-PCR, of which the BN model identified 6. These six individuals identified less than four odors from the KOR test. The remaining nine individuals identified five out of the six odors (n = 4) or identified the six odors (n = 5). Overall, the model had 84% accuracy and an AUC of 0.712 with a 95% confidence interval [0.6302;0.7942].Mint has two features that are especially attractive in a smell test, such as KOR. First, mint has a very distinctive smell and is rarely confused with other odors. Second, mint is a familiar smell to most people. In the KOR test, mint was correctly recognized by a majority of participants with a negative RT-PCR (93%). Hence, mint has a larger contribution to the model. If mint is not recognized there is a higher probability that the participant is infected (Fig. 1B) . It is possible that some of the proposed odors may not be readily recognized across different sociocultural settings, despite being used and validated in international medical studies [55] . Cross-cultural validity would be, nevertheless, straightforward to address by piloting the test and by choosing odors which satisfy the two features mentioned above before implementation.The fact that the KOR test is rapid, painless, low-cost, and simple enables mass screening of COVID-19 in the population. There is substantial evidence that a great portion of infected individuals are asymptomatic [26, 56] . For example, the notorious Diamond Princess cruise ship had an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection prevalence of 30.8% in an adult population, and The American Academy of Pediatrics currently reports that about 4% of children are asymptomatic and 51% have only mild symptoms [57] . Rational allocation of scarce diagnostic resources to test asymptomatic individuals is crucial. It can substantially mitigate disease transmission as patients with no apparent symptoms are less likely to follow public health guidelines compared to symptomatic patients [57] . Several studies have stressed the importance of frequent, mass testing [16, 17] , and modeling suggests that frequent screening for olfactory dysfunction could substantially reduce viral spread [58] . Until a substantial proportion of the population is vaccinated, frequent, accessible, routine screening for COVID-19 is critical to isolate infectious individuals and effectively break the chain of viral transmission. The KOR test, or any other psychophysical test to assess olfactory dysfunction would allow developing better sampling strategies that maximize the identification of high-probability COVID-19 cases with more sensitive tests (e.g., RT-PCR), among individuals with no apparent symptoms.Our model incorporated cold to consider that several symptoms are shared between COVID-19 and cold. Nevertheless, several other diseases and conditions share symptoms with COVID-19, including smoking, allergies, and rinithis, which we could have considered in the model. Capturing more complexity in the Bayesian network model, leads to exponentially larger data set, which rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive. We limited sample and model complexity to make parameter estimation reliable. The model assumes that symptoms are independent given the status of cold and COVID-19 (infected/not infected). This independence assumption may not be satisfied, but we prioritized a simpler model that can capture the general tendency, given sample size constraints.Until an effective vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available for a large proportion of the population, strategies to control the epidemic are mostly limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions. These interventions are socially and economically costly, and therefore, more focused interventions are increasingly important. Frequent screening, rapid diagnosis, and effective isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infections are critical. However, costs and time make currently available options impractical as a surveillance tool, particularly for low-and middle-income countries. We have presented a standardized, model-based, low-cost olfactory psychophysical test for the rapid screening of COVID-19. The test is painless and easy to implement and has a web-based secure platform for managing patient data. To this date, over 130,000 tests have been performed in the platform (refer to KOR web platform), which highlights the potential for systematic assessment of olfactory impairment in the general population. In a sample of participants with no apparent symptoms, the model captures individuals with loss of smell and a positive RT-PCR. Our results highlight the potential of using olfactory function assessments as a low-cost, frequent, accessible, painless, routine testing for COVID-19 surveillance for a safer reopening of society, including industry, universities, and other organizations.Individuals were tested following the World Health Organization guidelines for real-time reversetranscriptase PCR testing using validated diagnostics reported elsewhere [63] .Model training dataset: COVID-19 suspects cohort from healthcare systemThe first sample of participants was obtained from five medical centers that are part of the UC-Christus healthcare network in Santiago. The sample consisted of 926 individuals, 48% women and 52% men, with an average of 37 ± 13 years of age. These individuals had either symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and/or were in close contact with confirmed cases. The individuals undergone both the olfactory KOR test and the SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR tests. COVID-19 prevalence was 32% in this sample. Individuals who reported base olfactory dysfunction as a consequence of previous trauma and/or acute/chronic health issues (e.g., chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, among others) were not considered in this study. Before the application of the test, participants declared their COVID-19-related symptoms (fever, cough, muscular pain, breathing difficulty), demography (age, gender), prevailing diseases (allergy, cold, diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson, rhinitis and Alzheimer), and whether they were smokers. Other self-reported symptoms or conditions such as anosmia/hyposmia, ageusia, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, chest pain, and stomach pain, were also registered (refer to previous subsection).For model validation under more realistic conditions, a sample of 1365 individuals was collected from a mining company in Antofagasta, Chile. Individuals that satisfy criteria i) and ii) (below) were simultaneously tested for their olfactory function status and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR at a sanitary checkpoint. Inclusion criteria were: i) the person had not have a positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, and ii) at the moment of the test, the person did not have fever or any other apparent COVID-19 symptom. Only asymptomatic individuals were included in the sample. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 1.1% in this sample. Participants (825) also reported at the time of the screening if they recently suffered from olfactory impairment.To predict an individual's COVID-19 status, we built a model that considers an RT-PCR positive result as a COVID-19 case (Y 1 ), and incorporates cold (Y 2 ) as a possible confounder variable, seven symptoms (cough (X 7 ), fever (X 8 ), muscular pain (X 9 ), breathing difficulty (X 10 ), self-reported anosmia (X 14 ), ageusia (X 15 ) and the anosmia score, five indicator variables (X 11 , X 12 , X 13 , X 16 , X 17 )and we are interested in calculating the probability of positive RT-PCR given the other variables, i.e.where all variables are dichotomous Bernoulli distributed. We assume a Binomial distribution for the joint probability of RT-PCR and self-reported cold.Here k denotes the four different outcomes that the joint variables Y 1 , Y 2 can take. Note that there are a total of 75 parameters that need to be estimated. θ k represents the probability of belonging to group k for the variables Y 1 , Y 2 . θ i,k represents the probability that an individual is positive for the condition/disease/variable i given that she/he is in group k for the variables Y 1 , Y 2 . We trained this model using a dataset of 926 individuals. In order to gain some degrees of freedom, and because we observed a clear tendency between the symptoms and the outcome of the variables Y 1 , Y 2 as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 , we set the following linear constrain on the parameters,reducing the number of parameters to be estimated to 36. We either plug-in equations (3) and (4), or (3) and (5) into (1) to obtain via maximum likelihood the estimators of the parameters. The variables R ik are known and set to fit the tendency of the parameters as shown in Supplementary  Fig. S4 . Finally, for a new individual with variables X 1 = x 1 , . . . , X 18 = x 18 we compute:From these three equations we can obtain the probabilities s 0 , s 1 , s 2 , s 3 . If Y 2 = 1 thenFor an individual with outcomes from the KOR test given by (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 , x 6 ) where x i can take the value 1 if the individual identify odour i or 0 if the individual did not identify the odour i, its anosmia score is calculated in the following way.• For individuals with the cold:• For individuals without the cold:The distribution of the anosmia score, say y, is assumed to be a Gaussian mixture of two distribution:f (y; π, µ 1 , σ 2 1 , µ 2 , σ 2 2 ) = πf (y; µ 1 , σ 2 1 ) + (1 − π)f (y; µ 2 , σ 2 2 ) where f (y; µ, σ 2 ) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ 2 , the parameters µ 1 , σ 2 1 represent the parameters of the distribution for the anosmia score for individuals suffering from olfactory dysfunction, and the parameters µ 2 , σ 2 2 represent the parameters of the distribution for the anosmia score for individuals that do not suffer from olfactory dysfunction. The estimators for these parameters were obtained from the UC-Christus data:μ 1 = −1.81,σ 2 1 = 4.41,μ 2 = 1.22 andσ 2 1 = 0.94.The KOR test web platform was designed to enable a rapid administration of the test. We developed a data model to store test information efficiently, paying attention to how often data about organizations, members, and screening tests are updated. The platform's data access layer (backend) was developed in Django (open-source framework), while its user interface (front-end) was developed in the JavaScript library ReactJS (open-source). High scalability and security concerns are handled by the deployment of the platform in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

Although most people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have mild disease, about 20% may present with severe illness [1, 2] .Preventive and treatment options for COVID-19 remain under study. Therefore, traditional interventions have re-emerged as a new therapeutic alternative. CP has been used for decades for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases when no specific treatment was available [3] . CP can provide passive immunity by transfusion of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and other immune components from patients who have recovered from an infection, to unexposed or infected individuals in order to reduce the risk of disease or to lessen its clinical impact [4] . This strategy has been used for the treatment of several viral infections, including Spanish influenza, parvovirus B19, H1N1, Ebola and other coronaviruses.However, conclusive data from randomized and controlled trials are lacking [5] [6] [7] [8] .Passive immunization with plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could help to control the infection before patients have generated a proper immune response [4] . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of CP in COVID-19 patients as an investigational new drug for the treatment of this disease [9] . Up to date, several studies have published some promising benefits [10] [11] [12] [13] . The early administration of CP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 containing high IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 may not only decrease disease severity, but may also decrease mortality [14] . However, due to a high methodological variability in selection criteria for donors and recipients, dosage, NAbs concentration, disease severity, outcomes, among others, it is difficult to objectively assess the real therapeutic potential of CP [15] .COVID-19 is characterized by an overzealous activation of the innate and adaptive immune system leading to hyper-inflammation that are primarily a result of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell dysregulation [16] . In this regard, transfusion of CP to infected patients may provide antibodies, cytokines, and other active factors that may modulate the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, thus attenuating the severe inflammatory response [3] . The main mechanism of action of CP involves, among others, the presence of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 protein S, which are correlated with total IgG and IgA antibody levels [17] . Since its entire mechanisms of action are not fully understood, we aimed to evaluate the composition of the CP in terms of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, autoantibodies, cytokines and metabolites, as well as its effect on the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19, up to 28 days after treatment.This was a two-phase controlled study in which, first CP composition and the basal immunological and metabolomic status of recovered and severe patients were evaluated. Secondly, its longitudinal effect at 28-day follow-up period on the immune response in severe patients was determined (Fig. 1A ) (see section 2.7). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 10 The institutional review board at the Universidad del Rosario approved the study design. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.Participants were recruited from the following three medical centers: (1) Clínica del Occidente; (2) Clínica CES; and (3) Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi in Colombia. Participants were recruited from July 1, 2020 to August 25, 2020. Follow-up was completed on September 22, 2020. Patients were selected using non-probabilistic sampling (i.e., convenience selection). Plasma recipients were selected from the CP pilot study (NCT04332380), whereas patients who received exclusively standard therapy were selected from a randomized controlled trial (NCT04332835). The latter group comprised the first nine consecutive controls who were included in that study. Consecutive inclusion of plasma donors was also performed.Participants were divided into three groups, as follows: pre-pandemic control group (n= 16); patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (n= 19) , which included super-donors (n= 11) and donors (n= 8) on the basis of their antibody titers (see below); and patients who were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (n= 18) , whom after day 0 were split into two groups: plasma recipient (n= 9) and standard therapy (n= 9).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 Pre-donation process included the following steps/criteria: (1) signed informed consent; (2) aged between 18 and 65 years; (3) subjects with a laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) having been hospitalized but not at the intensive care unit (ICU), discharged and recovered between 14 and 30 days before the pre-donation assessment; (4) two consecutive negative RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs within 48 hours before donation; (5) women were only accepted if they did not have pregnancy history or a current suspicion of pregnancy; (6) negativity for HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, HTLV 1 and 2, syphilis, and Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Potential donors were screened for IgG and IgA antibodies, and classified as super-donors and donors according to antibody levels. Subjects with IgG antibody titers ≥1:3200 and IgA antibody titers ≥1:800 to SARS-CoV-2 were considered super-donors and were chosen for plasmapheresis and further therapeutic transfusion. Subjects who did not reach those titers were considered as donors, and were discard for plasmapheresis, but its serum composition was analyzed in this study. Approximately, 800 mL of plasma were collected from super-donors. Prior freezing, pathogens inactivation with Riboflavin followed by UV light exposure was performed [18] .Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) signed informed consent; (2) were not included.Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) pregnancy or breast feeding; (2) patients with prior allergic reactions to transfusions; (3) critically ill patients in ICU;(4) patients with surgical procedures in the last 30 days; (5) subjects with active treatment for cancer (i.e., radiotherapy or chemotherapy); (6) diagnosis of HIV in subjects with viral failure (i.e., detectable viral load > 1000 copies/ml), two consecutive viral load measurements within a 3-month interval; (7) subjects with other confirmed infection that explains clinical manifestations; (8) end-stage kidney disease (i.e., glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min/1.73 m2); (9) Child Pugh C stage liver cirrhosis; (10) high cardiac output diseases; (11) autoimmune diseases or immunoglobulin A nephropathy; (12) and subjects not willing to participate.Each transfusion dose of CP was 250 mL, patients received two doses for a total of 500 mL within 48 hours after study inclusion. Each CP unit was kept separate from other super-donors' units. The transfused CP ABO type was compatible with the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 recipient's ABO type in 8 out of 10 transfused patients. Each recipient received CP units from the same super-donor. CP transfusion was administered at 3 mL/min with close monitoring for the first 30 min, and regular monitoring over the following 6 hours.Standard treatment consisted of symptomatic control and supportive care for COVID-19. This treatment was based upon recommendations from the Colombian Association of Infectology and institutional protocols, which included management with antibiotics, corticosteroids, oxygen, and anticoagulants [19] . Both plasma recipient and standard therapy groups received this treatment.Sociodemographic and pathological factors were evaluated on day 0. The biological baseline included cytokines, lymphocyte populations, IgA and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, viral load, blood gases, laboratory surrogate of possible thrombotic process (i.e., D-Dimer), hematological, inflammatory, hepatic and renal parameters. These measurements were repeated on days 4, 7, 14 and 28. In addition, the SOFA scale and the 4C mortality score (i.e., score for prediction of mortality 28 days after hospitalization) were evaluated on admission [20] . The viral load was measured using the Ampliphi ® RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Kit (www.ampliphi.co).The Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) was used for serological detection of human IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 structural protein, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.The ratio interpretation was <0.8 = negative, ≥0.8 to <1.1 = borderline, ≥ 1.1 = positive [17, 21, 22] . Antibody titration was performed using serial dilutions of serum samples from 1:100 to 1:1,638,400.Detection of IgM rheumatoid factor (RF), IgG anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide thirdgeneration (CCP3), IgM and IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACAs), IgM and IgG anti-β2glycoprotein (β2GPI) antibodies, IgG anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, IgG anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were quantified by ELISA as previously reported [23] . In addition, anti-nuclear antibodies were detected by IMTEC-ANA-LIA Maxx (Human Diagnostics Magdeburg, Germany) [24] . Assessment of anti-IFN-α antibodies was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 15 done by ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following manufacturer's specifications.A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50 ) for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Vero cells [17] , with serum samples diluted from 1:16 to 1:4,096.Concentration of 20 human cytokines IL-2, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IFN-α, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon-γ induced protein 10 (IP-10) in serum samples from patients were assessed using the Cytometric Bead Array (BD Biosciences™, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, U.S.) in a FACSCanto II™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences™) [25] .To increase the metabolite coverage, serum samples were analyzed using an For a detailed analysis of the cell phenotype, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies. A minimum of 100,000 lymphocytes per sample were acquired on a FACSCanto II™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences™). Table 1 ) were analyzed with FlowJo software version 9 (BD Biosciences™).Briefly, in the univariate analysis, categorical variables were analyzed using frequencies, and quantitative continuous variables were expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or the median and interquartile range (IQR). The Mann-Whitney U-test, the chi-squared or Fisher exact tests were used based on the results. Correlations among variables of interest were performed using the Spearman correlation test, and when necessary, corrected for multiple inference using Holm's method. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) that were adjusted for age and sex were used to evaluate intergroup differences between pre-pandemic controls, donors, super-donors, and COVID-19 patients. Additionally, GLMMs were used to evaluate longitudinal changes in antibody ratios, cytokine delta, and lymphocyte population delta. A P value of <0.05 was set as significant.Analyses were performed using SAS Studio© (SAS® University Edition, Cary, North Carolina, U.S.) and R version 4.0.1.To establish the differential biological composition of CP from recovered COVID-19patients, we compared the plasma of the following groups: samples collected prior (Table 1 ). In patients transfused with CP containing autoantibodies including anti-IFN-α neither adverse events nor mortality was observed. On the other hand, two recipients positive for antibodies anti-IFN-α prior to transfusion deceased.Next, a panel of 20 cytokines was evaluated. This is of interest since transfusion of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators could influence the recipient response. Cytokines were gathered using principal-component analysis (PCA) ( Fig. 1C ). This analysis revealed, that the only difference between donors and super-donors relied on anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 levels. Thus, since both donors and super-donors disclosed a similar cytokine profile, it was appropriate to combine the data of these two groups as a unique recovered group for subsequent analyses. P=<0.0001) levels were higher in COVID-19 than in recovered patients (Fig. 1E ).Although IL-4, IL-8, TNF-α and IFN-γ z-score was slightly increased in recovered patients ( Fig. 1D ), no differences were found at the statistical level.Non-targeted metabolomic and lipidomic profile was evaluated to assess additional levels and therefore were gathered again as a single recovered group for all subsequent OPLS-DA models.For recovered and pre-pandemic controls, 50 metabolites were found to be statistically significant (Supplementary Table 2 ). The heatmaps showed that the proportion of most statistically significant metabolite levels were lower in recovered patients, which corresponds to fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids (Fig. 2E ).When the COVID-19 group was compared with the pre-pandemic control and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 20 recovered groups (Supplementary Table 3 ), the largest class of differential metabolites corresponded to a dysregulation in fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerolipids, and in a lower proportion of sterol lipids and sphingolipids ( Fig.   2F ). However, the phenotype of recovered patients did not return to a similar phenotype of pre-pandemic controls, and it was characterized by continued altered levels of unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic and linoleic acid (Fig. 2 ).After the evaluation of CP composition, we aimed to evaluate the immune response in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Inter-group analysis revealed that plasma recipients and standard therapy patients were similar in age, sex, WHO scale, SOFA score, 4C score, PaO2-FiO2, and viral load on inclusion. In addition, comorbidities and body mass index were similar between groups.Patients who underwent plasma transfusion received CP within the first 72 hours after hospitalization. None of the patients presented adverse reactions nor acute exacerbation of the disease after CP transfusion (Table 2) .To characterize the T-and B-cell signature in COVID-19 patients' prior transfusion, a cellular analysis was performed before plasma or standard therapy treatment.PCA of 30 cell subsets clearly distinguished between COVID-19 patients and prepandemic controls (Fig. 3A) 3B ).A correlation matrix among clinical and biological parameters was constructed ( Table 4 ).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 22 Prior longitudinal analysis, a baseline analysis (i.e., Day 0) between the plasma receptor group (i.e., recipients) and the standard therapy group looking for cytokines and immune cell signature was performed. Since this analysis revealed differences for some cell populations (Supplementary Table 5 ) and cytokines (Supplementary Table 6 ), we conducted a longitudinal analysis [delta (∆) changes] to evaluate the effect of CP.Based on the results of the previous section, we evaluated the immune response induced by CP through longitudinal follow-up in patients with COVID-19 after treatment with CP or standard therapy. No significant differences in clinical outcomes or viral load were found between groups during the follow-up (Fig. 4A , Table 2 ). However, the IgG anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2 ratio value was higher on day 4in the plasma recipient group ( Table 7) .For cellular sub-phenotypes, most of the between-group differences were observed at ∆D14 to D28. Plasma recipients showed a positive ∆change in central memory Our study showed an ongoing and dynamic immune response differential between treatments. Although antibody-independent mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the effect of CP [3] , no difference between donors and superdonors in terms of cytokines and metabolomic profile was observed. Super-donors had NAbs titers ≥1:256, which exceeded the FDA recommendation of ≥1:160 [9, 29] . Thus, the main difference between super-donors and donors was in their antibody levels, which highly correlated with NAbs [17] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 24 We found a differential metabolomic profile of recovered COVID-19 patients compared with pre-pandemic controls and severe COVID-19 patients. Consistent with previous reports, ours confirmed that COVID-19 patients are characterized by lipid dysregulation in fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids, which has been associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress [30, 31] . Recovered patients regulated the most prominent metabolic perturbations that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection on metabolic function, such as a decrease in lipid levels, along with an increase in ketone bodies. However, the phenotype of recovered patients did not return to a similar phenotype of prepandemic controls, and it was characterized by continued altered levels of unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic and linoleic acid.COVID-19 patients disclose latent rheumatologic, thyroid and antiphospholipid autoimmunity (Table 1 ) [32] . Several emerging reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can lead to autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases [33] [34] [35] . The pathogenic mechanisms shared between these diseases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could act as a triggering factor for the development of autoimmune phenomena in susceptible individuals [16, 36] . Post-COVID-19 long-term studies are warranted to determine whether this latent autoimmunity persists and may evolve towards overt autoimmunity (i.e., clinical disease) [37] . Furthermore, anti-IFN-α antibodies were confirmed in COVID-19 patients. A recent study, showed that some infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2, mainly men produce autoantibodies against IFN-α due to inborn errors of type I IFN immunity [38] . These autoantibodies are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 25 associated with high risk of developing life-threatening pneumonia [39] . However, in this small study, clinical worsening following CP transfusion containing such antibodies was not observed, suggesting that allogenic antibodies anti-IFN-α do not influence clinical outcomes.We observed that transfusion of CP with high NAbs titers did not significantly modify viral load kinetics. Although early administration of CP to hospitalized COVID-19 patients could reduce severity and mortality [14] , this phenomenon is not exclusively attributable to viral load reduction. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a higher viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20-40 days after onset of disease than mildly ill patients, indicating that severity of illness influences viral load kinetics [40] . All together, data indicate that the level of antibodies does not guarantee viral clearance.Patients with COVID-19 showed a correlation between hematological and clinical parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as previously reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection [41] [42] [43] [44] . COVID-19 patients showed a hyper-inflammatory response that was characterized by high levels of IP-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, MCP-1, IFN-α, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-10 (Fig. 5) . Accumulating evidence indicate that the severity of COVID-19 is associated with an increased level of inflammatory mediators including the cytokines and chemokines mentioned above [45] [46] [47] . Among these cytokines, IL-6 is one of the key factors associated with lethal complications of COVID-19 patients [48] . IL-6 amplifier is activated by coactivation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and STAT3, which are potential regulators of the COVID-19-mediated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 26 cytokine storm [47] . High IFN-α levels were observed in COVID-19 patients, as previously shown [46] . However, opposite results for IFN-α have been published [38, 39, 49] . Cytokines release in COVID-19 is influenced by disease duration and severity, sex, age, genetic background including ancestry, and autoimmune phenomena [38, 39, 50] .High levels of IL-6 and IL-10 can directly block the expansion of lymphoid progenitors [48, 51] , causing lymphopenia. The hyper-inflammatory state (i.e., cytokine storm syndrome) drives the exhaustion of T cell subsets, characterized by perpetuated activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [52] [53] [54] [55] . IL-6 also induces Th17and Th22 differentiation and favors inflammation [56] .The inflammatory profile of cytokines in COVID-19 differed from that of recovered patients. CP transfusion early regulates the inflammatory balance among the cytokines evaluated in this study, which have been associated with COVID-19 severity [57] . An increase in IL-8 was observed in recovered patients compared to pre-pandemic controls. Similar results were reported by Hähnel et al., [58] who observed a slight increase in IL-8 in plasma donors, indicating that some proinflammatory cytokines may still be present in the plasma of recovered COVID-19patients.CP decreased the IL-6/IL-10 and IL-6/IFN-γ ratios on day 28 post-transfusion.Recent reports have shown that an increase in the IL-6/IL-10 ratio is related to a poor prognosis in COVID-19 [59] . IL-10 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that can J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 27 attenuate inflammatory responses through its Th2 activity and by blocking NF-κB, which negatively regulates IL-6 production [60, 61] . However, a large amount of IL-10 inhibits immune cell function and proliferation, which delays viral clearance and can consequently cause lung damage [62] . The decrease in the IL-6/IFN-γ ratio in the plasma recipient group indicates another mechanism of action of CP. Lagunas-Rangel et al., [63] showed that an increase in this ratio could be associated with COVID-19 severity. Interaction between these two cytokines contributes to the recruitment and adequate elimination of neutrophils which favors the timely resolution of the infection and prompt transition between innate and adaptive immunity [64, 65] . Moreover, CP induced an early but transient increase of TNF-α, IL-8, IL-17A, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ, although the latter was persistently increased at day 28. The understanding of the inflammatory profiles in COVID-19 have demonstrated a dual role of IFN-γ. Some have shown increased IFN-γ in severe COVID-19 patients [66] , while others have shown opposite results [67] . Our results indicated that CP induces a temporary increase in inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ and TNF-α) that counteracts the infection by controlling the cytokine storm syndrome, as observed in the decrease in the IL-6/IL-10 and IL-6/IFN-γ ratios.Our findings also demonstrate that the use of CP attenuates the exhausted phenotype observed in patients before transfusion, since CP decreases activated and effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5) . Kalfaoglu et al., [68] [69] found that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes have antiviral function: memory T cells produce cytokines and expand upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells express receptors capable of neutralizing the virus. Previous reports have shown that recovery is associated with the increase of T cell memory as suggested by the lack of central memory in severe COVID-19 patients [70] . Likewise, the frequency of memory B cells is a critical indicator of the resolution of the disease in SARS-CoV-2 [71] . CP induces a robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, along with a memory T and B phenotype that could provide long-term immunity.Our study has several strengths. We included patients in the first 72 hours of admission, and in the first 14 days after symptoms onset, which allowed to limitation of the present study is that the observed results might be from chance alone or the moderate sample size. However, this is unlikely because of the highly significant results that were seen after adjustments and corrections as well as their consistent direction and magnitude within the different analyses.Total IgG and IgA anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are key factors for CP selection and correlate with NAbs. Serum from recovered patients discloses a different cytokine and metabolite composition than that from patients with severe disease.

In more advanced stages of a pandemic where epidemiological routes cannot be constructed, effectively testing the population becomes a challenging task that must thrive to keep under-reporting as low as possible. The accuracy in measuring case incidence and prevalence, as well as mortality rates is decisive for high-quality epidemiological modelling that enables governments to propose and implement public policies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic [2] [3] [4] .Throughout the current Covid-19 pandemic, governments have mainly gathered databases of daily positive cases and positive deaths. Due to the finite resources of each country, tests for Covid-19 are performed only on a subset of the total country's population. Different countries have different strategies to select those subsets. No matter how effective those strategies are, it is expected that some infected people do not ever get tested for Covid-19, and therefore are not reported into the positive Covid-19 cases databases. This phenomenon is known as under-reporting, and its magnitude varies especially in relation with the effectiveness of epidemiological tracing strategies, as well as tests availability [5] .In this work we show how disease cases databases can be used to estimate the magnitude of this under- * clviviescasr@unal.edu.co reporting, thus yielding better-quality figures for case incidence and mortality rates. In particular, we analyse and report data from Colombia to assess its current situation of cumulative positive cases. Unlike seroprevalence studies, the method that we use does not need to perform further tests than the ones already performed, and whose results are contained in the cases databases.Our method is based on the idea of comparing case fatality ratios (CFRs) between a target country, which in our case is Colombia, and a benchmark country, which in our case is the Republic of Korea. The benchmark country should be one that has a very effective testing strategy. This means that the scientific community is confident in that strategy, which also means that the benchmark country is expected to have low under-reporting. The method answers the question of how many positive cases would be detected in the target country if it were using the testing strategy of the benchmark country? Related to this question, we also explain how to account for differences between the population of the target and the benchmark country. This paper is divided as follows. Section II lays out the data used for our study, and also details the method to correct CFRs. Section III presents the estimated status of Covid-19 in Colombia. Then section IV compares our results with other studies, and also discusses some limitations of our study. Finally, we conclude in section V.Since the main objective of our work is to estimate the true number of cumulative positive cases of Covid-19 in Colombia, in this section we explain a method to answer the following question: for an arbitrary geographical region, can we account for under-reporting to estimate the true number of cumulative positive cases?We use two datasets for our analysis. The first one is the data published by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) [6] , which is updated every day and reports all known Covid-19 cases in Colombia. For each case it provides its date of notification, location city, state or district, current status (recovered, recovery from home, being treated in an intensive care unit and passed away), age, sex, country of provenance, symptom onset date, date of death, date of diagnosis, date of recovery and the web report date. From this information we derive the case incidence as well as the distribution of days between onset date and date of death for the cases that resulted in death. For this, we need the onset date for every record in the database, and their corresponding dates of death, if the cases resulted in death. We also keep information about age and location of each case. To construct the case incidence time-series (see fig. 1 ) as well as the onsetto-death distribution we used data up to December 28, 2020.The other dataset is extracted from the demographic database maintained by the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) [7] . We retrieve data containing the most recent projection for the year 2020 of the number of individuals per age group for all regions and cities of Colombia (see fig. 2 ). This demographic dataset will be needed in order to assess the vulnerability of each region to Covid-19, as it is well documented that death risk strongly depends on age [8] [9] [10] .The CFR is adjusted following the method proposed by Nishiura et al. [11] . We estimate the proportion of cases resolved using the case and death incidence to adjust the CFR to account for delay outcome (cCFR). The underestimation factor [1, 11, 12, 16, 17] ,scales the cumulative number of cases in the denominator of the cCFR, and accounts for the adjustment. Here c t is the daily case incidence (see top panel of fig. 1 ) at time t and f t = f (t) is the conditional probability density of the delay-time from onset-to-death (see fig. 3 ).For Covid-19 the severity of the infection is highly correlated to the age of the infected individual [14] , hence, for each region or city, we evaluate age-stratified estimates of the adjusted case fatality rate, cCFR ri , where r stands for the region and i labels the age group. The age aggregated cCFR for a region is adjusted for the population demographics, and is given byHere, p ri is the fraction of the population with age i for the region r.The adjusted cCFR does not account for underreporting. In order to obtain an estimate of the potential level of under-reporting in Colombia and its regions our model follows the simple method proposed by Russell et al. [1] further adjusting for the country demography. We assume a baseline CFR (blCFR), taken from a benchmark country, and compare it with the estimated cCFR for Colombia and some of its regions and cities. We do an age-stratified analysis. If the cCFR ri is higher than blCFR i , it indicates that only a portion of the real number of cases in this age group have been reported so far. The fraction of reported cases in region r and age group i is given bywhich accounts for the region population demographics through p ri , and obtainThe most recent literature offers several estimates CFR for Covid-19. Among those adjusting or controlling for under-reporting, we mention those by Verity et al. [14] , Russell et al. [16] , Shim et al. [17] , Guan et al. [18] . In our analysis, we use as benchmark country the Republic of Korea. As baseline we use for this work the age stratified CFR data of July 14, 2020 [19] , listed in Table II , since most of the cases from the first peak had already been resolved by this date. In our analysis we consider all regions and cities in Colombia that have reported at least 40 fatal Covid-19 cases as of December 28, 2020. Table III shows the percentage of cases reported, the cCFR, blCFR and the total cases and deaths for all regions of Colombia. Note that the value of the blCFR fluctuates from region to region, evidencing the differences in population demographics between regions. For regions and cities with a younger population than the average of the country, the blCFR is lower compared to the value for the country. On the contrary, in those regions or cities in which the fraction of the population with age above 60 years is more significant, the blCFR is higher than the value for the country. As an example, consider fig. 2 where the age distribution of Amazonas, the region with the youngest population, is compared to the age distribution of Risaralda, the region with the oldest population. The corresponding blCFRs mirror the demographics, with Amazonas' blCFR being 0.5% and Risaralda's being 1.4%.We also present age-stratified reporting percentages for all the regions in Colombia (with at least 40 fatal Covid-19 cases) in table IV. A trend is notable: reporting percentage is much higher for the elder population, whereas it is quite low for the young population. We hypothesise that young people do not get tested as much as old people because if symptomatic, they only develop mild symptoms in most cases [10, 20] . This is an important source of uncertainty on the estimation of the virus propagation because young people are relevant vectors because of mobility reasons, especially in cities [21, 22] . Furthermore, the framework so far exposed can be used to evaluate reporting percentages and estimations of cCFRs in the past by truncating the datasets. However, there is a detail that has to be handled carefully. Notice that when we compute the cCFR, we are using the number of death people reported up to today, and we are using the case incidence curve reported up to today. This means that we are in the best state of knowledge that we can about today. However, tomorrow, we will have a state of knowledge about today better than the one we have today. This is because tomorrow there will be some cases with onset symptoms dates from today and from previous days. Similarly, tomorrow there will be reported cases of people that died today or in previous days. Therefore, we need to truncate the datasets based on the report day only. Thus, if we truncate the database a month ago, we ensure that we are reproducing the state of knowledge that we had one month ago.The evolution of reporting percentage confidence intervals are shown in fig. 4 . Qualitatively, almost all regions start with wide confidence intervals, and they become narrow as more people are reported positive or dead because of Covid-19. Also, in most regions the reporting percentage raises as time passes by. An important feature is that in some of the most inhabited regions, there are drops on the reporting percentage about July-August. This coincides with the peak of positive cases reported in Colombia. Even though the number of tests also incremented on those dates, they did not match the rate at which new cases and more importantly, new deaths rose.These plots can also be useful to evaluate different public policies being carried out at each region. For instance, Boyacá closed their borders early on in the pandemic [23] . Later, they opened the borders, and naturally, the number of cases grew. The peak is found to be at the end of October and beginning of November. Nonetheless, despite a pronounced peak, the number of tests was enough to maintain the same reporting percentage over the course of those months, as seen in fig. 4 . Another interesting case is Amazonas, the largest state in Colombia by area. It hit the headlines several times because it had the largest number of deaths per inhabitant at the start of the pandemic (around May) [24] . As a consequence, the government performed many tests (with respect to other states), making Amazonas the state with more performed tests per inhabitant. Despite this special attention that the state got, its reporting percentage is well below the average of Colombia.An important point has to be remarked on the validity of our results. We saw that we corrected the CFR for today with the information that we possess today. In the future we will have more information about today, and a better correction of the CFR for today can be estimated. To account for this lag of information we would need to predict how many cases will be reported in future days. To perform this prediction, we need to use information about how many people have been infected so far. And calculating how many people have been infected so far needs the prediction of new cases. Thus, this becomes an auto-consistent problem which falls beyond the scope of this work. Nonetheless, the further correction that can be achieved by solving this auto-consistent problem can be important, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. For instance, a simple prediction of new cases done by linear regression on the case incidence time-series can yield statistically significant differences in the reporting percentage that we estimate (not shown). More accurate predictions done by fitting epidemiological models can improve the accuracy of our last statement.Another important resource when trying to estimate the true number of infected Covid-19 cases in Colombia and its regions is a seroprevalence study. In Colombia, some seroprevalence studies were recently published. In table V we show the results for some Colombian cities. By dividing the reported number of deaths by an estimate of the cases given by the seroprevalence studies, we computed the corresponding nCFR for each city. We also added the results of seroprevalence studies for two of the most affected zones in Europe and the New York State. We see a high seroprevalence and low values of nCFR in all of Colombia regions. On the other hand, European zones show an opposite situation. In the case of New York, the study was done just before the days with a high number of daily deaths (29 March) , which is why the nCFR is very low. Rosenberg et al. [25] mentioned that if they considered an average of 19 days between onset-to-death as an average, the nCFR would be 0.6 %, which still doubles the nCFR found in Colombia. As a conclusion, the nCFR of Colombia deduced by seroprevalence studies in all its regions is smaller than in other countries. We hypothesise that this could be due to the age-distribution of the countries: Colombia's population is younger than USA's, Spain's and Italy's.Also, Colombian seroprevalence studies are preliminary and the methodology details is not publish yet. Therefore, we do not know the possible biases. Particularly, the Montería study [26] has a possible bias because tested people were chosen randomly in different neighbourhoods and it is known that cities have intrinsically heterogeneous mobility patterns [21] , thus making any uniform random samples problematic [27, 28] .Our study makes some assumptions that directly impact the results, therefore, the figures given in this work have to consider the following limitations:• We do not account for comorbidities of the population which can influence the vulnerability (i.e. the baseline CFR) of a country or a region. The main comorbidities correlated with Covid-19 deaths are cerebrovascular disease, high-blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonar diseases, diabetes, among others [32] .• Also, we ignore the burden of the healthcare system among other regional and socio-economical factors that might influence the capacity of a country or a region to attend all important Covid-19 cases.• Our results are liked and biased by the baseline CFR, which come from measured nCFRs from the Republic of Korea. An important effect is that reporting percentage (and therefore the estimation of seroprevalence) can change a lot for small errors in the estimation of the baseline CFR.• We do not take into account different strains of Covid-19 and the different CFRs for each type [33, 34] .In the present study we accounted for the delay between symptom's onset and death caused by the Covid-19 disease in order to estimate its case fatality ratio in Colombia and its regions. This estimation allows us to calculate the total number of infected people so far in Colombia and its regions, thus creating a clear picture of the magnitude of the pandemic in this country. In particular, we estimate that there have been a total number of 3'661,621 infected people in Colombia, in contrast with the confirmed 1'594,497, as of December 28, 2020. Moreover, the following are the states with the largest underreporting in Colombia: Amazonas, Magdalena, Norte de Santander and Putumayo. Furthermore, the capital city of Colombia, Bogotá, presents a reporting percentage close to 48%.A remarkable feature of the method to estimate CFRs in Colombia and its regions was the inclusion of demographics, as Covid-19 has proven to have different mortalities for populations with different ages. Therefore, we saw that older populations were more vulnerable than younger ones. Indeed, our corrected CFRs have a correlation of 0.51 with the baseline CFRs, which account for regions demographics, indicating that younger (older) populations are expected to have lower (higher) mortalities.Another phenomenon linked with age distributions is that the reporting percentage is much lower in the young population, whereas the old population presents large reporting percentage. We hypothesise that this happens because young people usually have low to mild symptoms, and most of the time they do not require to go to the hospital, and prefer not to take a Covid-19 test. This behaviour is seen in every single region of Colombia.Finally, we also compared our results to seroprevalence studies from Colombia. Although most of those studies have only released preliminary results, they all indicate mortalities much lower than those reported in Europe and the United States of America. Also, compared to our results, the seroprevalence studies in Colombia show lower estimates of mortality, and thus, estimate more true cases of Covid-19 in the country than we do.We developed a Python library that eases the extraction, load and transformation of raw data from the INS database. The code is freely available at https: //gitlab.com/hubrain/covid19. Also, we designed a dashboard were we keep a daily record of how reporting percentages are changing at each region which can be found at http://covid19.hubrain.co. Furthermore, the code to reproduce the figures and tables here presented is in https://gitlab.com/hubrain/ covid19-paper.","Colombia","abstract","2021-01-04",1

Early detection of cases by highly sensitive and specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the currently recommended diagnostic strategy (World Health Organization, 2020a) . However, the high cost of RT-PCR, shortage of reagents, and need for trained personnel have limited the testing capacities of laboratories to provide results in a timely manner (World Health Organization, 2020b) . In addition, new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 testing include the estimation of infectivity to tailor control measures of known or suspected COVID-19 cases (Rhee et al., 2020) . Low viral counts detected by RT-PCR might not correspond to infectious virus, especially in asymptomatic individuals or in patients who continue shedding viral RNA after recovering from COVID-19, resulting in false positives and segregation of people who are no longer infectious (Jefferson et al., 2020; Wáng, 2020; Kim et al., 2020) . Therefore, alternative diagnostic tools allowing the rapid testing of large numbers of samples and the ability to evaluate infectivity are of high priority (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2020). Recent developments include whole-genome sequencing, CRISPR-based technologies, droplet-based digital PCR, RT-LAMP, and immunoassays for the detection of antibodies or antigen (Giri et al., 2020) . Rapid antigen detection tests (Ag-RDT) using immunochromatographic (ICT) or fluorescence immunoassays (FIAs) have recently become available; many of which are CE-IVD licensed and some have received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) (www.finddx.org/COVID-19/pipeline). These tests are fast, easy to use and do not require highly trained personnel or sophisticated equipment. As previously suggested FIAs are highly specific and can reach remarkably high sensitivities, if applied in samples from early phases of infection or with high viral loads Weitzel et al., 2020 , Liotti et al., 2020 . For this reason, they could complement RT-PCR testing by becoming a first line tool for rapid detection of infective individuals.Here we present the performance of two novel FIA automated antigen detection systems in samples from COVID-19 patients presenting within 5 days of symptom onset.Samples derived from patients attending Clínica Alemana in Santiago, Chile, for COVID-19 testing. Specimens consisted of naso-oropharyngeal flocked swabs obtained by trained personnel and placed in universal transport media (UTM-RT Ò System; Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR assay (COVID-19 Genesig, Primerdesign Ltd., Chander's Ford, UK). Samples exhibiting exponential amplification curves and cycle thresholds (Ct) values ≤40 were considered positive .RT-PCR characterized UTM samples were aliquoted and kept at −80 C until analysis by the two FIA kits, ""SOFIA SARS Antigen FIA"" (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) and ""STANDARD F COVID-19 Ag FIA"" (SD Biosensor Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). Both tests detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by lateral flow immunofluorescence, which is interpreted by automated analysers (Table 1 ). The kits are CE-IVD labelled; Quidel recently received EUA by the FDA. Manufacturers state that both tests should be performed using nasopharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic individuals within 5 days of symptom onset. The use of samples stored in certain brands of universal transport media (including Copan UTM) is permitted for the SD Biosensor assay; the Quidel test initially also allowed using UTM, but a recent instruction update discourages the use of such prediluted samples.For the evaluation, 32 RT-PCR positive UTM samples, all collected within the first 5 days after symptom onset, and 32 negative specimens were selected. All positive samples were from symptomatic patients, 12 negative samples were from asymptomatic patients screened before surgery. Some of the positive (n = 27) and negative samples (n = 19) had been used in a previous evaluation . Assays were performed using the same sample aliquot, following manufacturers´instructions, by the same laboratory personnel, who were blinded to RT-PCR results. In brief, specimens were mixed with an extraction reagent, dispensed into the cassette's sample well, and read after incubation by an instrument. Testing procedures were performed under a BSL2 cabinet. RT-PCR served as reference method; in case of discordant results, tests were repeated. Demographic and clinical information was retrieved from the national surveillance system and anonymously analysed. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated as recommended by current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI, 2008) ; for the Wilson score Confidence Interval (CI) at 95%, we used OpenEpi (version 3.01). Test performance was evaluated for all samples and for those with high viral loads (Ct ≤ 25), as previously described (World Health Organization, 2020c). Kits and analysers were provided by manufacturers at reduced costs for evaluation purposes. The study was approved by the Comité Etico Científico, Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo in Santiago, Chile, and a waiver of informed consent was granted (Project ID number 931).The study included a total of 64 samples, 32 were RT-PCR positive and 32 RT-PCR negative. The median age was 39 years (IQR 36.7-57) and 52% were male. Median days from symptom onset to RT-PCR testing of positive and negative cases were 2 (IQR 1-3) and 1 (IQR 0.75-4), respectively. Ct values had a median of 17.95 (IQR, ); 29/32 samples (90.6%) had a Ct ≤ 25 (Table 2) .Both assays demonstrated an overall sensitivity >90%, reaching 100% for samples with high viral loads (Table 3) . False negative results were observed with the Quidel and SD Biosensor assays in two and three samples, respectively, which had Cts of 30.89-32.57 and were taken on the 4th or 5th day after symptom onset. Specificity was 96.7% for both tests, that is, both kits displayed a single false positive result, from two distinct symptomatic RT-PCR negative cases (Table 3 ). The two assays were user friendly, included ready-touse reagents and required little hands-on time. Moreover, analysers were easy-to-use, stored the results, and included options for QR coding, printing, and connection to laboratory information systems. Antigen-based assays have risen as one of the most practical alternatives, but independent evaluations of their diagnostic performance are scarce and their role within the routine diagnostic workup is yet not defined (World Health Organization, 2020c; Dinnes et al., 2020) . One of the main concerns about antigen-based tests is that these assays per se have a higher detection threshold than RT-PCR, thus, they might miss cases with low viral replication during very early or late infections (World Health Organization, 2020c; Liotti et al., 2020) . However, the results of this and former studies indicate that antigen detection by immunofluorescence, especially when used with an automated reader, has an excellent sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in samples with estimated viral loads abovẽ 10 6 copies/mL (Ct values ≤ 25) (World Health Organization, 2020c), which are found in pre-symptomatic (1-3 days before symptom onset) and early symptomatic COVID-19 cases (up to 5-7 days after symptom onset) Lee et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020) . According to recent modelling studies, elevated viral titers are associated to infectivity (Larremore et al., 2020) . This is in accordance with in vitro experiments, which showed no viral growth from samples with Cts > 24 or taken >8 days after symptom onset (Bullard et al., 2020 , Wölfel et al., 2020 . A viral load of 10 6 copies/mL has therefore been suggested as the limit of infectivity for clinical practice (Drosten, 2020) . However, until the exact threshold of contagiousness is known, other authors have considered a more conservative approach (1,000 copies/mL) (Jacot et al., 2020) .For samples with high viral loads, our comparative study showed that both tests were 100% sensitive. This is in accordance with manufacturers' information and a recent study from Italy of the STANDARD F assay, which showed a high detection rate of 95.2% (20/21) in samples with Cts < 25 (Liotti et al., 2020) . In our panel of positive samples, false negatives only occurred with Cts > 30, which translates to viral loads <10 4 for the used RT-PCR protocol (Scohy et al., 2020) , although this finding has to be confirmed with a larger number of specimens. The high-performance value coincides with recent studies of a similar FIA with automated reading (BioEasy, Shenzhen, China), which demonstrated sensitivities of 100% for samples with Cts ≤ 25 and of 98% for samples with Cts ≤ 30 (Diao et al., 2020) . In contrast, immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests demonstrated lower sensitivity values of 74-85% for samples with Cts ≤ 25 Mertens et al., 2020; Lambert-Niclot et al., 2020) . The evaluation of test specificity was limited by the low number of included RT-PCR-negative samples. In our experience, the rate of false positives using the Biosensor assay in pre-surgical samples of low-risk asymptomatic patients was 1.6% (6/374) (L. Porte and T. Weitzel, 2020, unpublished observations) .Although additional studies with larger numbers of samples are needed, the excellent performance data of FIA Ag-RDTs suggest their potential use in the following scenarios, when RT-PCR is unavailable or impractical: (1) closed or semi-closed remote communities such as cruise ships or military camps (World Health Organization, 2020c), (2) High-risk congregate facilities including schools, care-homes, dormitories, etc., when testing daily or every other day could reduce secondary infections by 100% or 90%, respectively (Paltiel, Zheng & Walensky, 2020) , and (3) screening of asymptomatic attendees at potential superspreader events, like conferences, weddings, and sports or cultural events. In the future, due to their high sensitivity to detect infective patients, FIA Ag-RDTs might also play an important role within ""test-out"" strategies, that is, the early release of suspected cases from self-isolation or shortening quarantine for proven cases.The authors received no funding for this work.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Lorena Porte conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments, analyzed the data, prepared figures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.

In March 11 th 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) , a condition with multiple clinical features, which can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications was declared a pandemic 2, 3 . The disease spread rapidly, affecting regions and areas located in urban settings but also in rural and geographical distant areas all over the world 4, 5 .The epidemiological behavior of the pandemic showed an exponential growth throughout many countries, while others seem to have managed the outbreak better 6 . Several studies have identified differences in morbidity and mortality depending on many factors including socioeconomic status, the burden of chronic diseases, adequate access to health care, the strength of the epidemiological surveillance systems and the implementation of control measures as well as strict mobility restrictions 7 . During the first months of the pandemic, very few ecological studies showed a possible epidemiological and survival implication exerted by high altitude 7, 8 . It has been proposed that these results are in part answered by the well-known physiological acclimatization and the long term adaptation to high altitude exposure, generating a greater tolerance to the hypoxia [7] [8] [9] [10] . These results are also supported by the presence of some biological plausibility regarding lower virus' affinity for the type-2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor since highlanders might have lower expression of ACE-2 receptors 8 . Consequently, it has been hypothesized that high altitude populations would have less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, therefore lower likelihood to develop severe pathological conditions related to COVID-19 11 . Another hypothesis surrounding those findings refer to the involvement of the hypoxia-triggered protein that regulates angiogenesis, the well-known Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 α ) 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .The link between chronic exposure due to high altitude living and the clinical features of COVID-19 patients has been poorly studied 17, 18 . Studies on clinical, ventilatory and respiratory support parameters' differences have been studied in locations below 1,500 m and no evidence about the role of high-altitude exposure on severally ill COVID-19patients have been published 19 .Therefore, it is important to describe the possible role of high-altitude exposure as factor interfering with the clinical progression and the final outcome of patients with severe COVID-19.A prospective cohort study including patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed from March 15 th , 2020 to July 15 th 2020.The study was carried out in two intensive care units (ICU) located at two different elevations from the Social Security Health System (IESS) in Ecuador. The IESS-Quito SurHospital located in the city of Quito in Ecuador (located at 2,850 m above sea level) and the IESS-Los Ceibos located in the city of Guayaquil (Located at sea level).All the patients included in this study were admitted to the ICU unit in one of the two hospitals. We used a non-probabilistic sampling technique for both hospitals based on the inclusion criteria. The present study included a total of 230 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using the RT-PCR technique, of which 114 patients were treated in the highaltitude group (IESS-Quito Sur), while 116 patients belonged to the low-altitude group (IESS-Los Ceibos).Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR who did not meet the criteria for admission to the ICU or who lived less than 1 year in the unit's coverage region or who did not sign the informed consent for the use of the information were excluded.Demographic information, clinical characteristics (including medical history, history of symptoms, comorbidities), chest computed tomography (CT) results, laboratory findings, ventilatory values, and medications used were collected from each patient. The dates of disease onset, hospital admission, admission to the ICU, and death or discharge date from the ICU were also recorded, as well as the APACHE II scores and the Charlson index. The onset date was defined as the day the patient noticed any symptoms. The severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the diagnosis and treatment guide for SARS-CoV-2 issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) 20 . It was designated as critical illness due to COVID-19 when patients had one of the following criteria: (a) acute respiratory distress syndrome (any grade); (b) Septicemia; and (c) septic shock. The data were obtained from the electronic medical record of a common registry system for both units and analyzed by three independent researchers.Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described using median values and interquartile ranges (IQR) or mean and standard deviation, as appropriate. Analysis included two-tailed Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test was used. The frequencies of the categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test and expressed in count and percentage. Also, survival curves (Kaplan Meier), the log-rank statistic, and the hazard ratio between groups were obtained.Bivariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to identify factors associated with death from COVID-19 in all patients using the Cox risk regression model. To obtain a reduced set of variables from the broad set of predictors, we carried out a progressive en bloc procedure assigning the predictor variables into six groups: sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, complications, scales, ventilatory values, medications, and laboratory and imaging parameters. A multivariate regression analysis was applied within each block using two criteria to achieve the best set of predictors: relevance to the clinical situation and bivariate and multivariate statistical significance (p <0.05). Variables with more than 25% missing values were not considered for the analysis.All statistical analyzes were performed in SPSS version 25 and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc).In order to minimize observation bias for systematic differences between the low and highaltitude group, observers were blinded the hypothesis under investigation and a strict protocol was implemented in both sites.The present study included a total of n = 230 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, of which n = 114 patients were treated in the high-altitude group, while 116 patients belonged to the low-altitude group.The hazard ratio found was 0.55 (95%CI = 0.39-0.78). Due to the differences found concerning comorbidities, the analysis by subgroups was performed according to the Charlson classification (Figure 4 ).In the final adjusted analysis, 5 factors associated with the risk of death were found. As a protection factor, they were high altitude and the presence of a tracheostomy. On the other hand, as risk factors were the APACHE II score greater than 17 at 72 hours, the relationship between arterial oxygen pressure and inspiratory oxygen fraction (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ) on the seventh day less than 300, and the presence of coagulopathy during the hospitalization ( Figure 5 ). .The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected several countries worldwide, so understanding the factors involved in its prognosis is a priority worldwide. Evidence has been found of the influence of altitude on the number of infections and mortality, with lower values in high altitude places 21, 22 . The pathophysiological reason for this relationship is not established. On the one hand, high-altitude patients present a chronic conversion of the hypoxia-inducing factor type 1 to type 2, which favors a greater tolerance to hypoxemia and decreases the acute tissue damage triggered by patients with severe acute respiratory conditions. On the other hand, it has been shown that some high-altitude resident population groups have developed polymorphisms of the ACE2 receptor that favor a better tolerance to hypoxia 23, 24 . The same receptor that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the target cells and that, when inactivated, promotes a pro-inflammatory state that would increase the repercussions in the lungs and other organs 11, 23, 24 . Despite the absence of clear pathophysiology, the present study provides relevant epidemiological and clinical data for understanding the influence of altitude on the evolution of seriously ill patients with COVID-19.The study shows a mainly male hospital population with a median age of 60 years, with results similar to other studies 3, [25] [26] [27] . The analysis together showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, besides, increased values of ferritin, LDH, CRP and procalcitonin were evidenced. This analysis is compatible with studies similar to those found in patients with severe COVID-19, where abnormal values of leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets are evidenced 28, 29 , while blood biochemistry shows increased CRP and LDH 30 . In the analysis by altitude, the low altitude group had a higher number of leukocytes, a lower number of platelets and higher levels of CRP, however the rest of the values were similar in both groups.The treatment basis for moderate-severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is based on ventilatory support with low tidal volumes, a prone position, and active management of intravenous fluids 19, 20, 35, 36 . In this way, it is evident that the strategy The ventilator used for both groups in the present study was protective and up to 79.1% of patients complied with the prone position. Despite these measures, the complications were not different, and the high-altitude group was characterized by higher survival with a median of 39 days, compared to 21 days in the low-altitude group. A difference that remained constant in the subgroup without comorbidities provides one of the first measurements of the contribution of altitude as a factor to be considered in this pathology. It is also important to note that currently the evidence for the use of dexamethasone has been established as a protective factor for mortality 37 ; however, the low-altitude group that received a greater amount of corticosteroids presented higher mortality than the high-altitude group.In the Cox regression model, 5 factors associated with the risk of death were evidenced.This study was carried out in two of COVID-19 designed hospitals, part of the social security health system. The private for-profit health system also receives COVID-19 patients, nevertheless, this population was not included in our analysis. To strengthen the findings, there needs to be further study with greater numbers of study sites, greater patient sample sizes and across countries. To better understand the relationship between severity of disease and high-altitude, a range of altitudes needs to be studied, as our study only investigated two altitudes above sea level.In this series of cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, there has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to the high-altitude critical care unit. High altitude living was associated with improved survival, especially among patients with no comorbidities. COVID-19 patients admitted to the highaltitude ICU unit have improved severity-of-disease classification system scores at 72 hours and reported better respiratory and ventilatory profiles than the low altitude group. Our analysis suggests this improvement is not due to temporal changes in the age, sex or major comorbidity burden of admitted patients. According to good clinical practices and local regulations, identifiable data from clinical records was only accessed by the medical team that was providing treatment and care to the patients.Due to the nature of the data and according to local regulation, information concerning patients' results cannot be published. Nevertheless, the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, Dr. Esteban Ortiz-Prado upon reasonable request at e.ortizprado@gmail.com.","Ecuador","abstract","2021-01-25",1

This highly contagious unprecedented virus has impacted government and public institutions, strained the health care systems, restricted people in their homes, and caused country-wide lockdowns resulting in a global economic crisis [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, as of November 2 nd , 2020, nearly 46 million COVID-19 cases in 213 countries and territories have been reported, including more than 1.2 million deaths [6] . The social, economic, and psychological impact of this pandemic on much of the world's population is profound [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Soon after its initial rapid spread in China, the first case of novel coronavirus beyond China was reported in Thailand on January 13 th , 2020 [14] . The first case in the USA was not identified until January 20 th , 2020 followed by the detection of the first cases in the European territory on January 24 th , 2020 [15, 16] . The COVID-19 pandemic has since spread to every continent. While some countries like New Zealand and Australia have steadily suppressed the COVID-19 spread, reporting less than 150 cases per day as of November 2 nd , 2020, other countries like Brazil, India, and the USA still struggle to contain the increasing number of cases [17] . Subsequently, considerable COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in Latin America since late February 2020.The WHO declared Latin America the new epicenter of the COVID-19 on May 22 nd , 2020 [18] . Latin America has paid a high toll during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some of the worlds' highest death rates [19] [20] [21] . While home to less than 10% of the world population, Latin America accounts for about one-third of all reported global deaths (~370 thousand) [6] . Several socioeconomic, demographic, and political factors make control of the pandemic in Latin America particularly challenging [22] [23] [24] [25] . Most countries in the region are now facing the stark social and economic costs imposed by large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions while largely failing to control the epidemic's spread [13, 24, 26] . Despite these unique conditions, the region has received relatively little attention from researchers globally [19] . As of November 1 st , 2020, the highest number of cases have been reported in Brazil (5, 516, 658) , followed by Argentina (1, 157, 179) , Colombia (1, 063, 151) , Mexico (918,811), Peru (900,180) and Chile (510,256) [17, 27] . Adjusted by population, Chile's COVID-19 outbreak is among the worst globally, with more than 26,000 cases and 980 deaths per million inhabitants [28] .The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile was identified on March 3 rd , 2020. While the initial cases were imported from southeast Asia and Europe, the COVID-19 case counts have expanded in this country, placing Chile in phase 4 of the pandemic on March 25 th , 2020 [28, 29] . Chile was the fifth country in Latin America after Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Argentina to report COVID-19 cases. The first six imported cases were reported in Talca and in the capital of Chile, Santiago [28] . However, since the early phase of the outbreak, Chile has employed an agile public health response by announcing a ban on public health gatherings of more than 500 people on March 13 th , 2020, when the nationwide cumulative case count reached 44 reported cases [30] .Moreover, the Chilean government announced the closure of all daycares, schools, and universities on March 16 th , 2020. These closures were followed by the announcement to close country borders on March 18 th , 2020, and the declaration of national emergency on the same date, accompanied by several concrete interventions to further contain the outbreak in the region [31] . In particular, these included a night-time curfew in Chile starting on March 22 nd , 2020, and localized lockdowns (i.e., intermittent lockdowns at the municipality level depending on total cases and case growth) starting on March 28 th , 2020 in two municipalities in Southern Chile and seven municipalities in Santiago [32]. These initial containment strategies kept the COVID-19 case counts lower than regional peers; Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador until the end of April 2020. However, the government started to ease the COVID-19 restrictions in late April by reopening the economy under the ""Safe Return"" plan, including the televised opening of some businesses and stores, as new infections had reduced between 350-500 per day by the end of April, implying an only apparent flattening of the COVID-19 curve [33] [34] [35] . Moreover, imposing and lifting lockdowns in small geographical areas (municipalities) proved unsuccessful in areas with high interdependencies such as the Greater Santiago [36]. This strategy resulted in a new wave of infections; with the virus spreading from more affluent areas of Chile to more impoverished, crowded communities, forcing the government to reimpose lockdown measures in Santiago in mid-May (Fig 1) [23,37,38]. By mid-July, the government implemented the ""step by step"" strategy, considering five stages of gradual opening, at the municipality level, based on the periodic monitoring of epidemiological and health system indicators. The case counts continued to increase, averaging~4943 cases per day in June 2020, and started to decline thereafter. The mid-June peak of infections resulted in intensive care units (ICU) reaching saturation levels of 89% nationally and 95% in the Metropolitan Region [39] . Thus far, Chile has accumulated 513,188 reported cases including 14,302 deaths as of November 2 nd , 2020. The majority (~58%) of COVID-19 cases are concentrated in Region Metropolitana (mostly in Chile's capital, Santiago), with 297,423 reported cases, followed by 30,498 cases in Valparaiso located in coastal central Chile, and 30,934 cases in Biobio located in southern Chile [40, 41] . Moreover, the crude case fatality rate in Chile (~2.8%) resonates with the global average case fatality rate (~2.6%) [17, 42] .In this study, we estimate the transmission potential of COVID-19, including the effective reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile and around the mid of the epidemic, by July 7 th , 2020. We also estimate the instantaneous reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile. The reproduction number can guide the magnitude and intensity of control interventions required to combat the COVID-19 outbreak [43, 44] . We examine the effectiveness of control interventions in Chile (see Table 1 ) on the transmission rate. To do this, we conduct short-term forecasts using phenomenological growth models [45] calibrated using the early trajectory of the epidemic and by the mid of the epidemic (as of July 7 th , 2020) to anticipate additional resources required to contain the epidemic. These phenomenological growth models are useful in capturing the epidemic's empirical patterns, especially when the epidemiological data are limited, and significant uncertainty exists around infectious disease epidemiology [46] . These models provide a starting point for forecasting the epidemic size and characterizing the temporal changes in the reproduction number during the epidemic [47]. March 26 th , 2020We obtained updates on the daily series of new COVID-19 cases as of November 2 nd , 2020, from the publicly available data from the GitHub repository created by the Chile's government [27] . Incidence case data by the date of reporting per day, confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests from March 3 rd -November 2 nd , 2020, were analyzed. The daily testing and positivity rates available from April 9 th -November 2 nd , 2020, were also analyzed.We utilize two phenomenological growth models, the generalized growth model (GGM) and the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) that have been validated by deriving short-term forecasts for multiple infectious diseases in the past, including SARS, pandemic Influenza, Ebola, and Dengue [52,53].We generate short term forecasts using the generalized growth model (GGM) that characterizes the early ascending phase of the epidemic by estimating two parameters: (1) the intrinsic growth rate, r; and (2) a dimensionless ""deceleration of growth"" parameter, ρ. This model allows to capture a range of epidemic growth profiles by modulating parameter ρ. The GGM model is given by the following differential equation:In this equation C 0 (t) describes the incidence curve over time t, C(t) describes the cumulative number of cases at time t and ρ2[0,1] is a ""deceleration of growth"" parameter. This equation becomes constant incidence over time if ρ = 0 and an exponential growth model for cumulative cases if ρ = 1. Whereas if ρ is in the range 0< ρ <1, then the model indicates subexponential growth dynamics [54, 55] .The generalized logistic growth model (GLM) is an extension of the simple logistic growth model that captures a range of epidemic growth profiles, including sub-exponential (polynomial) and exponential growth dynamics. GLM characterizes epidemic growth by estimating (i) the intrinsic growth rate, r (ii) a dimensionless ""deceleration of growth"" parameter, ρ and (iii) the final epidemic size, k 0 . The final epidemic size is sensitive to small variations in the deceleration of growth parameters [56] and would vary as the epidemic progresses. The deceleration parameter modulates the epidemic growth patterns, including the sub-exponential growth (0< ρ <1), constant incidence (ρ = 0) and exponential growth dynamics (ρ = 1). The GLM model is given by the following differential equation:Where dCðtÞ dt describes the incidence over time t and the cumulative number of cases at time t is given by C (t) [45] . This simple logistic growth type model typically supports single peak epidemics in the number of new infections followed by a burnt-out period, unless external driving forces such as the seasonal variations in contact patterns exist. This model can underestimate the peak timing and the duration of outbreaks. This model can also underestimate the case incidence before the inflection point has occurred [45,47,53,57].We calibrate the GGM and the GLM model to the daily incidence curve by dates of reporting in Chile using time series data from March 3 rd -March 30 th , 2020, and from May 9th-July 7 th , 2020, respectively (Fig 2) . The period from March 3 rd -March 30 th , 2020, includes the initial interventions made by the Chilean government, whereas the period from May 9 th -July 7 th , 2020, comprises the reimposition of lockdowns after a brief reopening of society under the ""new normal"" (Fig 1) .Model parameters are estimated by a non-linear least-square fitting of the model solution to the incidence data by the date of reporting. This is achieved by searching for the set of model parametersŶ ¼ ðŶ 1 ;Ŷ 2;...:Ŷm Þ that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed data y ti = y t1 ,y t2 ,. . ..y tn and the corresponding mean incidence curve given by f ðt i ;ŶÞ ¼ C 0 ðtÞ: whereŶ ¼ ðr; pÞ corresponds to the set of parameters of the GGM model andŶ ¼ ðr; p; k 0 Þ corresponds to the set of parameters of the GLM model. In both cases, the objective function for the best fit solution of f ðt i ;ŶÞ is given by:where t i is the time stamp at which the time series data are observed and n is the total number of data points available for inference. The initial condition is fixed to the first observation in the data set. This way, f ðt i ;ŶÞ gives the best fit to the time-series data y t i . Next, we utilize a parametric bootstrapping approach assuming a negative binomial error structure for the GGM and GLM model to derive uncertainty in the parameters obtained by non-linear leastsquare fit of the data as previously described [54, 58] . The variance is assumed to be three times the mean for GGM and 96 times the mean for the GLM. The model confidence intervals of parameters and the 95% prediction intervals of model fit are also obtained using the parametric bootstrap approach [54].The reproduction number, R, is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t during the outbreak. This is crucial to identify the intensity of interventions required to contain an epidemic [59] [60] [61] . Estimates of effective R indicate if the disease transmission continues (R>1) or if the active disease transmission ceases (R<1). Therefore, in order to contain an outbreak, we need to maintain R<1. We estimate the reproduction number by calibrating the GGM to the epidemic's early growth phase (27 days) [55]. We model the generation interval of SARS-CoV-2, assuming gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.72 days [62] . We estimate the growth rate parameter, r, and the deceleration of growth parameter, p, as described above. The progression of local incidence cases I i at calendar time t i is simulated from the calibrated GGM model. Then in order to estimate the reproduction number, we apply the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval denoted by ρ i to the renewal equation as follows [43,44,63]:The numerator represents the total new cases I i , and the denominator represents the total number of cases that contribute to generating the new cases I i at time t i . Hence, R t , represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a single case at time t. Next, we derive the uncertainty bounds around the curve of R t directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates (r, p) obtained from the GGM. We estimate R t for 300 simulated curves assuming a negative binomial error structure where the variance is assumed to be three times the mean [54].In order to estimate the reproduction number by July 7 th , 2020 (after the reimposition of lockdowns in Santiago and Valparaiso), we calibrate the GLM from May 9th-July 7 th , 2020 [55] . Next, we model the generation interval [62] , estimate the model parameters (r, p, k 0 ) from GLM and the reproduction number from the renewal equation as described above [43, 44, 63] . The uncertainty bounds around the curve of R t are derived directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates (r, p, k 0 ). We estimate R t for 300 simulated curves assuming a negative binomial error structure [54] where the variance is assumed to be 96 times of the mean calculated by averaging mean to variance ratio calculated from the data (by binning data points and calculating directly from the data itself).We estimate R by the ratio of number of new infections generated at time t (I t ), to the total infectiousness of infected individuals at time t, given by [64, 65] : P t s¼1 I tÀ s w sIn this equation, w s represents the infectivity profile of the infected individual, which depends on the time since infection (s), but is independent of the calendar time (t) [66, 67] .More specifically, w s is defined as a probability distribution describing the average infectiousness profile of an individual after infection. Distribution of w s is affected by individual biological factors such as symptom severity or pathogen shedding. The equation P t s¼1 I tÀ s w s indicates the sum of infection incidence up to time step t − 1, weighted by the infectivity function w s . The distribution of the generation time can be utilized to approximate the infectivity profile, w s , however, since the time of infection is rarely observed, it becomes difficult to measure the distribution of generation time [64] . Hence, time of symptom onset is usually used to estimate the distribution of serial interval, which is defined as the time interval between the dates of symptom onset among two successive cases in a transmission chain [68] . The infectiousness of a case is a function of the time since infection. This quantity is proportional to w s if we set the timing of infection in the primary case as the time zero of w s and assume that the generation interval equals the SI. The SI was assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.72 days [62] . Analytical estimates of R t were obtained within a Bayesian framework using EpiEstim R package in R language [68] . R t was estimated at 7-day intervals. We reported the median and 95% credible interval (CrI).The We estimate the reproduction number for the first 27 epidemic days incorporating the effects of the social distancing interventions, as explained in Table 1 and Fig 1. The incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics with the scaling of growth parameter (deceleration of growth parameter), p, estimated at 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.81) and the intrinsic growth rate, r, estimated at 0.81 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.00). During the early transmission phase the reproduction number was estimated at 1.80 (95% CI: 1.60, 1.90) (Fig 3) .We also estimate the reproduction number from May 9 th -July 7 th , 2020, incorporating the effects of the reimplementation of localized lockdowns in Santiago, Antofagasta, and Valparaíso. The incidence curve displays a nearly linear growth trend with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.51 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.56). The deceleration parameter in the GLM model helps modulate the trajectory of the epidemic, depicting a linear growth trend. The intrinsic growth rate, r, was estimated at 22 (95% CI: 13, 31) and the final epidemic size, k 0 , estimated at 3.4 e+05 (95% CI: 3.1 e+05, 3.7 e+05). The reproduction number was estimated at 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.89) as of July 7 th , 2020 (Fig 4) .Utilizing the Cori method based on a sliding weekly window, we observe that the reproduction number peaked on March 16 th , 2020, with an estimate of R~6.19 (95% CrI = 5.84, 7.08). The reproduction number declined thereafter and reached~1.00 (95% CrI: 0.99, 1.04) on April 17 th , 2020. From April 18 th -June 18 th , 2020 the reproduction number fluctuated between 1.01-1.75. This was followed by a decline in the reproduction number to less than 1.0 between June 19 th -August 9 th , 2020. Since then, the reproduction number has fluctuated around 1.0 with the most recent estimate of R~0.96 (95% CrI: 0.95, 0.98) (Fig 5) .To assess the impact of social distancing interventions in Chile given in Table 1 , we generated a 20-day ahead forecast for Chile based on the daily incidence curve until March 30 th , 2020. The 28-day calibration period of the GGM model yields an estimated growth rate, r, at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.00) and a deceleration of growth parameter, p, at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.80), indicating early sub-exponential growth dynamics. The 20-day ahead forecast suggested that the early social distancing measures significantly slowed down the early spread of the virus in Chile, whose effect is noticeable about two weeks after implementing an intervention, as shown in Fig 6. A case resurgence was observed in Chile in mid-May 2020. As a consequence of this case resurgence, a total lockdown was imposed in Greater Santiago (representing~52% of total COVID-19 cases during the epidemic) on May 15 th , 2020. The quarantine in Santiago was gradually eased from August 17, 2020, and was lifted on September 28, 2020, as a part of the move to phase three of a five-step plan of deconfinement that would allow movement on regional transportation and reopening of non-essential businesses and schools [31, 69, 70] . We generated a 20-day ahead forecast based on the daily incidence curve from May 9 th -July 7 th , 2020. The 60-day calibration of the GLM model yields an estimated scaling of the growth parameter, p, at 0.52 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.57), representing an almost linear growth pattern. The 20-day ahead average forecast utilizing the GLM model showed that Chile could accumulatẽ 45,160 cases (95% CI: 27,934-67,600) between July 8 th -July 27 th , 2020 (Fig 7) . Our forecast results approximate closely the~46,798 cases reported between July 8 th -July 27 th , 2020 by the Ministry of Health, Chile.Daily testing and positivity rates for the time period April 9 th -November 2 nd , 2020, by the reporting date are shown in Fig 8. The total number of tests performed for this time period were 4,325,617, amongst which 10.9% (47,597) had positive results. The average number of daily tests was estimated at~5,460 for April 2020 and~12,959 for May 2020, a 137% increase. The testing rate in Chile further increased in June 2020, testing on average~17,578 individuals per day, followed by a slight decline in July 2020, testing on average 16,587 individuals per day. However, the testing rates continued to increase in August (average~26,079 tests per day), The estimates of the early transmission potential in Chile for the first 27 days of the epidemic indicate sustained local transmission in the country with the estimate of reproduction number R at~1.80 (95% CI: 1.60, 1.90) which is also in accordance with the estimate of the reproduction number obtained from the Cori method (R~2.2 95% CrI (2.14, 2.28)). The estimates of R from our analysis agree with the estimates of R retrieved from studies conducted in the surrounding Latin American countries including Peru and Brazil [71, 72] . Other countries including Korea, China, South Africa and Iran also exhibit similar estimates of R that lie in the range of 1.5-7.1 [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] . In contrast, some other countries including Singapore and Australia have reported much lower estimates of R (R<1) that can be correlated with the implementation of early strict social distancing interventions in these countries [81, 82] .The initial deceleration of the growth parameter in Chile indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern (p~0.8), consistent with sub-exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 that have been observed in Singapore (p~0.7), Korea (p~0.76) and other Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p~0.67) [78, 81, 83] . In contrast, studies conducted in Peru, a Latin American country, and Iran have reported a nearly exponential growth pattern of the COVID-19 whereas an exponential growth pattern has been reported in China [72, 75, 83] .Although the initial transmission stage of COVID-19 in Chile has been attributed to multiple case importations, Chile quickly implemented control measures against the COVID-19 epidemic, including border closures on March 18 th , 2020, to prevent further case importations. The 20-day ahead forecast of our GGM model calibrated to 28 days suggest that the social distancing measures, including closure of schools, universities and day cares, have helped slow down the early virus spread in the country by reducing population mobility (Table 1 and Figs 1 and 6) [84] . The commixture of interventions, including localized lockdowns, night-time curfew, school closures, and the ban on social gatherings in Chile, can probably be attributed to preventing the disease trend from growing exponentially during the early growth phase, as has occurred elsewhere [3, 4] . However, the significant increase in case incidence observed in mid-May can probably be attributed to the relaxation of social distancing measures and reopening of society in late April, in the context of the ""Safe Return"" plan [31]. As the virus reached the lower-income neighborhoods in Chile, the pandemic quickly exploded [23, 38, 39, 85] . While the COVID-19 case incidence exhibited a relative stabilization in case trajectory for April 2020 (with an average of~443 cases per day), highlighting the positive effects of early quarantine and lockdowns, the reopening of society and early economic reactivation in late April 2020 probably resulted in the surge of cases resulting in an acceleration of the epidemic with estimates of R higher than 1.0. The total lockdown comprised of stay-at-home orders imposed in Greater Santiago (which accounted for about 77% of cases in the country) Moreover, we estimated a reproduction number, R, of~0.87 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.89) in early July, indicating a decline in transmission of the virus consistent with the stay-at-home orders. This reproduction number corresponds to the instantaneous reproduction number estimated during the course of the epidemic utilizing the Cori method, which also indicates a decrease in disease transmission with R~0.8 as of early July. The instantaneous reproduction number has fluctuated around~1 since early August with the most recent estimate of reproduction number, R~0.9 as of November 2 nd , 2020. The 20-day ahead forecast calibrating data to the GLM model (from May 9 th -July 7 th , 2020) has reasonably indicated a declining trend in case incidence. The forecast results also imply that approximately~45,160 cases (95% CI: 27,934-67,600) could be observed in Chile from July 8 th -July 27 th , 2020. The actual case count by for this time period, as reported by the Chilean government indicated 46,798 cases [40], closely approximating our mean GLM forecast, falling within the 95% PI. Therefore, based on the most recent estimates of R (Fig 5) , it can be implied that maintaining social distancing measures, limiting social gatherings, and reducing population mobility have served as essential ways to containing the spread of the virus [86, 87] . Though the number of reported cases in Latin America remains low compared to the United States, official data for many Latin American countries are incomplete. However, Chile has tested a higher percentage of its residents than any other Latin American nation, lending confidence to its reliability [88] . Chile's testing capabilities have been greatly expanded during the pandemic, in part from a coordinated effort lead by the Ministry of Science to include testing from public and private laboratories. For instance, the average number of COVID-19 tests performed in Chile per day per thousand people is 1.52 compared to the neighboring South American country, Peru (~0.2 tests per thousand people) as of November 2 nd , 2020 [89] . The average positivity rate for the whole span of the epidemic in Chile is estimated at~12.98%. However, the average monthly positivity rate of COVID-19 in Chile is estimated at~5.90% and~4.88% for September and October, respectively, compared to~20.09% in May 2020. The high positivity rate at the beginning of the epidemic indicates that the government failed to cast a wide enough net to test the masses early in the pandemic, and there were probably many more active cases than those detected by epidemiological surveillance, underestimating the epidemic growth curve [90] [91] [92] . The most recent lower positivity rates indicate that Chile is testing a comparatively larger segment of the population. This positivity rate for Chile is also consistent with the positivity rate obtained from India, the United States, Canada, and Germany that exhibit moderately high positivity rates (4-8%) for COVID-19, indicating overall limited testing in these countries [89, 93] . In comparison, some countries like Mexico and the Czech Republic exhibit very high positivity rates (30-51%) [89] . Other countries like Denmark, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, and South Korea have reached very low positivity PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES rates (0-3%) by testing the masses with South Korea's large testing capacity combined with a strategy that tracks infected people via cell phones [88, 89, 94] . Moreover, studies suggest there is asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [66, 95, 96] , which means we could have underestimated our estimates based on the daily incidence's growth trend from symptomatic cases [97] [98] [99] . On the other hand, preliminary results of a study have shown the relative transmission of asymptomatic cases in Santiago to be almost~3% [100] . While our study highlights the effectiveness of broad-scale social distancing and control interventions in Chile, it also underscores the need for persistent isolation and social distancing measures to stomp all active disease transmission chains in Chile. In the absence of pharmacological interventions and considering the advent of second waves in Asia and Europe, non-pharmacological interventions such as the ones implemented in Chile are the available options for countries to address the pandemic before large segments of the population are immunized with effective and safe vaccines. In this scenario, real-time metrics that characterize the transmission dynamics and control are crucial to face the future challenges that the pandemic will impose. This study has some limitations. First, our study analyzes cases by the dates of reporting while it is ideal to analyze the cases by the dates of onset or after adjusting for reporting delays. On the other hand, a substantial fraction of the COVID-19 infections exhibits very mild or no symptoms at all, which may not be reflected by data [101, 102] . Moreover, the data are not stratified by local and imported cases; therefore, we assumed that all cases contribute equally to the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Finally, the extent of selective underreporting, and its impact on these results is difficult to assess.In this study, we estimate the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile. Our current findings point to sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the outbreak, with our estimate of the reproduction number at R~1.8. The COVID-19 epidemic in Chile followed an early sub-exponential growth trend (p~0.8) which has transformed into an almost linear growth trend (p~0.5) as of July 7 th , 2020. The most recent estimate of reproduction number, R, is~0.9 as of November 2 nd , 2020, indicating a decline in the virus transmission in Chile. The implementation of lockdowns and apt social distancing interventions have indeed slowed the spread of the virus. However, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active contact tracing efforts to maintain the epidemic under control.

The first reported case in Argentina was on March 3rd; four days later, the first fatality was registered in the country and in Latin America [2] . On March 6th, the first case of COVID -19 was confirmed in Córdoba, the second most populated province, out of a total of 23 provinces that make up the Argentine Republic [3] . Until December 31st, 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Córdoba registered a total of 126.893 cases and 2.496 deaths from COVID -19 [4] .The current health crisis produced by the coronavirus pandemic and defined as an unprecedented situation led us to raise doubts, controversies, and dilemmas in health care in general, and in surgery in particular, understanding that the residents are probably as vulnerable or maybe more than all professionals [5] .In this scenario, the Association of Residents and Attendees of General Surgery of Córdoba (ARCCC), which represents a non-profit civil association, founded in 1989, with the purpose of promoting scientific activity among resident doctors, prepared a survey with the aim of obtaining more information on how the COVID -19 pandemic affected the training and education of surgical residency programs in Córdoba, Argentina.A cross -sectional study was carried out, supported by a digital survey tool (Google Forms). The survey presented 24 compulsory multiple-choice questions and was distributed through social networks such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, from August 20th to September 30th, 2020.All surgical residency programs were invited to participate in Córdoba, Argentina.Before distribution, the survey was tested for internal validation until completed and reviewed by 10 ARCCC members. Only residents of surgical programs in the region were included in the analysis.Post-residency fellows were excluded.All respondents participated voluntarily in this study and were advised that the information provided is confidential, and will not be used to identify individual responses. The survey is available in Appendix A1.Ethical approval was not required as all data collected was anonymized. The study was reported according to the STROCSS criteria [6] and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 04703400) which can be found via the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04703400.The survey asked the demographic characteristics of the residents, the type of hospital where they carried out their surgical training (public / private / Armed Forces), the adherence of the training center to the resolution of the Ministry of Health 718/ 2020 (extension of the graduation and promotion of the academic year of the residents until September 30th, 2020 within the health services, to attend the health and social emergency produced by COVID-19) [7] , the type and the year (Considering the National Decree 718 / 2020) of the training program, the work modality, the number of days of attendance at their institution and surgical practices, before and during the pandemic. Residents were asked whether these changes would affect their surgical training and overall preparation for their next professional step. The effects of the pandemic were also evaluated on the well -being and burnout of residents.We entered the collected data into Microsoft Excel with a double-entry method to avoid errors during the process and SPSS 26 software was used for statistical analysis. For descriptive analysis, variables were presented with frequencies, percentages, and pie charts. A Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.A total of 195 resident physicians participated in this survey. 59.4 % (n = 116) were men and the age of 66.7 % (n = 130) ranged between 26 and 30 years old. Most of them belonged to public hospitals (48.2 %; n = 94) followed by private ones (44.1 %; n = 86), while 7.7 % (n = 15) belonged to Armed Forces hospitals. The distribution of the type of surgical residency program can be seen in Table 1 . Considering the changes in the protocols concerning operating rooms, recommended by different national and international scientific surgical societies more recognized as the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the Argentine Society of Infectiology (SADI) [8, 9, 10] , 52 % (n = 101) did not participate in scheduled surgeries and/or emergencies of COVID-19 patients and 7.2 % (n = 14) were not authorized to enter the operating room.Regarding the number of surgical procedures performed by residents per week, before and during the pandemic, we found a significant decrease ( Fig. 1 -2 ). 83.2 % (n = 164) reported that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected their surgical training and 45 % (n = 87) stated that they were not adequately trained to carry out their surgical activity in the residency program.Most of the residents (55 %; n = 107) mentioned that academic activity increased by 25 -75 % during the pandemic, in terms of weekly classes and athenaeums, through virtual platforms. 71.3 % (n = 139) affirmed that this health emergency allowed them to dedicate more time to developing their academic training and 33 % (n = 64) suggested that their training should be extended after graduation of the academic year.In the pre -COVID -19 era, 52 % (n = 101) attended their hospital between 4 and 6 days a week.During the pandemic, 55 % (n = 107) stated that work teams were organized, with an alternate regime to avoid contact between health personnel, with a subsequent period of isolation;consequently, 65 % (n = 127) did not attend their working hours for 5 days or more per month.Despite having more free time, 52.3 % (n = 102) reported feeling more exhausted than usual. 34 % (n = 66) were reorganized to assist patients in areas other than their surgical program. Most of the residents (70.3 %; n = 137) reported concern about the possible transmission of COVID -19 to family and friends, while 39 % (n = 76) about contracting COVID -19 themselves. Finally, 49 % (n = 96) increased stress at work, due to a greater number of patients, sick people, and consequently more responsibility.In Argentina, the Health Residence is a postgraduate educational system for the recently graduated doctor, which aims to complement the comprehensive training of the professional, exercising in the responsible, efficient and ethical performance of the corresponding disciplines, through the adjudication and personal supervised execution of complexity acts and progressive responsibility [11] . In this system, surgical education is intended to provide resident physicians with a base of surgical knowledge, technical competence, and clinical judgment for the management of surgical patients [12] .Understanding the concern of residents of surgical programs, the ARCCC conducted this survey in order to evaluate the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on surgical training (volume of surgical cases performed by residents before and during the pandemic), academic program and professional burnout.During the pandemic, different societies and government agencies around the world made recommendations for surgical procedures based on the experience of other coronavirus epidemics [13] or according to the epidemiological context in their country of origin, with little scientific evidence [8, 10] . In Argentina, the basic principles of prevention and infection control, and the standard precautions recommended by the World Health Organization [9, 14] were applied. In this context, teaching methods have been modified at practically all levels. Face -to -face classes were suspended, and virtual learning was implemented instead, as well as the reduction of the number of attendant residents in the same shift to reduce the exposure of health personnel [15] .Consequently, we found that the elective surgical activity performed by the residents was drastically [16, 17, 18, 19] . However, before the current global pandemic, surgical education has had to respond with new technologies, treatments and procedures to the dynamic changes in the knowledge of surgical disease, the demand in the supervision of resident doctors, and the demands for the patient safety [20] .In our study, the impact of COVID -19 on the educational program was positive, even though all face -to -face academic activities, external and internal rotations were suspended. 71.3 % mentioned that this health emergency allowed them to dedicate more time to the development of their academic training, through scheduled virtual meetings (classes and conferences) on widely disseminated platforms. On the other hand, as the backlog of surgical procedures begins to be tackled, surgical research is unlikely to be at the forefront of healthcare system providers' minds.However, if we are to avoid a drought in scientific discovery and advancement, academic surgical authorities should encourage the restart of clinical research, perhaps via modified protocols and processes to ensure safe, efficient, and effective studies [21] .Another important discovery in this analysis was regarding the well-being and burnout of residents of surgical programs during the pandemic. The depletion rate was higher than the traditional rates J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reported in the literature [16, 22, 23] States reported a burnout rate of 33.1 % [16] . However, in our study 52.1 % of the survey respondents reported greater exhaustion than usual during the COVID -19 pandemic. This suggests that burnout is not only associated with work hours, longer patient lists, sicker patients, increased responsibility, but also the stress of contracting the virus and taking it home with friends and family.A peculiarity that occurred in the territory of the Argentine Republic was the period of social, preventive and mandatory isolation, with an approximate duration of seven months (March 20 th to November 8th, 2020), being considered as ""one of the longest quarantines all over the world"".Consequently, the peak of greatest contagion of this first wave occurred in October and this would explain why in Argentina the effects of the pandemic in surgical residences occurred later, compared to other Latin American countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru (Fig. 3) .On the other hand, many countries in Asia, Oceania, and Europe have already faced the phenomenon of the second wave of COVID -19 cases.Our study is limited by selection bias, wherein residents who have been most affected by the pandemic may not have had time to answer our survey and by the implementation of this study in a single province (Córdoba, Argentina) that was moderately affected by the COVID -19. Policies in hospitals on permitted operations are dynamic and we have presented data for only a specific period.Future research might consider developing and evaluating contingency plans for graduate medical education in all surgical residency programs in order to maximize education when the next wave arrives.This is the first cross -sectional survey study that shows the impact of the pandemic on surgical residences during the first wave in Argentina. The effect on training residents with surgical programs remains unknown. We can estimate that it will have long-term effects, both positive and negative, and it is important to value a more innovative approach in the training of our professionals through virtual tools and complement each other in the fields of research and academic productivity.No source to be stated.

On 12 March 2020, the first death related to the disease was confirmed, and on 13 March 2020, the first cases linked to community transmission were reported in Rio and São Paulo, the biggest cities in the Country. There was a rapid progression in the number of cases followed by subsequent requirement for intensive care support in proportions never experienced before. Exceptional efforts were made by the health authorities to cope with this monumental escalation of a snowballing pandemic. However, the initiatives and strategies deployed were not uniform across a Country with continental dimensions [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .Despite strong recommendations, social distancing rates remained below desirable levels for most of the time period. Two possible consequences of the aforementioned were: a) intensive care units' occupancy remained below 80%, most of the time and in majority of the cities of the Country, especially São Paulo and b) the number of new cases and the number of deaths reached either a stable plateau or showed a worrisome growth in some regions [6] .On 1 June 2020, in São Paulo, health authorities implemented a stepwise system to authorize economic activities to resume [7] . The main criteria included the average rate of intensive care units designated exclusively for SARS-CoV-2 patients, the number of new hospital admissions, and the death rate. On 12 June 2020, Brazil reached the dubious and worrisome distinction of attaining the second position Worldwide in the number of COVID-19 cases. In response, authorities, individuals on own initiative or requested by employers, clubs or airlines, increased the number of tests performed, both for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (molecular or PCR test) and the diagnosis of past infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals through the identification of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, ie, the determination of seroprevalence of IgG, IgA, and IgM [8] [9] [10] .Historically, seroprevalence data offers valuable information related to the development and progression of an epidemic outbreak [11] . However, the unique and largely unknown immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 limits the full epidemiological and clinical use of the test results [12] [13] [14] [15] . Moreover, the determination of seroprevalence has exposed several caveats related to the use of qualitative instead of quantitative tests, the sum of different immunoglobin classes as a unique seroprevalence, and the presence of false-negative and false-positive results. Adding fuel to this uncertainty is the overflooding of the market with several tests, which has led to the unfortunate sequalae of pitting caregivers and patients on opposite ends of a divisive spectrum, arguing about test results that probably still require reference data. In our clinical practice, it has become increasingly common to field requests for an interpretation of serology testing from patients and friends. We observed that IgA results are more frequently positive, even in the absence of past clinical symptoms.To test our hypothesis, we sought to analyze data obtained, at the end of May 2020, from a convenience sample of asymptomatic individuals analyzed by the same commercial diagnostic laboratory test to estimate the seroprevalence by age and gender, using the reference levels provided by the manufacturer.This is a time-sensitive cross-sectional study that involved members from an upper-class social and sports club in São Paulo, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from May 20-22, 2020, in the Club's garage, a vast open space that allowed social distancing. Levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were determined in blood serum by ELISA technology (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, EUROIMMUN BRASIL MEDICINA DIAGNOS-TICA LTDA), and were performed in the same laboratory [7] . The cutoff level provided by the manufacturer for a positive test was an index greater than 1.1 for both IgG and IgA antibodies. Patients with fever, dyspnea, cough, or other symptoms related to active disease were not authorized by the club board to come and are not represented in this group. Demographic data was obtained from all patients.Descriptive data are presented as absolute values, percentages, median, and interval interquartile range (IQR). For the comparisons we assumed non normal distribution and used nonparametric tests: Mann-Whitney test (Tabular results, Unpaired) for continuous variables, Pearson χ 2 test with Yates' continuity for categorical variables and odds-ratio (OR), with 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated by Baptista-Pike method and performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com). Frequency distribution of different IgA and IgG levels was also analyzed and compared.From May 20 to 22, 938 individuals were tested. There were 441 (47%) men and 497 women, age 53 years (IQR = 39.0-63.2). The sample included 335 (35.7%) individuals aged 60 or more years old. Individuals with a positive test (index ≥1.1) were 54 (5.8%) for IgG and 96 (10.2%) for IgA, and 42 (4.5%) for both IgG and IgA (Figure 1) .The prevalence of positive tests by age and gender groups, IgG, and IgA levels are depicted in Table 1 and Table 2 . The prevalence of IgG and IgA positive test was not different in men and women (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.65-1.97for IgG and OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.68-1.59 for IgA; P = 0.937) and not different in individuals un-der 60 and 60 years old (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.63-2.00, for IgG and OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.57-1.35, P = 0.619).Of note, the median IgG and IgA levels were nearly10-fold greater in individuals with a positive than in those with negative test ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). Figure 2 We report a cross-sectional study of qualitative (seroprevalence) and quantitative (serum levels of IgA and IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 938 free-of-symptoms subjects in São Paulo, Brazil, at the end of May 2020. Previous reports in the literature privileged the analyzes & interpretation of seroprevalence (qualitative aspects) and longitudinal follow-up data [13] [14] [15] [16] . The quality and strength of the information provided by antibody tests has been strongly criticized [17] .The present study was elaborated as a response to recurring clinical practice dilemma, ie, frequent requests for interpretation of results of serological tests by patients with positive results, especially for IgA. Considering the reference levels provided by the manufacturer, seroprevalence results were 5.8 and 10.2 for IgG and IgA, respectively. In our cohort, seroprevalence was not different in men and women but was higher in subjects less than 60 years old. This finding is similar to a recent publication from the United States. [18] On the other hand, the quantitative data showed that the frequency distribution of Ig levels in positive subjects with positive results is quite different between IgG and IgA. Notably, IgA levels distribution in subjects with a positive test deviates to the left in comparison to IgG distribution data. This phenomenon indicates that many subjects reported as IgA positive have immunoglobulin levels just above the 1.1 reference level. The explanation for this finding is not provided by this or previous studies, but it is not possible to exclude the presence of false-positive results or a misleading reference value. The finding of higher immunoglobulin levels in subjects tested positive for IgG than those for IgA and the lower IgA levels in subjects tested positive only for IgA than those positive for both IgA and IgG also suggest a false-positive result or a recent infection. Positive results always create worries and a tense vibe for patients and their families. Health care systems and health authorities may get overburdened with strategizing as to the best policy towards these asymptomatic individuals.To the present moment, there is no precise information regarding the clinical or epidemiological relevance of the almost 2-fold increase in the IgA in comparison to IgG levels. Considering the finding of this study, ie, that many subjects reported as IgA positive have immunoglobulin levels slightly elevated, we strongly suggest caution in the interpretation of IgA test results. This recommendation is more important for those with positive IgA just above the reference level. These individuals should go in for a repeat comprehensive evaluation and health care providers should not base their decision on this analysis. Confirmation of the hypothesis generated by these data needs future studies and could allow additional interpretation of them.","Brazil","abstract","2021-01-16",1

It is a new virus with an extraordinary efficiency in transmitting from person to person and a rather high level of morbidity and mortality that raises with age and co-morbidities. The non-pharmaceutical intervention of detection and isolation of infected people is a key policy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The aim is to slow transmission and the growth rate of infections to avoid overburdening healthcare systems an approach widely known as flattening the curve. In order to identify the infected people SARS-CoV-2 tests must be performed.However, each diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test costs 30-50 US dollars [2] . Therefore, testing many people in a population regularly, as may be essential to flatten the curve, is beyond the reach of most low and even some mid-income countries. However, there are more efficient ways than the naive approach of testing everyone in which far fewer tests are actually needed, especially at low prevalence. It is much more efficient to pool (or combine) samples and test them together. Group testing initially appears in a paper of Dorfman in 1943 [3] . Other algorithms of pooling samples have been proposed recently [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Estimating the prevalence of a virus within a community prior to widespread disease transmission may help public health officials predict when to prepare for an increase in cases. With over sixty eight million cases in the world at time of writing this paper [8] , this sort of screening strategy is probably not necessary at this point in the pandemic. Nevertheless, these techniques are likely to be valuable at the beginning of a future outbreak to track the spread of a virus across the world over time. Specially because human behaviors that perturb the human-microbial status quo may have reached a tipping point that predicts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease emergences [9] .On the other hand, this approach may be particularly helpful in settings where the number of infections is low and declining, and most test results are expected to be negative. For example, in a community where the infection seems to be under control and reopenings of schools and businesses are planned, pooled testing of employees and students could be an effective strategy.Our goal in this work is to analyze the way in which different strategies of surveillance testing in a low prevalence stage, like frequency and random vs. localized search of infected people, change the epidemics curve. We choose the hypercube algorithm of pool testing [1] in the same way as we may have chosen some other pool testing algorithm because we are not particularly interested in the efficiency of the algorithm but in the strategy of the algorithm application. A similar study to monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled depending on the frequency of testing was studied with a stochastic agent-based model for SARS-CoV2 transmission [10] . To investigate the effects of surveillance testing strategies at the population level, we used simulations to monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled, We will take a network approach to simulate the evolution of the epidemic on a society in order to study not just the frequency but also the spatial distribution of testing. In order to study the different behavior of the epidemic when different test pooling samples are applied the social group under the epidemic is represented as families or small communities that interact with each other in a random way. We choose a sparse network to reflect the lockdown restriction. Similar structures have been proposed in [11] for carrying out comparative tests of different methods for community detection in complex networks.The paper is laid out as follows. In section 2 we define the epidemiological network model in which the connections between individuals are modeled as static links [12, 13] , assuming the contagion as a process faster than the network evolution. The main results are presented in section 3. In section 3.1, the impact of the social structure given by the network model on the spread of the disease is analyzed. This allow us to establish a frame of reference to study, in section 3.2, the optimal strategies of the pool testing based on the geometry of a hypercube, at low prevalence [1] . Finally, in section 4, we state our conclusions.In our sparse network model, we assume that the small communities (families) are composed of a few members connected to each other and also to other families with a number of external static links triggering the spreading epidemics (see figure 1 ). The number of members of each small community or family is k int ± ∆k int nodes connected in average to k ext nodes that belong to other small communities. The nodes of the network represent individuals that can be either susceptible, infected or recovered, subject to interactions with their neighbors (i.e. other individuals directly linked to him/her by either intracommunity or intercommunity connections). As a result of these interactions, susceptible individuals can become infected and spread the disease over time before they recover or isolate using a strategy in affected areas by the virus based on the geometry of a hypercube. Starting with a number of outbreaks of the disease randomly located on the network, the model dynamics is defined by iterating a sequence of possibilities, as follows:(1) an individual is selected at random; (2a) if the individual is infected, he/she can transmit the virus to his/her neighbors with an infectious contact rate of COVID-19 pandemic β or can recover with probability 1/t rec , with t rec the recovery time. This time is different for each infected individual, given by a Gaussian distribution around the mean value t rec (see Table 1 ).(2b) if the individual has infected neighbors, he/she can become infected with an effective contact rate β.(3) with probability 1/t lif e , the selected individual can die, where t lif e is the average life expectancy. For simplicity without loss of generality, if he/she dies, an individual is born in his/her place without intercommunity connections.The system evolves towards absorbing states with a maximum of affected individuals by the pandemic i.e., frozen configurations that are not capable of further changes. The final state, consisting of recovered and susceptible individuals that were not infected depends on the number of outbreaks of the disease and on the community structure. We are interested in studying the efficiency of a search and isolation algorithm based on the geometry of a hypercube of infected individuals on affected areas applied to the model of social networks under quarantine. The affected areas are discovered due to the rate of infected individuals report to health centres.Thus, the translation on the horizontal axis is nT ′ = n/r, with n = 0, 1, 2with p the prevalence defined as the probability that any individual of the subgroup N S is infected. The prevalence of the disease is unknown and we roughly estimate p ≈ n I0 /N in the affected areas by the virus, considering that infection does not spread at the beginning of the pandemic. Then, when the testing is finalized, infected individuals in affected areas are found and isolated of their neighbors. Due to limited resources, a maximum number of tests per day M is imposed. M is chosen lower than the sample N of screened individuals per day. The testing is recursively repeated, estimating p as the number of infected individuals isolated, divided by the samples used in the previous testing. In our network model simulations, a fixed number of 15 % of infected persons report to health centres in each round of testing. The first tests start when the 15 % of infected individuals is equal or greater than one and thus, n I0 depends on the sample. Figure 6 (a) shows the density of active infected and recovered individuals for a social network without epidemic control and with testing using the hypercube algorithm and the simple method of one test per person on affected areas. For both methods of epidemic control, an epidemic decrease is obtained, significantly improving for social structures with less interaction ( figure 6(b) ). In this case, the hypercube algorithm achieves control the epidemic. In fact, the density of recovered persons (dashed green line in figure 6 (b)) is very low since a few individuals were infected (dashed red line, practically is not visualized in the scale of figure 6(b) ).Time saving is very important for a rapidly spreading infectious disease like COVID-19. However, the regular testing is limited by costs and operational capacity of sampling. In figures 6 (a)-(c), a maximum number of tests M = 200 on a maximum number of screened individuals N = 2000 for every 100,000 inhabitants per day were considered, but in part (c) the maximum number of tests and of screened persons are M/2 and N/2 every 12 hours, doubling the frequency of testing. This allows the search and isolation of infected individuals in a shorter time and thus, can not infect others. Figure 6 (c) shows that the hypercube algorithm achieves control of epidemic reducing the search time for social networks with high connectivity.The social, psychological and economic burdens throughout a pandemic lead to a minimum threshold of interactions between persons originating a certain confined social structure. We found that social networks with low connectivity between their individuals reduce the contagion and can go a long way in keeping the curves of infected persons flat. However, since most facets of economic and social life require person-to-person contact, the testing, searching and isolating infected individuals helps to reduce the epidemics and return sooner to normal activity. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate, but costly and are a challenge particularly for developing countries. The search for infected individuals by grouping samples is considered in this work. Particularly, we studied the epidemic evolution under different strategies of application of a pool testing based on the geometry of a hypercube to isolate infected persons applied to social networks under quarantine threatened by an epidemic with high contagiousness and rapid spread as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The pool testing on social networks under quarantine is effective if the search of infected persons is in zones where the virus was reported and the isolation of these individuals is done as quickly as possible. The strategic search in affected zones by the virus and a high frequency of isolation can overcome a massive testing. Indeed, we found that a massive testing randomly applied to social networks with both high and low connectivities leads to little impact on reduction of contagion.","Argentina","first author","2021-01-15",1

This protocol will maximize the cost-benefit of viral detection and accelerate availability by the use of conventional kits on a large scale in molecular biology laboratories.Validation of the primer sequences. The Beacon Designer platform showed that there were no secondary structures, no hairpins, no homodimers, and no cross dimer formation in the primer set sequences. Primer-BLAST analysis of both the hCOVassay1 and hCOVassay2 primer sequences showed that they are present only in the target SARS-CoV-2 genome. When base complementarity of the primer set was searched against the human genome, there was no similarity, reinforcing that the viral genome alone would be amplified. In addition, we verified the primers' ability to anneal in the genomes from other airways circulating opportunistic microorganisms. No relevant homologies were found, i.e., the primers will not generate unspecific amplifications. The searches are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and S2. The primers from hCOVassay1 and hCOVassay2 have proven to be specific only for the SARS-CoV-2 genome.RNA extraction and reverse transcription optimization. RNA was extracted using a total RNA extraction kit. The results were below 1 ng/μL according to quantification with the NanoDrop fluorometer. The values of the total RNA extracted were on the pg scale, below the equipment's detection threshold.After reverse transcription, the mean amount of ssDNA obtained was 1394 ng/μL (SD = 26.9) for the hCO-Vassay1 primer, 1327 ng/μL (DP = 107.6) for the hCOVassay2 primer (3′ primer methodology), and 727 ng/μL (SD = 27.3) for the random primers methodology. The ssDNA purity levels were very similar in both techniques. The random primers technique was chosen to produce ssDNA in the first validation stage, since it is easier and quicker than the 3′ primer methodology.Template DNA concentration curve for quantitative PCR detection. The manufacturer's recommended temperatures, time per cycle, and number of cycles were applied to amplify the targeted DNA. The amplifications with the 3′ primer technique and master mix without UDG activation using the hCOVassay1 primer and DNA dilutions of 500 ng, 100 ng and 50 ng yielded cycle threshold (CT) values of 34, 35 and 37, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Amplifications with the hCOVassay2 3′ primer generated CT values of 35, 37 and 37, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Amplifications of ssDNA reverse transcribed with random primers and master mix without UDG activation using the hCOVassay1 with dilutions of 100 ng, 50 ng and 10 ng yielded CT values of 32, 33 and 36, respectively (Fig. 1C) . When the hCOVassay2 primer was used to amplify the same dilutions of the template DNA, the CT values were 33, 34 and 36, respectively (Fig. 1D) . The CT value for the negative controls using 3′ primer ssDNA methodology was 34 for the hCOVassay1 primer set and 36 for the hCOVassay2 primer set (Fig. 1E) .When master mix with UDG activation was used with the 3′ primer technique using 500 ng, 100 ng and 50 ng dilutions of the template DNA, the CT values yielded for the hCOVassay1 primer set were 34, 34 and 37, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . The hCOVassay2 primer set generated CT values of 31, 34 and 37, respectively (Fig. 2B ). For the reverse transcriptase technique using the random primer methodology and master mix with UDG activation, template DNA with dilutions of 100 ng, 50 ng and 10 ng yielded CT values of 29, 30 and 32, respectively, for the hCOVassay1 primer set (Fig. 2C ). When the hCOVassay2 primer set was used, the CT values were 30, 31 and 33, respectively (Fig. 2D ). The CT (cut-off) value for the negative controls using 3′ primer ssDNA methodology was 38 for the hCOVassay1 and hCOVassay2 primer set (Fig. 2E) .Thus, the 3′ primer methodology for synthesis of ssDNA was selected as the best option since the parameters of the amplification curves showed less nonspecific signal and a higher level of reliability.Melt curve analysis. The melt curve of all amplified SARS-CoV-2-positive samples with both sets of primers produced similar dissociation curves patterns and gave a clear and distinct melt peak ( Fig. 3A-D) . However, a clearly distinct dissociation curve was obtained for negative control samples that did not align with the melt curve obtained from the positive samples, suggesting that the melt curve peaks generated from the negative samples were due to nonspecific signals or the formation of primer dimers. This parameter is very important in the analysis of specificity of curves for the SyBr Green methodology.Visualization of RT-PCR amplicons. The RT-PCR amplicons were separated by electrophoresis, and the products were analyzed under UV to confirm negative and positive samples. Figure 4 shows the 102 bp amplicon corresponding to SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, while the last two lanes show negative samples. When master mix with or without UDG activation was used, the negative control samples did not have a 111 bp band for the hCOVassay1 primer set or a 102 bp band for the hCOVassay2 primer set ( Fig. 4: lanes 7 and 8) .Optimization of amplification parameters. The amplification parameters for each primer were modified (primer annealing temperature and time and Taq DNA polymerization time), which improved the capture signal during the RT-PCR assay, mainly when the master mix with UDG activation was used. The parameter alterations reduced possible nonspecific annealing and hindered the formation of double strands larger than 200 bp. Figure 5 shows that the RT-PCR amplification curves obtained from the use of master mix without UDG activation produced a faint SYBR signal for the negative controls for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5A,B) , although for both primer sets no amplicons can be visualized after separation by electrophoresis (Fig. 5C ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The SYBR Green master mix with UDG activation proved to be very efficient and reliable in terms of nonspecific signals. The master mix with UDG activation was more appropriate for avoiding false positives in uninfected human cDNA samples, maintaining the specificity of the amplification signal (Fig. 6) .The Supplementary Table S3 shows the pre-established parameters, as recommended by the manufacturer, and alterations made to improve the detection method are described here.Quantifiable control and detection curve. It was possible to detect the presence of the virus by observing the amplification curve from 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 for both primers. Regarding the detection capacity, less than 20 ng of total ssDNA after transcription using the 3′ primer did not generate a considerably safe amplification curve for virus detection. ssDNA equal to or greater than 200 ng were capable of being detected with great reliability. The comparison of the amplification curves showed that 200 ng of ssDNA corresponds to approximately 200 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample (Fig. 7) . (E) Amplification curves of negative controls produced using the two primer sets using 3′ primer ssDNA method. The negative control was from a negative patient. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ primers to generate first-strand DNA, RT-PCR performed with master mix with UDG activation and optimized amplification parameters. Of these 41 samples, 33 were negative and 8 were positive according to this new protocol. All samples were also tested through the CDC protocol for SARS-CoV-2. All 33 negative samples were confirmed, and 7 positive samples were confirmed by the CDC protocol. Only one positive sample according to the SyBr Green protocol was negative in the CDC protocol. The amplification curves of the two set of primers showed a positive signal for confirming positive samples and did not show any signal of amplification curve in negative samples. For confirmation, some samples were submitted for electrophoresis in 2% agarose showing absence of amplicon band. The example of this validation methodology is described in Fig. 8 . This protocol was applied in approximately 3000 samples. We randomized 300 samples tested from April to September 2020. From these analyzed samples, 48 were positive in SyBr Green and TaqMan protocol and 252 samples were negative in both SyBr Green and TaqMan protocol. A large fraction of samples was tested with the TaqMan protocol only when they were positive for SyBr Green protocol. The examples of this analysis (amplification and dissociation curves) are described in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2.The SYBR Green and TaqMan techniques are routinely used in real-time PCR. Due to its simple design, easy configuration and low cost, the SYBR Green detection methodology is predominantly used for the detection and amplification of nucleic acids. However, the TaqMan methodology uses an additional labeled probe, significantly www.nature.com/scientificreports/ increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay due to the reporter dye's conjugation to the specific oligonucleotide sequence of the probes, which is capable of emitting fluorescence. The TaqMan assay is considered the main method to detect and quantify human pathogens with a low copy number, including viruses 13 . Nonspecific primer binding, which results in the production of unwanted PCR products and the formation of primer dimers, can significantly influence the sensitivity and reliability of the PCR signals. Therefore, the choice of specific primers and their in silico validation, followed by RT-PCR parameter optimization, plays a fundamental role in the success of an RT-PCR assay when SYBR Green is used.The hCOVassay1 primer set used in this study, given its complementary to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, had a high specificity index and generated a 111 bp PCR amplicon. This primer has no homology with the genomic sequences of other viruses from the Coronaviridae family or other known human respiratory viruses except rhinoviruses/enteroviruses, which possess a 5 base-pair mismatch with the forward primer and 4 distinct nucleotides on the reverse primer but would generate an amplicon of 409 bp. The forward primer also has five nucleotides homologous to the Legionella spp. genome, and the reverse primer has four mismatches, capable of generating an amplicon of 3591 bp. The hCOVassay2 primer set has four and three nucleotides homologous with the Legionella spp. genome in the forward primer and the reverse primer, respectively. This set of primers can produce amplicons of 3243 bp and 500 bp, respectively.The primer annealing temperature and TAQ DNA polymerization time were optimized based on information obtained from the Primer Blast (NCBI) data for each sequence, which allowed an increase in amplification specificity for the PCR products. Annealing temperatures of 54 °C were calculated according to the number of CG/AT bases in each primer pair. In addition, the 20-s polymerization time reduced the possibility of unspecific signals generated by partial primer annealing and/or primer dimers.The standard WHO methodology uses the TaqMan probe technique to detect SARS-CoV-2. This methodology is extremely effective and can even accurately discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. The Charité Protocol, developed at the University of Charité, Berlin, uses four different probes to identify SARS-CoV-2. This test is very expensive, which limits its large-scale application. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also has a standardized protocol with four different TaqMan probes that can accurately determine SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the Charité and the CDC protocols involve reagents and probes that are now scarce and expensive on the world market.The present study established a screening strategy for SARS-CoV-2 through a molecular assay using the SYBR Green methodology. The proposed method harbors a low cost with the potential for large-scale screening of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic individuals. This screening strategy will allow communities or companies to screen for SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals on a large scale. However, when the test shows a positive result, it is advised that the patient undergo the molecular tests established by the WHO or CDC or even a serological test after the period required to detect antibodies, seven to fourteen days. Therefore, the most scarce and expensive tests could be applied only to a fraction of the target population ( Supplementary Fig. S3) .In this study, we established a fast and low-cost method for negative SARS-CoV-2 screening. We suggest that negative by both sets of primers in RT-PCR signal analysis in linear mode can certify the absence of virus. Samples whose signal is compatible with the positive control in one of the two tested primers must be repeated and/or treated as indeterminate. Double-positive samples for the tested primers should be confirmed according to WHO or CDC protocols.Double-negative patients can resume normality regarding social isolation, while patients who are positive for one or both proposed primers should be immediately tested according to recommended protocols or wait 7 to 14 days for serological tests, also known as rapid tests.Due to its low cost and processing speed, this methodology can be applied on a large scale, providing peace of mind for those being tested and their peers, as well as guidance for social isolation protocols.We aimed to develop a low-cost diagnostic test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharyngeal mucosa of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to help reestablish normal work routines as well as to remove SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from isolation (with appropriate medical follow-up).Clinical samples. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) with approval number 3.977.510. All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in this study. All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. To determine the specificity of the primer set, the detection curve and possible cross-reactions, a sample obtained from the Clinical Analyses Laboratory of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil was used. The sample was collected from an inpatient with suspected COVID-19 who attended the São Lucas da PUCRS hospital. The sample was sent to the Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública do Rio Grande do Sul (LACEN) and Fleury Laboratory for determination of SARS-CoV-2 positivity through the Center of Control Disease and Prevention (CDC) protocol.In silico study of primer specificity. Two pairs of primers complementary to two different regions of the viral RNA sequence of the isolated coronavirus (Whuan-H1/NC_045512.2) were tested (Supplementary  Table S1 ). First, the primers were input into Beacon Designer Software (PREMIER BIOSOFT INTERNA-TIONAL) to search their molecular structures based on test type. The SYBR Green option was selected, and the parameters were adjusted accordingly. The primers were then input into the Prime-BLAST platform (NCBI) and evaluated for their specificity with the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Searches were also performed for similarities within regions of the human genome and of the main respiratory and opportunistic viruses and pathogens to determine whether the primers flanked the regions of interest and amplified only the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. The input SARS-CoV-2 primers were compared with the genomes of the microorganisms shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
