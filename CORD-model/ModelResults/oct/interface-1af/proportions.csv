It has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an international pandemic [1, 2] . SARS-CoV-2 primary attacks the lower respiratory system causing viral pneumonia, but it may also affect the heart, gastrointestinal system, liver, kidney, and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure [3] . Several comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. The most prevalent comorbidities detected in different studies were hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory diseases, and obesity [4] [5] [6] [7] . In this review, we will through light on extrapulmonary manifestations caused by COVID-19 and their impact on outcome and case management which indicates a great need for multidisciplinary team.The exact mechanism of extrapulmonary manifestations is still under research; several factors have been proposed either direct or indirect injury secondary to the inflammatory response to the viral injury [8, 9] . SARS-CoV-2 infection begins when the viral surface spike protein (S) binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors (ACE2) receptor following activation of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that facilitates S protein priming [10] . ACE2 receptors are expressed in the lung (principally type II alveolar cells), heart, intestinal epithelium, kidney, vascular endothelium, and smooth muscle cells of all organs providing a mechanism for the COVID-19 multi-organ dysfunction [11] [12] [13] .Another mechanism is the severe inflammatory response induced by the viral infection in the lung as well as other organs [14] . Once inside the cells, SARS-COV-2 activates T lymphocytes triggering an intense immune response and an inflammatory reaction leading to an inflammatory cascade with the release of cytokines: interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) known as cytokine storm resulting in tissue damage [15] .Recent studies found that cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease are common in COVID-19 cases and are linked to severe disease, poor prognosis, and death [4] [5] [6] [7] 16] . Besides, diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for heart failure as non-cardiovascular comorbidity [16] . Several existing reports suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to CV complications or exacerbation of preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) [5, 17] . Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest were common CV manifestations in patients with COVID-19 infection in one study [18] . Zhou and colleagues reported that cardiomyopathy and heart failure were observed in 23.0% of patients with COVID-19 disease [19] . Researchers found that among COVID-19-related deaths 11.8% of patients who did not have underlying cardiovascular disease had cardiac damage with elevated cardiac troponin I (catnip) or cardiac arrest during hospital admission [20] . Other researchers found elevated serum troponin levels in many patients infected with COVID-19, and it was associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis [21] . Another study showed that COVID-19 non-survivors had significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels and longer prothrombin (PT) compared to survivors on admission [22] .Prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic dysregulation and aging that may relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis [21] . The exact mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 is still under research. It was proposed that COVID-19 interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels, increasing morbidity in patients with existing cardiovascular conditions and provoking myocardial dysfunction and injury [23] . The mechanism behind acute myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) [20] which are highly expressed in the heart [11] . Besides, severe respiratory infection and hypoxia, especially in the setting of severe infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19, it is likely that many patients will develop injuries such as myocardial injury, myocarditis, and acute coronary syndrome [17] . Meanwhile, pneumonia may cause significant ventilation perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxemia, which significantly reduces the energy supply for cell metabolism, increases anaerobic fermentation, and leads to intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals that destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane [24, 25] . Also, the high prevalence of arrhythmia might be attributable to hypoxia, metabolic disarray, and neurohormonal or inflammatory stress in the setting of viral infection in patients with or without prior CVD [26] . Abnormal coagulation resulting in venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) are other contributing factors [22] .The results of previous reports indicate that cardiac injury, arrhythmia, and venous thromboembolism should be considered in any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case and the patient should undergo a prompt clinical evaluation. Thromboprophylaxis should be added to therapy to those with severe disease.There is evidence from previous studies that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through binding to ACE2 receptors where they are highly expressed as in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, ileal, colonic, and rectal epithelia; ileum; and colon [26] [27] [28] . ACE2 expression is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa, probably because the esophageal epithelium is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, which express less ACE2 than glandular epithelial cells [28] . Besides, genetic elements of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA had been found in feces [26] [27] [28] . Importantly, it is observed that 23.29% of patients continued to have positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in stool after showing negative results in respiratory samples [28] . This may raise the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission route and the GI can serve as a route of transmission [26] [27] [28] [29] .Patients suspected to have COVID-19 presenting with GI symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting should be considered seriously [26] . SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute gastritis and enteritis, as evidenced by nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting [27] . Previous studies reported that most patients had at least one GI symptom, most commonly anorexia and diarrhea [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Patients with GI symptoms have a significantly high rate of fever, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, and increased incidence of ARDS, and they also tend to have more severe/critical disease when compared with those without GI symptoms [25] . Electrolyte disturbances such as decreased sodium level secondary to GI manifestations contribute to the severity of the disease [25] . A study found that about 3% of patients admitted to the hospital presented with digestive symptoms without respiratory symptoms. They had a significantly longer time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission when compared with patients with no digestive symptoms [30] . Abnormal laboratory data in these patients included elevated levels of liver enzymes, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) [25] . Significant prolongation of prothrombin time was found in patients with digestive symptoms, whereas other indicators of coagulation function were not significantly different [30] . Gastrointestinal manifestations may be attributed to the inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut, which may directly or indirectly damage the cells. Viral invasion of GI epithelial cells results in cytokine and chemokine release, activating acute intestinal inflammation characterized by infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. This inflammatory response is evidenced by diarrhea, elevated fecal calprotectin (FC), and systemic IL-6 response. SARS-CoV-2 infection exerts gut tropism characterized by an acute inflammatory response. This inflammatory process could deteriorate already present GI disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [31] . In addition, the immunosuppressive drugs used to treat IBD may result in a more severe/critical course of COVID-19 [32] .Considering the previous points, GI symptoms should be evaluated promptly, and suspected COVID-19 infection should be considered to avoid complicated course and to prevent transmission to the community due to delayed diagnosis and treatment [33] . Meanwhile, both the SARS-COV-2 virus and the antiviral therapy can induce liver injury so continuous monitoring of liver functions is mandatory [15] .Several studies reported acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients with variable incidence rate [24, 26, 32, 34, 35] . Worsening of preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) was also described in COVID-19 patients [36, 37] . Kidney injury is more linked to severe disease, old age, and comorbidities [26, 37] , and it is a risk factor for poor prognosis [24, 38] . Markers of kidney injury observed in COVID-19 cases involved elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, reduced glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and hematuria [35, 38, 39] , in addition to decreased density of the kidney and edema as seen in computed tomography (CT) scanning of the involved patients [39] .The etiology of kidney involvement in COVID-19 patients is ambiguous, and several mechanisms are proposed: first, the COVID-19 virus utilizes the ACE2 receptor for entry to the cell as mentioned earlier [10, 11] . Human tissue RNA sequencing revealed that the ACE2 presence in the kidney is higher than that in the lung [39] . Therefore, the COVID-19 virus may attack renal epithelial cells [40] . This mechanism is verified by the presence of the virus RNA in the patients' blood and urine [24] . Besides, a report of autopsies from patients showed severe acute tubular injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, arteriosclerosis, and accumulation of coronavirus-like particles in renal epithelial cells [37] . Second, kidney impairment may stimulate inflammation in the lung (collateral injury). Meanwhile, inflammation following lung injury may result in the deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunologic response leading to acute kidney injury [41, 42] . Third, the virus-induced cytokine storm may affect the kidney as well as other organs [14] . Hyaline thrombi with small vessel damage are found in the kidney of COVID-19 patients [43] .Prompt evaluation of kidney function is necessary in all cases of COVID-19 disease; continuous follow-up of renal function and proper management of any abnormal clinical finding should take place early to avoid deterioration.The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the genital and reproductive system is still unknown. However, there are some reports describing testicular injury and possible impaired male fertility [44] . Viral markers have been found in the testis and semen raising the possibility of sexual transmission [45] . Significant changes in sex hormones in patients with COVID-19 were reported, which may be attributed to impaired gonadal function [46] . Mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 effect on the gonadal system are the same for other organs including ACE2 receptor binding and utilization of TMPRSS2 protein [8] [9] [10] which are highly expressed in the urogenital system [46] . The systemic and local inflammation process associated with the viral infection and the released cytokines, interferon, and inflammatory mediators contribute to the destructive effect [47, 48] . Therefore, continuous follow-up of the reproductive system is important in COVID-19 patients. There was no evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breast milk samples. The intrauterine infection has not been reported [49] .Neurologic symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19. The symptoms included central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and skeletal muscle injury. The most common CNS symptoms were dizziness and headache, while the most common PNS symptoms were taste and smell impairment. Most neurologic manifestations occurred early in the illness (median time, 1-2 days) except for cerebrovascular disease and impaired consciousness. Some patients presented to the hospital with neurologic symptoms; even some had acute cerebrovascular attacks without any typical symptoms (fever, cough, anorexia, and diarrhea) of COVID-19 [50] . Several patients reported a partial or total loss of smell and/ or taste [51, 52] . The extent of olfactory dysfunction is still not fully understood [52] .The neurologic manifestations can be due to SARS-COV-2 infection either directly or indirectly [13, 50] . SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal route [53, 54] . The invasion of the nervous system occurs through binding to ACE2 receptors that are expressed in the nervous system and skeletal muscles [13, 50] . The researchers detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of those patients and in their brain tissue on autopsy [53, 54] . Specimens from patients with COVID-19 showed brain tissue hyperemia, edema, and degeneration of some neurons [55] . Immune suppression contributes to the neurologic injury indicated by the presence of a low number of lymphocytes in patients with CNS symptoms compared to those without CNS symptoms. Patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than patients with the non-severe infection that makes patients with severe infection more likely to develop cerebrovascular disease [50] . The true magnitude of olfactory affection cannot be estimated because of the absence/scarcity of validated quantitative olfactory testing and neuroimaging performed for COVID-19 patients. The mechanism may be direct injury of the olfactory nerve or local inflammation of the nasal cavity [51, 52] .Therefore, we should pay close attention to neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 disease especially those with severe disease, and any patient with unexplained neurologic deficits should be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection.A few cases with COVID-19 in China have been reported a skin rash, eczema, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, dryness, erythema, and urticaria [56, 57]. However, it is difficult to distinguish between the main causes of these symptoms [57] . Several factors can be behind skin manifestations including the immune response to infection, medications, or use of protective equipment in healthcare workers or even unknown [56] [57] [58] . Hundreds of healthcare workers in China were found to have skin symptoms on the hands, nose, cheeks, and forehead as a result of damage to the skin barrier due to the frequent use of disinfectants and prolonged wearing face masks, goggles, and gloves [57, [59] [60] [61] . Itching and skin infections can result from some drugs used to treat symptoms such as antimalarials, antivirals, and corticosteroids [57, 62] . Skin reactions may also appear as a form of the immune response against the fever [63, 64] . Although the relationship between COVID-19 and skin diseases is still mysterious and needs more clinical evidence, there is still some concern because the skin is the first line of defense for the immune system [57] . If one of these possibilities is correct, people with autoimmune disorders and chronic infections such as psoriasis, lupus, scleroderma, and vitiligo may be more susceptible to infection with the COVID-19 [61] . Therefore, the China Dermatological Society and the National Center for Clinical Research of Dermatology and Immunology have recommended taking preventive measures such as wearing goggles instead of a sanitary mask. Use foam-free cleaning products and skin moisturizing creams after cleaning your hands and wearing gloves that contain hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or vitamin E [65] .Ocular involvement in COVID-19 is uncommon, and conjunctival congestion was reported in less than 1% of cases [66] . Another study reported a higher rate of manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis (12 out of 38 patients, 31.6%) especially in cases with severe pneumonia. These manifestations involved conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions. Patients with eye manifestations had leukocytosis, neutrophilia, increased Creactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and procalcitonin [67] . Conjunctival congestion may be an early manifestation in COVID-19 according to some case reports [67, 68] .Eye involvement may result from direct inoculation of the virus through respiratory droplets, migration through the nasolacrimal duct, or hematogenous spread [69] . The virus can also be transmitted through contaminated hands. The possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through ocular secretions is still unknown. Positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from conjunctival secretions was reported only in 2 cases in Wu study [67] .Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of eye involvement in COVID-19 and should take infection control precautions and refer suspected cases for specialists to be evaluated thoroughly.The relation between blood sugar and pulmonary diseases is well established [70] . Studies found that COVID-19 may cause elevation of blood sugar in diabetics and some experience poor control [71] . A preliminary data from Sebeokian et al. study found that more than half of all cases confirmed or suspected COVID-19 had hyperglycemia and nearly one third had diabetic ketoacidosis. In addition, some cases developed newonset diabetes [72] . Direct pancreatic involvement by SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in severe COVID-19 cases due to the high expression of ACE2 receptors in the pancreas, in addition to severe inflammatory reaction which may explain pancreatic failure [73] . This may be associated with high serum amylase and/or lipase levels [74] . So, strict control and follow-up of blood sugar in all cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is important to avoid flaring of infection and/or complications of uncontrolled diabetes. In severe cases, a panel of endocrine markers should be evaluated.Every organ in the body is susceptible to injury caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and at the current time, several symptoms may be attributed to COVID-19 disease. A high index of suspicion and prompt evaluation of every case is mandatory to avoid deterioration and complications. Follow-up of any organ affected should be carried out after recovery, and early management of complications is warranted. At the same time, clinicians not involved in the management of COVID-19 should be aware of the possibility of other routes of possible transmission and take infection control precautions until the situation is clear. Multidisciplinary care is important to avoid complications and proper control of any organ affection. ","Egypt","first author","2020-10-01",10

This offered a unique opportunity to study the impact of humans on the environment (Lindsey et al. 2020; Manenti et al. 2020; Rutz et al. 2020) . One of the most immediate and visible impacts was the increase in air quality linked to reduced air pollution (Dutheil et al. 2020; Muhammad et al. 2020; Stratoulias and Nuthammachot 2020 , but see Wang et al. 2020) . However, little has been reported on the impact of the so-called 'anthropause' (Rutz et al. 2020 ) on other forms of pollution (Zambrano-Monserrate et al. 2020) . It has been suggested that lockdown restrictions prohibiting beach access resulted in cleaner beaches, but that solid waste management challenges were exacerbated by reducing recycling and re-use initiatives, and that additional waste resulted from discarded personal protective equipment such as gloves and face masks (Fadare and Okoffo 2020; Prata et al. 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al. 2020) . It also has been reported that increased reliance on home delivery of food and groceries during national lockdowns and home quarantines increased the generation of plastic packaging (Scaraboto et al. 2020; Vanapalli et al. 2020 ). However, empirical support for these claims is limited and we therefore report how a strict lockdown in South Africa affected street litter in two urban centres.Street litter mainly results from inappropriate disposal of waste by pedestrians and vehicle passengers, although some items fall off vehicles accidentally, for example unsecured loads or pieces of the vehicles themselves, and there may be leakage from poorly designed/managed waste receptacles (Schultz et al. 2013) . There are numerous studies of why people litter, with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the propensity to litter (e.g., Williams et al. 1997; Torgler et al. 2012; Ojedokun 2013; Moqbel et al. 2020 ). However, surprisingly little appears to have been reported on how litter loads correlate with human activity. On Tasmanian beaches, litter loads are explained in part by the number of people living in the vicinity (Willis et al. 2017) , but this result could be confounded by other differences among sites. In the coastal city of Mar del Plata, Argentina, litter loads were higher in areas with more pedestrians and parked cars, although litter loads did not peak in the main tourism season when there is an influx of people to the area, suggesting that other factors such as the frequency of street cleaning may also influence litter loads in the city (Seco Pon and Becherucci 2012).Given the scarcity of research on how litter loads correlate with human activity, we conducted street surveys in two major South African urban centres during the COVID-19 pandemic. A strict lockdown was implemented in South Africa for five weeks from 27 March 2020, confining all people not involved in essential services to their homes. The gradual easing of restrictions over the following months provided a unique opportunity to assess how litter loads changed as human movement increased. Despite many years of education and awareness campaigns, street litter remains a significant source of mismanaged solid waste, particularly in developing countries (Moqbel et al. 2020) , and is a major contributor to aquatic pollution in South Africa (Verster and Bouwman 2020; Weideman et al. 2020a) . By improving our understanding of how litter loads vary in response to human activity, we can inform mitigation measures aimed at stopping the release of litter into the natural environment. We hypothesise that litter loads should be lowest during the period of strictest lockdown, and increase as lockdown restrictions eased.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government implemented a national lockdown on 27 March 2020, with only people involved in a limited set of essential services allowed to leave home other than to buy food or seek medical attention. This strict 'level 5' lockdown remained in place throughout April 2020. From 1 May, the lockdown was eased to 'level 4', which allowed people to exercise within 5 km of home for three hours from 6 h00-9 h00. From 1 June, restrictions were eased further to lockdown 'level 3', which saw much greater freedom of movement during the day. Most businesses reopened, and traffic volumes increased close to pre-lockdown levels.We were issued a permit to conduct street litter surveys from 20 April 2020 in suburbs of Cape Town (Muizenberg) and Durban (Kloof). The two sites are shown in Supplementary Material (SM) Figs SM1 and SM2, respectively. The study areas were selected to include a similar mix of residential and retail areas, and both contained government offices (police station and magistrate's court in Muizenberg; community clinic in Kloof) as well as food shops that remained open during the lockdown. The Cape Town residential area included three areas where household waste is collected weekly. There were no similar collection points in the Durban study area. Litter bins are provided along Main Road in the Cape Town site (two bins within the 190-m long stretch sampled); there were no bins in the Durban study area.To ensure all litter was removed and that subsequent collections only sampled newly arrived litter, we conducted an initial clean of 400 m of street margins in Cape Town on the afternoon of 22 April and a 400 m stretch in Durban on the morning of 24 April. After the initial cleaning, litter was collected from each 400 m study area every day thereafter for 50 days (Cape Town: 22 April -10 June, Durban: 24 April -12 June). In Cape Town, accumulated litter was assigned to the day of collection because litter was collected in the afternoon, whereas Durban litter was attributed to the day before because cleaning took place early each morning. This resulted in 8-9 days of litter accumulation data for level 5 lockdown, 31 days for level 4 lockdown and 9-10 days for level 3 lockdown.We collected all anthropogenic litter items >1 cm, but we did not collect organic waste (e.g., fruit peel). We then cleaned, dried and weighed all litter items. We weighed most items to the nearest 0.1 g on a top pan balance (0.01 g for small items), but items >120 g were weighed with a spring balance to the nearest 5 g (120-500 g) or 50 g (> 500 g). Litter was categorised according to its material (plastic, glass, wood, paper, metal, etc.) and source: street litter which had evidently been dropped by pedestrians or people in vehicles, and vehiclerelated litter (i.e., loose vehicle parts). In Cape Town, litter found close to bins that had evidently been dropped by rubbish collectors or people rummaging through bins was categorised as bin litter. This category was not relevant to Durban as there were no bins situated within the study area. For both sites, we further categorised street litter according to its use: food packaging such as chip packets or sweet wrappers, hygiene-related items such as face masks, gloves, wet wipes, tissues and toilet paper, and tobacco-related litter such as cigarette butts, matches and lighters.We used Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare the number of items and mass of litter found at the two sites. To assess if there was a change in the proportion of plastic litter during the three stages of lockdown, we used chi-square tests. We used Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) to assess how the number and mass of litter items collected per day changed as lockdown levels eased from level 5 to level 3. We modelled the number and mass of items per day as a function of both lockdown level and study day (day 1-50) in the R statistical environment (R Core Team 2020), with daily rainfall as a covariate because rain might reduce litter loads by decreasing the number of pedestrians and washing away some litter items. Models were fit for each site separately using a quasi-Poisson distribution to account for the data being overdispersed. Data are reported as means ± SD or as median and inter-quartile ranges where data were strongly right-skewed.In Cape Town, 3741 litter items (18.7 ± 9.6 items•100 m −1 •day −1 ) weighing 18.2 kg (91.0 ± 146.4 g•100 m −1 •day −1 ) were collected over the 50-day survey period, significantly more than the 2271 items (11.4 ± 4.4 items•100 m −1 •day −1 ) weighing 7.6 kg (37.9 ± 40.4 g•100 m•day −1 ) collected in Durban (Wilcoxon rank sum tests; number of items: W = 1932, p < 0.001; mass of items: W = 1655, p < 0.05). The GLMs showed that rainfall did not significantly influence litter loads at either site (SM Tables SM1-SM4) . Furthermore, the GLMs showed that the number of litter items increased at approximately 4% per day in Cape Town and 2% per day in Durban as the lockdown progressed ( Fig. 1a and b, Table 1 , and SM Table SM1 ) while the mass of litter increased by approximately 13% per day in Cape Town and 6% per day in Durban ( Fig. 1c and d, and SM Table SM3 ). At both sites, the GLMs showed that the number of litter items was approximately three times higher in level 3 than during the hard lockdown (Table 1, Table SM2 ), while the mass of litter was nine and four times higher in level 3 than level 5 in Cape Town and Durban, respectively (Table 1, Table SM4) .At both sites, over 95% of litter items (>75% by mass) appeared to have been deliberately littered by pedestrians or vehicle passengers (Table 2) . Of these street litter items, on-the-go food packaging and tobacco-related products accounted for more than 60% at both sites, although these items contributed less by mass (Table 2 ). In Cape Town, 5% of litter items (18% by mass) came from spillage of domestic refuse put out for municipal rubbish collection on Mondays (Table 2) . Despite the ongoing ban on the purchasing of tobacco products, the abundance of tobacco-related products littering the streets increased at both sites throughout the lockdown (SM Fig. SM4 ) although the proportion of tobacco-related products decreased in Cape Town as the country transitioned from the hard lockdown to levels 4 and 3 (Table 2) . Hygiene-related items comprised a relatively small proportion of litter at both study sites (Table 2) , with face masks and gloves comprising less than 1% of litter items overall (1% by mass). However, the proportion of hygiene-related items did increase slightly as the lockdown progressed (Table 2) , particularly in Durban where large numbers of cotton wool and wet wipes were found surrounding the community clinic.Plastic and card/paper were the most common types of material at both sites in all levels of lockdown, although the higher density of metal resulted in metal making up a larger proportion of litter by mass (Table 3 ). The proportion of plastic litter by number decreased significantly in both Cape Town (χ 2 = 26.23, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001) and Durban (χ 2 = 4.92, d.f. = 2, p < 0.05) as the country transitioned to less strict restrictions (Table 3) . When measured by mass, the proportion of plastic in Durban was almost two times higher in level 5 than level 3 while in Cape Town, three rubber bicycle tires were found during level 4 of the lockdown, resulting in the proportion of plastic by mass being lower in level 4 than during level 5 (Table 3) . Table 1 The total number and mass of items in each level of lockdown (L5 to L3) in Cape Town and Durban, as well as the mean ± standard deviation, and median and interquartile range (IQR) of the number (n•100 m −1 •day −1 ) and mass (g•100 m −1 •day −1 ) of items littered daily. Level 5 was the strictest phase of the lockdown which slowly transitioned to level 3 when most businesses re-opened and traffic increased close to pre-lockdown levels. The Cape Town residential area included three areas where household waste was collected weekly, but there were no similar collection points in the Durban study area. The grey shading shows level 4 lockdown. Lines show the best-fit regression between the number and mass of items and the survey day During the strictest lockdown, litter loads were roughly three times less than when restrictions eased, thus demonstrating a clear link between human activity levels and littering. This agrees with anecdotal evidence that the volume of waste collected from litter bins in central Cape Town halved during the initial stages of the lockdown (Jacobs 2020). There was a tendency for litter to increase steadily throughout our study, even during level 4 (Fig. 1) , when restrictions on movement were constant. We interpret this result as a gradual reduction in compliance with regulations as the lockdown continued. The effect of the lockdown on litter loads was likely even greater in most residential areas, because we specifically selected study areas where there were government buildings and sampled close to shops that remained open throughout the lockdown. It has been suggested that littering in developed countries has become more prevalent as lockdowns have eased (e.g., Thomson 2020) but this does not seem to be the case in South Africa, where littering was a major challenge even before the COVID crisis. While we unfortunately lack pre-lockdown litter loads from the two study sites, the daily litter amounts recorded at the end of the study were similar to those reported in previous surveys of street litter in Cape Town (13-62 items 100 m −1 •day −1 and 120-165 g•100 m −1 •day −1 ; PGR and EAW unpubl. Data from Newlands and Sea Point in 2018). If anything, litter loads appeared to be lower than usual at the end of our study period because many people continued to stay at home. Most litter collected during the lockdown appeared to have been littered deliberately, while vehicle parts which had evidently fallen from vehicles comprised <1% of litter items. However, spilled household waste on the day of refuse collection accounted for almost one third of the mass of all litter in Cape Town once the lockdown eased (Table 2 ). This resulted largely from informal waste collectors breaking open bags of refuse to search for recyclable materials to sell (Schenck and Blaauw 2011; Yu et al. 2020) . This is less of an issue where refuse bags are put out in plastic bins, but at one site in the study area where houses lack road access and do not have large bins, bags are left loose on the pavement. The municipal collection system is geared to load refuse from plastic bins, and loose litter is often spilled, especially if refuse bags are opened. The marked increase in this source of litter as the lockdown eased and the increase in the inter-quartile range of litter loads (Table 2 ) reflected the increase in waste 'picking' as restrictions on movement were lifted. A related issue of litter escaping from poorly-designed waste bins (Schultz et al. 2013) was not an issue during the study as the litter bins in the Cape Town study area are designed to prevent wind blowing items out of the bins. The main problem comes if bins are emptied too infrequently, resulting in litter overflowing, or being piled next to bins. Lockdown restrictions were such that this was not an issue during the study.Smokers typically exhibit a much greater propensity to litter cigarette butts than other litter types (e.g., Schultz et al. 2013) , and cigarette butts are often one of the most abundant types of litter collected in street (e.g., Seco Pon and Becherucci 2012) and beach (e.g., Araújo and Costa 2019) surveys. In Cape Town, other daily accumulation studies found that cigarette butts comprise 18-50% of street litter by number of items (PGR, KM and EAW unpubl. data) . The proportion we recorded during the lockdown falls well within this range, irrespective of the lockdown level ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the controversial ban on the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products during the lockdown had little impact on the amount of smokingrelated litter. This is explained by the dramatic increase in the illegal trade of cigarettes during the lockdown which meant most smokers had easy access to tobacco, despite the nationwide ban (Chingono 2020; Flanagan 2020; Jooste 2020) . The prevalence of discarded cigarette butts is worrying because they can easily be washed into stormwater systems and eventually into the aquatic environment (Weideman et al. 2020a) . Once in the natural environment, cigarette butts can easily leach several toxic chemicals such as nicotine, arsenic and heavy metals which are toxic to many aquatic species (Micevska et al. 2006; Moriwaki et al. 2009; Slaughter et al. 2011) . It is therefore imperative that mitigation measures aiming at reducing the propensity of smokers to litter are implemented. These include educational campaigns, increased taxes, increased production of biodegradable cigarette butts and the installation of more bins (Araújo and Costa 2019) .Plastic waste generation has increased dramatically during the Covid-19 lockdown. Of particular concern is the increased use of single-use hygiene-related plastics such as masks and gloves which have subsequently been found littering beaches, rivers and streets Silva et al. 2020; Vanapalli et al. 2020) . In our study site, the number of hygiene-related litter items increased at a similar rate as other types of litter as the lockdown progressed (SM Fig. SM4 ). However, there was only a small increase in the proportion of hygiene-related items and this was mostly driven by wetwipes and cotton wool found around a local clinic at the Durban site. Overall, masks and gloves only comprised a small proportion of litter which is likely attributable to the widespread use of reusable cotton masks instead of single-use surgical ones. It has also been suggested that people in quarantine or those trying to avoid crowded spaces have been ordering more take away foods and were thus also consuming more singleuse plastic food packaging Vanapalli et al. 2020) . While the amount of food packaging found littering the streets increased as the lockdown progressed, the proportion of this type of litter remained relatively stable in Cape Town and decreased in Durban. The littering of food packaging has always been a problem in South Africa and is often one of the most common types of plastic litter found on South African beaches (Ryan et al. 2014; Chitaka and von Blottnitz 2019; Weideman et al. 2020b) , streets (PGR and EAW unpublished data; Ryan 2020) and stormwater outlets (Weideman et al. 2020a) . It is therefore not surprising that the proportion of food-related packaging did not increase as the lockdown progressed, as might be the case in other countries where littering is not as prevalent. It is clear that more mitigation measures are urgently needed to prevent littering in South Africa although it is important to note that there is no single solution and each municipality should assess which measures will work best in their jurisdiction (Godfrey 2019) .The finding that litter increases with human activity is hardly surprising. However, our study re-emphasises that people are the primary cause of litter, and that strategies to reduce litter need to focus mainly on changing human behaviour (Williams et al. 1997) . We can only hope that the 'anthropause' not only gives us the opportunity to measure the direct impact of human actions on the planet, but also contemplate ways to reduce those impacts.","South Africa","first author","2020-10-06",10

Within a month, more than ten thousand people were infected and hundreds died [1] . The initial outbreak caused several deaths, as the medical systems were not capable of handling many seriously ill patients. Till July 23, 2020 there were 631,680 deaths [2] reported across the world due to this pandemic. In a rapidly evolving pandemic, improper analysis and predictions of the number of patients results in an inefficient distribution of medical resources. Limited medical facilities and mismanagement of resource allocation can lead to additional severe cases and a decline in recovery rates. To cope with this situation, predicting the new cases which will arise in the future is very important. This can ensure optimal allocation of medical resources in the affected regions.Data science in the predictive domain is an emerging field. In this study we have incorporated the principles of data science [3] for the prediction of COVID-19 progression. The outbreak of COVID-19 is a significant challenge for any government, with regard to the capacity and management of public health systems to face the catastrophic emergency [4] . The prediction model can help hospitals and healthcare management to properly allocate resources, thereby reducing the pressure and allowing the situation to be handled with relative ease.We developed and tested 9 different predictive algorithms for 10 countries. It was noticed that the pattern of growth in the number of cases varied from country to country. The basic approach for the predictions was to train the models based on the dataset provided, but these models were not sufficiently accurate, as they were trained on only one class of dataset. As a result, the models were unable to accurately predict the number of new cases and, consequently, the existing techniques failed to utilize the resources in an optimized way [5] . Insufficient training data is also one of the reasons for the models to have low accuracy.We tried 9 different standard machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the number of patients for the next 5 days. After getting a decent accuracy of 85%, we implemented these algorithms on datasets of different countries. We selected 10 countries with the highest population and the highest density for our work. By using the data of these countries, we trained standard prediction models using multiple ML algorithms and obtained different accuracy for each of the models for different countries.The different models gave high accuracy for different countries. However, there were variations in accuracy because of the different trends of change in COVID-19 patients for different countries.The system flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1 Multiple research works have been carried out to predict the outbreak of COVID-19. Vomlel et al. worked on the dataset of patients from STEMI and different classifiers used for predictions were, namely, Logistic Regression, LogitBoost, Decision Tree, NBC, Neural Networks, and the two versions of Bayesian Network Classifiers [6] . Kumar et al. [7] used the ARIMA model for predicting the outbreak in the top 15 European countries. Tuli et al. [8] proposed an ML model that can run continuously on Cloud Data Centers (CDCs) for precise prediction of spread and proactive development of strategic response by the government and citizens. Robust Weibull models fitted well on their dataset rather than baseline Gaussian models. Petropoulos et al. [9] introduced an objective approach to predict continuation of COVID-19 by live forecasting. They produce ten-days-ahead point forecasts and prediction intervals. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model was used to predict the spread across all major cities in China, with 95% credible intervals [10] . Yang et al. [11] used the modified SEIR model to derive the epidemic curve. They used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Bhatnagar et al. [12] created a mathematical model for predicting the spread of COVID-19 in countries using various types of parameters and tested their model on real data of countries. A segmented Poisson model was incorporated by the power law and the exponential law as proposed by Zhang et al. [13] to study the COVID-19 outbreaks in six major western countries. Maier et al. [14] have introduced a parsimonious model that captures the infected individuals and also population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies. Li et al. [15] studied the transmission process of COVID-19. It used forward prediction and backward inference of the epidemic situation, and the relevant analysis helped relevant countries to make more appropriate Fig. 1 Proposed system flow diagram. The data on the spread of COVID-19 in the top 10 densely populated countries, viz., India, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, China, Philippines, Germany, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria were analyzed. The data for all the countries was fed into 9 different machine learning algorithms to predict the count of new cases for the next 5 days. These predicted values were compared with the actual values that were found and the accuracy was calculated. The best outbreak prediction model was selected for each country depending on the accuracy values obtained decisions. Tomar et al. [16] have used data-driven estimation methods like, long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction for the monthly number of COVID-19 cases in India and also the effect of preventive measures like, social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. Kumar et al. [17] have applied cluster analysis, to classify real groups of infectious disease of COVID-19 on a data set of different states and union territories in India, based on their high similarity to each other.Wu et al. [10] forecasted the prediction for only the major cities of China, whereas Zhang et al. [13] predicted for six major western countries. On the other hand, the proposed methods forecast the count for 10 highly and densely populated countries. SEIR, Poisson, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing model were reported for COVID-19 count prediction. However, we have incorporated 9 different ML algorithms for the prediction and also trained our models with the data of over 100 days, which was 3 times more than reported in the literature.We considered the top 10 countries with high population and high density for our outbreak prediction system. Since COVID-19 spreads majorly through human contact, it was imperative to consider only those countries with high density, as well as, high population. The dataset of the countries, namely, Bangladesh, India, China, Pakistan, Germany, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, the Philippines, and Indonesia have been used. Initially, we identified a list of 20 most populated countries (Supplementary material S.10). Further, we obtained a list of countries with the highest population density (Supplementary material S.11). From these two lists, we identified the top 10 countries having the highest density as well as high population count (Table 1) . We used 9 different machine learning algorithms for predicting the number of patients for the above-specified countries.The train data to test data partition was 94% and 6%, respectively. The algorithms predicted the rise in the number of cases in the next 5 days (Figs. 2, 3) for the countries specified in Table 1 . The testing run-time for these algorithms varied between 2 and 5 s. The algorithms were tuned by an iterative approach between the normalized value of zero and one. For the tuning of individual parameters, partial and full autocorrelation was used.The ARMA model is the merger between Auto regressive (AR) and Moving average (MA) models, namely: the AR model, which tries to explain the momentum and mean reversing effects often observed in trading markets and the MA model, which tries to capture the shock effects observed in thermal noise. These shock effects could be thought of as unexpected events affecting the observation. So first we loaded the dataset, and then divided it into a test set and a train set. We trained the model based on the train set and test set comprised of values for which we had to make predictions. Then we made an ARMA model that was trained on the training data. In ARMA, the values of p and q were put inside the order of the model. These values changed depending on what the model fitted the best. Values of p and q are normally taken up to 6. The values of p and q varied for different training datasets depending on the best fit.For a given series a 0 , a 1 , … a t , to implement the ARMA model we have to find the difference between data at different timestamps and make a new series altogether. This difference that we take form the d parameter of the model. Let us represent the Prediction plots for the number of COVID-19 patients that would rise in the next 5 days for some countries, where an exponential increase in the curve is expected or the rise in the cases would remain constant. Various machine learning models were deployed for predicting the outbreak. The black line shows the actual data, whereas the other colors represent the predictions obtained using the different ML algorithms. The SVR model is inefficient for most of the countries, whereas the ARIMA model gave comparatively better results. The predictions for the countries can be seen more clearly from the snippets. a The prediction plot for Indonesia indicates a rise in the curve as predicted by most of the models. ARIMA shows a decline in the cases, whereas the ARMA model indicates a rise in the curve. b Prediction plot for Nigeria. Apart from the ARMA model, all the other models predicted an increase in the curve. c Prediction plot for Pakistan. SVR indicates a sharp increase in the curve, whereas the other models show a constant rise in the number of cases. d Prediction plot for Bangladesh. All the models indicate a constant rise in the cases, whereas the SVR model shows an abrupt increase in the curve, indicating its inefficiency for predicting the outbreak. e Prediction plot for India. The cases in India will increase exponentially as predicted by the models, whereas the LRP model predicted the decline for India new time series as z 0 , z 1 , … , z t . The newly formed time series is stationary and represented as z t = a (t+1) − a t . Usually the value of d is taken as 0 or 1.The last value of the z series will be given by:Now, if we want to predict the value at k th position, in future ie k > t , we have to get the answer in the original series means, we need a value of a k so we have to thus convert the 'z' series into 'a' series and it will be done as:Prediction for the next 5 days of the number of patients in different countries where cases are likely to decrease in the coming days using 9 different machine learning algorithms. The black line represents the real data obtained and the rest all colors show predictions using different ML models. The predictions for the countries can be seen more clearly from the snippets. a Prediction plot for Germany.The ARIMA and ARMA models indicate that the count will remain constant for the coming days, whereas XGB shows a decrease in the cases. b Prediction plot for Ethiopia. XGB shows a rapid decline in the number of cases, whereas the ARMA model shows a slight decrease in the curve. c Prediction plot for the Philippines. All the algorithms were inefficient in predicting the highly uneven number of cases seen in the country. d Prediction plot for China. Training the dataset with some specific values, a few algorithms such as LRP and BRR gave inappropriate results. e Prediction plot for the Democratic Republic of Congo. SVR and LRP show an increase in the number of casesARIMA is a predictive model that predicts future time series based on its past values. An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, and q, where p is the order of the auto regressive term, q is the order of the moving average term and d is the number of differences required. So first we loaded a dataset, then divided into a test set and a train set. We trained the model based on the train set and test set comprised of the values for which we had to make predictions. Then we made an ARIMA model that was trained on the training data. The values of p, q, and d were put inside the order of the model. These values changed depending on what the model fitted the best. Values of p and q are normally taken up to 6 and d varied between 0 and 1. The values of p, d, and q varied for different training datasets depending on the best fit.If there is given a time series l 0 , l 1 , … , l t and we want to predict the last term that is l t , then let the predicted last term be represented as ̂l t . The actual last term will be given by:is Moving Average term and t is Error lag. Now for predicting ̂l t , Only the Error lag term is not present. The values of p and q are determined by ACF and PACF, where ACF stands for Auto Correlation Function and PACF stands for Partial Auto-Correlation function.It is a statistical approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and a given set of independent variables. All the values in the dataset were plotted. After plotting the points, we created the best-fit line. A best-fit line is the one that minimizes the error, i.e., it should have a minimum difference between the actual and predicted values. We found the slope of the line and also its y-intercept.After getting the equation of the line, we were able to predict the new values, which is the number of patients in an individual country. The expression for representing a line is given as y = mx + c, where 'm' is the slope. The formula for calculating the slope is where x and ȳ are the mean values.We used the polynomial feature function provided by sci-kit learn library of machine learning, where we can increase the power of the input variable and then fit and transform it on any desired model. Firstly, we imported the necessary libraries. We then imported the polynomial and linear regression functions from sci-kit learn. We instantiated a polynomial feature function with degree = 5 as a parameter. Then we fitted and transformed the input variable as well as the list of days for which we wanted to make the predictions. After that, we instantiated the linear regression model with parameters normalize = True, and fitintercept = False and then fitted the model using a new list made by applying polynomial features. Now we can use our model for predictions of COVID-19 cases on any particular day by using the list made by applying polynomial features to the list of days for which a prediction of COVID-19 cases is desired. Polynomial regression is a model based on a mixture of dependent and independent variables represented by m and y, respectively, and F p is the polynomial function that tries to add variables of any power we need, which gives us the best results with the dataset taken.where m = number of independent variables, y = dependent variable, F p = polynomial function (it tries to add variables of any power we need).Bayesian linear regression is an type of linear regression. We have used a polynomial version of Bayesian Ridge Regressor to utilize the important relationship between the input variables and target variables, which can further be used for prediction of COVID-19 cases on any random day. We used a randomized search that needs dictionaries of parameters having a different range of values as list of values and names of parameters as keys that we need to experiment with in our model and see which set of parameters gives the best results.The model was defined with the parameters , , and during the fitting. The regularization parameters and being estimated by maximizing the log marginal likelihood. The initial value of the maximization procedure can be set with the hyperparameters _init and _init. There are four more hyperparameters 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , of the gamma prior distributions over and . These are usually chosen to be non-informative.Bayesian Ridge estimates a probabilistic model of the regression problem as described above. The prior for the coefficient is given by a spherical Gaussian:The priors over and are chosen to be gamma distributions, the conjugate prior for the precision of the Gaussian. The resulting model is called Bayesian Ridge Regression.SVR is a powerful algorithm that allows us to choose how tolerant we are of errors, both through an acceptable error margin( ) and through tuning our tolerance of falling outside that acceptable error rate. Our original training dataset for every country was stated in a finite-dimensional state and so the sets to discriminate were not linearly separable in that space. To resolve this problem, our original finite-dimensional state was mapped into a higher-dimensional space. By doing this we could find the prediction of different countries in a non-linear approach. The model is defined as a comprehensive evaluation of the gram matrix along with the predictors x(i) and x(j). The gram matrix is a n x n dimensional matrix that contains the elements g(i, j). The process comprises obtaining a non-linear SVM regression model by replacing the dot product of the predictors with a nonlinear kernel function comprising G(x1, x2) as (x1) and (x2) , where (x1) comes out to be greater than G(x1, x2) and (x2) comes out to be less than the function modeled.Some regression problems cannot be described using a linear model, we need nonlinear models. To obtain a nonlinear SVM regression model by replacing the dot product x ′ 1 x 2 with a nonlinear kernel function G(x 1 , x 2 ) =< (x 1 ), (x 2 ) > , where (x) is a transformation that maps x to a high-dimensional space. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox provides the following built-in semi-definite kernel functions.The Kernel function of linear dot product is as shown:The Kernel function of Gaussian is:The Kernel function of Polynomial is:where q is in {2,3...}.We used random forest regressor (RFR), as it fits several classifying decision trees. The sub-sample size was controlled with the maxsamples parameter. We loaded the specific model into our training environment and initiated all the parameters to random values. We got the same result every time we ran the model on the given dataset. Then we fitted this model on the dataset so that we could easily predict the number of COVID-19 cases on any day using our trained model. XGBoost stands for ""Extreme Gradient Boosting"" and it is an implementation of gradient boosting trees algorithm. Firstly, we imported the necessary libraries and instantiated XGBoost with nestimators=1000 and fit the model. With this, we predicted the number of COVID-19 cases on any day we wanted. In these ways, we used this model to get the number of COVID-19 cases on any particular day using a dataset of actual COVID-19 cases used in training the model.The model is defined as a comprehensive mix of training losses and regularization measures along with squared loss function summed up in an interval varying from 1 to n. The purpose of optimizing training loss is because of its assistanceD = ((x 1 , y 1 ), … … … (x n , y n )) in predictive models, while regularization enhances the generalization of simpler models. Additive boosting is with y and as hyperparameters. Approximation techniques such as Taylor approximation have been used in generating the model. where where L( ) is loss function and ∑ (ŷ i − y i ) 2 is the squared loss.In Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model we considered the seasonality to be additive. The forecasted value for each data element is the sum of the baseline, trend, and seasonality components. We use c to denote the frequency of the seasonality. The value of periods (1/frquecy) also depends on best fit and training. So we loaded a dataset, and then divided it into a test set and a train set. We trained the model based on the train set and test set comprised of values for which we had to make predictions. Then we did exponential smoothing on the training dataset with seasonality as additive. This model consists of periods over which we want exponential smoothing to take place. The value of periods varies depending on the best fit and by analyzing the graph of training. The Holt-Winters seasonal method comprises the forecast equation and three smoothing equations, one for the level l t , one for the trend b t , and one for the seasonal component s t , with corresponding smoothing parameters , and . Within each period, the seasonal component will add up to approximately zero, i.e., ∑ S t = 0 for a particular period. Mathematically, Holt Winters Additive Model is represented as: Forecast = Estimated level + Trend + Seasonality at most recent time point Series equation is represented as:The series has Level (l t ),Trend (b t ) + Seasonality(s t ) with c seasons. Level equation is represented as:The level equation shows a weighted average between the seasonally adjusted observation (y t − S t−c ) and the non-seasonal forecast (l t−1 + b t−1 ) for time t.Trend equation is represented as:The trend equation is identical to Holt's linear method. Seasonality equation is represented as:The seasonal equation shows a weighted average between the current seasonal index, (y t − l t−1 − b t−1 ) , and the seasonal index of the same season c time periods ago. The values of , and usually range between 0 and 1.The models were trained on Windows 10 operating system with an 8th generation Intel i5 processor and 8 GB of RAM. The dataset was obtained from ourworldindata.org [18] . All the models were trained on Google Colaboratory, as well as Spyder using Python version 3. As shown in Table 2 , we used 9 different machine learning algorithms to predict the number of patients in 10 highly dense and populated countries. Among all the models for the various countries (Figs. 2, 3) , we achieved the highest accuracy of 99.93% for Ethiopia ( Fig. 3b and 4c ) by using the ARMA model. ARIMA gave an accuracy of more than 85% most of the time for almost all countries. Almost all the models gave an accuracy of more than 80% at least for one of the 10 countries, except in the case of the Philippines (Fig. 3c) . We found different countries to have a different trend of increase or decrease in COVID-19 patients. Not every ML algorithm could give a very high accuracy for predicting the rise or fall in the cases for each country. Our results showed that for Bangladesh (Figs. 2d and 4b ), the LRP model showed the highest accuracy of 86.45%. For India (Figs. 2e and 4a) , we got an accuracy of 99.26% using the ARMA model. China (Fig. 3d and 5d ) had a prediction value of 82% using the XGB model. For Pakistan (Figs. 2c and 5b) , the accuracy was 87.91% using the BRR model. For Nigeria (Figs. 2b and 4e) , the accuracy was 98.06% using the ARMA model. Democratic Republic of Congo (Figs. 3e and 4d) showed the highest accuracy of 91.96% by using the LRP model. Indonesia (Figs. 2a and 5a ) demonstrated the highest accuracy of 97.72% using the ARIMA model. For Germany (Figs. 3a and 4f) , ARIMA . 4 Bar graphs depicting the error percentage and error bar for 5-day prediction by using 9 different ML models. The green color bar indicates the model with the least percentage error, i.e., highest percentage accuracy. a For India, the ARMA model gave the highest accuracy with an error bar of 0.42. b For Bangladesh, the LRP model gave the highest accuracy with an error bar of 3.18 as compared to other models. c The ARMA model showed the least percentage error in comparison to other models for Ethiopia. d The LRP model gave the least percentage error for the Democratic Republic of Congo. e In the case of Nigeria, the ARMA model gave the least percentage error, although the error bar had a value of 7.76. f For Germany, the ARIMA model gave the least percentage error, while models like BRR and LR gave percentage error of more than 50% gave an accuracy of 85.39%. Using the SVR model, we got a prediction accuracy of 50.54% for the Philippines (Figs. 3c and 5c) . Figure 4 shows bar graphs for different error percentages and their corresponding errors for the next 5-day predictions. In the case of India (Fig. 4a) , Ethiopia (Fig. 4c) , and Nigeria (Fig. 4e ), the ARMA model gave the highest accuracy for the prediction as compared to the other models. For Bangladesh (Fig. 4b) andDemocratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 4d ), the LRP model proved to be effective, although the accuracy in the case of Bangladesh was low. In the case of Germany (Fig. 4f ), the ARIMA model gave the least percentage error, while models like BRR and LR gave errors of more than 50%. For Indonesia (Fig. 5a ), the ARIMA model gave the least percentage error, while the ARMA model was highly inaccurate, with a very high error percentage. In the case of Pakistan (Fig. 5b) , the BRR model yielded better accuracy, whereas for the Philippines (Fig. 5c) , noneBar Graphs depicting the error percentage and error bar for 5 days prediction using 9 different ML models. The green color bar indicates the model with the least percentage error i.e. highest percentage accuracy. a For Indonesia, the ARIMA model gave the least percentage error, whereas, it was seen that ARMA gave the highest percentage error as compared to other models. b For Pakistan, the BRR model proved best for prediction. c For the Philippines, none of the models gave accuracy that was expected. The percentage error of all models was more than 40%. d For China, the XGB model proved the best for prediction while models like LR and SVR gave an error percentage of more than 70% of the models made accurate predictions. The percentage error of all models was more than 40%. The XGB model proved best for prediction in the case of China (Fig. 5d) . A range finder code was written that helps to improve accuracy. This code works on a range of predicted numbers from all 9 algorithms, rather than actual predictions by the individual algorithms. This combined approach helped us to improve accuracy by up to 8%.It was not possible to get the results using all the 9 algorithms for each country as there were no specific trends observed. For the Philippines, we got a very low accuracy because a sudden drop of around 1400 cases to 0 was seen and in the following day, the count increased by 4500. Also because of the change in the government rules, the COVID-19 count of the country changed drastically. Due to this change, the proposed models were not able to make predictions with high accuracy. According to our dataset for China, a particular day had approximately 2000 patients and after that day the rise observed in the number of cases was approximately 13,000. The number of total patients was observed to be around 15,000. All of a sudden, the number dropped by 11,000 the next day. The declining phase started after the drop for about the next 100 days. Due to the peak value, our training dataset had to be changed. We considered only those values after the peak where a declining trend could be seen. To date, China shows a decline in the curve, and hence we considered only the decrement values. The slope for China is decreasing, and hence the values after the peak were considered. Also, after considering this, 2 out of the 9 models failed to show good accuracy for China. The raw data received from countries like China and Philippines were not correct, because the government policies changed on February 17, 2020 and July 6, 2020, respectively. Table 3 , we have compared our methodology with the other methodologies reported in the literature. Most of the literature has used the ARIMA model for the outbreak prediction of COVID-19. We have used 9 different ML models for the prediction of COVID-19 on the top 10 densely and highly populated countries. We achieved the highest accuracy of 99.93%, which was high as compared to the other methodologies reported. The highest accuracy was achieved by the ARMA model for Ethiopia. Poonia et al. [20] achieved the highest accuracy of 95% for India using the ARIMA model forecasting. The ARIMA model for India achieved an accuracy of 90.55%, which was high as compared to an accuracy of 70% obtained by Gupta et al. [21] using the ARIMA model and Exponential smoothing. In comparison, the SEIR model implemented by Wu et al. [10] gave an accuracy of 95% for prediction in Wuhan.Although the overall accuracy achieved was very good, we are still trying to implement prediction models using different algorithms that could give us higher accuracy. We are also planning to get a single standard model that can be used for any country, which may be a combination of different algorithms. We are planning to develop such ML algorithms that could give us an approximate duration of COVID-19 as a pandemic.The study presented here outlines several technique of predicting new cases that would arise in a few days in the near future in any region during an expanding pandemic, so that there is the proper allocation of resources in those regions for higher recovery rates. The ARMA model gave the highest accuracy for the prediction of COVID-19 cases for Ethiopia. From the results obtained on all the models for all countries, it was found that ARMA proved to be the best model for India and Nigeria. ARIMA was best for Indonesia and Germany. LRP for Bangladesh and Democratic Republic of Congo. And BRR, XGB, SVR proved best for Pakistan, China and the Philippines, respectively. We got an accuracy of more than 80% for all the countries except the Philippines by any one of the 9 ML algorithms. The overall best model for the prediction was ARIMA. Generating high-accuracy prediction that could help in an optimized use of available resources along with pacing up the recovery graphs has been the main aim behind this exercise. These regions could potentially benefit from knowing the number of resources that they would need based on the predictions of the model. This model could help in lowering the cost of dealing with the pandemic and improve the recovery process in regions where it is deployed.Data availability statement All the data and codes used in this study, as well as, the supplementary material can be made available from the corresponding author, upon reasonable request.Code availability All the codes used in this study, as well as, the supplementary material can be made available from the corresponding author, upon reasonable request.Involvement of human participant and animals This article does not contain any studies with animals or humans performed by any of the authors.

All the countries affected by this disease have taken many preventive measures, including containment. The containment established by the Moroccan government and the public authorities at the right time made it possible to avoid Keywords and phrases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , deconfinement strategy, mathematical modeling, delayed stochastic differential equations (DSDEs), extinction.the worst: according to the minister of Health, at least 6000 lives were saved thanks to the measures adopted to face the spread of this pandemic [13] . The resistance measures, regarded as necessary and urgent, cannot be sustainable.Actually, the deconfinement is a new stage entered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, several countries strategically planned their deconfinement strategies. The extension of the state of emergency in Morocco until May 20, 2020 will no doubt have economic repercussions. If Morocco won the first round, or at least limited the consequences, especially in terms of limiting the pandemic and health management of the situation, the second seems difficult and complex. Indeed, it must not only be well thought out but also its axes of resistance have to be well-identified. In this context, all efforts should be focused on stabilizing the economy by intelligently relying on resources. Economic deconfinement is part of the solution and should be gradual and concerted. Indeed, it is absurd to think that the return to the normality is in the near months, because the unavailability of an effective vaccine implies that the virus will always be with us in the near future, which poses a risk for the population. This economic deconfinement should be prepared and accompanied by other related measures, in particular under health, security, education and social assistance. In this period of general crisis, the response must try to mitigate the impacts on priority sectors, such as agriculture, agrifood, transport and foreign trade, in relation to imports that are vital to the Moroccan economy. The challenge is to ensure resistance and a continuity of value creation while preventing a sector from being detached from the economic body. So to speak, priority must be given to vital sectors whose health directly affects all Moroccan activity, while protecting those bordering on chaos. According to the deconfinement strategy, which is applied by the Moroccan authorities, it is mandatory to study the occurrence of an eventual second wave and it's magnitude.Mathematical modeling through dynamical systems plays an important role to predict the evolution of COVID-19 transmission [9, 16] . However, while taking into account the deconfinement policies, the environmental effects and the social fluctuations should not be neglected in such a mathematical study in order to describe well the dynamics and consider an additional degree of realism [2, 3, 10, 18, 21] . For these reasons, we describe here the dynamics of the deconfinement strategy by a new D-COVID-19 model, governed by delayed stochastic differential equations (DSDE), as follows:where S represents the susceptible sub-population, which is not infected and has not been infected before but is susceptible to develop the disease if exposed to the virus; C is the confined sub-population; I s is the symptomatic infected sub-population, which has not yet been treated, it transmits the disease, and outside of proper support it can progress to spontaneous recovery or death; I a is the asymptomatic infected sub-population who is infected but does not transmit the disease, is not known by the health system and progresses spontaneously to recovery; F b , F g and F c are the patients diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan health system and under quarantine, and subdivided into three categories: benign, severe, critical forms, respectively. Finally, R and M are the recovered and died classes, respectively. At each instant of time, the equationgives the number of the new dead due to disease. The parameter 1 − u represents the level of measures undertaken on the susceptible population while δ is the confinement rate and ρ represents the deconfinement rate. We adopt the bilinear incidence rate to describe the infection of the disease and use the parameter β to denote the transmission rate. It is reasonable to assume that the infected individuals are subdivided into individuals with symptoms and others without symptoms, for which we employ the parameter ǫ to denote the proportion for the symptomatic individuals and 1 − ǫ for the asymptomatic ones. The parameter α measures the efficiency of public health administration for hospitalization. Diagnosed symptomatic infected population is completely distributed into one of the three forms F b , F g and F c , by the rates γ b , γ g and γ c , respectively. Then, γ b + γ g + γ c = 1. The mean recovery period of these forms are denoted by 1/r b , 1/r g and 1/r c , respectively. The latter forms die also with the rates µ b , µ g and µ c , respectively. Symptomatic infected population, which is not diagnosed, moves to the recovery compartment with a rate η s or dies with a rate µ s . On the other hand, asymptomatic infected population moves to the recovery compartment with a rate η a . The time delays τ 1 and τ 2 denote the incubation period and the period of time needed before the charge by the health system, respectively. The time delays τ 3 and τ 4 denote the time required before the death of individuals coming from the compartments I s and the three forms F b , F g and F c , respectively. Here, B 1 (t), B 2 (t) and B 3 (t) are independent standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F , P) with a filtration {F t } t≥0 and satisfying the usual conditions, that is, they are increasing and right continuous while F 0 contains all P-null sets and σ i represents the intensity of B i , i = 1, 2, 3. The schematic diagram of our extended model is illustrated in Figure 1 . Remark 1.1. The stochasticity is introduced in model (1) by perturbing the most sensitive parameters: β, α, δ, and ρ.For the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the parameters δ and ρ are perturbed with the same intensities, that is, we assume that Moroccan individuals possess the same behaviors and reactions towards the authorities instructions.Remark 1.3. Note that the multipliers of I s (t − τ 2 ) terms are the same as σ 3 dB 3 (t) although they are premultiplied by different constants. Indeed, the portion of diagnosed symptomatic infected population is completely distributed into the three forms F b , F g , and F c , by the rates γ b , γ g and γ c , respectively. Then,In addition, we assume that the parameter α, which measures the efficiency of public health administration for hospitalization, undergoes random fluctuations. Remark 1.5. Temporarily asymptomatic individuals are included in the class I s of symptomatic, while individuals in I a , who are permanently asymptomatic, will remain asymptomatic until recovery and will not spread the virus, a fact which has been recently confirmed by the World Health Organization.For biological reasons, we assume that the initial conditions of system (1) satisfy:where θ ∈ [−τ, 0] and τ = max{τ 1 , τ 2 τ 3 , τ 4 }. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with the existence and uniqueness of a positive global solution that ensures the well-posedness of the D-COVID-19 model (1). A sufficient condition for the extinction is established in Section 3. Then, some numerical scenarios, to assess the effectiveness of the adopted deconfinement strategy, are presented in Section 4. The paper ends up with Section 5 of conclusion.Let us denote R 9We begin by proving the following result.Theorem 1. For any initial value satisfying condition (2), there is a unique solutionto the D-COVID-19 model (1) that remains in R 9 + with probability one. Proof. Since the coefficients of the Stochastic Differential Equations with several delays (1) are locally Lipschitz continuous, it follows from [12] that for any square integrable initial value x(0) ∈ R 9 + , which is independent of the considered standard Brownian motion B, there exists a unique local solution x(t) on t ∈ [0, τ e ), where τ e is the explosion time. For showing that this solution is global, knowing that the linear growth condition is not verified, we need to prove that τ e = ∞. Let k 0 > 0 be sufficiently large for 1 k 0 < x(0) < k 0 . For each integer k ≥ k 0 , we define the stopping time τ k := inf t ∈ [0, τ e )/x i (t) / ∈ 1 k , k for some i = 1, 2, 3 , where inf ∅ = ∞. It is evident that τ k ≤ τ e . Let T > 0, and define the twice differentiable function V on R 3 + → R + as follows:By Itô's formula, for any 0 ≤ t ≤ τ k ∧ T and k ≥ 1 we havewhere L is the differential operator of function V :Thus,By applying the elementary inequality 2ab ≤ a 2 + b 2 , we can easily increase the right-hand side of the previous inequality to obtain thatwhere D is an adequate selected positive constant. By integrating both sides of the equality dV (x(t)) = LV (x(t))dt + σ(x(t))dB t between t 0 and t ∧ τ k and acting the expectation, which eliminates the martingale part, we get thatEV (x s ))ds.Gronwall's inequality implies thatFor ω ∈ {τ k ≤ T }, x i (τ k ) equals k or 1 k for some i = 1, 2, 3. Hence,It follows thatLetting k → ∞, we get P (τ e ≤ T ) = 0. Since T is arbitrary, we obtain P (τ e = ∞) = 1. With the same technique, we also deduce that the rest of the variables of the system are positive on [0, ∞). This concludes the proof.In this section, we obtain a sufficient condition for the extinction of the disease.) be a solution of the D-COVID-19 model (1) with positive initial value defined in (2) . Assume that.Then,Namely, I s (t) tends to zero exponentially a.s., that is, the disease dies out with probability 1.To simplify, we setWe then getHence,whereWe haveThen,From the large number theorem for martingales [5] , we deduce thatWe also haveThus,We conclude that ifThe proof is complete.In this section, we simulate the forecasts of the D-COVID-19 model (1), relating the deconfinement strategy adopted by Moroccan authorities with two scenarios. We assume u defined as follows: where u i ∈ (0, 1], for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, measures the effectiveness of applying the multiple preventive interventions imposed by the authorities and presented in Table 1 . [1, 20] , in average, before becoming symptomatic and infectious or asymptomatic with a percentage that varies from 20.6% of infected population to 39.9% [15] , while the time needed before his hospitalization is estimated to be 7.5 days [6, 8, 19] . All the parameter values chosen for the D-COVID-19 model (1) are summarized in Table 2 . We consider that all measures and the adopted confinement strategy previously discussed are conserved. The evolution on the number of diagnosed infected positive individuals given by the D-COVID-19 model (1) versus the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Morocco, from March 2 to May 6, is presented in Figure 2 . We see that the curve generated by the D-COVID-19 model (1) follows the trend of the daily reported cases in Morocco. So, we confirm that the implemented measures taken by the authorities have an explicit impact on the propagation of the virus in the population since the curve of the D-COVID-19 model (1) has been flattening from April 17 and tends to go towards the extinction of the disease from May 05. In Figure 3 , we see that Morocco has spent almost 40% of the total duration of the epidemic at May 11 and will reach extinction after four months, in average, from the start of the epidemic on March 2, 2020 (t = 0). To prove the biological importance of delay parameters, we give the graphical results of Figure 4 , which allow to compare the evolution of diagnosed positive cases with and without delays. We observe in Figure 4 a high impact of delays on the number of diagnosed positive cases. Indeed, the plot of model (1) without delays (τ i = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is very far from the clinical data. Thus, we conclude that delays play an important role in the study of the dynamical behavior of COVID-19 worldwide, especially in Morocco, and allows to better understand the reality.In Figures 5, 6 , and 7, we consider the deconfinement of 30% of the population returning to work from May 20, and this proportion is immediately integrated into the susceptible population. Numerical simulations are presented for three possible scenarios. In the first, we consider that the whole population highly respects the majority of the measures announced by the authorities in relation with the deconfinement (Figure 5 ). The second and third scenarios show the direct impact on the curves when the population moderately respects the measures with different levels, σ 2 = 0.10 and σ 2 = 0.15, respectively. With the last two scenarios we observe the growth in the final number of infected, deaths, severe and critical forms, which are the most important to monitor, since the health system should not be saturated. It is also important to note the appearance of a second significant peak and the fact that the time required for extinction becomes longer, which relates to the value of σ 2 (Figures 6 and 7) . It should be mentioned that all our plots were obtained using the Matlab numerical computing environment by discretizing system (1) by means of the higher order method of Milstein presented in [7] and used in [11] .In this work, we have proposed a delayed stochastic mathematical model to describe the dynamical spreading of COVID-19 in Morocco by considering all measures designed by authorities, such as confinement and deconfinement policies. More precisely, our model takes into account four types of delays: the first one is related to the incubation period, the second is the time needed to move from the symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms of diagnosed cases, the third is the time needed to move from the class of infected individuals to the recovered or dead class, while the last one is the time needed to pass from the three types of classes of individuals supported by the Moroccan health system, and under quarantine, to the recovered or dead compartments. Besides, to well describe reality, we have added a stochastic factor resulting from possible maladjustment of the population individuals to the measures.To show that our model is mathematically and biologically well-posed, we have proved the global existence of a unique positive solution (see Theorem 1) . Our result has shown a possible extinction of the disease when σ 2 1 is greater than a threshold parameter (see Theorem 2) . In addition, numerical simulations have been performed to forecast the evolution of COVID-19. More precisely, we have shown that the evolution of our D-COVID-19 model follows the tendency of daily reported confirmed cases in Morocco (see Figure 2 ). Further, if Moroccan people would maintain, strictly, their confinement policy, we observe that the disease dies out around four months from March 2, 2020 (see Figure 3 ). On the other hand, in response to the decision of deconfinement represented by the liberation of the 30% of population, which took place at May 20, we simulate three scenarios corresponding to different values of the intensity σ 2 . When σ 2 = 0.01 ( Figure 5 ), the eradication of the disease from the population comes early compared to the cases when σ 2 = 0.10 ( Figure 6 ) and σ 2 = 0.15 ( Figure 7) . Additionally, the number of diagnosed confirmed cases mainly changes because of the value of this intensity and a small perturbation leads to relevant quantitative changes and significant variations on the time needed for extinction. Thus, we observe that the value of this perturbation has a high impact on the evolution of COVID-19, which means the Moroccan population has a big interest to respect the governmental measures announced May 20, 2020, in order to have a successful and good deconfinement strategy.Here we have compared the predictions of the proposed model (1) with real data until middle of May 2020. We leave the comparison of the real data in Morocco till the end of 2020 to a future work, where we also plan to incorporate the predictions of the evolution of our COVID-19 model with respect to preventive Moroccan measures by regions and cities.","Morocco","abstract","2020-10-28",10

It is caused by a new type of virus belonging to the coronaviruses family and recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was reclassified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease spreads rapidly from country to country, causing enormous economic damage and many deaths worldwide. The first case of COVID-19 in Morocco was confirmed on March 2, 2020 in city of Casablanca. It involved a Moroccan expatriate residing in Italy and who came from Italy on February 27, 2020. As of April 17, 2020, the confirmed cases reached 2564 and the number of recoveries reached 281 with a total number of 135 deaths [2] .Moroccan authorities have implemented multiple preventive measures and strategies to control the spread of disease, such as the closing of borders, suspension of schools and universities, closing coffee shops, the shut-down of all mosques in the country, etc. Further, Morocco has declared a state of health emergency during the period from March 20 to April 20, 2020, to avoid the spread of COVID-19. During this period, movement during the day should be limited to work, shopping, medical care, purchasing medicine, medical supplies, and emergency situations only. In addition, and from April 6, 2020, the wearing of a mask became compulsory for all persons authorized to move.Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission has attracted the attention of many scientists. Tang et al. [3] used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 transmission based on data obtained for the confirmed cases of the disease in mainland China. Wu et al. [4] provided an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China by using a SEIR model. In [5] , Kuniya applied the SEIR compartmental model for the prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from January 15 to February 29, 2020. Fanelli and Piazza [6] analyzed and forecasted COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France by using a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death (SIRD) model. The authors of [7] present a mathematical model and study the dynamics of COVID-19 that emerged recently in Wuhan, China. For a fractional (non-integer order) model see [8] .In the models cited above, the transmission of the disease was assumed to be instantaneous and therefore they are formulated by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), without time delays. In this study, we propose a mathematical model governed by delay differential equations (DDEs) to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco and taking into account multiple preventive measures and strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities, related to the confinement period between March 2 and June 20, 2020, in order to control the spread of disease. To do this, Section 2 deals with the formulation of the model. Section 3 is devoted to parameters estimation and sensitivity analysis. Forecast of COVID-19 spreading in Morocco is presented in Section 4. We end with a discussion of the results, in Section 5.Around the world, all the countries that are attacked by the COVID-19 have imposed several strategies, with different degrees, to fight against it, namely the reduction of some rights by adopting the quarantine method in order to prevent contacts between vulnerable and infected individuals, closing the geographical borders of the countries, and enforcing the capacity of the sanitary system. Similarly, the Kingdom of Morocco quickly followed all of the previous strategies when the pandemic was in its early stages.The terms ""susceptibility"" and ""vulnerability"" are often used interchangeably for populations with disproportionate health burdens [9] . The distinction between vulnerability and susceptibility marks the difference between being intact but fragile-vulnerable and being injured and predisposed to compound additional harm-susceptible [10] . Here, we refer to ""the potential to contract the COVID-19"" as vulnerability, to emphasize the environmental nature of the disease.After the first reported positive case in Morocco, March 2, 2020, the closing of schools and universities is done at March 16, 2020; the state of health emergency (containment) is imposed to contain the outbreak from March 20, 2020; and the closure of the borders is performed at March 24, 2020. Additionally, the face mask is obligatory used in the general population at April 6, 2020. Based on these preventive measures and strategies, we model the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19 in Morocco by extending the classical SIR model. Precisely, the population is divided into eight classes, denoted by , , , , , , and , where represents the vulnerable sub-population, which is not infected and has not been infected before, but is susceptible to develop the disease if exposed to the virus; is the symptomatic infected sub-population, which has not yet been treated, it transmits the disease, and outside of proper support it can progress to spontaneous recovery or death; is the asymptomatic infected sub-population who is infected but does not transmit the disease, it is not known by the health system and progresses spontaneously to recovery; , and are the patients diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan health system and under quarantine, and subdivided into three categories: benign, severe, and critical forms, respectively. Finally, and are the recovered and died classes. The schematic diagram of our extended model is illustrated in Figure 1 . Therefore, the extended model can be governed by the following system of DDEs:where represents the level of control strategies on the vulnerable population. We adopt the bilinear incidence rate to describe the infection of the disease and use parameter to denote the transmission rate. It is reasonable to assume that the infected individuals are subdivided into individuals with symptoms and others without symptoms, for which we employ the parameter to denote the proportion for the symptomatic individuals and 1 − for the asymptomatic ones. The parameter measures the efficiency of public health administration for hospitalization. Diagnosed symptomatic infected population moves to the three forms: benign, severe and critical, by the rates , and , respectively. The mean recovery period of these forms are denoted by 1/ , 1/ and 1/ , respectively. The later forms die also with the rates , and , respectively. Symptomatic infected population, which is not diagnosed, moves to the recovery compartment with a rate or dies with a rate . On the other hand, asymptomatic infected population moves to the recovery compartment with a rate . The times delay 1 and 2 denote the incubation period and the period time needed before hospitalization, respectively.For biological reasons, we assume that the initial conditions of system (1) satisfy:with the uniform topology. It follows from the theory of functional differential equations [11] that system (1) with initial conditionsOn the other hand, the basic reproduction number is an important threshold parameter that determines the spread of infection when the disease is introduced into the population [12] . This number is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual. By using the next generation matrix approach [13] , the basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1) is given bywhere is the spectral radius of the next generation matrix −1 withBased on the daily published Moroccan data [14], we estimate the values of some parameters of the model. The proportion of asymptomatic forms can vary from 20.6%of infected population to 39.9% [15] . Then, ∈ [0.61, 0.794]. The progression rates , and from symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms are assumed to be 80% of diagnosed cases for benign form, 15% of diagnosed cases for severe form, and 5% of diagnosed cases for critical form, respectively [16] . The true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to be fully understood. The data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3 and 4% [16] . As the Moroccan health system is not overloaded at the moment, it is assumed that deaths mainly come from critical cases with a percentage of 40% for an average period of 13.5 days [16] . Since the mortality rate of symptomatic individuals differs from country to country [6] , we assume that 1% of symptomatic individuals die for an average period of 21 days, whereas the recovery rate for asymptomatic cases is 100% and is the same for severe and benign forms if a proper medical care is taken with an average period of 21 days. We employ a least-square procedure with Poisson noise as in [5] to estimate the transmission rate. The incubation period is estimated to be 5.5 days [17, 18] while the time needed before hospitalization is estimated to be 7.5 days [19, 20, 21] . The estimation of the above parameters is given in Table 1 . Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model predictions to some parameter values. It is used to discover parameters that have a high impact on R 0 and should be targeted by intervention strategies. The main objective of this section is to examine the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number R 0 with respect to model parameters by the so-called sensitivity index.The normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable , that depends differentially on a parameter , is defined asAccording to Definition 1, we derive the normalized forward sensitivity index of R 0 with respect to , , , , , , , and , which is summarized in Table 2 . As we observe in Table 2 , the most sensitive parameters, which have a higher impact on R 0 , are and , since Υ R 0 and Υ R 0 are independent of any parameter of system (1) with Υ R 0 = Υ R 0 = +1. In addition, the parameter has a middle negative impact on R 0 , while R 0 is slightly impacted by the rest of the parameters.In this section, we present the forecasts of COVID-19 in Morocco relating with different preventive measures and strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities on the confinement period between March 2 and June 20, 2020. Then the parameter can be defined as follows: where ∈ (0, 1], = 1, 2, 3, 4, measures the effectiveness of applying the multiple preventive interventions imposed by Moroccan authorities presented in Table 3 . To make a better illustration of the different strategies, we test the four decisions made at the government level in Figure 2 . We see in Figure 2 the evolution of the number of diagnosed infected positive individuals with different sets of measures: low, middle, high, and strict interventions. Up to April 15, the curves corresponding to the first three sets of measures increase exponentially, while the curve corresponding to the fourth set of measures has lost its initial exponential character and tends to flatten over time. In addition, the last daily reported cases in Morocco from March 2 to April 17, confirm the biological tendency of our model. Thus, our model is efficient to describe the spread of COVID-19 in Morocco. However, we note that some clinical data is a little far from the values of the model due to certain foci that appeared in some large areas or at the level of certain industrial areas. Next, we give the graphical results related to delays parameters to prove their biological importance. Now, we indicate the predicted relative impact of the model and especially the diagnosed infective individuals with and without interventions applied progressively in Morocco.Before finding the first positive infected case in Morocco, the authorities have begun with a suspension of international air lines to and from China, and installed health control check-points at the borders but without any interventions into the Moroccan population. For this, we simulate model (1) in the case = 0, which is illustrated by Figures 4 and 5 . We remark from Figure 4 that the estimated epidemic peak is * = 142 (95% , 141 − 143), that is, starting from March 2, 2020 ( = 0), the estimated epidemic peak is July 21, 2020 ( = 142).In the absence of any government intervention, the disease persists strongly and almost all of the vulnerable population will be reached by the infection (Figure 5 ).After the first imported positive infected case, Moroccan authorities began to establish some preventive interventions between the 2 and the 10th of March, namely isolation of positive cases, contact tracing, hygiene measures, prevention measures in workplaces, and ban of mass gathering events. For this reason, we have selected in this period = 0.2. From March 10 up to March 20, 2020, additional preventive measures were established: gradual suspension of all international sea, ground, and air lines (including with Spain, Italia, Algeria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal), closure of coffees, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, party rooms, clubs, sport centers, hammams, game rooms and sport fields, closure of mosques, schools and universities, disinfection of public transportation means, reduction of the carrying capacity of taxis, buses and tramways, movement/travel restrictions, and containment For this, we assume that = 0.4. From April 6, the authority decided compulsory wearing of masks in public spaces, which implies a significant positive influence on the above interventions and an increase of their efficiency level. In this case, we assume that = 0.8. Tacking into account all these policies, we present the following Figures 6 and 7 .We remark from Figure 6 that the estimated epidemic peak is * = 57 (95% , 56 − 57), that is, starting from March 2 ( = 0), the estimated epidemic peak is April 28, 2020 ( = 57).From Figure 7 , we see that all the measures taken into this second strategy have a significant impact on the number of new positive diagnosed cases per day. Compared to Figure 5 , the time required to reach the peak is reduced by 85 days, avoiding globally an interesting number of new infections and new deaths. Furthermore, the computed basic reproduction number R 0 is less than 1, which means the extinction of the disease if the measures cited above are strictly implemented. Here, on one hand, we compare the impact of different degrees of effectiveness on the evolution of the number of positive infected diagnosed individuals, symptomatic individuals, and deaths (see Figures 8 and 9 ). In addition, we present the cumulative cases in Figure 10 and we summarize it in Table 4 . We remark that the effectiveness of the policies plays an important role to reduce, or not, the human damage and ensure the eradication of the illness. However, mitigation measures must be strictly respected to maintain a good level of control over the spread of the virus. On the other hand, we are carrying out a statistical study on a national scale and we note that the trend at the beginning was exponential and will undergo a break due to the multiple interventions of the government, which is globally a good sign (see Figure 11 ), whereas it is needful to pay attention at the evolution of the curves in the different regions in Morocco. Since the clinical data of COVID-19 was not available on a daily basis at the start of the spread of the epidemic in Morocco, we proceeded with a choice of unit of three days. We also remark that almost all the regions have a homogeneous tendency with the national one, except Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (TTA), Oriental, Marrakech-Safi (MS), and Casablanca-Settat (CS), which show a mitigation of the epidemic that does not seem very stable (see Figures 12 and 13 ). Our work followed several steps. First of all, we have formulated an adequate mathematical model to describe the evolution of the COVID-19 disease epidemic in Morocco. This model allows us to have an idea on the number of resuscitation beds to prepare for severe forms and intensive care units for critical forms. Second, we have estimated the corresponding parameters based on the daily Moroccan data. Furthermore, we have applied the least-square-method to determine the confidence interval of the transmission rate , which is given by (95% , 0.4484 − 0.455). Third, we have computed the basic reproduction number R 0 with the next-generation-matrix method, for which we have studied the sensitivity analysis in order to examine the robustness of the model. We have observed that the transmission rate and the proportion of individuals with symptoms are the most sensitive parameters and have a high impact on R 0 . By performing some numerical simulations, we have represented the effect of measures taken by the government, step by step, with the control . In the first period, the appropriate basic reproduction number for = 0.2 is R 0 = 2.9108. In the second period, R 0 = 2.5469 for = 0.3. Thirdly, R 0 = 2.1831 for = 0.4. In the last period, R 0 = 0.7277 for = 0.8. Based on all strategies taken by the Moroccan authorities, we affirm that the best one is to increase considerably the level of the lockdown accompanied by the general use of the face masks. In this case, the estimated endemic peak will take place around April 28. Finally, through an analysis of regional data, we have shown that the evolution of the pandemic is consistent with the general epidemiological tendency at the national level.We finish by mentioning that the used historic data and the different preventive measures and strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities and considered in our study, are related to the confinement period in Morocco, between March 2 and June 20, 2020, whereas the use of historic data and other measures and strategies, linked to the deconfinement phase, are left to another research work.","Morocco","abstract","2020-10-08",10

Many African schools that are newly ""experimenting"" with virtual school need to create a virtual learning environment for the learning. This might be termed virtualising the school. To this end, the learning environment should be created and equipped with all learning resources that are adapted for an optimal learning experience, characterized by best practices and supported by the appropriate culture. One vital thing is the affective aspect of delivery-the institutions need to place emphasis on building a virtualschool culture and this might include approaches to teaching and providing students support services including effective communication. This article highlights a number of factors that require critical attention when virtualising the school.A learning management system [LMS] is indispensable to having an ideal virtual learning environment. Virtual school or online learning should guarantee the virtual school environment for learning with specific features for effective delivery of content, facilitation of content delivery, effective student engagement, tools for optimal participation during session activities, as well as assessment tools that are most effective for assessment including proctoring and grading. In addition to LMS, institutions might want to integrate an information system such as the university management information system [UMIS] for the university. An external, integrated or extended communication system [COMM] that could facilitate education in most effective ways and connect learners within the virtual school system as a community should also be considered. This might include educational social platforms and forums.Pedagogy has to be carefully determined and strategically implemented. The traditional pedagogy for the contact or traditional class is the lecture, which is now in many instances described interactive lectures' to show that is could be enhanced for better student engagement. This can no more be the main or primary method in the virtual school context. Many teachers simply think that sitting in front of the computer and giving content-loaded lectures very eloquently, at best, would do the magic. This is far from the truth in the virtual learning context. Methods of teaching [pedagogy] need to be carefully determined. 1 For example, flip classes might be better than real-time lectures, especially when the internet is not reliable. Teambased learning [TBL] sessions might be helpful as well. Rather than giving 2-3-hour didactic lectures, shorter lectures with relevant application questions and group work to encourage self-directed learning and collaborative participation during learning might be quite useful. Teachers, when giving real-time lectures need to carefully choose their environment and their appearance as well as the presentation styles as these would affect students' learning significantly. The media needs to support learning and the choice of teaching methods. E-conferencing media including Zoom, Google meeting and Webex might help better than ordinary video-communicating apps. The teachers' skills, as well as knowledge and the adherence to best practices in the virtual learning environment, are also worth critical consideration. 2There is a sea of resources to work with nowadays. It would be helpful, if the institutions can afford them, to subscribe to standard online resources that deliver a variety of quality learning materials or content including video of lectures, animations of concepts, flashcards for learners, revisions resources, and self-assessment material among others. Resources like ScholarRx, Lecturio and Osmosis are used in the medical fields for instance. In addition to this or as a suitable alternative, teachers can use [open education resources] OER for their students. 3, 4 These resources are available for use and could be ""re-packaged"" suitably for a specific group of learners in ways that specifically meet their needs. In addition, with a suitable LMS, educators can upload selected videos, short texts, simulations, animations, own lectures recorded as videos or audio for students to use.Assessment in the virtual school or learning environment can only be effective when it follows evidence-based practices and the appropriate principles. 5 Tests formats such as long and short essays, direct observations and practical sessions are more difficult to organise in the virtual learning environment. This brings to the fore the ongoing argument about the efficiency of these methods in the context of students' assessment. While this article is not in any way an attempt to take a side along these lines of argument, it emphasises the fact that the impracticality of certain methods in certain context and the misalignment of assessment with pedagogy and context could mess up things in the context of virtual learning environment. Efficiency, therefore, requires the need to use only evidence-based practices and methods supported by empirical data and reliable evidences.Formative assessment from a collection of different approaches may include reflections or reflective practices, multiple-source formative assessments [360°], portfolios, digital or micro-badges, short leaner's reports in forms of short essays or short answers to specific questions, testing students with critical thinking cases after which they will be required to provide original responses or answers; group work including literature reviews and specifically defined problems-based questions among others. These formative assessments should give adequate opportunity for student to explore information using the internetenabled electronic library materials. If properly used, formative assessments should carry significant proportion of the final grades weight in a virtual learning environment. Summative assessment which is high-stake could help in determining the final level of students learning and knowledge or proficiency. In this case, except when practical skills and performances are required such as in the clinical setting in medicine and nursing and in the workshop or laboratory setting such as in engineering, multiple-choice questions when properly structured, deployed and implemented are arguably the most effective means of summative assessment in the virtual learning environment. However, the higher-order learning attributes as indicated in the Miller's pyramid may not be testable using this method.Connectivism is a proposed modern theory of learning; 6,7 despite its accompanying controversies. It could help in addressing the current situations. This includes the effective use of the internet to facilitate human interactions and connections as a learning community to facilitate learning. It provides the basis for how best to use the internet in the most effective ways for learning. It also helps to structure virtual learning in a leaner-center approach conducting teaching and assessments following evidence-based principles and practices in such context. This theory is worth consideration in current scenarios. It might be helpful for institutions to also consider portfolios, digital badges and other methods of facilitating learning and rewarding learning in standardised and creative ways in addition to the traditional methods of assessment.Quality assurance or ensuring academic integrity will be of utmost importance in a virtual learning environment. The ability to use technology-enabled security measures and features such as attendance of sessions and participation which could be recorded by Learning Management Systems would be quite helpful. Records of participation on the learning management system and the use of computers would be quite helpful. Institutions deploying virtual learning facility should invest in security apps some of which could help to monitor student screen during examination as well as their physical environment. Certain apps can be used for examination proctoring and these can prevent students from accessing any other materials except what is provided for the purpose of assessment on the learning management system. In addition to this, plagiarism checks, done with apps or software would help to deter students from indulging in plagiarism and similar vices. This would ensure academic integrity, serving as a measure of quality assurance. By extension, these measures would ensure originality when students are given tasks. These measures and practices will help to ensure academic integrity.The online learning environment is a peculiar one since there is no contact not just between the teacher and learners but also between the students and the school support systems. Support is therefore expected to be provided virtually. Many students who require support systems more frequently can be troubled students, and lack of quality support can worsen their perception of the quality of services and education that they receive. In addition to the skills of providing this service, online presence of the school support system as well as demonstrated empathy and quality engagement will be critical to meeting students' needs. The online environment should not be one in which students' mails and messages are not read or replied for several days. Service providers would see inquiring students like a student standing right in front of them. Do you keep such a person for three days before responding? No! This explains why students might get easily frustrated and consequently lose interest when online or virtual school support systems are dysfunctional and ineffective. Institutions would have to train their support service staff and equip them with communication skills to deal with the peculiarities of the demands in the online school environment.Technology should support the virtual learning system adequately. It is better if vital consideration is given to how technology would enable effective integration of LMS, UMIS, resources, communication and social forums. 8 The ICT teams should consider the quality of internet access including the speed or the bandwidth in the design of the virtual school system. Just as critical considerations are given the structure of the physical learning environment, technology and internet quality, strength and DovePress compatibility will be crucial to the success of the virtual learning environment. It is however important to note that it would be very wrong to think that technological investment is the single most important factor in virtualising the school. While training teachers and learners on how to use technology to achieve learning is important and necessary, it is simply one of the many factors that should be considered.It is very important to emphasise the need to build the culture that would enable the virtual school to be effective and to meet the need of the learners. First, school, being learner-centered, more than ever before now puts emphasis on the learner than ever before. Virtual schools should ensure access with equitable opportunities for such access. This should be considered in the planning and implementation of the online schools. 1 The platform should enable learners to have access to materials, resources, classes and teachers with minimal difficulty. For instance, using an LMS that comes with varieties of opportunities for access such as through the desktop, phones including all kinds of smartphones would be a better option than a conventionally built website. Conversely, android and iPhone compatible apps can easily allow access for students whose preference or only options would be their phones. There is a need for a quality online presence of both teachers and the school support system. Etiquette in the online environment -now coined as netiquette -is important and the culture should shape this. Inclusion is another keyword to consider. 9Schools in their attempts to be pragmatic are currently setting up virtual classrooms and engaging students.There are however challenges that come with every new culture and with change. In the older order of didactic classes, things happen within classrooms and offices and often end up there -it was like a closed system! Now that the virtual system has emerged, schools and teachers have to be careful and watchful. Professionalism and ethics are keywords here. Teachers should be careful with reckless use of materials that do not belong to them as teaching materials. The era of subtle plagiarism, including repackaging and repurposing the work of other people for use without permission is gone. There could be serious litigations arising from such practices which often go unnoticed in the physical environment. Another thing to consider is the teaching sessions. Political jokes and comments as well as racially, sexually, religiously and socially sensitive and offensive comments might be riskier than ever before. Online sessions can easily be recorded or copied by different people and this if found wanting could be used against the teacher and the institution. Now, people can easily compare the quality of teaching in one institution with what is available in another. There are many more things to consider, but here is the bottom line; while institutions can be enthusiastic about the new normal, they are required to do things right!Now that we have the new normal, it is not enough to be pragmatic to quickly virtualise the school; all quality assurance methods and standard checks should be put in place. In fact, institutions should put in place mechanisms to ensure that all activities meet the required standards. Governments and regulators should be involved. Institutions should be required to meet certain standards for online schools. Videoconferencing with learners in random and haphazard manners would not suffice. Capacity building for teachers to engage learners in the ""virtual world"" would be helpful. Learners need to be taken through the transformation processes and it would be good to bear in mind the fact that learners would be on various levels of not just learning but with the use of technology and how well they appreciate the system. 10I will conclude with an appeal, especially to institutions in Africa [and the rest of the developing world] with this statement: it is impractical to absolutely graft virtual learning into an existing rigid traditional education system and to continually premise teaching on learning theories and practices of the physical learning environment or contact methods. It might be very expedient to engage appropriate expertise and methods in the efforts to develop applicable virtual learning environments with adequate infrastructures that will deliver. Also, it would be very important to put in place effective training or workshops on knowledge, skills and attitude of how to teach in the virtual environment. Significant emphasis should be placed on the need for a paradigm shift so that teachers and learners can be effective in the virtual learning environments. Institutions should start cultivating a sustainable and compatible culture in support of virtual schools while encouraging teachers to continuously advance their expertise in this domain through continuous professional development and continuous use of the applicable technology so as to eventually achieve proficiency. Virtual school has its culture and institutions should develop this in a strategic manner.The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.","Rwanda","first author","2020-10-13",10

Recent research has shown that in recent months, the most deleterious fake news circulation to the global health system has been on the COVID-19 pandemic [2] . Reports show that as of 14 May 2020, there were over 4.4 million global cases of COVID-19. Over 1.6 million people had recovered from the disease, while there had been around 298 000 deaths [3] . Despite these increasing number of cases, there have been many rumours and incorrect news stories circulating about the COVID-19 [4] . Therefore, it is essential to understand better why people both believe and share false information related to COVID-19 and to develop interventions to reduce the spread of misinformation [5] . To achieve this, we propose a conceptual framework combining three theories: uses and gratification theory (UGT), social networking sites (SNS) dependency theory and social impact theory to understand the factors that predict fake news sharing related to COVID-19.The reason for using these theories is that the UGT has been shown to be limited in explaining the usage of social media for news sharing [6] . We extended the UGT by incorporating other theories to come up with suitable variables; 'status-seeking, information-seeking, social tie strength, parasocial interaction, perceived herd and individual SNS dependency', to be treated as predictors to fake news sharing in this context. Our study also focused on demonstrating the moderating role of fake news knowledge on sharing misinformation related to COVID- 19 . We believe that the increase of fake news knowledge and awareness among the populace would help in curbing the spread of false information related to the pandemic. We focused on Nigeria which is less well-studied [7, 8] , to provide an alternative view of understanding this global problem of fake news. Moreover, scholars have recommended to look beyond researching fake news from the US and UK contexts [9] . As at 14 May 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 4971 cases of COVID-19, 1070 recovered and 164 deaths (NCDC 2020). Therefore, we sought to find out the factors that predict fake news sharing related to COVID-19 among social media users. And the role fake news knowledge has in moderating the effect of fake news sharing.A research model was proposed based on prior literature and three theories; UGT, SNS dependency theory and social impact theory (See Fig. 1 ).The UGT has been the dominant theoretical approach to studying how and why individuals utilize media for many decades. It identifies the needs and desires that an individual has to use a particular media channel [10] . This provide the basis for the motivations of an individual to communicate, which thus influences the type of media that they will use and how they use and interpret the content that the media facilitates [11] . The prevalence of social media has attracted a growing body of studies adopting UGT. These studies have attempted to explore the gratifications associated with the new media. For instance, Introne et al. [12] proposed that the perceived gratifications of online news sharing were entertainment, interpersonal communication, information-seeking and information learning. Park and Blenkinsopp [13] proposed four gratifications derived from social media use, including information-seeking, socializing, entertainment, and self-status-seeking. Therefore, the dominant U&G factors identified by social media literature are entertainment, socializing, information-seeking, information sharing, selfexpression and status-seeking. In this study , we used 'information-and status-seeking gratifications'. Due to the inherently participatory nature of social media [6] , we contend that these gratifications may still be relevant in the current context of fake news sharing.Information-seeking refers to the extent to which news shared in social media can supply users with relevant and timely information which is relevant in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Lampos et al. (2020) [5] stressed that as the cases of the COVID-19 increased around the world, there has been a flurry of misleading or false news stories emerging, as well. This indicates that a lot of people look for information regarding how to cope with the virus, which could turn out to be untrue. We, therefore, contend that due to the million unsupervised messages on COVID-19 found on social media that individuals continuously seek to consume in a bid to combat the disease, they may as well share fake news. We, therefore, propose that: H1. 'Information-seeking' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.Status-seeking refers to how sharing news on social media assists users to attain status within their network. It has been found that individuals share contents on social media to gain recognition (Ma 2014). Lee et al. [14] discovered status-seeking to be the strongest predictors of news sharing on social media. We believe that in this period of pandemic, a lot of people would like to disseminate information to either assist or show they are knowledgeable in the preventive tips one should follow in curbing the virus. Therefore, when people are motivated to seek status, they may not care about the accuracy of the news they share. What they care most is the number of views and likes. Taken together, we then propose that:Factors that affect online fake news on COVID-19 H2. 'Status-seeking' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.Social impact is defined as any influence on individual feelings, thoughts or behaviour that is created from the real, implied or imagined presence or actions of others [15] . The theory helps us understand in which social situations we produce a greater influence. Thus, the social impact will depend on the social forces, the immediacy of the event, and the number of sources that produce the impact. According to Handarkho [16] , the choice to use and share an information received is generally influenced by one's acceptance of others' views, and this is also based on the quality of social experience that occurred in the platform. Therefore, we examined social tie strength, parasocial interaction and perceived herd's influence on sharing fake information related to COVID-19.Tie strength is the level of intensity of the social relationship, or degree of overlap between two individuals' scope of friendship [17] . It has been proven that information obtained from a strong tie strength source is perceived as more trustworthy [18] . We thus contend that the ideas or information relating to COVID-19 shared by individuals that are familiar to the users may cause them to trust the information, without necessarily verifying such information. Consequently, we propose the following hypothesis:H3. 'Social tie strength' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.The concept of perceived herd assumes that information or message is perceived to be reliable when shared or accepted by many [19] . Based on the social impact theory, perceived herd refers to particular behaviour exhibited by a substantial number of people that results to 'psychological pressure' towards an individual belief [16] . Drawing from this premise, we assume that when many people on SNS frequently share specific information on COVID-19, social media users may adopt it and consider it as the truth and this may lead to the consumption of fake news. Based on this, we propose that:H4. 'Perceived herd' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.Parasocial interaction refers to the degree or propensity of an individual to develop an emotional connection with a figure considered as a guide, or a role model [20] . Handarkho [16] remarked that emotional tie is not only formed among friends and relatives but also formed among individuals that are admired and respected, such as politicians, public figures and idolized personalities. In this view, we assume that people would believe and consider any COVID-19 information disseminated on SNS by public figures they hold in high esteem. Drawing from this, we proposed that:H5. 'Parasocial interaction' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.The SNS dependency theory focuses on the degree an individual depend on SNS to carry out a daily task [21] . The theory assumes that the more an individual rely on SNS platform, the easier it becomes for their conducts and beliefs to be influenced by the 'opinion' of others regarding specific issues [22] . People who regard SNS as their primary source of information or update presume that information circulated on the platform is trustworthy and reliable [4] and hence we believe that dependency on social media may lead to fake news sharing. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed:O. D. Apuke and B. Omar H6. 'Individual SNS dependency' is positively associated with sharing fake news on COVID-19 pandemic.In this study, fake news knowledge is a practical understanding of fake news. It is also viewed as the salience on the part of a social network member that fake news exists and may be present in his/her network [23] . It was found that individuals can be at the centre stage in dealing with misinformation because without individuals generating content and sharing it, social media which houses fake news cannot survive [8] . Thus, this current study argues that adequate knowledge and awareness of fake news could help users to reduce the tendency of sharing fake news [23] . Torres et al. [23, p. 86] advocated that 'as individuals become aware that news items from a particular source and media may be misleading, at best they may perceive that source to be incompetent, and may begin to question the integrity of the source or media'. Nevertheless, evidence from past research suggests that some people share fake news frequently although they were aware about the falsity of the news, they shared [10] . In contrast, a recent research concluded that fake news awareness moderate fake news sharing [7] . Taken together, we propose that:H7a. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'status-seeking' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge. H7b. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'informationseeking' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge. H7c. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'social tie strength' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge.H7d. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'perceived herd' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge. H7e. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'parasocial interaction' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge. H7f. 'Fake news knowledge' will moderate the relationship between 'individual SNS dependency' and 'fake news sharing' such that the effect of fake news will be stronger for individuals with low fake news knowledge. A survey research design was adopted in this study. Specifically, a self-administered online survey was conducted to reach social media users in Nigeria aged 18 and above. G*-power with effect size of 0.15, alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, was used to get a minimum sample size of 96. However, since we are dealing with a heterogeneous group, we increased our sample size to 770. We promoted our online questionnaire through a network sampling technique also known as 'chain referral' [24] . Participants were invited to complete the survey and share the links with other members. To increase the response rate, the link to the questionnaire was also advertised on various social media platforms. We also contacted some social media influencers in Nigeria to host the link on their page. Overall, 770 responses were obtained for the analysis. Of the 770 responses obtained, 650 was found useable (completion rate 84%). The data were collected between February 2020 and May 2020.Online survey is a cost-effective method with no limitations of geographical boundaries [25] . However, online survey may reduce the Factors that affect online fake news on COVID-19 randomization of sample since members of the population do not have equal chances of receiving the questionnaire [26] . Yet, we believe that online survey seems to be most appropriate because of the movement restrictions. To address the issue of generalizability and bias in online survey, past research suggested a few ways such as having a large sample size, replication of results to increase generalization and comparing sample characteristics with demographic data or/and official statistics [26] . Therefore, we compared our demography with the Nigerian demographic statistics and found that it did not defer much [27] . We also increased our estimated sample size to 770. Table I shows the respondents characteristics.All our constructs were measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale, in which 1 symbolizes strongly disagree and 5 strongly agree. Appendix A list the items used to measure the construct and sources consulted. A pilot study which consisted of (n ¼ 30) participants was conducted before actual data collection. Furthermore, experts were consulted to give their input on the items. The feedback from the pilot test and experts was used to revise wordings of the items to avoid misunderstanding.We analysed data using structural equation modelling with SmartPLS 3.2.6. The reason for using Partial Least Squares is related to the exploratory nature of our research and the model complexity with some moderating variables [28] . Common method bias (CMB) was tested before data analysis because responses were collected from the same survey. We performed a Harman's single factor test and a single factor shared over 25.4% of the total variance which is <50% threshold value [28] . This indicates that the CMB was not a problem in this study.To evaluate the measurement model, the convergent and discriminant validity test was conducted [7] . The outer loading of each indicator item is over 0.708 [29] , the composite reliability, average variance extracted and Cronbach's a all exceeded the recommended threshold [29] . Thus, convergent validity was supported (See Table II) .We also assessed the measurement model by conducting a discriminant validity test [30] . Table III shows that all values are <0.90. Thus, discriminant validity was supported.Before assessing the structural model, we assessed collinearity. All the inner VIF values were between 1.14 and 2.42, below the threshold of 5 [29] (See Table I ). According to Hair et al. [29] , the key criteria for evaluating the structural model is to examine the t values, path coefficient (b values), effect size (f 2 ), predictive relevance (Q 2 ) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). A 5000 resample bootstrapping procedure with 5% significance level (one-tailed) was used to test the significance of the hypotheses. Table IV and Fig. 2 revealed that tie strength (b ¼ 0.622, P < 0.001), perceived herd (b ¼ 0.412, P < 0.001), SNS dependency (b ¼ 0.398, P < 0.001), information-seeking (b ¼ 0.339, P < 0.01) and para social interaction (b ¼ 0.214, P < 0.05) positively predicted fake news sharing related to COVID-19. This supports H1, H3, H4, H5 and H6. However, status-seeking was not significant (b ¼ 0.021, P < 0.05). Therefore, H2 was not supported. Additionally, gender and age had no significant effect on fake news sharing, but education was significant (b ¼ 0.321, P < 0.01). Further results indicated that the effect sizes (f 2 ) for the five significant relationships are all achieved from small to large effect size. This is based on the threshold of 0.02 small, 0.15 moderate and 0.35 large [31] . Finally, we looked into the model's predictive relevance (Q 2 ) [32] and found it to be 0.189 > 0. This suggest that the research model has excellent predictive relevance, since it is greater than zero. Our model explains 78% of the variance in people's intention to share fake news; suggesting a substantial contribution of all predictors in explaining the dependent variable [28] .We used the two-stage approach to analyse moderation because it is versatile and should generally be given preference for creating the interaction term [29] . Fake news knowledge significantly moderated the effect on the relationship between perceived herd and fake news sharing (b ¼ À0.372, P < 0.001), SNS dependency and fake news sharing (b ¼ À0.326, P < 0.001), information-seeking and fake news sharing (b ¼ À0.239, P < 0.05) and parasocial interaction and fake news sharing (b ¼ À0.144, P < 0.05). However, the relationships between tie strength and fake news sharing (b ¼ 0.014, P > 0.05), as well as status-seeking and fake Fig. 2 ).Our results indicated that tie strength is the strongest predictor of fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. This is consistent with a recent research [16] . Furthermore, we found a positive relationship between perceived herd and fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. A possible reason for this outcome could be because there are now many rumours and false news stories circulating about the COVID-19 [4] . Therefore, as people come across stories shared and liked by many, they might feel that such information is accurate. We also found a positive association between SNS dependency and fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. This supports the outcome of a recent research [4] .Therefore, we maintain that individual's high dependency in SNS for information on COVID-19 has caused the consumption and circulation of fake information to increase. Additionally, informationseeking was found to predict fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. This outcome corroborates recent research [5] , related to COVID-19 and false information sharing.Our results also showed that parasocial interaction predicted fake news sharing. This suggests that a lot of people have the tendency to believe COVID-19 information disseminated on SNS by public figures they hold in high esteem. This is consistent with a recent research [33] . Contrary to what we expected, status-seeking was not associated with fake news sharing relating to COVID-19. What this indicates is that people may not want to share misinformation that would endanger their reputation. Additionally, we found that gender and age have no significant effect on fake news sharing, which is contrary to prior research [8] . We believe that contextual factors might have some influence on this outcome. However, we found that educational level predicted fake news sharing. Those with lower educational qualification shared fake news more than individuals who have higher education.As shown in Fig. 3 , the relationship between fake news knowledge and perceived herd is weakened among individuals that exerts a high level of fake news knowledge. These findings suggest that those with a high level of fake news knowledge tend to be more sceptical and critical when sharing information. Furthermore, we found that fake news knowledge moderated the relationship between SNS dependency and fake news sharing. This is graphically represented in Fig. 4 . Figure 4 demonstrates that the effect of fake news sharing is more significant for individuals with lower fake news knowledge. Additional findings demonstrate the ability of fake news knowledge in weakening the relationship between informationseeking and fake news sharing (Fig. 5) . In this view, we found that the effect of fake news sharing is stronger with individuals that have low fake news knowledge.As shown in Fig. 6 , those with low fake news knowledge as represented by the steeper slope share more fake news. What this means is that if an individual has a high level of fake news knowledge, he/ she may be more cautious when using any information that a public figure posted online. This outcome is contrary to findings of past research [22] .Contrary to our expectation, fake news knowledge did not moderate the relationship between tie strength and fake news sharing. This could be because Nigerians perceive the quality of idea or information shared on SNS more valued when it comes from relatives and friends. We also found no moderating effect of fake news knowledge on the relationship between status-seeking and fake news sharing.Most prior studies widely employed the U&G as a lens to predict news sharing determinants [6, 34] . We extended the UGT and incorporated other theories such as SNS dependency and social impact theory to establish factors that better explain why people share fake news on social media. This study established that information-seeking, parasocial interaction, tie strength, perceived herd and SNS dependency are associated with fake news sharing. Evidence has shown that empirical studies on fake Factors that affect online fake news on COVID-19 news sharing are lacking as most prior literature lacks a theoretical framework or model that empirically broadens our understanding of fake news sharing behaviour on social media [7, 36] . Therefore, this study has significant importance as it modelled the factors that lead to the spread of misinformation during this period of COVID-19. Another contribution of this study is that limited prior literature on fake news mainly focuses on social media users from the Western world. In contrast, the current study is based on samples drawn from Nigerian social media users. Our study has also empirically demonstrated the role of fake news knowledge in curtailing fake news spread.Based on the findings of this study, we suggest intervention strategies which can nudge people to consume manageable amount of COVID-19 content through social media. People should be mindful with the messages shared by friends and families and prominent figures. They also need to reduce the over reliance on social media for information. Social media users should try to authenticate and scrutinize information properly before sharing. Social media companies should also restrict the number of COVID-19 specific information people are exposed to; this may reduce the circulation of fake news. All relevant authorities, health care workers and other stakeholders should increase the knowledge of people to realize the dangers of spreading fake news during this pandemic. Moreover, government officials and health workers should provide relevant information on this current pandemic. That is, correct information should be shared widely to the public domain through various conventional and online media. This may decrease the spread of fake news on the concocted cure and prevention tips found online.This study suffers from some limitations. This study was undertaken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and drew its sample from only one country (Nigeria). More studies are required to extend this study to other countries that are facing similar issues. Despite the limitations of this study, it has answered a recent call to look beyond researching fake news from the US and UK contexts [7, 9] . Another limitation of this study is that we can only conclude base on the factors we have identified and analysed. There are other factors such as peer influence, social comparison and so on. Therefore, future researchers could expand the number of predictors to better understand fake news sharing related to COVID-19. We also acknowledge the fact that fake news knowledge is not the only moderating variable that could reduce fake news sharing. Future researchers could investigate the role of source credibility, news verification behaviour and other related moderators to fake news sharing.

MERS-CoV causes a zoonotic disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with out breaks in health-care facilities associated with trans mission between humans. As of November, 2019, 2494 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS, including 858 associated deaths (case-fatality ratio of 34·4%), were reported globally; the majority of these (2102 cases, including 780 deaths) occurred in Saudi Arabia. 2 Travel-associated outbreaks led to 186 cases and 39 deaths in South Korea. 2 Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic MERS-CoV disease. 3 The majority (>70%) of dromedaries are found in Africa. They have comparable seroprevalence and virus shedding to those in the Arabian Peninsula, 4 but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa.Humans with prolonged close exposure to dromedaries in the Arabian Peninsula have serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection, sometimes having seroprevalence as high as 50%, 5, 6 but serological evidence is rare in Africa, even in dromedary-exposed individuals. 7, 8 However, virologically confirmed infection, especially if it is asymptomatic or mild, might not lead to a serological response. 9 Thus, alternative and more sensitive methods for detection of past human MERS-CoV infection are needed.Specific T-cell responses have been shown to be longlasting in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected humans, 10, 11 and persist longer than antibodies in SARS. We therefore aimed to test peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in workers from an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, for MERS-CoV-specific T-cell responses to understand if the dromedary-exposed individuals in Africa have been infected by MERS-CoV.In this observational cohort study, workers at an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, consenting to participate in the cohort study in March 13-26, 2018 , were recruited. Nonabattoir workers were also recruited randomly from the city of Kano during the same period, and blood donors aged 18-65 years sampled in May 10-Aug 31, 2018, at Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou, China, were randomly included as healthy controls from a region with no dromedary camel exposure.Convalescent blood samples collected from 14 people with symptomatic or asymptomatic virologically confirmed MERS-CoV infections detected at the King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, and King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, collected as part of a previously reported study 11 were included as positive controls. The clinical, serological and T-cell responses (using only interferon [IFN]-γ as a readout of positive cells) of this patient cohort have been previously reported. 11 PBMCs were collected at 6 months (patients 1-6, 8-9, 11-14 as reported in the previous publication) or 24 months (patients [18] [19] after infection.Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants in Nigeria and the study was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health, Nigeria (MOH/Off/797/T.I/630). We obtained Institutional Review Board approval from the Health Commission of Guangdong Province to use the anonymised blood donor samples for this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all recovered patients with MERS to participate in this study and approval obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, and King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Jeddah. 12 Procedures 8 mL of blood were collected from each study participant from the abattoir and from donors from Guangzhou. PBMCs were isolated from blood using Leucosep tubes (Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria) and Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) according to the manu facturer's instructions. PBMCs were stored in liquid nitrogen and plasma at -80°C or lower before and during shipping before analysis.Plasma was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56°C before the serology testing. Anti-MERS-CoV antibody titres were determined using plaque reduction neutralisation tests. 9, 13 A set of 20-mer peptides overlapping by ten amino acids en comp assing the four MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) structural proteins (peptides S1, S2, N, and ME encompassing the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the spike [ Evidence before this study Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is recognised as one of eight emerging pathogens of greatest threat to global public health, and dromedary camels are the source of human zoonotic infection. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the pandemic potential of zoonotic coronaviruses. Although zoonotic disease has been restricted to the Arabian Peninsula, the largest number (>70%) of MERS-CoV infected camels are found in Africa. We searched PubMed for articles published between Nov 8, 2012, and Dec 15, 2019, in English with the search terms ""MERS"" AND ""coronavirus"" AND ""human"" AND ""Africa"" and manually screened all retrieved articles. There was one MERS outbreak reported in Tunisia initiated by a traveller returning from the Arabian Peninsula but no reports of zoonotic disease in Africa. There were six sero-epidemiological studies of camel-exposed or other humans in Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, and Morocco and only two (two of 1122 in Kenya and three of 476 tested in Morocco) found any evidence of MERS-CoV infection. Because there was evidence that serological assays for MERS-CoV had suboptimal sensitivity for past infection and because we had previous data showing that T-cell assays for MERS-CoV are specific and potentially more sensitive than antibody detection, we investigated T-cell responses in dromedary-exposed abattoir workers and controls in Nigeria.We found that 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries had MERS-CoV specific T-cell responses, but of 20 abattoir workers without exposure to dromedaries and ten non-abattoir workers from Kano, none had such T-cell responses. No individuals with MERS-CoV T-cell responses had detectable antibody. By contrast, T-cell responses to endemic human coronaviruses were detected comparably in abattoir workers with and without exposure to dromedaries and control groups. We document that dromedary-exposed individuals in Africa are frequently infected with MERS-CoV without evidence of severe disease.Our findings indicate that there is substantial zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV to people with dromedary exposure in parts of Africa. The contribution of MERS-CoV to zoonotic respiratory disease remains to be established. Our findings have implications for global MERS-CoV control policy. There is a need to confirm our findings elsewhere in Africa and to include molecular testing for MERS-CoV in the investigation of patients with severe acute respiratory infections in dromedary-exposed populations in Africa.ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b) were synthesised by Sino Biological (Shanghai, China), and used for stimulation of PBMCs. T-cell responses were measured using intracellular cytokine staining assays for interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Structural proteins peptide libraries of HKU1-CoV, OC43-CoV, NL63-CoV, and 229E-CoV were also synthesised by Sino Biological to detect viral-specific T-cell responses. To enhance specificity, only cells with dual expression of both IFN-γ and TNF after peptide stimulation were considered as positive.Flow cytometry was used to determine the phenotype and function of T cells. The following anti-human monoclonal antibodies were used: BV510-CD3 (HIT3a; BD, San Jose, CA), PerCP-Cy5. 5 In a previous study of dromedary abattoir workers in Saudi Arabia, ten of 30 workers sampled had detectable T-cell responses to MERS-CoV. 14 On the basis of this finding, and the assumption that abattoir workers without dromedary exposure and the other control groups would have no detectable T-cell responses, eight abattoir workers would be the minimal sample size required to detect a positive result with 95% probability, where the detection probability is given by: 1 -(1 -p)n with p equivalent to 10/30 and n being the sample size. We aimed at sampling all abattoir workers who consented to participate, as long as we successfully sampled at least eight dromedary-exposed abattoir workers.Association of T-cell responses with different exposure to dromedaries was done using Fisher's exact test. In univariate analysis, we estimated the crude odds ratio (OR) for each potential epidemiological exposure factor in relation to MERS-CoV T-cell positivity using a logistic regression model. Independent risk factors for T-cell positivity were identified using multivariable logistic regression. We included a-priori variables, such as years of work in abattoir and whether other household members frequently visited camel farms, and other variables with a crude OR of more than 2 or less than 0·5 in the univariate analysis. Due to small sample size and cross-related practices of drinking camel milk and camel urine, we first fitted a logistic regression model which considered all four combinations of the two practices (eg, drinking camel milk only, drinking camel urine only, drinking both camel milk and urine or not drinking either), adjusted for potential confounding factors (Model 1). Then we further assessed the effect of drinking camel milk and camel urine separately in two models (Models 2 and 3) . Missing data were handled using multiple imputation with 50 imputations by predictive mean matching using the AregImpute function in R. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.5.1.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.We recruited 81 volunteers working in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria. Dromedaries, sheep, goats, and cattle were slaughtered in different areas of this abattoir (appendix p 4), and workers usually restrict themselves to work with one animal type. 61 (75%) workers had occupational exposure to dromedaries, whereas 20 (25%) were only involved in the slaughtering of sheep, goats, or cattle. Ten people residing in Kano not involved in abattoir-work and 24 volunteers from Guangzhou, China, with no exposure to dromedaries, were also recruited as additional controls. 14 patients with confirmed MERS from Saudi Arabia were included in this study as positive controls. 11 All participants were adults (aged ≥18 years). Boots were the main protective equipment used by abattoir workers with (48 [79%] of 61) and without (14 [70%] of 20) exposure to dromedaries, whereas other protection, such as gloves, coveralls, masks, or goggles, were rarely used. There was no significant difference in the demographic characteristics between the three groups recruited in Kano (table 1) .None of the sera collected neutralised the Nig1657 virus (previously isolated at the same abattoir) at the dilution of 1:10 to levels of greater than 50% of control, the lowest threshold for a positive result (data not shown).PBMCs possessed good viabilities in all groups from which they were collected (appendix p 5) and responded to anti-human CD3 stimulation (appendix p 6). 18 (30%) of 61 samples from workers with exposure to dromedaries contained CD4+ or CD8+ T cells that responded to at least one peptide pool, particularly S1 and S2 pools ( figure 1A, B; appendix p 7) . No MERS-CoV specific CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in the three groups without exposure to dromedaries ( figure 1C, D) . The proportion of individuals with both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses was significantly larger among dro medaryexposed abattoir workers than in workers without exposure (CD4+ p=0·0014; CD8+ p=0·0009), non-abattoir workers (CD4+ p=0·0038; CD8+ p=0·0018), or the Ghuangzhou control group (CD4+ p=0·0005; CD8+ p=0·0003). The magnitude of the CD4+ T-cell responses in abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries was similar to individuals in the Saudi Arabian positive control group with a subclinical condition (p=0·094), whereas the CD8+ T-cell responses were comparable to the symptomatic group (p=0·49). For stimulation with peptide pools derived from MERS-CoV accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b), PBMCs were available from 11 workers with exposure to dromedaries who had T-cell responses to MERS-CoV structural proteins, from 11 who had negative T-cell responses to MERS-CoV structural proteins, and from four each from abattoir workers without exposure to dromedaries and non-abattoir workers. Eight of the 11 dromedary-exposed workers who had T-cell responses to structural proteins also had T-cell responses to accessory proteins ( figure 1E ). None of the abattoir workers with dromedary exposure who did not have T-cell responses previously, nor those without dromedary exposure and non-abattoir workers had T-cell responses to accessory proteins ( figure 1E ). All the T-cell responses detected to accessory proteins were CD4+ T-cell responses and no CD8+ T-cell responses were detected (data not shown). Taken together, of 61 workers with exposure to dromedaries in our cohort, six had both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against MERS-CoV structural proteins, four had only CD4+, and eight had only CD8+ T-cell responses.The MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were multifunctional with dual expression of two cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF). The majority of MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cells from dromedary-exposed workers were phenotypically effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-) cells (figure 1F), whereas CD8+ T cells consisted of effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-) and effector (CD45RA+ CCR7-) cells ( figure 1G, H) , comparable to the TEMRA subset (effector memory T cells expressing CD45RA) described in MERS survivors. 11 Thus, these multifunctional cells are expected to rapidly and efficiently respond to subsequent MERS-CoV reinfection. 61 (53%) of the 115 participants had PBMCs available for additional testing for four endemic human coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), including 18 dromedary-exposed workers positive and ten negative for a MERS-CoV T-cell response and 33 from the negative control groups who were all MERS-CoV T-cell negative. 47 (77%) of 61 were T-cell positive to one or more of the human coronaviruses, with CD4+ T-cell responses being detected in all four groups (figure 2A), whereas CD8+ T-cell responses were found less often (figure 2B). In this group of 61 people, MERS-CoV T-cell responsiveness was not significantly associated with T-cell responses to any of the other coronaviruses (Fisher's exact test; 229E p=0·57, HKU1 p=0·58, NL63 p=0·37, and OC43 p=0·40). Of the 47 with T-cell response to any of the other coronaviruses, ten (21%) had T-cell responses to MERS-CoV. By contrast, seven (50%) of 14 with no detectable T-cell response to any other coronavirus had T-cell responses to MERS-CoV, the negative association being statistically significant (Fisher's exact test p=0·047) . human coronaviruses did not differ between the exposure groups and this was in marked contrast with the observations with MERS-CoV, which was observed exclusively in the dromedary-exposed group. Drinking unpasteurised camel milk (OR 0·24, 95% CI 0·07-0·83) and drinking camel urine (0·30, 0·09-0·94) were significantly and negatively associated with T-cell positivity (table 2). In the multivariate analysis, drinking both camel milk and urine was significantly negatively associated with T-cell responses (0·07, 95% CI 0·01-0·54; Model 1; table 3). Similar findings were obtained from a model without adjustment for potential confounders (data not shown). We further assessed the effect of each practice separately (Models 2 and 3; table 3) and found that drinking unpasteurised camel milk (0·14, 0·02-0·81) and camel urine (0·19, 0·04-0·84) remained a significant factor for T-cell negativity. The two practices of drinking camel milk and camel urine were closely cross-related; 48 (79%) of 61 dromedary-exposed workers drank camel milk or urine, 15 drank milk without drinking urine, and two drank urine without drinking milk. Our results indicated that drinking camel milk or camel urine was associated with a protective effect against MERS-CoV infection, but we could not separate their independent effects in the analysis.Dromedaries in Africa have comparable seroprevalence of MERS-CoV and virus shedding to those in the Arabian Peninsula, but zoonotic disease has not been reported. 4, 12, 15 Even serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary-exposed populations is uncommon. We previously found no serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in 261 dromedary-exposed abattoir workers in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, although virus RNA was repeatedly detected in the camels slaughtered during the winter months, with a peak of 11% of animals shedding virus in some weeks. 16 The negative serological results in workers from the same abattoir in this study were thus consistent with those of other studies of dromedary-exposed populations in Kenya and Egypt, which also did not find MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. 7, 16, 17 One study in Kenya 18 found two seropositive individuals among 1010 people tested, and our study 8 in Morocco detected three seropositive individuals among 476 people living in dromedary herding areas. Because some patients with confirmed MERS disease might not manifest neutra lising antibody responses and because such antibody responses can wane over time, serological studies could underestimate the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa. 9 Furthermore, antibody responses might not be positive in those with mild or asymptomatic infection, 9, [19] [20] [21] and T-cell responses are known to be more sensitive and long-lasting following SARS-CoV infections. 22 We have therefore previously analysed T-cell responses to MERS-CoV. 11 In these studies, both MERS survivors (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and camel workers One abattoir worker with exposure to dromedaries had missing data for years working in abattoir, one for other household members frequently visited camel farms, two for travel outside Kano in the past 6 months, and one for participated in mass gathering. *Mean for age was 27·7 years (SD 8·9). †Mean for years working in abattoir was 11·4 years (SD 9·8). (asymptomatic) identified in Saudi Arabia were shown to have MERS-CoV specific T cells in their blood, and some of those with T-cell responses did not have neutralising antibodies. Comparable findings were observed in the Korean outbreak; some patients with mild MERS did not produce neutralising antibodies but had MERS-CoV-specific T cells in their peripheral blood. 21 We have shown that MERS-CoV-specific T cells were present in 18 (30%) of 61 dromedary-exposed workers but not in controls without exposure to dromedaries, and we conclude that MERS-CoV infections in people with occupational contact with dromedaries is underestimated in Nigeria, and probably elsewhere in Africa. T-cell responses in these workers recognised the highly variable S1 region and unique accessory proteins found in MERS-CoV, arguing for the MERS-CoV specificity of the T-cell responses. By contrast, T-cell responses to human coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43 were found equally distributed in the dromedary-exposed worker group and the control groups (abattoir workers without dromedary exposure, non-abattoir workers, and Ghuangzhou negative control). Cross-reactive T-cell responses to other human endemic coronaviruses were not likely to be an explanation for the MERS-CoV T-cell responses in the dromedary-exposed workers, the association being a negative one. The observation that dromedary-exposed individuals with MERS-CoV T-cell responses did not have antibody responses is consistent with previous studies on MERS and the underlying mechanisms needs further investigation. A question of relevance to public health is why no human zoonotic MERS has been documented in Africa even though zoonotic infection seems to be taking place as assessed by specific T-cell responses. The perception that MERS does not occur in Africa might reduce the use of MERS-CoV diagnostics in patients who have travelled to the Arabian Peninsula, precluding detection of zoonotic MERS in Africa. Our finding that zoonotic MERS-CoV infection is occurring in dromedaryexposed populations in Africa highlights that MERS-CoV needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with severe acute respiratory infections in these regions.An alternative hypothesis is that MERS-CoV strains in Africa differ in pathogenic potential to those circulating in the Arabian Peninsula-ie, causing infection but less likely to cause severe disease. We have shown that MERS-CoVs identified from Africa (clade C), including those isolated in Nigeria (clade C1), are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses causing disease in the Arabian Peninsula (clade B). 12, 23, 24 Viruses from the African clade C1-lineage were found to replicate less efficiently in human respiratory epithelial cell lines, in ex-vivo cultures of the human lung and in experimentally infected human DPP4 transgenic mice, possibly suggesting impaired pathogenic potential. 12 The absence of antibodies in individuals with T-cell responses might also be indicative of less severe infections, because patients with mild or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections often do not have detectable antibody in both the acute and convalescent stages of infection. 9, 21 Irrespective of whether MERS-CoV in Africa is less pathogenic than the virus strains in the Arabian Peninsula, our findings argue for more intensive investigation of MERS-CoV in both humans and camels in Africa. If repeated unsuspected zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV continues to take place in Africa as our findings indicate, given the much larger number of MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries in Africa, the possibility of the virus adapting and efficiently transmitting between humans is probably more likely here than in the Arabian Peninsula where MERS control efforts have been focused. The phylogenetic diversity of clade C viruses in Africa suggests that these are the precursors that gave rise to the potentially more pathogenic clade B viruses currently enzootic in the Arabian Peninsula. 12, 25 If so, similar pathogenic MERS-CoV might independently emerge in Africa. Overall, our findings suggest that the MERS control in the Arabian Peninsula needs to be extended to Africa.Occupational contact with camels was found to be a key risk factor for MERS-CoV infection, as defined by the positive T-cell responses against MERS-CoV. A univariate analysis of exposure factors associated with MERS-CoV infection (ie, MERS-CoV T cell reactivity) in the dromedary-exposed worker group revealed that drinking unpasteurised camel milk and drinking camel urine for medicinal purposes were significantly and negatively associated with infection risk. Because the practices of drinking raw camel milk and urine were often associated and because of the small sample size, it was not possible to estimate their independent effects in a multivariate analysis in which both factors were concurrent variables. The finding that drinking unpasteurised camel milk was negatively correlated with infection risk is surprising and requires independent confirmation. Camel milk has been previously thought of as a potential risk factor for MERS-CoV infection because MERS-CoV virus has sometimes been detected in camel milk. However, camel milk contains high titre antibodies to MERS-CoV, which is likely to neutralise any infectious virus particles, and viable MERS-CoV was not isolated from milk samples in which MERS-CoV RNA was detected. 26 Thus, MERS-CoV antibody present in camel milk could provide protection against MERS-CoV infection.Our study had some limitations. Exposure and risk factors associated with T-cell positivity were self-reported and the details on frequency or intensity for different modes of contacts with dromedaries were not collected. A small sample size reduced the power of the multivariable logistic regression analysis, although we were still able to identify a large protective effect of drinking unpasteurised camel milk or urine on T-cell positivity.In conclusion, we have shown that detection of virusspecific T-cell responses was a more sensitive method for detecting past infection compared with the serological tests being used hitherto, findings that may be also relevant to assessment of population-based infection attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 using seroprevalence that are currently under way. Our findings suggest that the incidence of MERS infections taking place in Africa is underestimated. These findings have implications for policies on global MERS prevention and control and highlight the need for attention towards camel-herding regions in Africa as well as the Arabian Peninsula.CKPM, JincZ, and MP designed the study.

For instance, the statistics released on August 28, 2020, indicated that there had been more than 24.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 835,000 deaths worldwide (Worldometer, 2020) . Worldometer reported further that, at the end of August 2020 in Nigeria, more than 53,317 cases have been confirmed, while over 1,011 people have died (Worldometer, 2020) . Despite the disturbing figures, it has been opined that the actual global incidence rate of COVID-19 cases is likely to be far higher than what the statistics show (Flaxman et al., 2020) .Being a novel disease that is highly contagious, spreading fast across the world, and the fact that there is yet to be an established cure for it, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of panic in every part of the world. In response, many countries have put up different measures, especially those upholding social distancing order, to slow down the spread of the disease. Although there is evidence of the effectiveness of quarantine measures to control the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or Ebola in the past (e.g., Twu et al., 2003) , the effect of restriction of movement and lockdown on socioeconomic activities across different countries of the world has generated different opinions about the impact on the general citizens (Goldman et al., 2018; Forbes and Krueger, 2019; Mbamalu, 2019; The World Bank, 2020) .From the foregoing, emerging evidence has implicated the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the mental health outcomes among different populations such as the healthcare professional and the general public worldwide (e.g., Ji et al., 2017; Brooks et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Olaseni et al., 2020; and Rossi et al., 2020) . Besides, the social-distancing and self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic place more challenges on the mental health and general well-being of the people (Mukhtar, 2020) . In addition, it is crucial to assess the mental health outcomes of people during a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic alongside the socioeconomic status and attributes of the people. This is because several studies have established strong relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and mental well-being. More importantly, low SES have been implicated in poor self-reported mental health including depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and psychological distress in adults and adolescents (Richter et al., 2009; Salami and Walker, 2014; Pappas, 2020) .Having a holistic understanding of the mental health outcomes of all members of the society, not only focusing on direct victims (patients) and healthcare providers in response to any major event, is crucial to the recovery of the people. This position was emphasized by the proposition of the Canadian National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health in 2003 that a ""systemic perspective, "" focusing on the general population and not just medical staff and patients should be embraced in addressing the SARS epidemic (Naylor et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, the literature shows that many studies addressing the psychological consequences of COVID-19 are focusing exclusively on either the healthcare professionals or the general public, therefore limiting the opportunity of comparison between the two populations concerning the mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 crisis.Furthermore, the situation in Nigeria calls for special attention because being a developing country where small medium enterprises (SMEs) contributed 48% of the national gross domestic products (GDP) that account for 96% of the businesses and 84% of employment (Public Works Corporation, 2020) , the effect of the present COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on socio-economic activities is likely to be severe on the well-being of the people, many of whom rely on daily income to cater for their personal and family financial needs. Hence, the significance of this study addresses that the interaction between socioeconomic status and mental health outcomes of Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be overemphasized. Specifically, the following objectives guided this study:1. To investigate the interaction between socioeconomic status of respondents and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 crisis. 2. To compare the mental health outcomes of healthcare workers with the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.This research was a web-based cross-sectional survey that was conducted via social media (Facebook and WhatsApp posts) using a Google form from March 20 to April 19, 2020. This was found appropriate to enable the investigators to assess the psychological distress experienced by participants during the COVID-19 pandemic without manipulating the variables of interest.A snowball sampling technique was utilized in this study. This method was considered appropriate due to the imposed restrictions of movement and lockdown in Nigeria during the period. Key persons (e.g., known healthcare workers or frontline staff, friends, colleagues, and those on the contact of the researchers) across each category of respondents (healthcare workers and the general population) were considered the seed in the study, and they were encouraged to disseminate the links with others in the same category accordingly. The online semi-structured questionnaire developed using Google forms with an appended consent form was sent through emails, WhatsApp, and Facebook platforms to potential respondents on the contact of the investigators. Those prospective individuals were then encouraged to roll out the survey to other colleagues or residents in Nigeria.Eight hundred and eighty-four (884) participants were involved in the current study. The sampled respondents cut across healthcare personnel and the general public. Healthcare personnel were 43.21% (n = 382), while the general public constituted 56.79% (n = 502) of the study respondents. Considering the gender disparity, the majority of the respondents were male, which constituted the 54.5% of the total respondents, while the female counterparts constituted 45.5%. There was a disparity in the distribution of geo-political zones of the respondents; the majority of the respondents were from the southern part of Nigeria, constituting 85.2% of the sample, 10.9% were from the northern part of Nigeria, while 4% were foreign residents in Nigeria. The disparity across respondents' marital status and level of education were also reported (see Table 1 ).Data were collected via an online self-reported questionnaire designed by the investigators. The questionnaire contained six sections related to the mental health outcome of health workers in Nigeria amid the coronavirus pandemic. The first section consisted of information assessing demographic attributes such as sex, age, religion, and marital status of participants. The second section contained the 22-item of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) (Weiss, 2007) . The scale was developed to measure the subjective response of an individual to a specific traumatic event, especially the response to sets of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, as well as total subjective stress. The IES-R is not a diagnostic tool but just a screening measure. The total IES-R score was divided into 0-23 (normal), 24-32 (mild psychological impact), 33-36 (moderate psychological impact), and >37 (severe psychological impact). Briere (1997) affirmed the validity and reliability of the scale. Cronbach's alpha 0.82 was established as the reliability coefficient for the scale in this study.Section three of the questionnaire was the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) . It consisted of 7 questions assessing generalized anxiety disorder. The items focused on the frequency of symptoms during the preceding 2-week period of COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. The GAD-7 requires approximately 1-2 min to administer and for each symptom queried provides the following response options: ""not at all, "" ""several days, "" ""over half the days, "" and ""nearly every day"" and these items are scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A score ranging from 0 to 21 is obtainable by respondents. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. Cronbach's alpha 0.81 was established as the reliability coefficient for the scale in this study. The fourth section contained the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale that has the potential of performing a dual-purpose of the instrument. It can establish the diagnosis of a depressive disorder and reveal the grade of symptom severity (Kroenke et al., 2001) . Statements measuring depressive symptoms such as ""little interest/pleasure in doing things"" were rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) by respondents as applicable to them over the past two weeks during the lockdown. PHQ-9 scores can range from 0 to 27. The scale has strong psychometric properties (e.g., Botha, 2011) and has been widely used. Cronbach's alpha 0.87 was established as the reliability coefficient for the scale in this study.The fifth section contained the Insomnia Severity Index; this is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. Participants were required to rate their sleep condition in the last 2 weeks as described by each item of the scale. Questions on the ISI cut across the severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. The scale is responded to on a 5-point Likert scale with a score ranging from 0 to 4, thus yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: the absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28). Previous studies have reported adequate psychometric properties for both the English and French versions (e.g., Bastien et al., 2001) . Cronbach's alpha 0.78 was established as the reliability coefficient for the scale in this study.The study was an online cross-sectional survey study. Only adults (aged between 18 and 78 years) who were either healthcare workers or Nigerian residents with access to the internet were involved in this study. Also, participants must be able to read and understand in basic English language and be willing to click the agree button to participate before having to access the survey. A link to the survey on Google form was sent to all participants. On receiving and clicking the link, the participants got autore-directed to the survey items. A detailed informed consent form was attached at the beginning of the online questionnaire and only individuals who gave their consent participated in the study. The data collection was initiated on March 20, 2020, and closed on April 19, 2020. The sampling technique utilized allowed the investigators to collect data from across various states of Nigeria. Eight hundred and eighty-four (884) correctly filled questionnaires were recovered through the Google form and processed for statistical analyses.The collected data were analyzed using the Statistics Package of Social Sciences (SPSS; version 25). The analyzed data responded to the two research questions stated earlier in this study. The analyses included reliability coefficients of the used scales, prevalence estimate analysis, and chi-square analysis.This section presents the results and interpretation of the data collected. The analyses of the interaction between socioeconomic status and mental health outcomes of selected respondents (healthcare personnel and the general population) in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were conducted. The results captured the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents as well as the interaction between socioeconomic status and mental health outcomes of respondents which are presented in Tables 1-3.Outcomes of the study (see Table 2 ) revealed that there was a significant difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms among respondents with different socioeconomic status (χ 2 = 04.05; df = 4; p < 0.05). Furthermore, it was found that the prevalence of clinical depressive symptoms was significantly higher among respondents with the standard income compare to those above standards and below standard incomes (61.5% vs. 22.8% and 20.2%; 95% CI, 0.63-4.60; p < 0.05). Further findings revealed that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among categories of socioeconomic status (χ 2 = 02.38; df = 3; p > 0.05). However, the prevalence of clinical insomnia symptoms was insignificantly higher among respondents with standard income compared to respondents with the above standard and below standard incomes (60.1% vs. 24.9% and 15.3%; 95% CI, 0.20-1.68; p > 0.05).Similarly, study findings revealed that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among different socioeconomic classes (χ 2 = 01.50; df = 3; p > 0.05). However, the prevalence of posttraumatic symptoms was insignificantly higher among respondents with standard income compared to respondents with the above standard and below standard incomes (48.3% vs. 43.3% and 47.9%; 95% CI, 0.53-2.98; p > 0.05). Insignificant difference was also reported in the prevalence of clinical anxiety symptoms among classes of socioeconomic status (χ 2 = 0.19; df = 1; p > 0.05). However, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was insignificantly higher among respondents with standard income compared to respondents with the above standard and below standard incomes (46.9% vs. 45.3% and 47.3; 95% CI, 0.49-2.83; p > 0.05).Another objective of the study proposed to examine the comparative analysis of mental health outcomes among the healthcare population and the general population was presented in Table 3 .Responses from 884 participants in the study (i.e., both healthcare personal and the general population) were screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and posttraumatic symptoms constituted the outcome of the analysis. Outcomes of the study (see Table 3 ) revealed that there was a significant difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms among healthcare personal and the general population (χ 2 = 14.26; df = 4; p < 0.01). Further, it was found that the prevalence of clinical depressive symptoms was significantly higher among healthcare personnel than the general population (35.1% vs. 23.5%; 95% CI, 0.54-1.03; p < 0.01). Finding further revealed that there was a significant difference in the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among healthcare Similarly, study findings revealed that there was a significant difference in the prevalence of PTSS among healthcare personal and the general population (χ 2 = 08.34; df = 3; p < 0.05). Such that, the prevalence of posttraumatic symptoms was significantly higher among healthcare personnel than the general population (52.6% vs. 42.8%; 95% CI, 0.85-1.52; p < 0.05). A significant difference was also reported in the prevalence of clinical anxiety symptoms among healthcare personal and the general population (χ 2 = 06.71; df = 1; p < 0.05). Such that, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was significantly higher among healthcare personnel than the general population (58.4% vs. 49.6%; 95% CI, 0.72-1.31; p < 0.05).The objectives of this study are to investigate the interaction between socioeconomic status and mental health outcomes of respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic and to make a comparison between the mental health outcomes of healthcare workers and the general public in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, our study revealed significant differences among the three socioeconomic status classes on depression only, invariably, this means that no significant difference was found among the three socioeconomic status classes on insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms and anxiety in Nigeria during the COVID-19. In detail, our study revealed that the standard income socioeconomic class reported almost two-thirds (62%) higher prevalence of depression as against the above standard income and below standard income class (22.8% vs. 20.2%).Consistent with our findings, various studies have reported the relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health during COVID-19, but there has been a disparity in the class that is most affected. While our study reported the standard (middle) income socioeconomic class having the highest prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, Heath (2020) reported 45% of the above standard (upper) income socioeconomic status class reported their emotional well-being harmed by coronavirus as against 34% and 36% from the lower and middle socioeconomic status class. Besides, contrary to our findings, Pappas (2020) suggested that people with lower socioeconomic status have a higher tendency to have mental health issues; however, the low socioeconomic level has been associated with death and high illness rates in several studies, regardless of the cause of death being from infectious or noninfectious diseases and indices for measuring socioeconomic status (Kaplan et al., 2007; Oguntayo et al., 2018) .The reason for our result could be associated to the fact that the standard (middle) income socioeconomic class in Nigeria is the largest socioeconomic group, occupying the wide inequality gap between the haves and the haves not. These individuals are mostly business owners (SMEs) and major salary earners from the private and government establishments; therefore, they are the most hit by the closure of businesses and lockdown in the country. Besides, there is speculation of a looming recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic (The World Bank, 2020), which has spurred some organizations to lay off staff and reduce the salary of the retained staff while so many have not received any salary since the lockdown in Nigeria. In this respect, Holmes et al. (2020) argued that serious psychological distress is anticipated from potential global economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic. This argument is substantiated by previous evidence linking the socioeconomic status of the people to their mental health outcome following the SARS epidemic in 2003 (e.g., Nickell et al., 2004; Tsang et al., 2004; Yip et al., 2010; Kanter and Manbeck, 2020) . These are valid reasons why this group may have reported a higher prevalence of depression compared to the above standard (high) income class who are mostly politicians and big industrialists that have no fear of layoff or reduction in salary and below standard income class.The unbalanced prevalence of depression among the socioeconomic classes in our study (22.8% vs. 61.5% vs. 20 .2%) confirmed the assertion of Kanter and Manbeck (2020) that a large population may develop inequitably distributed depression due to the stressors of the COVID-19 crisis. Fear of inability to feed, pay house rent, and purchase of basic safety materials such as sanitizer and mandatory nose mask to fit into the new norm have added to the economic burden of the standard income and below standard income class, thereby leading to the prevalence of higher depressive states compared against the above standard income class. Importantly, the above standard income class in Nigeria holds the economic power of the country and economic power translates into political power, thereby giving control of state structure into the hands of the above standard income class. Moreover, various studies have confirmed that mental health deteriorates in line with the level of socioeconomic status (Goldman et al., 2018) and economic recessions (Forbes and Krueger, 2019) .Our study further revealed differences in the mental health outcomes between the Nigerian healthcare workers and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In specifics, the prevalence of depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety was higher among the healthcare workers (35.1%, 33.2%, 52.6%, and 58.4%, respectively) as against the prevalence of depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety of the general population (23.5%, 15.1%, 42.8%, and 49.6%, respectively). The higher prevalence of mental health outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic can hereby be connected with their role as caregivers and essential workers during the pandemic. Interestingly, a similar higher prevalence of mental health outcomes was reported among healthcare workers in China caring for COVID-19 patients as against lower prevalence of mental health outcomes among the Chinese general population (Lai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .Healthcare workers are essential workers that have to care for the infected despite the impending risk during a pandemic, due to the duty and obligation to care. Compared against the general population that has restricted movement and discontinued working due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are required to be at work, despite the human-to-human transmissible nature of the virus, wear uncomfortable personal protective equipment, work overtime, and observe directly, the devastation of the virus on their patients. These experiences have a more social, emotional, and psychological effect on healthcare workers than the general population as revealed in this study. CONCLUSION This study exposed the prevalence of mental health outcomes among Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the result revealed a disproportionate prevalence of depression among the three socioeconomic classes, whereby the standard income (middle) socioeconomic class recorded the highest prevalence of depression. Besides, the prevalence of mental health outcomes (depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety) was higher among the Nigerian health care workers when compared against the general population in Nigeria.This study established the association between socioeconomic status and stress-related behaviors; however, there are still some probable limitations. The participants were relatively few; therefore, this result should be carefully generalized as there is a possibility that outcomes would vary if measured on more numbers of participants. Also, response biases which most times are difficult to eliminate in a self-report survey study like this might have affected respondents' opinions, thereby limiting the results of this study. All these shortcomings might have influenced this result and limit the external validity of this study.Looking at the results of the current study, these recommendations are suggested to alleviate the mental health challenges among the residents and health workers during the pandemic period:1. Federal and state governments in Nigeria should initiate a bill honoring the tele-mental health services to manage present and future pandemic psychological implications. This will help to integrate psychological and medical health services in the fighting against any disease outbreak in the country, especially when face-to-face appointments are risky. 2. Healthcare stakeholders needed to collaborate with psychotherapists in the management of pandemic or disease outbreak to regulate residents' emotions and that of self to promote wholistic well-being in Nigeria. 3. Stakeholders in government should pay attention to policy that will favor adequate palliative measures to cushion the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of residents in Nigeria. Also, healthcare workers should be considered for better remuneration and other economic benefits to sustain their well-being during the present and future pandemic.The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

Due to the importance of human-to-human transmission, social distancing and lockdown have been the control strategies adopted by most countries in the world (Adhikari et al. 2020) . In Tunisia, immediately after horizontal transmission was confirmed, the government (Tunisian Republic Presidency 2020) officially announced a lockdown on March 22, 2020. This decision caused a significant change in the everyday life of Tunisians: travel or movement restriction, suspension of work and studies (Tunisian Republic Presidency 2020), prolonged and forced contact between family members, reduced means of entertainment, boredom, loss of contact with wider social circles, and economic difficulties (Marques et al. 2020) . These factors might have led to the COVID-19 pandemic turning into a psychosocial crisis, in addition to it being a major physical health concern. Therefore, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic being a major physical health concern, these factors may have led to it becoming a psychosocial crisis. Violence against women is a public health problem worldwide and a violation of human rights (Oram et al. 2017) . During humanitarian crises such as wars, natural disasters, or epidemics, violence expands mainly to the detriment of the most vulnerable groups. The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown can trigger the onset of anxiety disorders and may lead to symptom exacerbation in those with pre-existing disorders (Chatterjee et al. 2020) . It is widely accepted that women are the most affected, given that they are known to have a more anxious temperament: This trait-like phenotype is characterized by increased behavioral and physiological reactivity to mildly stressful stimuli (Akiskal and Akiskal 2005) . In addition, several genetic, sociocultural, hormonal, and developmental factors can influence an individual's response to stress, and the biological role of gender remains a vulnerability factor to psychosocial stress (Wang et al. 2007 ). The aim of this article is to study the effect of the lockdown on mental health of Tunisian women and the possible impact of lockdown on violence against women. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health and violence in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world.Our research was conducted using an online survey, between April 25 and May 6, 2020, 1 month after the Tunisian government announced the lockdown. We chose a female social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. We initially selected five participants. Each one of them was asked to choose five women to send the questionnaire to. The other participants were contacted using the same method until data saturation was reached. Women were recruited homogeneously throughout all Tunisian regions to ensure a representative sample of the Tunisian women. The survey was anonymous. All participants were Arabic-speaking and living on Tunisian territory.Since the survey was anonymous, a message encouraging the request for help and breaking the silence in case of violence was sent to the respondents, to which a detailed reminder of the support structures had been attached. These contacts included the following: the toll-free numbers provided by the Ministry of Women, Family and Childhood, the contact information of associations specialized in providing care to victims of violence, the numbers of the police brigade specialized in violence against women, as well as the numbers of the emergency police and emergency medical assistance services. The toll-free numbers of the Tunisian psychological support unit (Zgueb et al. 2020 ) managed by volunteer psychiatrists and psychologists have also been made available for psychological first aid interventions.We used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect sociodemographic information (age, marital status, number of children, geographical area), mental health status (history of mental illness and eventual treatments taken), information on lockdown conditions (changes in working activities), and COVID-19 risk status (no personal risk, under quarantine, COVID+).The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) is a quantitative 21-item screening tool to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. The validated Arabic version was used (Ali et al. 2017 ). This instrument comprises three subscales.The depression subscale (DASS-21 D): with the following categories for the total score-normal (0-9), mild depression (10-12), moderate depression (13-20), severe depression (21-27), and extremely severe depression (28-42).The anxiety subscale (DASS-21 A): with the following categories for the total score-normal (0-6), mild anxiety (7-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), severe anxiety (15-19), and extremely severe anxiety (20-42).The stress subscale (DASS-21 S)-with the following categories for the total score: normal (0-10), mild stress (11-18), moderate stress (19-26), severe stress (27-34), and extremely severe stress (35-42) (Tran et al. 2013 ).The Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS) is a selfadministered 6-item scale that evaluates addiction to Facebook. Each item corresponds to one of the six central components of addiction according to Griffith's model: salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict, and relapse (Andreassen et al. 2012) . Each item consists of a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""very rarely"" to ""very often."" The validated Arabic version was used (Ghali et al. 2019) .The history of domestic violence and its types before and during the lockdown were assessed by yes or no questions.Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS 22.0). For qualitative variables, we calculated simple frequencies and relative frequencies (percentages). For the quantitative variables, we calculated means and standard deviations, and we determined the extreme values (minimum and maximum). Percentage comparisons were made by the Chi-square test. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Standard univariate/bivariate comparisons of continuous measures (ANOVA) were used to compare means. Pearson's correlation test (in case of normal distribution) and Spearman's correlation test (in case of non-normal distribution) were used to examine correlations between quantitative variables. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.Study participants were provided with the numbers of all social services and as well as those of therapists to contact if needed.Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Razi Hospital, Manouba (RPA 6/2020). It was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the 1995 Helsinki Declaration and its revisions (General Assembly of the World Medical Association 2014).We received 948 responses; 197 questionnaires were incomplete and thus excluded. Therefore, the number of included responses was 751. The age ranged from 18 to 69 years, and the mean age was 37 (± 8.2) years. The majority of respondents (69%, n = 518) were married (Table 1) . Only 38.7% (n = 291) continued to work during the lockdown (Table 3) . Forty-nine women (6.5%) had a history of mental illness (Table 3) , out of whom three quarters were on psychiatric treatment. Antidepressants were the most prescribed psychotropic class (72%).Anxiety, depression symptoms, and stress were found in about 85% of the women. More than half of participants had symptoms of extreme severity for the three axes of the DASS-21 scale. The DASS-21 subscales severity ratings are detailed in Table 2 .We found a statistically significant negative correlation between the age of the respondents and depression (p = 0.004; Rho = − 0.11), anxiety (p = 0.009; Rho = − 0.09), and stress (p = 0.002; Rho = − 0.11) subscores. We did not find any correlation between the number of children or the COVID-19 risk status and any of the DASS-21 subscores. The associations of other socio-demographic factors with DASS subscores are detailed in Table 3 .Scores of the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale ranged from 6 to 30, and the mean score was 16.49 (± 5.4). Forty percent (n = 300) of respondents might have Facebook addiction, as per the scale. A significant positive correlation was found between Facebook addiction score and DASS scores of depression (p = 0.001, r = 0.43), anxiety (p = 0.001, r = 0.39), and stress (p = 0.001, r = 0.41). We found that violence against women increased during lockdown from 4.4 to 14.8% (p < 0.001) ( Table 3) . Psychological violence seemed to be the most frequent type. Indeed, virtually all those who were abused (96%) experienced psychological (emotional) violence, followed by economic (41%) and then physical violence (10%). Almost 90% (n = 98) of those who experienced violence during the lockdown did not seek assistance. None of the women who experienced emotional abuse reported it. Violence during lockdown was associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and stress (Table 3) . It was also associated with higher Facebook addiction scores as shown in Table 4 . Women who were already experiencing violence before the pandemic seemed to have a higher rate of violence (73%) during the lockdown (versus 12% among those who do not have a history of domestic violence) ( Table 5 ).In this cross-sectional study about women's mental health during the COVID-19-related lockdown in Tunisia, we found that most participants reported a high level of distress symptoms (57.3% had extremely severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 53.1% had extremely severe stress symptoms). A problematic use of Facebook (and probably social media in general) was found in 40% of participants. In addition, violence against women was found to have increased significantly during the lockdown. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were abused during the lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Women who had been abused before the lockdown seemed to be at a higher risk of violence during the lockdown.Our study took place in the early phase of COVID-19 spread in Tunisia. This timing may explain why more than half of the women interviewed suffered from severe distress symptoms, since information about the virus during that period was still very limited. Similarly, in China, more than 70% of the population was found to have high levels of psychological symptoms when evaluated during the Level I Emergency Response (Tian et al. 2020 ).Uncertainty about the future and fear of the unknown had a negative impact on the mental health (Brooks et al. 2020) , especially as the pandemic has been going on for more than 2 months, at the time of writing of this manuscript. Several studies about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reported an increased incidence of anxiety, depressive and obsessive symptoms (Banerjee 2020), irritability, acute stress reaction (Mengin et al. 2020; Röhr et al. 2020) , fear of being infected, and infecting those around them.Response and responsiveness to stress appear to be different by gender. Because of several underlying biological mechanisms, women may be more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders (Verma et al. 2011 ) and might be particularly affected by stressful events ). Indeed, starting at puberty, the prevalence of major depressive episodes is higher in female subjects, suggesting a hormonal and biological role in the susceptibility to anxiety and depression (Elhai et al. 2020 ). Most of the time, the woman is the main caregiver and is more responsible for household tasks and for the care of children (Wenham et al. 2020) . This burden could have increased due to the temporary closure of schools during the lockdown. In fact, being a young parent, being a first-time parent, having many children, or having infants has been reported as being a potential source of exhaustion and may lead to parental burnout (Vigouroux and Scola 2018). However, our results did not find any link between the number of children and the severity of distress symptoms.Gender-based violence can be psychological, physical, sexual, or economic. The intimate partner was responsible for 40% of the cases of femicide in the world (Stöckl et al. 2013) . Studies suggest that an abused woman has a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (Mapayi et al. 2013) , attempting suicide, a higher risk of physical conditions such as physical trauma, sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancy, and low birth weight . Activists have sounded the alarm about the increase in violence against women during this pandemic (Campbell 2020) . The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) predicted a 31 million increase in cases of gender-based violence if lockdown extends by 6 months and 15 million additional cases with each 3-month extension (Bellizzi et al. 2020 ). As our results have shown, violence against women has increased significantly during the lockdown. In addition, we found that abused women had more depressive, anxious, and stressful symptoms than those who were not. Because of the lockdown, support structures for victims of violence were of limited access (Mazza et al. 2020) . The focus has been on the physical impact of the pandemic, often to the detriment of mental health. Those who were abused during the lockdown may have felt abandoned, with limited possibilities of assistance. In many cases, they had to stay in quarantine with their aggressors. Home, which is supposed to be a ""shelter"" from the COVID-19 pandemic, might have been perceived by these women as a source of distress and insecurity.Furthermore, we found that women who were already experiencing violence before the pandemic had a higher rate of violence during lockdown (p = 0.001, OR = 19.34, ). Indeed, according to the WHO, past tolerance of violence is a perpetuating factor of genderbased violence (Gracia 2004) . In our study, 78% of the cases of violence recorded during lockdown were de novo, i.e., women assaulted for the first time during the lockdown. In Tunisia, the Ministry of Women, Family and Childhood declared that during the lockdown, domestic violence increased seven-fold (Tunisian Republic Presidency 2020). An awareness campaign was carried out by the Ministry of Women, Family and Childhood and civil society. It included TV commercials, social media advertisements, videos, and informative texts. Representatives of civil society presented on the topic in the most influential television programs in Tunisia. Collaboration between the Ministry of Women, Family and Childhood and the Ministry of Defense was established, and the responsiveness of law enforcement and health care personnel to requests for help in the face of domestic violence has also increased. A detailed reminder of the support structures was attached to the survey of all the participants.In our study, psychological violence appeared to be the most frequent type of violence (96%). Almost all the abused women experienced it, followed by economic (41%) and then physical violence (10%). The large majority of those who experienced violence during the lockdown did not report it. None of the women who experienced emotional abuse reported it. As it is the case in many countries especially developing ones, Tunisia has patriarchal and religious societal norms conducive to the normalization of gender-based violence (Zgueb et al. 2019) . As a matter of fact, more than half of Tunisian women interviewed in 2016 said violence is ordinary and not worth reporting (UNFPA 2017).As seen in our results, women who have higher rates of distress are more likely to have a problematic Facebook Use. We found that 40% of our sample meet the definition of a Facebook addiction. Addictive disorders are a frequent comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders (Wolitzky-Taylor and Schiffman 2019). In addition, during lockdown, Facebook use scores appear to be higher among those abused as shown in Table 5 . To conclude, it seems that women abused during lockdown find refuge in a problematic use of Table 3 Association between DASS-21 scores and socio-demographic characteristics social media. Use which appears to be problematic under normal conditions may have been seen as a useful and protective tool from the COVID-19 during lockdown. No studies on the association between domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic and social media addiction were found; our article is the first to examine this association. A study conducted in China involving 908 participants of both sexes and ages overlapping with the participants in our sample found that behavioral addiction to telephone and internet use was noted in people suffering from depressive and anxiety symptoms due to COVID-19. However, the severity of problematic smartphone and internet use was not associated with exposure to information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors suggested that smartphone and internet use may be part of coping strategies implemented for the emotional distress secondary to this pandemic (Elhai et al. 2020) .The effects on mental health of emerging infectious diseases in the world over the last decade may give us an idea about the long-term impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This can be seen in the psychological distress and guilt that Zika virus disease has generated since 2013, and to this day in m o t h e r s o f n e w b o r n b a b i e s w i t h c o n g e n i t a l malformations (Tucci et al. 2017) . The same goes for the Ebola virus that emerged in 2010, and that generated post-traumatic stress disorder among the survivors in Sierra Leone (Paladino et al. 2017) .Since Tunisia's independence in 1956, the country's policy had been geared towards empowering women and protecting their rights. Nonetheless, and even though Tunisia is often praised for its remarkable achievements for women in terms of constitutional human rights (Megahed and Lack 2011), gender-based violence persists and continues to be a major problem rooted in the Tunisian society, as in most Eastern and Western societies alike.Strengths and limitations of the study To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence among women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world. It therefore provides considerable information in view of the cultural particularities of the region. This data could be used to establish appropriate intervention strategies. On the other hand, the possibility of selection bias should be considered as our sample method (snowball) could limit the generalizability of our results. In addition, we were limited to assessing participants who had access to the Internet and who some knowledge of computer use. Given the exceptional conditions of lockdown and social distancing, the snowball sampling strategy was the only one possible. Moreover, 80% of participants were between 26 and 45 years old, and 40% had a university education (percentage that is higher than official figures showing that 14.8% of Tunisian females above 25 had completed at least a short-cycle tertiary education in 2016) (The World Bank 2016). The characteristics of our sample in terms of age and education might hinder the generalizability of our findings to all women in Tunisia and in the region.To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence among women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world. It therefore provides considerable information in view of the cultural particularities of the region. In fact, it may be a sound basis for developing a more effective psychological intervention aimed at women in these regions. Strengthening strategies to protect women during periods of crisis is urgent. However, a change in mentalities would take more time to set up. Violence against women necessitates a fundamental long-term struggle and practical intervention strategies. These changes must emanate from within societies themselves and not be imposed in order to effectively change mentalities. This starts with education within the family core and requires collaboration between civil society and government to promote real longlasting changes.","Tunisia","abstract","2020-10-17",10

The implication for awareness and prevention","The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. It has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards. Starting with initial suspicions of animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and fomites [1] . The virus is caused by a new and more virulent type of Coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . As of 21 May 2020, the COVID-19 has affected 213 countries and territories around the world with about 5 171 936 global cases. Over 2 068 371 people had recovered from the disease, while there had been around 333 100 deaths [3] .In Nigeria, the first confirmed case of the disease was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus [4] . On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, involving a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen [5] . As of 21 May 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 4971 cases, 1070 recovered and 164 deaths [6] . The NCDC was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria's preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases [4] .Unlike infections such as the Flu and other agents, media coverage has highlighted COVID-19 as a unique threat, which further exaggerates the panic, stress and the potential for hysteria [7] . The mass media is considered a source of health information. They can help to shape the way people act and react towards health issues [8] . More importantly, the media help to create awareness and mobilize members of the public to cooperate with health authorities in the fight against pandemic at any given time [9] . The relationship between the mass media and the spread of disease is complex and mutual. On one hand, media reports about the COVID-19 may influence the attitude of the public towards the disease and enhance their selfprotecting awareness. People informed by the media reports may change their behaviours. They may take correct precautions, such as frequent handwashing, wearing protective masks and keeping social distances. Moreover, the degree of mass media attention to COVID-19 will inform the public on the severity of the outbreak. So it is no wonder that the mass media has long been recognized as a powerful force for shaping how we experience the world and ourselves [7] . To the best of our knowledge, studies that examine media coverage of COVID-19 is scarce. This paper is one of the first to study the content of Nigerian newspapers' coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak.The current study attempts to demonstrate media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. It also intends to ascertain if the media coverage is creating awareness and educating the masses on preventive measures to take. Focus was on four widely read newspapers in Nigeria: Daily Sun, Vanguard, Daily Trust and Leadership. This study is guided by the following questions: This study is anchored on the agenda setting theory. In 1972, the agenda setting theory was proposed by McCombs and Shaw [10] . According to Baran and Davis [11] , the theory opines that there is a significant relationship between media reports and peoples' ranking of public issues. The theory establishes a correlation between the rate at which the media cover a story and the value people place on such a story. This indicates that the media determine what issues should be considered more important by society [12] . This is accomplished through frequency of reporting, prominence given to the reports through headline display, pictures, layout in newspapers, magazines, films, graphics or timing on radio and television [13] . In summary, when the mass media allocate importance to an issue, it can influence the importance people assign to an issue, which can, in turn, determine their reaction to it. Relating this theory to the study, the prominence the media gives to COVID-19 can influence peoples' opinions and reactions towards the pandemic. This would increase their awareness and inform them about the precautionary measures to adopt. Thus, this work set out to examine Nigerian newspaper publishers' coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, implication for awareness and prevention.A quantitative content analysis (CA) was employed to study online newspaper reportage of the COVID-19 scourge in Nigeria. Four widely read Nigerian newspapers available online were selected for the study. The newspapers are the Daily Sun, Vanguard, Daily Trust and Leadership. These newspapers were selected because of their national reach and readership. Moreover, they were selected to represent the northern and southern parts of the O. D. Apuke and B. Omar country. Daily Sun and Vanguard are predominantly recognized in the South. At the same time, Daily Trust and Leadership are popular in the North. The coverage period was from February 2020 to April 2020. This period was selected because the first reported COVID-19 case in Nigeria was reported on 27 February 2020 and it became more alarming from March 2020 [2] .An online search was conducted using keywords including 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus in Nigeria', 'death rates of Coronavirus', 'intervention on Coronavirus', 'updates on Coronavirus' and 'pandemic in Nigeria'. The search in total retrieved 650 articles consisting of 'news', 'editorials', 'feature', 'opinion' and 'column' articles. For screening, the emphasis was on the headline and lead. For articles that lacked a lead (news analysis or column) the first and the concluding paragraph were read to realize if they should be included for the analysis. For inclusion, articles needed to report on COVID-19 in Nigeria; thus, articles on COVID-19 that focused on other countries were not included. Furthermore, articles that merely mentioned Coronavirus in the body were also excluded. By using these criteria, 309 articles were eliminated, leaving a final sample of 341 articles for the study (see Fig. 1 ).The unit of analysis for this study were news stories on COVID-19 found in the sampled newspapers news, editorials, features, opinion, and column sections. The categories were operationalized as follows.This refers to the newspaper outlet that could be Daily Sun, Vanguard, Daily Trust and Leadership.Coders checked the number of articles each sampled newspaper published in a month. Furthermore, the entire stories published between February and April 2020 were also ascertained. To realize the depth of coverage, the word counts for each article were noted and categorized as long, short or medium. For Nigerian newspapers reportage of COVID-19 example, news stories of 400 words above were considered long, while stories with 200-399 words were considered medium and those with length of 1-199 words were considered short. This categorization is consistent with prior research [14] .The text format was coded as 'straight news', 'features', 'editorial pages', 'opinion' and columns.The sources were coded as follows: 'Other Government Officials (i.e. ministers, senators, house of representative members and presidential spokespersons)', 'NCDC', 'WHO/United Nations', 'society (i.e. citizens, corporate bodies/agencies and business)', 'medical experts (i.e. Virologist)', 'victims of COVID-19 (i.e. recovered patients and those in quarantine)' and 'health sector (i.e. hospitals, ministry of health and pharmaceutical companies)'. When no source was mentioned, the newspaper reporter was judged to be accountable for the statements and was coded as 'newspaper reporters/ editorials'.To measure the tone of the news coverage, three categories were defined based on prior research [9] . The tone was categorized into 'alarming', 'neutral' or 'reassuring'. In general, a report was judged as alarming when the situation is defined in terms of risk and hazard. For example: 'NCDC raises pandemic alert level'; 'more Nigerians cases feared'. As such, warnings for severe outbreaks are alarming as are updates on the number of patients, hospitalizations and fatalities. The same goes for descriptions of the virus as 'extremely contagious' or 'deadly'. A report is reassuring when risks related to COVID-19 are put in a broader perspective that downscale the risk (also because of effective preparations by health authorities). For example: 'COVID-19 is not a death sentence; it is treatable'. Stories were coded as neutral when they contain both perspectives or when the tone is undecided.The themes that were identified in the coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria include: Data analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Descriptive statistics involving frequencies and percentages were run to describe the sampled article characteristics and to allow for a meaningful understanding of the data. The data collected were also subjected to ANOVA and Chisquare, set at 0.05 significance level. Finally, all data were presented in the form of tables for easy understanding. Table II To realize the depth of coverage, words per article was analysed and categorized as short, medium and long. Table III shows the average words per article. We observed that most of the stories on COVID-19 were relatively short, described using 1-199 words (M Table V sought to determine the sources of media reports on COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The intention here is to realize the most cited sources across the sampled newspapers.The results revealed a significant variation in the usage of sources (F(6, 341) ¼ 16.87, P < 0.001). The highest source cited was the NCDC (n ¼ 90, The total columns explain the number of stories on COVID-19 for that month. It has been shown that media sources could influence the tone of media reports [15] . In this view, In this section, an effort was made to realize the dominant themes in the coverage of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. As shown in Table VII Our study examined media coverage (February 2020 to April 2020) of COVID-19 in Nigeria with attention to the frequency and depth of coverage, story format, news sources, media tone and themes. With respect to frequency of coverage, we found that the media reported 341 stories on COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria between February to April 2020. During the first month (February) of the outbreak in Nigeria, the media had fewer stories. During the second month (March), there was an increase in media attention. Whereas, the third month (April) triggered a huge news wave. We observed that newspapers based in the Northern part of Nigeria had more stories on COVID-19, and a possible explanation for this could be because the northern part of Nigeria has witnessed increased cases of COVID-19. By implication, it could be deduced that the Nigerian media increased their interest on the reportage of the virus. A likely reason for this could be because the pandemic intensified from March. This outcome is contrary to a research which found that the Dutch media gave greater attention to the Dutch influenza in 2009, right from its first stage and less attention on its final stage [9] . In respect to the depth of coverage, though the Nigerian media had a considerable number of stories on COVID-19 outbreak, yet, most of the stories were short, suggesting a lack of in-depth writing to explain more about the virus. In the contemporary digital news environment, journalists are under pressure to deliver content quickly [16] , and this may be the reason why most of the newspapers had shorter stories. With respect to the story format used in the coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria, we found that more than half of the total stories studied were presented as straight news stories. This outcome is consistent with a research that investigated media coverage of Ebola in Nigeria [17] . We therefore maintain that Nigerian newspapers used more of straight news because they are more concerned with delivering the news on COVID-19 first hand to the public. Prior research has shown that news source plays a significant role in assigning importance to certain aspects of an issue [13] . In this view, we found that the highest source cited was the NCDC, followed by other government officials, health sector, medical experts (e.g. Virologists) and WHO/United Nations. In contrast, the society and victims of COVID-19 were sparingly cited. A probable reason for citing the NCDC more in the newspapers could be because they are responsible for controlling infectious disease in Nigeria. They announce new infectious disease, death rates and any other related cases including COVID-19 infections. We observed that the least cited sources were newspaper reporters/ editors themselves. This result is slightly different from Asaolu et al. [8] who found that reporters/editors and medical experts were the most frequently cited sources in the coverage of the Ebola crisis in Nigeria. We reason that there are possibilities that politics may affect truthful coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria since a large number of the stories cited government officials, such as ministers, senators, house of representative members and presidential spokespersons. Tobechukwu [18] stressed that the Nigerian media has been found wanting due to its active association with partisan politics.Regarding the dominant tone and themes used in the coverage of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the study found that most of the stories were alarming and induced panic with much focus on the increasing cases in Nigeria, death rates and concerns about Nigeria's preparedness. Only a few stories were reassuring and comforting, suggesting that COVID-19 is not a death sentence but could be managed and prevented when the appropriate measures are followed. The media might have focused on the alarming tone to increase the readiness of the Nigerian government as well as increase the awareness among the populace. However, public sensitization and education were sparingly covered. Ethics healthcare workers could adhere to received minimal attention. More emphasis was placed on death tolls and cases than proffering solutions. Though their efforts may be commendable, it is still inadequate given the fact that infections are increasing in Nigeria. It could be argued that the Nigerian media has created awareness of the outbreak but has not been very effective in reporting preventive measures. Drawing from the agenda setting theory, it could be said that the more the media demonstrate preventive measures to the public, the more they will see that as important. However, concentrating more on panic reporting may destabilize the public and create more chaos. This will increase confusion and public anxiety leading to adoption of practices just as in the case of Ebola, many Nigerians drank and bathed with salt water due to fear, which led to several deaths [19] .We conclude that the media in Nigeria paid attention to the issue of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the coverage was not in-depth; most stories were short and were mostly straight news. Longer stories accord a topic with a level of depth that is simply impossible with a shorter story [14] . Furthermore, the media quoted the NCDC and government officials more often. They also used health sector and medical experts as sources. Most of the stories were alarming and induced panic. Only a few stories were reassuring. More emphasis was placed on death tolls and cases of COVID-19 than proffering solutions. We contend that the Nigerian mass media has done well in creating awareness on the outbreak, but has not been very effective in educating the public on preventive measures to take. The Nigerian media, especially newspapers need to do more with regard to preventive measures the public can take to curb the virus. This could be achieved through increasing their attention towards informing the public on the pandemic mode of infection, signs, symptoms, risk factors, usage of face masks, washing of hands using hand sanitizers and social distancing. They should feature more articles, opinions and editorial to help inform and educate Nigerians about the pandemic as well as provide detailed analysis of the steps to take in curtailing the spread of the virus. The media should refrain from too much panic reporting to avoid putting the citizens in a state of panic.This research which is one of the first to examine media coverage of COVID-19, contributes to the growing body of studies. Nevertheless, there are some limitations worth mentioning. First, the study only focused on four newspapers in Nigeria. This implies that COVID-19-related stories on radio and television in Nigeria were not included. Future studies could extend this to examine both television and newspapers to obtain a richer data. Further limitation could be the time frame. The analysis only covered from February 2020 to April 2020. It is possible that there will be a change in the media behaviour as the pandemic progresses. The media may do better in the coming months. Future research could examine the coverage of media from April 2020 to determine if the Nigerian media improved in their coverage of the pandemic.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-10-21",10

It represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, mainly due to the high number of intensive care admissions, the prolonged stay of patients, and the increased mortality in the presence of comorbidities.Computed tomography of the chest has been proposed as triage and diagnostic tool for suspected COVID-19 patients. Although many parenchymal and extraparenchymal abnormalities have been observed, the presence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a rarely described lesion.We present a clinical case of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumomediastinum.We report the case of a 65-year-old patient who was admitted to intensive care for the management of respiratory distress and who has no medical or surgical history, with no history of cigarette smoking and not under any treatment.His history reveals an influenza-like illness, a fever at 39.2°C, arthralgia, myalgia associated with a dry cough, and anosmia with the notion of contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.On admission, clinical examination found a conscious, tachypneic patient at 24 cycles/min with O 2 saturation at 88% in ambient air and 93% under 2 L/min of oxygen at the telescope, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg. Moreover, the examination confirmed regular heart sounds and no audible breath, and there was no sign of right or left heart failure. Pulmonary auscultation found high-sounding gasps and sibilant in bilateral. e blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, PaO 2 of 53 mmHg, PaCO 2 of 46 mmHg, and HCO − 3 of 22 mmol/L −1 . e biological assessment found an aspecific inflammatory syndrome, with lymphopenia at 2400 cells/μL, C-reactive protein at 110 mg/L, and procalcitonin at 0.17 ng/ ml, a normal hemoglobin rate at 14.8 g/dL, a normal kidney function with urea at 5.66 mmol/L, and creatinine at 8 μmol/ L.A chest CT scan was carried out objectifying bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural ground-glass opacities, with foci of band condensation (Figure 1 ), suggestive of an infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Our patient gradually presented with dyspnea at rest with signs of struggle associated with moderate to severe basal thoracic pain, requiring oxygen therapy with a high concentration facial mask reaching up to 12 L/min. Front chest radiographs showed a stationary aspect of the lesions with bilateral reticulonodular opacities especially basal and more marked on the right side in connection with an interstitial syndrome.Faced with the nonimprovement of the clinical picture after a therapeutic protocol associating hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the patient received an immunoglobulin treatment at a rate of 1 g/kg for 5 days and then administration of two doses of tocilizumab 400 mg at 48 h interval. On the 16th day, a computed tomography of the chest was performed for a better study of the parenchyma (millimeter sections in high resolution with an injection of contrast product) revealing a spontaneous pneumomediastinum with no sign in favor of subcutaneous emphysema or pulmonary embolism ( Figure 2 ). e management of this rare complication was monitoring of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure with analgesic treatment for chest pain.e clinical course is favorable with a partial improvement in respiratory symptoms, and our patient is declared cured after 31 days and 2 negative PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken 24 hours apart.Since December 2019, a series of cases of viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus identified on samples of the airways named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan in China and quickly propagated all over the world. e main clinical signs during SARS-CoV-2 infection described in three studies by Guan et al. were associated with a fever higher than 37.5°C, a cough, sputum, and dyspnea, occurring in the first day of infection [1] . Also, myalgia was frequent, and digestive signs, which may be inaugural events, were also reported, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. e chest CT plays a pivotal role in the triage of patients arriving in the emergency room, and the most frequent characteristic CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia are areas of ground glass, multifocal, bilateral, and asymmetrical. e involvement classically predominates in the peripheral, posterior, and basal regions. Other atypical CT signs appear in the form of pseudonodular condensations, sometimes accompanied by an inverted halo sign [2, 3] .Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is rare in SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Only 3 cases were reported to date [4] [5] [6] . It is characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinal structures with no apparent cause (trauma and iatrogenicity).Physiopathologically a spontaneous pneumomediastinum is secondary to an endobronchial hyperpressure (effort with closed glottis) causing an alveolar rupture and then gas dissemination in the peri-broncho-vascular space up to the pulmonary hilum and the mediastinum [7] . e most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is acute retrosternal chest pain, followed by dyspnea, while subcutaneous emphysema is not systematic. Case Reports in Medicine Treatment is symptomatic, and no specific treatment seems necessary. Oxygen therapy is not systematic although it would accelerate the resorption of pneumomediastinum (absorption of free air by increasing nitrogen concentrations) [8, 9] . In the case of lung infections due to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causes the degradation of the integrity of the alveolar membrane because it infects type II pneumocytes. Consequently, the damage of the alveolar membrane due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be one of the mechanisms leading to alveolar rupture and the appearance of spontaneous pneumomediastinum [10] . Our case represents the 4th case described in the literature and the 2nd case described in Morocco. Two hypotheses could explain the mechanism of pneumomediastinum in our case: firstly, the coughing effort, and secondly, the spontaneous rupture of the alveolar partitions secondary to the alveolar and interstitial lesions induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.Spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a presentation rarely encountered in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 and can potentially be an aggravating factor in the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Indeed, the association of a pneumomediastinum and a parenchymal lesion extended on the thoracic scanner witnessing significant destruction of the alveolar membrane. However, the occurrence of pneumomediastinum in a patient hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia requires close monitoring of the patient.e data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.None of the contributing authors have any conflicts of interest, including specific financial interest or relationships and affiliations relevant to the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.","Morocco","first author","2020-10-19",10

COVID-19 manifestations vary from mild respiratory symptoms to severe multi-organ failure and death 2, 3 . Moreover, there is an increasing evidence that COVID-19 could be complicated by coagulopathy which may lead to death; especially in severe cases 4,5 .The viral infection, respiratory deterioration, and the use of central venous catheter may provide major risk factors for the occurring thromboembolism 6 . Likewise, the activation of coagulation and thrombo-inflammation with local vascular damage may enhance the process 4-6 . Among the associated complications, pulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported 7 .Studies showed different estimates for the epidemiological aspects PE with COVID-19. For instance, a study by Grillet et al 8 showed that PE incidence; detected by pulmonary CT angiography was 23%. Additionally, many studies showed incidences of venous thrombosis reaching up to 80% even with thromboprophylaxis [9] [10] [11] . However, the exact incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients is still not clear being based on few observational studies without large sample sizes. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to build a concrete evidence about the incidence and mortality of PE among patients with COVID-19.We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane's handbook of systematic reviews to conduct this study 12, 13 .We combined the following keywords and conducted our search: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""pulmonary embolism"" and ""venous thromboembolism"". We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles to be included. An additional online and manual search was performed on Google Scholar and Preprint Servers to ensure adequate inclusion of all studies.Results were imported into Endnote X8 (Thompson Reuter, CA, USA) for duplicates deletion.We included valid case series (>10 patients) and cohort studies including adults with COVID-19 with pulmonary embolism. Review articles, editorial, commentaries were excluded.The first author (O.H) divided other authors into two teams; each team independently performed title and abstract screening. Then, each team obtained the full-text of the included papers and performed full-text screening. Any disagreement between the two teams was resolved through consultation with the study seniors (A.E and I.S).The two teams extracted the data; one team performed extraction of selected outcomes and the other team extracted baseline data, then, data were revised in a cross-revision manner. Extracted data include author, country, year, study design, age, sex, total number of patients, and number of patients with PE, PE diagnosis, prophylactic treatment, and mortality rate from PE patients.We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) which is available at (https://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp) for assessing the risk of bias for our included studies. The possible scores of this scale range from 0 to 9. Studies with a score of seven to nine, four to six, and zero to three were classified as studies with low, moderate, and high risk of bias, respectively.The meta-analysis of the included studies was performed using OpenMeta [Analyst] version 1.15 for conducting single-arm meta-analysis. Meta-analysis for proportions was utilized to pool the incidence and mortality of PE in the groups. Dichotomous data were calculated to obtain risk ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I 2 test and P-value from the chi-squared test of heterogeneity. Values of I 2 >50and P<0.1 are significant markers of heterogeneity among studies according to Cochrane's handbook 13 . Random effect models were used to avoid the effect heterogeneity. The statistical significance was set with P-value at 0.05.We searched the aforementioned search engines/databases and found 1452 studies after duplicate removal. We excluded 1432 studies as they were not eligible for inclusion according to eligibility criteria, and a total of 20 studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1896 patients [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Figure (1) shows a summary of our search and table (1) shows the summary of the included studies.Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. Most of the included studies were conducted in Europe with only one report from USA. Among the included studies, the highest mean age was 73 years while the lowest was 60.5 years. Most of the included studies have a male predominance reaching 83% of the total included patients. CT pulmonary angiography was used for diagnosis of PE in most of the included studies.Among our twenty included studies evaluated for the risk of bias, all of our studies had a low risk of bias with score of six or higher (Table 1) .The results of meta-analysis including the 20 studies showed that the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 17.6% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 12.7 to 22.5%. There was significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 91.17%) which can be attributed to the variability of reported incidences among the different included studies (Figure 2 ).The results of pooled analysis including 8 studies showed that the mortality in patients with both PE and COVID-19 was 43.1% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 19 to 67.1%. There was significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 86.96%) as shown in figure 3 .We noticed significant heterogeneity while performing this meta-analysis. This can be explained by the different and variable estimates among the included studies and different settings and severity degrees among COVID-19 patients in the different included studies. It is also worth noting that most our included studies did not separate by the severity degrees and progress which prevent us from subgrouping in our meta-analysis.This study can be considered the most updated and comprehensive study to assess the incidence and mortality of PE with COVID-19 in a suitable number of patients. However, this study suffered from several limitations. The included studies were all observational retrospective cohort studies and case series and this type of studies has its own known limitations.Additionally, there was a wide variation among the reported items in the included studies which leaded to limitation in pooling more of the expected common data for analysis.To recapitulate, PE was highly frequent in patients with COVID-19 and observed in 17.6% of them. The mortality in patients with both PE and COVID-19 was remarkable reaching 43.1%.","Egypt","first author","2020-10-09",10

Globally, 9% of the world's displaced people are hosted in Europe, 12% in the Americas and 84% of the world's refugees live in developing countries [1] . Sub-Saharan Africa hosted about 26% of the world refugees [2] . Uganda, the third-largest refugee-hosting nation after Turkey (3.7 million), Pakistan (1.4 million) had 1.4 million by 2018 [1] . Many refugees besides suffering from physical injury, they too suffer mental harm [3] . However, little attention has been paid on the mental problems of the refugees.Forced migrations are characterized by traumatic events for the refugees during migration and after settlement. They are exposed to emotionally shocking stories, images of horror and pain. Besides, they have to adapt in the host countries, different culture, unemployment and uncertainty [2] . Earlier studies show that wars and violence are associated with a greater burden of mental problems [3] - [5] . For instance studies in Nepal and the Middle East showed that the refugee respondents had mental health issues [6] . Similarly, in the Karenni refugees, anxiety and depression levels were 42% and 41% respectively [7] . Refugees may experience multiple mental issues including Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety disorder mood disorder and depression [8] . Epidemiological studies on the psychopathology of war survivors depression is one of the most frequent mental health disorders experienced by refugees [9] , [10] .Demographics have often been examined as possible predictors for depression in refugee population but with inconsistent results [11] . Regarding age contradictory results have been produced, some studies reporting no association with depression [12] - [14] , while others revealed a significant relationship between age and depression [15] . In a similar study in Mexico among Guatemalan refugees revealed that marital status, gender and age were related to depression [16] . Marital status and gender were related to depression among Somali refugees in Melkadida camp [17] . In another study by Bogic and colleagues [18] , results showed that depression was more common among females, adults and singles. There are relatively consistent findings showing high levels of depression among females [19] - [20] . However, a study Haile and Samuel [21] found a higher prevalence rate among males than females, the results that mirrored those of Noh and colleagues [21] in Korean immigrants in Toronto.Depression is a widespread mental problem estimated to affect about 9.8%-67.4% of refugees globally [3] , [23] . Systematic reviews and meta-analysis on depression among refugees revealed variations in prevalence rates ranging between 5% and 80% [24] . One systematic review concluded that depression was one the mental health disorder among refugees with prevalence rate at 30-40% [25] . A meta-analysis reported the prevalence rate of 25-45% for depression [26] . A study in Cambodian refugees revealed that 52% of the respondents reported depression [27] . In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate is 20% for depression in refugees [29] . A study conducted in both southern Sudan and northern Uganda found the prevalence of depression was 48% among south Sudan refugees [28] . In a similar study among urban refugees in Kampala, results showed high levels of depression disproportionately affecting women [29] . Thus the already volatile situation of refugees becomes more traumatic in the face of COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic and the health-related measures to contain it have substantially created high levels of stress all over the world [30] , [31] . This unprecedented experience has multifaceted consequences for mental health and psychological wellbeing for the general population and refugees cannot be exceptional. It is now evident that COVID-19 has worsened anxiety in population leading to mental disorders including depression [31] , [32] . Therefore it is important to assess peoples' mental status in this exceptional period. Besides, early identification of the psychological disorder makes psychological interventions more effective.The mental health status of refugees in Nakivale refugee camp, Uganda during COVID-19 is still unknown. To date, there seems to be no study assessing the prevalence of depression among Nakivale refugees during COVID-19. Besides, although studies have been conducted on demographics (age, gender and marital status) and depression, the findings are contradictory and there seems to be none among Nakivale refugees. The settlement 109,815 hosts refugees and asylum seekers from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Eritrea, Rwanda and Ethiopia [1] . In an attempt to address the gap we examined the burden of depression in refugees settling in in Nakivale refugee camp. We asked: What is the burden of depression among refugees during COVID-19 pandemic and are the factors associated with depression?The survey was carried out in Nakivale refugee settlement camp located in Southwestern Uganda and hosts refugees from Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is one of the largest refugee settlement camps in Uganda. We conveniently sampled 146 participants from the camp that met the eligibility criteria for the study. Participants were included if they were 18 and above, those who were not sick and those who could speak at least one of the three languages-English, Kiswahili and Kinyarwanda. Participant aswere excluded if they were: below 18; were not a refugee; not staying in the camp. We obtained written consent from all study participants and followed all the guidelines and regulations set out by the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology for data collection during the pandemic as well as those of the Research Ethical Review Committee.PHQ-9 is a standard tool used to screen, diagnose and monitor depressive disorders/symptoms. The tool has 9 items whose scores range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day respectively). The 9 items represent the 9 symptoms of depression found in the DSM V [33] . In this study, we did not focus on the 10th question that identifies any subjective impairment of function. To determine the severity of the symptoms, we summed up the total of the scores of each item ticked. The categories specifying the severity of symptoms were as follows: Minimal Depression 1-4; Mild Depression 5-9; Moderate Depression 10-14; Moderately severe Depression 15-19; Severe depression 20-27. To determine the presence of a depressive disorder in a participant, we included any participant who had at least 4 symptoms that scored above 2 (except in item 9 in which any tick scoring above 1 was allowed) and either of item 1/2 or both had been ticked. We asked about demographic information including categorised age, gender and marital status of the participants. The survey questionnaire was administered by research assistants after being trained by a clinical psychologist on its proper administration. No modifications and changes were made to the questionnaire. The research team followed the standard operating procedure set out by Ministry of Health,Uganda and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology on collection of data in the field.We summarised the collected information form the questionnaire in Microsoft excel sheet which we later imported to STATA version 14.0 for statistical analysis. The predictor variables were age, gender and marital status (all categorical) while the outcome variable was depressive disorder (also categorical). We carried descriptive statistics summarizing the variables into frequency and percentages in a table. To determine the relationship, we conducted a bivariate analysis using Chisquare test of independence and Fischer's exact test (where values were <5 in a square) with statistical significance being set at P<0.05COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating challenging crises for public health in the modern world. Nations and different groups across the globe have suffered from a spike of agonizing psychological outcome including depression. In this context, the refugees are no exception. Thus this seems to be the first work on the prevalence of depression among refugees following COVID-19 pandemic. According to the analysis, the prevalence of depression in refugees is 47%, two thirds (25%) being women. This figure is in the range of study findings conduct in similar populations. In a study by Tamblyn et al., [35] 45% of the respondents were diagnosed with depression. Similar results (44%) were observed among Syrian asylum seekers [36] . However, it was far higher than studies conducted such as among Somali refugees in Melkadida camp (38.3%), Vietnamese refugees in America (20%) and Ethiopian immigrants (9.8%) [17] , [37] , [38] .In this study, females reported significantly higher burden of depression compared to males. Most studies globally agree that the burden of depression is higher among women (WHO,2004). Nasıroğlu and Çeri [21] reported that females were more at risk compared to males.The results indicate that of those who had depressive disorders, 78.3% had severe depression, with females constituting 42%. This prevalence rate is in tandem with results in refugees such as Central Africa, Middle Eastern, South-Eastern Europe and Southern Asia [41] , [42] . Bandeira et al., [43] reported depression in 74% of the refugee respondents. The systematic reviews on depression among refugees results showed variations in reported prevalence rates between 5 and 80% [44] . The rate of 78.2% however, exceeded the prevalence rates other regions in studies conducted before COVID-19 such as northern Uganda, Kurdistan region of Iraq, Syria, Mexico and Lebanon ranging between 20 and 60 [10] , [16] , [45] - [47] . For example in the study of mahmood et al., [46] the prevalence was 59.4 for depression. The high prevalence of depression among refugees in Nakivale camp may be attributed to the effects of COVID-19 and measures to prevent or mitigate it.The respondents' recruitment was restricted to only refugees who were in the camp, speaking at least one of the 3 languages-English, Kiswahili and Kinyarwanda. We may not generalise the findings to all refugees. Besides this was a cross-sectional study with its limitations thus a causal effect relationship is not possible.COVID-19 pandemic has caused several mental health problems notably Depression. The results in this study indicate high levels of depressive disorders among the refugees. Therefore amidst the pandemic, it is important to identify refugees affected mentally and given proper treatment. This study adds to the existing literature on depression by showing evidence of elevated rates of depression during COVID-19. The overall high prevalence of depression in Nakivale refugee settlement camp proves the need for the urgency of screening and treatment of depression among the refugees. According to WHO, depression among refugees needs immediate attention and policies to deal with it [1] .The authors extend their heartfelt thanks to the MoH for their support during data collection amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We would also wish to thank students of Lira University for their contribution to data collection and management.AK conceived the study. Both authors designed and conducted the study. LA contributed to data analysis. Both authors contributed to results and review of the manuscript. They too approved the final version and publication of the manuscript.We received no funding for this workData set to support the conclusions are available and a data file is attached with this submission.","Uganda","first author","2020-10-23",10

Now facing the pandemic, up to 6% of COVID-19 positive patients become critically ill and may develop CA [2] [3] [4] . The underlying cause of CA in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was mainly respiratory (87.5%) [5] , in a report from Wuhan, China, with the underlying rhythm asystole in the majority of cases (89.7%). Different factors predispose these patients to CA including hypoxemic respiratory failure, myocardial injury, ventricular arrhythmias, and shock [6] [7] [8] .As CPR stands out as an inherently risky activity that involves aerosol-generating steps [9] , rescuers must continuously balance the immediate needs of the patients with their own safety.Cardiologists, being front-liners, and usually taking the lead in CPR activity, had to have a scientific statement on how to deal with cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic.The statement contained herein is based on international guidelines [10, 11] as well as local expert opinion. As countries are at different stages of the pandemic, we do realize that there may be some variation in practice in different regions.Pre-hospital/emergency department 1. During cardiac arrest, first responders should don an N95 (or best available) mask.2. One rescuer should confirm pulselessness and nonresponsiveness of the victim and start compression only CPR (rescue breaths may be needed in children). 3 . He (or a second rescuer) must inquire about the possibility of COVID-19 infection of the patient, and the hospital emergency department (ED) should be notified in advance that they may be receiving a patient with possible COVID-19 infection. The query process should never delay any immediate lifesaving intervention.4. If automated external defibrillation (AED) is available, it should be used early as indicated.5. If the dispatcher did not provide information about the possible COVID-19 status of the patient, emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians should take appropriate precautions when responding to any patient especially with manifestations of a respiratory infection.In-hospital 1. CPR should (when possible) be done in a singleperson room with the door closed.2. Negative pressure rooms are an advantage, but rarely present in the ED.3. The room should be disinfected following the procedure.1. The number of providers present during the procedure should be limited to only those necessary for resuscitation.Personal protective equipment 1. Respiratory protection: put on a respirator or surgical facemask (if a respirator is not available) before dealing with the patient. N95 respirators or others that offer a higher level of protection should be used instead of a facemask when performing an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., CPR, endotracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation).Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is done in the standard manner, with the following precautions to minimize spread of infection to the staff and accompanying people: 1. When assessing breathing, look for normal breathing but do not place your face next to the victims' mouth and nose.2. It is preferable to pause chest compressions during ventilations to minimize the risk of spread of infection.3. Lay rescuers are to consider compression-only CPR, but may accept to deliver rescue breaths to children in addition to chest compressions.4. If available, it is advisable to use adhesive pads for defibrillation, hence delivering shock without direct contact between the defibrillator operator and the patient.• If intubation is needed, rapid sequence intubation, with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), may be used.• Proceeding directly to endotracheal intubation in patients with acute respiratory failure may be considered.• Avoid, as possible, procedures which generate aerosols (e.g., non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, nebulizers).• Ventilatory equipment should be provided with HEPA filtration for expired air.6. As COVID-19 patients are occasionally managed in the prone position to improve oxygenation, it is advisable that:• In the event of cardiac arrest in the un-intubated, prone patient, while wearing the correct PPE, the rescuer should turn the patient supine before starting chest compressions.• In the event of cardiac arrest in an intubated patient who is prone, it is possible to deliver chest compressions by pressing the patient's back (between the scapulae at the usual depth and rate of 5 to 6 cm at a rate of 2 compressions per second) while a team prepares to turn the patient supine.• Defibrillator pads may be placed with patient in the prone position either anterior-posterior or bi-axillary.7. Family members and other contacts of patients with possible COVID-19 should not be in the vicinity of CPR site while CPR is ongoing.Intra-hospital transport 1. EMS personnel should notify the receiving intensive care unit (ICU) if the patient has an exposure history and/or manifestations suggestive of COVID-19.2. The hospital path (including elevators) should be cleared of visitors before transfer.3. Transporting personnel should be donning full PPE.4. Avoid crowded areas and crowded times as possible. 5. Keep the patient with suspected COVID-19 separated from other people as much as possible. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the modified basic and advanced adult cardiac life support algorithm during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge in the development of the CPR scientific statement was to ensure that patients with or without COVID-19 who experience CA get the best possible chance of survival without compromising the safety of rescuers. The statement emphasized that during the pandemic, all staff should deal with any cardiac arrest victim presenting to the emergency department as a potential COVID-19 suspect and should use the appropriate PPE. CPR procedure should be done in a singleperson room with the door closed if possible, and the least number of necessary health care providers present. CPR is done in the standard manner, with precautions to minimize spread of infection and some modifications as prioritizing early intubation, and resuscitating intubated patient who are in prone position by pressing the patient's back to deliver chest compressions while a team prepares to turn the patient supine.

Users often contaminate these notes with several microflora including viruses, fungi, protozoan, and bacteria via unhygienic conditions and habits [1, [4] [5] [6] . Some of these practices and habits include nose-picking, coughing and sneezing on palms, applying saliva on fingers to aid notes counting, improper hand washing after using toilets, and storage of paper notes on contaminated surfaces [3, 7] .Historically, money was strongly linked to fatal infections like the ""Black Death"" or bubonic and pneumonic plague pandemics [8] [9] [10] . Currency notes, therefore, serve as fomites and vehicles for the transfer of microflora from one user to another [11] [12] [13] . Infection with pathogens through contact with fomites is widespread and more serious in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals get infected by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with pathogenic microbes while touching the eyes, nose, or mouth [14] .Infections caused by microflorae on currency notes are largely bacterial and many of them defied treatment with antibiotics [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Resistance to antibiotic treatment by some of these bacteria had claimed millions of lives despite huge investments and efforts to decrease the predicaments [20, 21] . is has a dire global health consequence and is incumbent to check the disease transmission and antibiotic resistance via fomites [12, 22] . Global surveillance showed there is a widespread antibiotics resistance [18, 23, 24] including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [17, 25, 26] .In Ghana, Mobile money (M-money) and Electronic commerce (E-commerce) payments for goods and services in the informal sector is very low [27, 28] . ere is, however, a gradual use (4.8%) of M-money and E-commerce due to some perceived risk issues and service charges [29] . Other studies showed that the majority of participants preferred cash instead of M-money to pay for goods and services [30, 31] . e Ghana paper currency (GH¢) notes are constantly passed on from one user to another with dirty hands, squeezed, mutilated, and kept on contaminated surfaces [32] .Earlier studies also reported that the GH¢ notes were heavily colonized by microflorae [1, 33] , with some being pathogenic [32] . ese notes, therefore, carried pathogenic bacteria that can infect handlers [34] and are resistant to antibiotics [35] . In Ghana, money is the most often and widely passed item from one user to another for commercial transactions. Meanwhile, pathogenic bacteria colonized our hands although adherence to effective hand washing is not observed by most Ghanaians [36] . Adherence to COVID-19 protocols among Ghanaians was found to be difficult. e mantra ""to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub"" cannot be overemphasized [14] .Infections with pathogens via fecal-oral route from fomites are rampant [37] . ere is, however, poor adherence to effective hand washing among many food vendors in Ghana [38] although cooked food is sometimes served with bare hands [39] , thus putting customers at risk of foodborne infections [40] .ere are several studies conducted on microbial contamination on GH¢ notes mainly in major cities in Ghana. ere is, however, paucity of empirical data on bacteria and their antibiotic profile on GH¢ notes in periurban Ghana. is study examined the microbial flora and their antibiotic activities from the Ghana paper currency notes.e study area was in the Mampong Municipal of Ashanti Region, Ghana. It is one of the twentyseven administrative districts located north of the region and shares boundaries with Atebubu-Amantin Municipal, Sekyere East, Afigya-Sekyere, and Ejura-Sekyeredumase to the north, east, south, and west [41] . e municipal is within longitudes 0.05 degrees and 1.30 degrees west and latitudes 6.55 degrees and 7.30 degrees north, covering a total land area of 2346 km 2 . e municipal capital Mampong is about 57 km from the regional capital Kumasi.e municipal population is about 88,051, out of which 42,653 are males and 45,398 are females. Agriculture is the main economic activity within the municipal and employs about 67.3% of the entire labor force. e climate and topography of the area are conducive for agriculture [42, 43] .is study employed a descriptive crosssectional design to assess microflora contamination on Ghana paper currency (GH¢) notes and their antibiotic activities in Mampong Municipal from January to May 2019.e currency notes included GH¢1, GH¢2, GH¢5, GH¢10, GH¢20, and GH¢50, which are the most widely circulated denominations. A total of 70 GH¢ notes made up of 15 GH¢1, 15 GH¢2, 15 GH¢5, 10 GH ¢ 10 GH¢20, and 5 GH¢50 were randomly sampled from different sources in the Mampong township.is study sampled only GH¢ introduced by the Bank of Ghana in 2007. e numbers of each GH¢ note were sampled based on the frequency of usage and volume in circulation.e study used aseptic techniques to collect each GH¢ note into a separate plastic envelope bag and sealed. ese notes were collected from grocery shops, canteens, commercial drivers, butchers outlets, and vegetable shops. e notes were obtained either by exchanging fresh banknotes for old notes or through a commercial activity. e study used a week to sample each denomination to improve efficiency.e media used were the products of Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke Hampshire, England. e study adopted the Oxoid standard protocol for media preparation except for selenite F broth. e media included plate count agar (PCA), MacConkey agar (MCA), mannitol salt agar (MSA) and deoxycholate citrate agar (DCA), Simmons citrate agar, triple sugar iron agar (TSI), selenite broth, and peptone water. Reagents were Kovacs and Remel BactiDrop Oxidase. PCA, MCA, DCA, and MSA were the media used for the total viable count, Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella-Shigella, and Staphylococcus isolation in that order. Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) was the medium used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test.Processing. Each GH¢ note was given a unique identifier. Both surfaces of the note were gently swabbed with sterile cotton moistened with sterile buffered peptone water (BPW). e swabs in their respective tubes with 1 ml sterile BPW was then vortexed to get a uniform suspension. e study made tenfold serial dilutions of each suspension for cultivation and identification of microbial contaminants. e GH¢ notes swabbed for the study were later cleaned with MAK SWAB (alcohol swab).International Journal of Microbiologye study used 0.1 ml of each dilution, and each dilution was inoculated into the right media and incubated at 37°C for 12-48 hours. e culture plates were then examined for growth and morphologic characteristics based on standard microbiological methods. Discrete colonies were subcultured on Nutrient Agar for biochemical analysis and Gram's staining technique [44] . Electronic colony counter was then used to count the total viable colonies, and the average counts were expressed in cfu/ml [44] .e study identified bacterial isolates using standard microbiological methods [45] . Gram's staining, colony morphology, and suitable biochemical tests were the methods used to identify bacterial isolates. For Gram-positive cocci bacteria with purple round shapes, catalase and coagulase tests differentiated staphylococci (catalase-positive) from streptococci (catalase-negative). Isolates of Gram-negative rods on MCA were further grouped into lactose and nonlactose fermenters. ese isolates were then inoculated into TSI, and indole test, citrate test, etc., were performed to aid identification [44] .(1) Salmonella and Shigella species. Colonies from samples pre-enriched in Selenite F Broth (DifcoTM) plated onto DCA with pale or colourless colonies with or without a black spot in the middle was suggestive of Salmonella, while colonies with pink zone indicates Shigella [44] .(2) Staphylococcus species. Colonies on MSA plates with yellow colonies with halo zone and colonies with pink with reddish-purple zones indicated Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Coagulase test differentiates between Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-positive) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS)) [44] .(3) Other Gram-negative isolates. All Gram-negative bacteria from MCA were subsequently inoculated in TSI and were incubated. Growth with acidic butt, acidic slant, and gas production without hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) indicated either E. coli or Klebsiella species. e two isolates were further identified by indole and citrate tests. Red ring formation on the surface of indole indicates E. coli. Blue colour change of citrate after incubation confirms Klebsiella species. An acidic butt, acidic slant, and gas production with H 2 S indicates Proteus spp. Alkaline butt, alkaline slant, no gas, and H 2 S production indicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa [44] .Agar diffusion technique on Mueller-Hinton agar (Kirby-Bauer modified disc diffusion technique) according to CLSI guidelines [46, 47] determined the antibiotic susceptibility. e inhibition zone standards for antimicrobial susceptibility were from tables of interpretative zone diameters of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [48] . e study tested 10 antibiotic discs of the most commonly used drugs to treat human and animal infections caused by bacteria. ese included erythromycin (ERY) (5 µg), ciprofloxacin (CIP) (5 µg), gentamycin (GEN) e analysis compared sources of currency notes using t-test at 95% confidence interval (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≥ 0.05), and comparison of means was done using Tukey-Kramer (Tukey's W) multiple comparison analysis.Formal permission was sought from the municipal authorities in Mampong. is study did not collect personal data from study participants. e study, therefore, obtained only verbal consent and approval from participants before sample collection.is study assumed that canteens, vegetable shops, butchers outlets, grocery shops, and commercial drivers were avenues in which currency notes are often exchanged and passed on from one user to another on daily basis.3.1. Results. Out of 70 GH¢ notes examined, 68 (97.1%) had bacteria contaminants. Table 1 shows mean total bacterial counts from different denominations on different media. Mean counts ranged from 3.2 cfu/ml × 10 5 to 4.7 cfu/ ml × 10 5 on PCA, 1.7 cfu/ml × 10 4 to 8.2 cfu/ml × 10 4 on DCA, 1.2 cfu/ml × 10 5 to 2.4 cfu/ml × 10 5 on MCA, and 1.2 cfu/ml × 10 5 to 2.7 cfu/ml × 10 5 on MSA. (10.5) , and 8 (6.5%) were from GH¢1, GH¢2, GH¢10, GH¢5, GH¢20, and GH¢50, respectively (p < 0.05). Table 4 shows antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria isolated. All bacteria were 100% resistant to erythromycin, 87.5% to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole, 75% resistant to vancomycin, 62.5% to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin, 50.0% to amoxicillin and ampicillin, while 87.50% sensitive to amikacin. In this study, nearly all GH¢ notes sampled had bacterial contaminants. is finding was very similar to earlier studies conducted in Ghana [51, 52] , Saudi Arabia [53] , and the United States of America [54] . Similar findings were also recorded on Iraqi currency [55] , South African banknotes [56] , Nepal banknotes [57] , and Nigerian banknotes [58] . GH¢ notes are largely used to exchange for goods and services on cash basis in the country [30, 31] with limited use of M-money and E-commence [27, 28] . e low usage of M-money and E-commence could contribute to the high microbial contamination of the GH¢ notes. is study reported high mean bacteria loads on GH¢ notes than similar studies conducted in Ghana [35, 52] and akin to earlier studies in Nigeria [15, 58, 59] . Other studies elsewhere reported high microbial loads on different currency notes that agreed with the finding in this study [60] [61] [62] . is study also reported mean counts for coliforms, Staphylococcus species, and Shigella-Salmonella species on GH¢ notes much higher than those in a similar study on the Nigerian naira [59] and other currencies [60] [61] [62] . e high bacterial load in this study could be linked to the rampant abused of the GH¢ notes especially the lower denominations which are often squeezed, mutilated, mishandled, and kept in unhygienic surfaces. e findings in this study further revealed that GH¢ notes of lower denominations were significantly more contaminated than higher notes, confirming earlier studies in Ghana and Nigeria [35, 63, 64] . Ghanaians are notorious at abusing and mishandling GH¢ notes with careless abundance and impunity. ere seems to be little regard for the lower denominations, and this may be linked to the high bacterial loads on the lower GH¢ notes. Moreover, lower GH ¢ notes are frequently passed on from one user to another in diverse economic and social activities with unclean hands, further contributing to the high contaminations [64] . Meanwhile, higher GH¢ notes are often saved in banks, more respected, and less frequently handled.is study also reported eight different bacterial species, of which S. aureus was predominant on GH¢ notes. Previous studies recovered similar microbes from GH¢ notes, of which CNS was most prevalent [35, 63, 64] . Money is the most handled and circulated item among the public making it prone to microbial contamination with a potential to cause diseases to handlers. In this study, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. were pathogens recovered from GH¢ [65] . ese fecal bacteria on GH¢ are an indication of lack of effective hand washing after using washrooms [36, 66] and unhygienic practices among users [67] .In this study, there was no link between sources of GH¢ notes and microbial contamination. GH¢ notes collected from meat shops, commercial drivers, and canteens recorded the highest numbers of bacterial isolates. GH¢ notes from meat shops were likely to be contaminated with blood, which is a good medium for bacterial growth [44, 64] . Commercial drivers often exchanged notes with passengers with unclean hands increasing the rate of contamination [1, 4, 5, 39] . Canteens are often patronized by many people where GH¢ notes are exchanged in minutes from one user to another with dirty hands [68] . GH¢ notes from canteens had all species of bacteria isolated, an indication that food vendors' hands possibly carried fecal coliforms and could lead to foodborne illnesses [39, 69, 70] . Customers with unclean hands could further increase their risk of contracting food-related diseases [71] . e prevalence of bacterial contamination was least on GH¢ notes collected from vegetable shops although vegetables are known to carry microbes [72, 73] .is study revealed that most bacteria isolated from the GH¢ notes were resistant to the widely used antibiotics [18, 74] .is has public health implications since these bacteria are pathogens that could easily infect users and would fail treatment with these antibiotics [75] . Moreover, many of these isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, which is a threat to public health in Ghana [76] . However, amikacin was the most effective antibiotic against these bacterial isolates on the GH¢ notes. An earlier study reported similar findings in Ghana [51] and other parts of the world [77] . ere is an increasing threat of antibiotic resistance due to excessive usage without prescriptions from a pharmacist [78, 79] .is study has demonstrated that the GH¢ notes are heavily contaminated with potential bacterial isolates that are highly resistant to the most widely used antibiotics and are a threat to public health. e GH¢ notes are overly abused with dirty and unhygienic hands contaminating them with pathogenic bacteria with the potential of infecting handlers. It is highly recommended that E-commerce and M-money should be strongly promoted to save the GH¢ notes from abuse and deterioration and the users from harm. e wake of COVID-19 is a testimony for the need to limit or avoid directly handling currency notes for the public good.e study met some difficulties obtaining GH¢ notes from the sources. e research assistants bought goods from shops to get the required denominations for the study. Some sources also suspected the team of fraud and trading in fake currencies and were very reluctant.is study has demonstrated that the GH¢ notes are heavily contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria that are highly resistant to the most widely used antibiotics and are a threat to public health. e use of E-commerce and M-money is commendable to use for goods and services to minimize the abuse and deterioration of the GH¢ notes.All data have been included in the manuscript.

The highly contagious nature and exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2, coupled with its potential for a rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has overwhelmed health care systems globally, contributing to the high mortality rates in early reports [1, 2] .The initial approach for respiratory support for severe COVID-19 pneumonia centred around invasive mechanical ventilation and the standard lung protective strategy recommended for ARDS [3] . This may have been detrimental to a proportion of patients due to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and associated systemic inflammation [4] . Furthermore, other strategies to improve oxygenation may be more appropriate in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who do not require ventilatory support [4] .High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is delivered by an air/oxygen blender, an active humidifier, a single heated circuit, and a nasal interface. It delivers adequately heated and humidified medical gas at flow-rates of up to 60 L/min, and is considered to have a number of physiological benefits, including the reduction of anatomical dead space and work of breathing, the provision of a constant fraction of inspired oxygen with adequate humidification and a degree of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [5, 6] . Although HFNO was originally utilised in neonatology, its use has extended to adult critical care [6] .The Western Cape Province was the initial epicentre of the outbreak in South Africa, which by early September 2020 was the country with the seventh highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide [7] . The ratio of ICU to hospital beds in the public health sector in South Africa is only~4% [8] . In April 2020, in anticipation of the rapid saturation of the existing critical care capacity resources, the two major tertiary centres in Cape Town adopted the use of HFNO, both inside the intensive care unit (ICU) and in non-critical care environments, in an effort to increase the capacity to manage patients with severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 [9] .To date, few retrospective studies with limited sample sizes, one of which is from a relatively resource-limited setting (China), have evaluated HFNO in COVID-19-related HRF [10À13] . However, to what extent HFNO is feasible in a more resource-poor, HIV-endemic, and non-ICU setting, remains unclear. Moreover, the predictors of treatment failure and the modulating effect of steroids thereon remain unclarified. We hypothesised that a significant proportion of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure could be supported with HFNO as initial support, thereby decreasing the burden on our healthcare system's intensive care platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the main aim of this study was to assess the impact of HFNO in avoiding mechanical ventilation in patients with severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. As secondary objectives, we aimed to identify potential physiological parameters or biomarkers predict HFNO failure, and assessed overall survival to hospital discharge.We conducted a prospective multi-centre observational study within the public health system in Cape Town, South Africa. The study was approved by the local ethics committees at each site (UCT HREC 295/2020 and SU HREC S20/05/001_COVID-19), and informed consent was waived in acknowledgement that the intervention was being assessed within the routine service. The study is reported in accordance with the STROBE statement for cohort studies [14] (Supplementary Appendix).The study was conducted at two urban tertiary academic hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa [Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH) and Tygerberg Hospital (TBH)], servicing a population of~4.5 million with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence [15] . Patients were enroled from the 19th of April to the 30th of June 2020. During this period, each hospital admitted~15À20 COVID-19 positive patients per day. At the end of the study period, GSH had admitted 1342 patients with COVID-19, and had increased ICU bed capacity three-fold to 55 beds, admitting 25À30 ventilated patients to ICU per week during the peak (all HFNO being offered in repurposed medical wards) [16, 17] ; at TBH, 1016 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period, ICU bed capacity had tripled to 45 beds, and~25 patients were admitted to ICU (both ventilated and for HFNO) per week during the peak (personal communication, Directorate of Health Impact Assessment, Western Cape Government: Health).Eligible participants were consecutive adult patients (aged 18 years) with severe respiratory failure, and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia [detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverseEvidence before this studyThe utility of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) for severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure (HRF), particularly in settings with limited access to intensive care unit (ICU) resources, remains unclear. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published in all languages up to 25 July 2020 using the search terms ""HFNO"", ""HFNC"", ""COVID-19 00 , ""respiratory failure"", ""ARDS"", ""ICU"", ""mechanical ventilation"", and ""outcomes"". We identified only 4 studies (2 in non-peer-reviewed preprint format) that evaluated HFNO in COVID-19-related HRF. The four studies together included a total of 312 patients, all were retrospective, and only one study enroled patients from a resource-limited setting (China). Significantly, none were from HIV-endemic or resource-poor (African) settings, and none evaluated the effect of steroids in modulating outcomes, which is now the standard of care.To our knowledge this is the largest prospective observational study to evaluate HFNO for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We showed that HFNO in combination is feasible and can successfully be utilised to provide respiratory support to a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19-related HRF. Moreover, this approach avoided mechanical ventilation even in patients with profound hypoxaemia. A higher ROX index measured at 6 h after HFNO initiation (ROX-6), along with treatment with steroids, independently predicted success. The majority of our patients received HFNO in a ward-based non-critical care environment, demonstrating the feasibility of HFNO outside of the ICU using affordable pulse oximetry-based monitoring.In a resource-constrained setting, HFNO for severe COVID-19 HRF is feasible and more almost half of those who receive it can be successfully weaned without the need for mechanical ventilation. transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on any respiratory sample] who were treated with HFNO during hospitalisation. Severe respiratory failure was defined as a respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute with oxygen saturations 92% despite oxygen at 15 L/min via reservoir bag, and/or arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P a O 2 /FiO 2 ) ratio<150. The decision to initiate HFNO was at the discretion of the treating clinical team based on a protocol for the stepwise escalation of oxygen therapy, and was contraindicated in patients with exhaustion or confusion. Likewise, the decision of the timing of intubation and mechanical ventilation was not protocolised, but determined by the treating clinical team, and guided by a composite assessment of respiratory effort, patient exhaustion, rising arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) or altered mental state rather than a single measure of oxygenation alone such as saturation or P a O 2 . Awake prone positioning was encouraged at every clinical encounter and reinforced by nursing staff according to a shared clinical protocol.Therapeutic interventions like anticoagulation strategy and the use of steroids (both physician directed) were also recorded. No other SARS-CoV-2 directed therapy was provided to any patient, either offlabel or as part of a clinical trial, at either hospital during the study period. The start of the study predated the preliminary report of the efficacy of dexamethasone by RECOVERY [18] , and prescription of corticosteroids prior to this date was by physician preference. After the 16th of June, all patients on HFNO received either dexamethasone 6 mg intravenously daily, or prednisone 40 mg daily, for 10 days.Heated and humidified HFNO was exclusively provided within the ICU at TBH, and within designated medical wards (non-ICU) at GSH where patients were cohorted. Patients wore surgical masks and all personnel were supplied with personal protective equipment, including N95 masks and visors. HFNO was delivered either by a Hamilton C1 ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), Airvo࣪ 2 (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Irvine, California, USA) or Inspire࣪ O 2 FLO (Vincent Medical, Hong Kong, China) machine. Flow was initiated at 50À60 L/min with FiO 2 0.8À1.0, titrated to aim for an oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) 92%.Demographic and clinical variables, and if available, contemporaneous peripheral blood differential counts and inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer and C-reactive protein) were recorded on commencement of HFNO. HFNO settings (FiO 2 and flow rate) along with heart rate, respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturations were recorded at 6 h post-initiation of HFNO. Using these variables, we calculated the validated ROX score [19] (ratio of oxygen saturation/FiO2 to respiratory rate) at 6 h (ROX-6) and modified ROX score [20] (ROX score divided by heart rate) at 6 h (mROX-6) score. For patients who were intubated before 6 h, the variables at the time that the decision was made that HFNO was failing were recorded. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a successful outcome (weaned off HFNO). Failure was defined as composite of the need for intubation or death whilst on HFNO. Of secondary interest were predictors of HFNO failure, and survival to hospital discharge (percentage of patients discharged home alive, or transferred to a rehabilitation facility, excluding patients still admitted and undergoing treatment).Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages, and were compared using Pearson's x 2 tests or Fisher's exact tests.Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviations, or medians with inter-quartile ranges. Non-parametric data was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. A CONSORT diagram reported the flow of patients in the study (Fig. 1) . The crude cumulative proportion of HFNO success was calculated. Predictors of intubation were primarily analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model, incorporating clinically important variables selected a priori for the model. The index date was the date of initiation of HFNO, with censoring occurring upon intubation, death, or the end of the study (30th June 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the software program GraphPad Prism (version 8, GraphPad Software, USA) and Youden's index was calculated to determine the cut-off that maximised sensitivity and specificity for ROX-6 and mROX-6. [21] Descriptive statistics, comparisons between parametric and nonparametric samples, and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed using Stata (V.12.1, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA) [22] . The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The first and last authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enroled between the 16th of April and 30th of June 2020: 105 (36%) were admitted to the ICU for HFNO, while 188 (64%) received HFNO in the designated COVID-19 ward (non-ICU). The median (IQR) age was 52 (44À58) years; 163/292 (56%) were males. Every patient was on via reservoir face mask at 15 L/min prior to initiation of HFNO; the median (IQR) ratio of P a O2/FiO 2 pre-HFNO was 68 (54À92). The median (IQR) duration of symptoms prior to treatment with HFNO was 7 (4À9) days. Comorbidities were highly prevalent: 134/293 (46%) patients were diabetic (with 79/134 (59%) having an HbA1c>8%); 131/293 (45%) were hypertensive, 153/293 (52%) were obese (body mass index30), and 45/292 (15%) were HIV positive (Table 1) . Therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg 12-hourly was almost universal (281/293, 96%), and 222/293 (76%) received steroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone / hydrocortisone dose-equivalent). Most patients (188/293, 64%) were treated with HFNO outside of the ICU. At any point during the study period, between 25 and 40 patients were being treated with HFNO at each of the participating hospitals.Successful treatment with HFNO was achieved in 137/293 (47%) of patients (Fig. 1) ; of these, the majority (128/137, 93%) were subsequently discharged from hospital. At the time of writing, 8 patients (6%) had been weaned off HFNO but were still in hospital. The median (IQR) duration of HFNO was 6 (3À9) days in those successfully treated versus 2 (1À5) days in those who failed (p<0.001 (Fig. 2) . Of the latter, time to intubation was 2 (0.5À5) days, whilst time to death on HFNO was 4 (2À6) days (p = 0.02).Differences in demographics, clinical characteristics and inflammatory marker profiles between patients with a successful outcome on HFNO and those with HFNO failure are summarised in Table 1 . The median (IQR) duration of HFNO was 6 (3À9) days in those successfully treated versus 2 (1À5) days in those who failed (p<0.001).*P<0.05 when compared to proportion of previous day for same outcome (Pearson's x 2 test). (Fig. S1 , Supplementary Appendix). 17/293 (6%) patients failed HFNO before 6 h, and had ROX-6 and mROX-6 scores recorded at the time of intubation. ROX-6 and mROX-6 were very closely correlated (r 2 =0.870), and both had virtually identical hazard ratios for outcome in univariable analysis (Table 3) , so ROX-6 was chosen for the multivariable analysis as it includes one less observation and is easier to calculate. In this model, only poorly-controlled diabetes (HbA1c>8%) (adjusted HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06À2.28), treatment with steroids (adjusted HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18À0.37,), ROX-6 score (adjusted HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33À0.54) were significantly associated with the relative hazard of treatment failure. The association between treatment with steroids and ICU setting was significant (p = 0.004), suggesting that the influence of setting on outcome was largely explained by the increased use of steroids in ICU.The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.75 (Fig. 3A) . A ROX-6 below 3.7 (cut-off A, maximising sensitivity) was 90% sensitive (true positives) whilst ROX-6 above 2.2 (cut-off B, maximising specificity) was 90% specific (true negatives) (Fig. 3B) . The corresponding positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (PPV) are shown in the table below Fig. 3 . The single cut-off that maximised sensitivity and specificity (Youden's index) was 2.7; the PPV and NPV at Youden's index was 72% and 73%, respectively.At the time of analysis, 10/293 (3%) patients were still in the ICU and ventilated, and 14/293 (5%) were still in hospital after either successful HFNO treatment or ICU discharge. Overall survival to hospital discharge for patients treated with HFNO (denominator excluding those still in hospital or ventilated in ICU) was 139/269 (52%), and mortality was 130/269 (48%). In patients successfully treated with HFNO, one patient (1/137, 1%) died after successfully being weaned off HFNO. Of the patients who failed HFNO, 111/156 (71%) were intubated after failing HFNO, and 45/156 (29%) died whilst receiving the therapy. Of the deaths prior to intubation, 26/45 (58%) died unexpectedly before intubation could be considered, and the remaining 19/45 (42%) were assessed as requiring intubation but were declined as non-ICU candidates due local facility protocols, or in a few cases, had pre-specified their preference not to be intubated. Survival to hospital discharge was 128/129 (99%) and 11/140 (7%) in the HFNO success and failure groups respectively (p<0.0001).This prospective observational study of HFNO for severe COVID-19 pneumonia is the largest reported to date. Our study showed that HFNO can successfully be utilised to provide respiratory support to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and HRF, and avoided mechanical ventilation even in patients with profound hypoxaemia. However, HFNO failed in just over half of our cohort, and the mortality in this group of patients who received mechanical ventilation was very high. Although these poorer ventilation outcomes may be the consequence of a patient population suffering from socioeconomic deprivation, multiple comorbidities and high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence, it also raises the possibility that persistence with HFNO in certain patients may delay the inevitable requirement for intubation, which could jeopardise clinical outcomes [23] . This further highlights the need for early differentiation of patients who may benefit Note: HR = hazard ratio; CI = confidence interval; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; mSOFA = Modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, ICU = intensive care unit; CRP = C-reactive protein.* Well controlled = HbA1c8%; poorly-controlled = HbA1C>8%. y ROX-6 used in adjusted model rather than mROX because of similar HR and diagnostic performance (see Fig. S2 , SupplementaryAppendix) with fewer input variables than mROX-6. z Best model fit obtained with inclusion of steroid use, diabetes (poorly-controlled vs. no diabetes), and ROX-6.from HFNO from those who will require mechanical ventilation, although in our resource-limited setting access to the latter was not unrestricted. We showed that a higher ROX index measured at 6 h after HFNO initiation (ROX-6), along with treatment with steroids, independently predicted success. Moreover, poorly controlled diabetes was associated with HFNO failure. Importantly, treatment with HFNO outside of the ICU, and HIV positive status, did not portend worse outcome. Most of our patients received HFNO in a non-critical care wardbased environment, demonstrating the feasibility of HFNO outside of the ICU. This potential to increase the capacity to manage severe COVID-19 pneumonia in resource-constrained settings has important implications. In settings where firstly, access to the infrastructure and/or expertise of ICU care is limited, or, secondly, transport of clinically unstable patients to a facility with a designated ICU is potentially hazardous and undesirable, HFNO may be considered as an appropriate mode of respiratory support. While adequate PPE is mandatory for all health care workers attending to patients on HFNO, evidence suggest that the risk of airborne transmission is no greater than the use of face mask oxygen [24] . The degree to which HFNO can be scaled up as a treatment for large numbers of patients with HRF would, however, be highly dependant on local oxygen capacity, the delivery infrastructure within individual hospitals, and the robustness of the supply chain.Evidence of efficacy of HFNO in reducing the requirement for intubation is consistent with previous studies, albeit in patients with HRF of other causes [25, 26] . A meta-analysis of 9 randomised controlled trials of acute HRF in the pre-COVID-19 era found HFNO resulted in lower intubation rates without affecting survival [27] . Preliminary data, mainly case reports and small case series, have also described its potential utility in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [9,10,28À32], and usually in combination with awake proning A ROX-6 below 3.7 (cut-off A, maximising sensitivity) was 90% sensitive (true positives) whilst ROX-6 above 2.2 (cut-off B, maximising specificity) was 90% specific (true negatives). The single cut-off that maximised sensitivity and specificity (Youden's index) was 2.7; the PPV and NPV at Youden's index was 72% and 73%, respectively. [33, 34] . The finding that ROX and mROX can be used as a prediction tool is also consistent with studies of early predictors of HFNO outcome in other forms of respiratory failure [19, 20] . We found that ROX performed equivalently to mROX, and thus favoured it, as it comprised fewer input variables. In a 2-year multicentre prospective observational cohort study of 191 patients with pneumonia (not related to COVID-19) treated with HFNO, Roco et al. found that 68 (35.6%) required intubation [15] . The prediction accuracy of the ROX index increased over time (area under the ROC curve 2 h, 0.679; 6 h, 0.703; 12 h, 0.759). ROX 4.88 measured at 2 (hazard ratio, 0.434; 95% CI, 0.264À0.715; P = 0.001), 6 (hazard ratio, 0.304; 95% CI, 0.182À0.509; P < 0.001), or 12 h (hazard ratio, 0.291; 95% CI, 0.161À0.524; P < 0.001) after HFNO initiation was associated with a lower risk for intubation. A ROX <2.85, <3.47, and <3.85 at 2, 6, and 12 h of HFNO initiation, respectively, were predictors of treatment failure. They found that amongst components of the index, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry/FiO2 had a greater weight than respiratory rate.A recently published letter from France (n = 62) [11] , two preprint reports from the same centre in the USA (n = 104 and n = 129) and a study from China (n = 17) [10] evaluated COVID-19 pneumonia treated with HFNO. They found intubation rates of between 31% and 66%, and that ROX (measured within the first 4 h) predicted success [11] . Compared to our study, there were several important differences in the published French study: the median ROX score that predicted survival was 1.5 times higher than ROX-6; time to intubation was much shorter (10 h), and ICU mortality was much lower i.e. 17%. The obvious distinction was the severity of HRF: the mean SPO 2 was substantially lower (90 vs 96%) and respiratory rate higher (37 vs 25 per min) in our study population.The main strengths of this study are the prospective, multi-centre design, the relatively large sample size with completed outcomes collected over a relatively short period of time, and the reporting predictors and outcomes within the context of corticosteroids, which is now the standard of care. The latter is an important point because it will likely impact thresholds for intubation and outcomes including death. In addition, we also clarified the relative importance of the different predictors including the components of the ROX score. It is also the only study from a population with high HIV prevalence, and the first report of the large-scale use of HFNO outside of a standard ICU. The compromise of providing non-invasive respiratory support outside of a conventional ICU setting has been made in other places (such as in Italy [35] À however, these patients were still cared for by intensivists in designated ""level 2 00 ICU beds).Some limitations of this study deserve emphasis. We could not adequately control for differences in physician experience and judgement around the timing of intubation. However, well-outlined protocolised provincial guidelines for intubation and mechanical ventilation, including score-based risk stratification (based on SOFA score, pre-morbid status, comorbidities and age) were followed [36] . Studies utilising composite physiological scores to determine predictors for the need for intubation inherently suffer from confirmation bias [19, 20, 37, 38] , as even if the ROX index is not formally calculated, the individual components (SpO 2 , FiO 2 and respiratory rate) are incorporated in a Bayesian-type reasoning by the clinician in making the intubation decision. Nevertheless, an objective measure that crystallises the current respiratory parameters, and can potentially reassure the clinician about the safety of continuing with HFNO, is still useful. Biomarker data was incomplete, thus reducing the power of the multivariable prediction model. However, this was a pragmatic 'real-world' study where blood sampling was clinically driven rather than protocolised outside the ICU. Our study was also not randomised (with a ""usual care"" as an alternative) but this would have been impractical given the scale of the pandemic and the limited intensive care resources. Lastly, intermittent proning was routinely performed, making it impossible to determine the impact of HFNO without prone positioning.In conclusion, in a resource-constrained setting where access to ICU care and mechanical ventilation is limited, HFNO for severe COVID-19 HRF is feasible and deliverable even in a ward-based noncritical care environment, and more almost half of those who receive it can be successfully weaned without the need for mechanical ventilation. Conversely, mortality in patients who fail HFNO is high.BA has received speakers fees from Novartis, and CK has served on an advisory board from AstraZeneca, both outside the submitted work.We gratefully acknowledge funding from the South African MRC (RFA-EMU-02À2017).GC, UL, GA, MGM, KD and CK were involved in the conception and design.

Since the outbreak in early December 2019 in the Hubei province of the People's Republic of China, the number of patients confirmed to have the disease and deaths from it increased at an alarming rate through time. 1 It was initially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. [2] [3] [4] Despite public health responses aimed at containing the disease and delaying the spread, several countries have been confronted with a critical care crisis, and more countries will almost certainly follow. 4 Major prevention methods recommended by the WHO include; regularly and thoroughly clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water, maintaining social/physical distancing, avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth, and different protection measures based on the situations. 5 It's very well known that the COVID-19 outbreak has placed unprecedented demands on the health systems of many countries around the globe. 6 This is expected to get even worse in the middle-and low-income countries where the health system is weak and fragile. In countries that are hardest hit, health facilities and workforce are currently swamped by activities related to controlling the pandemic. 6 As a step for the preparation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, African countries have established a Taskforce for Corona virus Preparedness and Response (AFTCON) that works in tandem with the African Union Commission, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In line with this and as a member state of the African Union, Ethiopian's preparedness and the health system's capacity to respond to the COVID-19 is no exception. 7 Ethiopia reported the first case of COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. The trend shows a dramatic increase in the number cases with more indications of transmission in the community especially in the capital, Addis Ababa. In Ethiopia, four months after the announcement of the first case, 7560 COVID-19 cases had been identified by 13 July 2020. While the number of cases that recovered from the disease was 32% (2430), the number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 127 (case fatality rate of 1.679 deaths per 100 cases. The government of Ethiopia has taken several measures such as shutting down of schools including universities, restricting the movement of people under a State of Emergency (stay at home), introducing chains of training programs for health workers, identifying isolation areas and hospitalization sites, starting screening tests at Bole International Airport and different engagement in mobilizing resources including equipment, supplies, food, money and educating the people about the disease and preventive methods, and so on. 8 In this COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to other interventions, timely access to accurate information and public awareness on prevention methods can be the difference between life and death. The stakes are high in developing countries like Ethiopia where millions of people have limited access to information because of low media access, insufficient internet penetration, illiteracy, and so on. 8 In this pandemic, when everyone should be aware of the risks posed by COVID-19 and, most importantly, be informed about how to protect themselves and their families and societies at large. Currently, as part of a national effort, Wolaita Sodo University has been engaged in different intervention packages concerning the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the activities is public education and information dissemination by using local media and other methods. But little is known about level of public awareness of the disease and its prevention methods. So, this assessment generates important information regarding the level of public awareness of the disease which in turn contributes to designing better mitigation strategies. Hence this study was conducted to explore the level of awareness and prevention methods of COVID-19 among Residents of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia.The assessment was conducted in selected districts (Woredas) of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Residents from Damot Gale, Boloso Sore and Humbo areas were included in this study. A qualitative study with a descriptive qualitative approach was used. This method is a naturalistic inquiry and it is the method of choice for this assessment since straight description of an event or phenomenon is needed. Community members engaged in the transport service, shopping, market places, hotels and cafeterias, governmental and non-governmental organizations and religious organizations were selected purposively. Maximum variation sampling was used. Maximum variation sampling is a type of purposive sampling by which the participants view on a specific topic amongst different types of groups will be explored. A total of 22 study participants, who were engaged in different service sectors in selected assessment areas, were submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 included. The service areas addressed in the assessment were; civil servants (4), traditional coffee (Jebena Buna) (2), religious leaders (3), motorbike drivers (4), trade in market areas (3), hotels (2), barbers (2) and shops/supermarkets (2) .In-depth interview (IDI) was chosen as the data collection method to capture awareness and practices related to COVID-19 by using an interview guide. The interview guide mainly includes, brief socio-demographic characteristics, awareness and prevention methods of COVID-19 and possible suggestions to tackle the pandemic. This method is useful to have as each participant has an opportunity to share feelings, perspectives, and experiences concerning the problem. A semi-structured interview guide which included socio-demographic components, awareness and prevention aspects of COVID-19 was used to collect data. Data collectors were health professionals with past experience and oriented on the study overview, objectives, participant selection, tool review and interview approach. The interview was audio-recorded by using a recorder. Interview data were reviewed periodically during data collection until data saturation 9 was reached, according to the judgment of the research team.Audio records were transcribed and translated into English and imported in to OpenCode version 4.02. A qualitative thematic approach was used to analyze the data. Data coding was done in each category by using the software. Once coding was complete, a code report was produced for each code, cleaned and prepared for synthesis. During synthesis and write up, meaning units were identified in relation to the aim of the study. Emerging meaning units that were extracted from each topic of the analysis were coded and then combined together to form categories, depending on their differences and similarities.Potentially eligible and interested participants received consent forms in their local language and were informed that their participation would be voluntary and there would be no personal consequences or benefits to participation. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. Confidentiality and anonymity was maintained when quoting research participants and the participants confirmed their agreement on publishing their anonymised quotes. This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants and a declaration of signed consent include the statement: I have read or had read to me the information sheet that explains the reasons for the study, and all about the group discussion that I am being asked to participate in, all the questions I had about the study have been answered. I clearly understand what is being asked of me if I agree to participate in this study. I also know that I have the right to leave the study at any time if I do not want to continue. I am aware that all the information that I give will be kept confidential. I agree and confirm my agreement on publishing anonymized quotes and take part in this study and I put my signature.This study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the College of Health Sciences and Medicine, Wolaita Sodo University, Ethiopia. Letters of support were secured by the research team from all institutions and offices where data were collected.Major thematic areas considered during analysis were awareness towards the disease, prevention methods and challenges and suggestions to mitigate the pandemic in local context and presented as follows.Most of the participants, 18 (81.8%), included in this study were males and the mean age of the service providers is 27 years old (Table 1) .Participants of IDIs were asked, regarding the disease COVID-19, about its cause and common symptoms. Accordingly, 18 of 22 participants indicated that COVID-19 is a new disease which happened recently, affecting all people in all countries in the world, transmitted from person to person and caused by virus. Participants obtained information about the disease from different sources; common sources of information mentioned by the participants include; radio, television, social media, health care workers, telecom messages during outgoing call, religious leaders and friends/neighbors. Four of the participants linked the disease with resentment of God on people and some others had a confusion with the term zoonotic disease.One of the participants who is barber explained the disease as follows;As I heard from media, radio, TV, religious institutions and mobile health educators, it is a virus which is deadly and has no treatment that transmits from person to person through breathing or by air during coughing. It is affecting Another participant from another area, who is engaged in hotel management service said; I heard the information from media and people talking about a disease called corona virus which I have not ever heard. I know that there is no detected case in our area but based on the information from media, cases are detected in other countries and Addis Ababa only in our country. Since then, I am practicing the messages told by health professionals for prevention from the disease acquisition. (Male participant, aged 30) Two of the participants noted that the disease is the result of the anger of God since people do not obey the rule of God and one of the participants who is a ""bajaj"" driver explained that; what I know is, it is the disease that came from God as result of our bad and evil acts, it has no drug to treat and the only option is pray to God to be protected from this type of disease. (Male participant, aged 28) Another participant from another site similarly noted that the disease emerged by the order of God and he shared the above idea by saying; I believe that, corona virus disease came from God because of our sin and we should pray to alleviate the problem and we should try to fight it by using all possible methods. (Male participant, aged 21) A participant from a similar Woreda emphasized to follow all the instructions from the government despite his strong belief in God for the reason of the emergence of the disease as well as solutions for it and noted the situation as follows; I recommend all people should kneel down for repentance. So far there are many evil acts we did, disobedience, homosexuality, genocide, ethnic targeted displacement, corruption, robbery and so many unethical acts. So, we have to ask forgiveness of God along with precautions from government. (Male participant, aged 52) One of the participants, who is civil servant in his occupation, said that ""it is confusing for me whether this disease can be transmitted from animal to human through eating animal products like raw meat since there are recommendations that avoid consuming raw meat."" This idea was shared by another participant from another Woreda and he pinpointed the situation as follows; "" . . . the disease can be transmitted via raw meat consumption so I think there is a possibility of acquiring it from animals"" (male participant, aged 28),Participants of the assessment were asked to reflect their opinion on common symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID-19; accordingly they forwarded their perspectives on symptoms of the disease and modes of transmission. Cough, fever, sneezing, diarrhea, throat pain, difficulty breathing and head ache were common symptoms of the disease mentioned by several participants. Based on the review of transcripts, participants indicated different modes of transmission of COVID-19, namely; hand shaking, hugging, sitting together, contact with droplets during coughing and sneezing, making contact with infected air and objects, skin penetration, and sharing clothes.Concerning modes of transmission, one of the participants said;The virus can be transmitted through contact, sneezing droplets, when we are sharing clothes with others, hand shaking, when we talking there are small droplets they may transmit disease, when we are close each other or sit together. These are the ways of transmissions. (Female participant, aged 29) Droplet inhalation and contact with the droplet was pinpointed by another participant and he said;Corona virus is a disease that can be transmitted from person to person via contact and also individuals might contract this virus through droplet inhalation. In addition to this, if a person touch different materials that might have come in touch with the virus, it favors the virus transmission in the developed countries and now a days, has also been health problem in Ethiopia. (Male participant, aged 24) Based on the transcripts of interviews, some participants emphasized that the virus can be transmitted via skin penetration after hand shaking or making contact with an infected person. A bajaj driver from one of study Woredas said;If we don't wash our hands, the virus can enter our body through penetration of skin of our hands. (Male participant, aged 18)The above concern was shared by another participant from the same town and he further elaborated the issue as follows;. . . at the time of hand shaking with the infected individual, uninfected individual can easily acquire the virus and at the same time it enters in to the body by penetrating hand, because it is very dangerous virus. (Male participant, aged 23)Hand washing, avoiding hand shaking, wearing masks and gloves, using sanitizer, physical distancing, general personal hygiene, holy water, consuming hot drinks, chili papers, garlic and ginger were identified as prevention methods of the disease by participants of in-depth interview. According to the in-depth interview participants, hygiene was described in different ways namely; washing hands every 15 minutes, taking showers five times per week, washing hands three times per day and using sanitizer, soap and water together. Two participants assumed the fever screening as a final technique that declares their status and feel a sense of security. Negative perception towards quarantine and isolation center was indicated by some of the participants. The following quotes describe different views as follows;As health professionals have been telling us washing hands every 15 minutes, rubbing with alcohol, avoid hand shaking, making physical distance at least 2 meter. (Male participant, aged 28)To prevent disease, keeping social distancing, we have been practicing social distancing in funeral areas yesterday as well as the day before yesterday. There were professionals coordinating this. Another is minimizing social life. Very important way is washing hand frequently. Using masks, wearing gloves in the office is important since we are collecting revenues. Avoiding hand shaking is another method. (Female participant, aged 29) A religious leader has briefed the importance of holy water to prevent the disease together with other precautions and he said;We make members to sit far apart, we order them to wash their hands and they use holy water without sharing drinking materials and I believe this is helpful to prevent the disease. (Religious leader, male, aged 31) Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comBased on a participant response, hot drinks and homemade prevention options were key to prevent COVID-19. She described by her own word as follows;. . . this disease has come from foreign countries, we are ordered to pray God in churches, in addition we are using spices and herbs like garlic, ginger, chili papers and hot drinks which are important to prevent this infection. (Female participant, aged 20) Based on the explanation of a participant, one time screening was considered as an adequate method to prevent the disease and he explained the issue as follows;. . . I don't know about it in detail but to prevent the disease as it has no drug, for myself I got tested for the disease while I was coming from Shashemene, as I knew my status there is no problem but I want to teach others to get tested for the disease. (Male participant, aged 25) A participant described how they changed their usual office set up and trend in order to prevent the disease, she explained the situation as follows;In our office, our work has forces us to have frequent interaction with the people since we are collecting revenues. Another thing that poses risk is money that we are collecting. We can't lock the job; because the revenue and tax that we collect is necessary for salary and other payments. With us there is finger print machine. Since many people are touching it may transmit the disease. Therefore we clean machine with alcohol after everyone is recording finger print and we are making the customers who use machine to rub their hands with alcohol. Another is; we have hand washing corner at the gate. Therefore everyone washes his/her hand before getting in to office. We serve the customer through window. We don't allow them to enter to the rooms. (Female participant, aged 29)Participants noted challenges like consistent availability of water, affordability of materials used to keep hygiene for the rural poor, keeping physical distancing in funeral area and markets, lack of awareness (particularly in rural areas), difficulty of avoiding usual trend of greetings like hand shaking in rural areas, not obeying rules and instructions, misunderstanding on lifting of some of the restrictions like allowing motorbike movement, stigmatizing people with cough.In this study, the participants were also asked for any comments and suggestions on the ways of preventing the pandemic by overcoming the challenges and minimizing its burden. The major suggestions forwarded by the participants include; continuous awareness creation, law enforcement and providing support for poor people. The following quotes describe different views and suggestions as follows;Still people are shaking hands each other in rural area, for example today it is market day, if someone caught by the disease, disease my spread to everyone. People salute each other while selling animals. They kiss each other's hand, to show their agreement for selling. Therefore, it is good to teach the community continuously. (Male participant, aged 38) It is difficult to prevent this disease in our area. For example motorbikes carries two or more customers at a time, they do not respect the rule. At rural area; people have no awareness about the disease. They don't know even as the disease is killer. Therefore, there should be intense teaching. Still there is gathering, sitting together. There should be continuous teaching. (Male participant, aged 32)There is shortage of soap; food ingredients are expensive and not affordable for poor people. Therefore, government should try to provide the supplies to the poor either as donation or by affordable price. (Female participant, aged 29) Government should force the community. For instance; motor vehicle ordered to use by maximum of two persons at a time. But they not obey this. Bajaj's do not obey too. Therefore they should be forced to obey the rule. Care should be taken in market areas and other gathering areas too. This is all that I can say. (Male participant, aged 45) . . . as I saw a great gap from both the government and the people. For example: Majority of our people lives in the rural area but they have very little information about the disease so the government must address every kebele and each home. In addition to that as you know a lot of people are very poor and they obtain their expense from day to day activity so the government must support those in need. (Male participant, aged 23) Sometimes peoples are not happy when you ignore hand shaking, they became emotional and respond aggressively. Most of the time they said you didn't believe in God that is why you develop fear for the disease he protects us. so, this need attention. On the other hand, there is no enough water for hand washing in every part of the city it is limited to some special areas that may contribute for the spread of the disease. The most important thing that must need attention was people living in the rural area because there is no or little information about the virus because they lack mass media but majority of people are there, so the government must address this problem. In addition to this almost all the materials needed for protective purpose are in a very small amount or not at all. Please as you said you are coming from university please try to solve this scarcity. (Female participant, aged 23)This quick assessment aimed to explore the level of awareness and prevention methods of COVID-19 among residents of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. The participants were civil servants, religious leaders, motorbike/bajaj drivers, merchants, hotel/café workers, barbers and people working in shops/supermarkets. The findings revealed that almost all of the participants heard about the disease COVID-19 and based on their expression it is viral disease affecting everybody in all countries in the world and transmitted from person to person.Some participants linked the disease with resentment of God on people and they strongly believe in praying to God to be protected from the disease. The implication of this finding is, it is still essential to provide necessary education for the community in order not to neglect all necessary prevention methods of the disease while praying to God which is well recognized by Ethiopian government and currently it is included in the national television broadcasting program.Some others had confusion with whether the disease is transmitted from animal to human because of advice like avoiding raw meat and other raw products. This shows the need for detail while educating people about the disease.Findings from this assessment showed that most participants realized common modes of transmission of the disease, like contact with droplets during coughing and sneezing, making contact with infected air and objects via hands and so on, but some participants considered that the disease can be transmitted via skin penetration and this is also an important area that should be addressed during the education program.The assessment reveals that most participants got information from different sources and they had awareness of common symptoms of COVID-19. The findings showed several participants mentioned methods of prevention of the disease as per the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) but some of the participants rely on consuming hot drinks, ginger or garlic to prevent the disease and giving them a sense of security, and this needs a precaution since these things are not scientifically proven prevention methods for COVID-19 so far.In addition, issues like negative attitudes towards quarantine and isolation centers, stigmatizing people with a cough, considering screening by measuring temperature as a final result of their COVID-19 status were documented in this assessment. So, it is helpful to consider these points during awareness creation and health education to mitigate the pandemic since issues like stigma and fear of isolation centers may prevent people from reporting the symptoms of the disease and this can create favorable grounds for the transmission.To ensure credibility of the findings in this study, data collectors who are very familiar with the study area were selected and trained. Dependability refers to whether the findings of this study may be repeated in other places by other researchers and the study tools are available on request for others to do, consistently. Transferability is the term used to refer to the external validity in qualitative studies, the study addressed different areas of the Zone and service sectors and the finding is applicable in similar socio-cultural settings.This assessment has some limitations. Although the study sites were drawn from 3 different Districts of the Wolaita Zone, the relative numbers of recruitment locations within these Districts were few and not necessarily representative of the entire rural community. The overall number of respondents, though limited by available resources and time, was in line with similar qualitative quick assessments of this type.Generally, most of the interviewed participants indicated that COVID-19 is a newly emerged viral disease, affecting all people in all countries in the world, transmitted from person to person. Some participants linked the disease with the anger of God on people and some others had confusion with zoonotic diseases.Most participants mentioned common symptoms of the disease. Participants indicated different modes of transmission of COVID-19, explicitly; hand shaking, hugging, sitting together, contact with droplets during coughing and sneezing, making contact with infected air and objects, skin penetration, and sharing clothes.Hand washing, avoiding hand shaking, wearing masks and gloves, using sanitizer, physical distancing, general Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress personal hygiene, holy water, consuming hot drinks, chili papers, garlic and ginger were identified as prevention methods of the disease by participants of the in-depth interview.Some participants assumed that screening by measuring temperature as a final technique that declares their status and felt a sense of security.

A local COVID-19 prevention taskforce should regularly attend events like funerals and markets to facilitate physical/social distancing (this may include health care workers, religious leaders, community leaders, security and so on).","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-28",10

But according to studies, the COVID-19 disease could present with different symptoms and signs. Regarding the spectrum of symptoms, studies show that the presentation spectrum could range from having no symptoms at all while being infected (asymptomatic cases) to different types of one or more symptoms. Respiratory and constitutional symptoms are reported to be the commonest presentation in most setups [2] [3] [4] .Also, atypical presentations like hyposmia, hypogeusia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sputum, cerebrovascular accidents, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are reported. These atypical symptoms are reported to be observed in the majority of patients in a study conducted in Europe but only in few patients in the United States making it difficult to generalize these symptoms as atypical for all setups [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .Studies about what determines becoming symptomatic are lacking but different studies and reports point that acquiring the disease, developing symptomatic infection, having severe disease and bad prognosis shows a difference in terms of sex showing that the male sex is more vulnerable to worse conditions. Different explanations are given starting from the genetic level up to behavioral factors that could cause men to be more susceptible to the disease [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .Studies including the ones conducted in our center showed that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis rather than other symptoms or have no symptoms at all. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide a better preventive practice and stratified patient management and follow up. But there is no such study conducted in the study area.The study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Institution based case-control study design was employed.The source population was all patients admitted to MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using RT-PCR by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health 16 .-Case (symptomatic): all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the MCCC and who presented with one or more symptoms at admission and during the clinical course of the disease. -Control (asymptomatic): all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the MCCC and who did not have any symptoms during the clinical course of the disease.The study population was all selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at MCCC and who full fill the inclusion criteria.The sample size was determined using sample size calculation for a case-control study with the following assumptions; 95% confidence interval, power of 90%, one to one ratio of cases and controls, the proportion of males who are symptomatic as 0.85, and proportion of females who are asymptomatic as 0.75 and considering a non-response rate of 10%. Therefore, the total sample size calculated becomes 778 cases of COVID-19 (389 symptomatic and 389 asymptomatic).To select both the cases and the controls, simple random sampling method was used.All COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at MCCC and whose clinical history regarding presenting symptom and symptoms developed during the clinical course of the disease is well documented were included.A data abstraction tool to pick all the relevant variables was drafted based on the patient registration and follow-up form and then pretested on 5% of randomly selected charts which were not included in the final data collection. The final data abstraction tool was then developed after modification based on the pretest. Data was collected by six trained General practitioners.Data consistency and completeness were checked before an attempt was made to enter the code and analyze the data.The extracted data were coded, entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned, stored, and exported to SPSS version 25.0 software for analysis. Categorical covariates were summarized using frequencies and percentages and numerical variables were summarized with a mean value. A chi-square test (Fischer's exact test for those variables that do not meet the chi-square test assumptions) and an independent t-test were run to determine the presence of a significant difference between the independent variables and the developmentof symptom. The assumptions of the chi-square test, that no cell should have an expected frequency of less than 5, and the assumptions of t-test, normal distribution, and equality of variance, were checked before the analysis, and all assumptions were met. A statistically significant difference was detected for variables with a P-value of ≤ 0.05.The association between the dependent variable and independent variables was analyzed using multivariable Binary Logistic Regression. Univariate analysis was done at a 25% level of significance to screen out independent variables used in the multiple Binary Logistic regression model. The adequacy of the final model was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test and the final model fitted the data well (x 2 (7)=6.298 and p-value = 0.505). For the Binary Logistic regression, a 95% confidence interval for AOR was calculated and variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with the development of symptoms (Symptomatic Vs Asymptomatic).Univariate analysis at 25% level of significance was conducted and age group, sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus history were found to be significantly associated with the development of symptoms.On the multivariable binary logistic regression, age group, sex, and diabetes mellitus were found to be significantly associated with the development of symptoms at 5% level of significance.Regarding the history of pre-existing co-morbid illness, the odds of developing symptomatic disease among diabetic patients was 2.368 times compared to patients with no such illness (AOR= 2.368, 95% CI= 1.364, 4.111, p-value=0.002). ( Table 3) On the multivariable binary logistic regression; age group, sex, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with the development of symptoms.Older age was found to be a significant factor that affects the development of symptomatic COVID-19. Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of developing symptoms were more likely among patients in the age range of 30 years and above compared with those patients < 30 years old. The odds are higher (more than four times) for those patients 50 years and above. That means older age groups are more susceptible to developing symptomatic disease once they are infected. This could be because, as it is already known, the body's immune defense mechanism tends to get weaker with age making aged people more susceptible to severe disease and worse outcomes from both infectious and non-infectious diseases. This is especially compounded by the presence of other underlying conditions (comorbidities) which are highly likely to be developed as someone gets older. The participants included in the study have also a significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbid illnesses that can be attributed to the increased odds of developing symptomatic disease [17] [18] [19] [20] .Male sex was associated with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. The odd of having symptomatic COVID-19 among males was 1.672 times than female patients. This disparity in sex in terms of symptoms and also acquiring the disease, having a more severe disease course, and worse outcome is observed in many countries with reports showing that a significantly higher proportion of men are getting hospitalized and dying from the disease compared to females. Different explanations have been given to the disparity, from genetics up to behavioral factors as contributors. Studies show that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is found to be a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 is found to be present in high concentration among males, which makes them vulnerable to have a more severe disease pattern and worse outcome [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . It is also hypothesized that men might not be as good as women in terms of taking necessary precautions to prevent acquiring the disease and also in seeking early medical attention if they get infected and become symptomatic. Understanding these modifiable behavioral factors is important to provide intervention to decrease severe disease and worse outcomes in men.Developing a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was found to be determined by the following factors; old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention, including inpatient management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have a favorable treatment outcome. In addition, further study should be conducted to assess the role of behavioral factors as a cause of the disease course disparity between the two sexes, so that intervention can be made on the identified modifiable behaviors.The study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants. The study had no risk/negative consequence on those who participated in the study. Medical record numbers were used for data collection and personal identifiers were not used in the research report. Access to the collected information was limited to the principal investigator and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-10-13",10

As COVID-19 continues to spread in Africa, health resources have been diverted to focus on general population needs rather than the specific needs of vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and their children. These modifications in resource allocation may cause an increase in maternal and newborn deaths [1] . Given the high burden of maternal and neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, there is an urgent need for innovative strategies to prevent the deterioration of maternal and child outcomes in already strained health systems.Limited information is available about the pathophysiological effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women. However, emerging evidence indicates that pregnant women are not at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness than other population groups [2, 3] . To date, most reports of COVID-19 cases in pregnancy were either asymptomatic or self-limiting pneumonia [4] . Nevertheless, immunological and physiological adaptations during pregnancy could make women more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general populace [5] . Furthermore, there have been reports of severe illness among pregnant women with comorbidities, such as diabetes [6] . In addition, previous human coronaviruses (e.g. pandemic influenza and SARS) were associated with increased maternal and neonatal deaths [7, 8] .Although pregnancy is ordinarily considered a normal physiological and developmental milestone, the increased stress women can experience during public emergencies may result in preterm birth, low birth weight, and other high-risk conditions. Recent reports from China [3, 9] and the United States of America [10] showed that a majority of pregnant women that were positive for COVID-19 delivered via caesarean section because of foetal distress [11] . There is limited evidence concerning the possible maternal-foetal transmission and neonatal infection, and case reports have described COVID-19 in healthy newborns as a mild self-limiting disease [3, 4, 12] .Scientists and public health officials are accelerating efforts to prevent, treat, and control COVID-19. However, minimising exposure to SARS-CoV-2 remains the only stratagem to reduce the risk of infection. Social isolation presents additional challenges, as current maternal and child health (MCH) guidelines advocate for women to attend regular antenatal (ANC) visits and deliver in health facilities. Despite the implementation of social distancing measures in hospitals, emerging evidence indicates that contagion is worse when healthcare is centralised [13] [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, it is important to explore alternative measures that target the community rather than just healthcare facilities.In Kenya, there have been reports of decreased antenatal attendance, immunisations, and hospital deliveries, along with an increase in stillbirths during COVID-19 [17] [18] [19] . This decline may be attributable to restricted access to health facilities arising from city lockdowns and curfews imposed by the government, where pregnant women and their companions fear harassment and arrest by the police. In addition, fear of contracting COVID-19 may keep many women from attending reproductive health services. Women reported similar sentiments concerning fear of infection risk at health facilities during the recent Ebola pandemic [1, 20] .Government directives and hospital policies limit the number of family members accompanying expecting women to hospitals to prevent contagion. There is also a separation of COVID-19-positive women from their newborns, instead of room-in as usual for these mothers and newborns [21] . Though the separation may minimise the risk of SARs-CoV-2 transmission from mother to infant during the hospital stay, this precaution may do more harm than good [22, 23] . Evidence shows that separation disrupts skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding and is associated with added physiologic stress to both the mother and infant [24, 25] . Moreover, neonates born to COVID-19-positive mothers have to be isolated from other babies to stop the spread of COVID-19 in newborn nurseries. This requires extra healthcare providers to care for isolated mothers and newborns, which places increased pressure on an already burdened health system. Though the Kenyan government has pledged to hire new healthcare workers, the goal of this new workforce is to fill human resource gaps in the COVID-19 pandemic, and it remains unclear how this would impact MCH services.In these extraordinary times, there is benefit from avoiding sources of infection and limiting health facility use to those who need it; therefore, should we not re-evaluate whether it is appropriate for all women to give birth in health facilities? Further, low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are encouraged to initiate public health innovations that are culturally acceptable [26] . Research shows that risk perception influences where women give birth [27] . Given the complexities posed by COVID-19, it is prudent to consider alternatives to existing delivery options for women.This article proposes a strategic response to maternal and newborn care in Kenya in the context of COVID-19. We recommend expanding and strengthening the existing community midwifery model (CMM), integrating community health workers (CHWs) and informal community networks, and creating midwifery centres run by qualified midwives that are closer to communities. We consider these strategies to offer a viable long-term plan that will reduce the burden on hospitals and decrease COVID-19 infection rates among pregnant women and their newborns.As in other LMICs, maternal mortality in Kenya has shown a minimal decline over the years. WHO trends placed Kenya among the countries with high maternal mortality and neonatal mortality rates, at 342/100 000 and 19/1000 live births, respectively [28] . It has been challenging to improve maternal and newborn outcomes because of service delivery gaps, cultural beliefs, lack of social support networks, and inaccessible emergency maternal obstetric care. Furthermore, according to the Confidential Enquiry Maternal Deaths 2017 report, 20% of maternal deaths had an avoidable community determinant [29] . This report emphasised the importance of community-based interventions to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.Despite the frequency of public health emergencies in Kenya (e.g. floods, terrorism, and ethnic violence), there are no adequate disaster plans that address how pregnant women will deliver during emergencies. In this prolonged COVID-19 crisis, women will continue to become pregnant and give birth. Furthermore, there are reports of high rates of teenage births during the pandemic lockdown [30], which is likely to increase the workload for maternal and newborn healthcare. Spikes in adolescent pregnancy were also reported during the Ebola and Zika virus crisis leading to adverse maternal outcomes [1] . Despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, pregnant women deserve a safe and humanised birth with a priority on physical and emotional safety for the mother and the baby. An effective strategy depends on stakeholders innovating evidence-based strategic plans to ensure safe care during childbirth.Under normal conditions, around 61% of pregnant women in Kenya give birth with the assistance of a skilled attendant [28] . During the COVID-19 crisis, barriers such as lockdowns, curfews, and risk for infection prevented women from accessing health facilities. The resulting increase in home deliveries offers an opportunity to introduce critical birthing, postnatal, breastfeeding, immunisation, and family planning services into women's homes. A community midwifery approach can close the utilisation gap and optimise MCH services during this crisis.The CMM is an innovative community-based health intervention that involves deploying skilled midwives residing in their communities to take critical maternal health services into women's homes [31] . The CMM was introduced as part of the National Health Sector Strategic Plan II, which emphasised the promotion of community health [32] . This strategic plan was revised in 2012, and a community health strategy was incorporated into the Kenya Health Policy (2012-2030) and Vision 2030. These documents highlighted the significant role of community midwives in providing culturally acceptable, skilled birthing services. Although the momentum for community midwifery in Kenya seems to have slowed given the paucity of the current literature, COVID-19 is an opportunity to revisit the critical role community midwives can play in bridging the gap in skilled deliveries.As Kenya attempts to revitalise its primary healthcare delivery system to provide universal healthcare, leveraging past success is a good starting point. Evidence from studies conducted in Kenya shows that community midwives improved ANC attendance, family planning, HIV services, skilled birth attendance, postnatal care, and exclusive breastfeeding [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, the continued success of community midwifery depends on their recognition as public health workers and adequate remuneration for services rendered by government insurance schemes.In Kenya, nurses and midwives provide the majority of peripartum care. COVID-19 has strained human resources for health. This shortage presents an option to consider integrating CHWs and volunteers into the CMM framework. Research in rural areas demonstrated that strengthening collaboration with CHWs and informal community networks improved ANC and normalised vaginal births [31, 33, 36, 37] . Evidence from LMIC shows that community-based interventions are effective in enhancing MCH services [38] . However, a significant risk of home-based care is the delay in accessing skilled care resulting in complications, due to the lack of knowledge on danger signs [39, 40] . The delay may also occur due to the limited number of midwives available in the community [31] . A new policy would concentrate on standardising high-quality community-based MCH interventions through optimal timing of home visits and referrals [38, 41] . It is essential to continue to address social and gender norms that pose barriers to accessing skilled childbirth services even when these are available at the community level [42] . Further, the country needs to invest in improving the number, training, and supervision of midwives to improve safety and reduce harm [42] .In low-resource areas where technology is limited, monitoring maternal and foetal conditions is challenging; however, midwives can screen pregnant women in their localities for complications and initiate referrals for specialised care for high-risk women. Readily available transport mechanisms need to be identified within communities for referrals during crises, especially in rural areas. Additionally, there needs to be a mechanism for midwives to manage complications if birth is imminent or it is not possible to transfer a pregnant woman to a facility when complications are anticipated. Childbirth kits should also be available in the event of a delay in transporting a pregnant woman [33, 37] . In addition, all community midwives and CHWs should be equipped with the necessary personal protective equipment to minimise their exposure to SARS-Cov-2 [13] .As reported in pandemics in West Africa [1, 43] , crises exacerbate maternal and neonatal mortality. Lessons learned from previous crises in Kenya that impacted the healthcare system highlighted the need to prioritise maternal and newborn care [35, 44] . Therefore, bold, longterm, and culturally acceptable measures are needed to address maternal and newborn care during this prolonged COVID-19 crisis. In the current pandemic, there is benefit from avoiding sources of infection and decongesting hospitals by offering midwifery services in the community. Although some pregnant women will still require hospitalisation, healthy women should be kept in the community. There are direct effects on access to MCH services as a result of the added burden of caring for COVID-19 patients within healthcare settings and the diversion of resources away from MCH towards caring for COVID-19 patients elsewhere. Further, there are knock-on effects arising from the impact of precautionary policies regarding access to health facilities and services intended to enable safer healthcare delivery during the pandemic, as well as the impact of more sweeping social measures during the pandemic such as lockdowns and curfew. These effects highlight the need to innovate and shift from an exclusive focus on hospital-based maternal care to community-based interventions [14] . It is time to enhance the CMM in Kenya to create demand and improve access to and use of skilled birth attendance and postnatal services for vulnerable women in informal urban settlements and rural areas.A CMM during the COVID-19 pandemic should include the following:1. Dedicated community-based midwives working within their communities with proper infection prevention and control training to minimise the risk of infection to themselves and the community. We suggest community midwives be separated from health facilities caring for patients with COVID-19. Community midwives also need to be recognised and supported to be key providers of care at the community level through fair remuneration, supportive supervision, and appropriate resources. 2. Collaboration with existing informal social networks and incorporation of existing CHWs, community health extension workers, and civil societies into the community framework. It is also prudent to retrain and build community midwives and CHWs to strengthen community health linkages, prevent transmission of disease, and overcome contextspecific barriers that prevent women from accessing quality maternal care. 3. Creating referral pathways and transport systems to strengthen facility-community linkages. A dedicated telephone line with direct access to community midwives should be established in each county to serve women and their families. Midwives can triage, offer advice, and refer women to maternal services as well as mental health, gender-based violence, and social services, as needed. 4. Development of long-term disaster plans that give clear guidelines that keep women and their newborns healthy in their communities without exposing them to unnecessary risks.COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with significant indirect ramifications for maternal and child health outcomes. Lockdowns and social distancing are needed to reduce transmission. However, given the economic impact of mitigation measures on the economy, the Kenyan government will soon have to lift these restrictions. This public health emergency requires solutions that move from facility-based care to outreach to the community. Although some pregnant women will require hospital admission, it is also possible for healthy women to safely give birth in communities with the help of skilled midwives. In turn, this would help to address the universal healthcare agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prolonged crisis that needs a long-term plan to ensure women and newborns continue to receive culturally appropriate care. ","Kenya","abstract","2020-10-07",10

Viral isolation and molecular analyses indicated a novel coronavirus (family Coronaviridae) provisionally named 2019-nCov [2] .The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2020) later designated the virus 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2), and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the associated disease '2019-Coronavirus Disease' [3, 4] .Due to its high infectiveness and person-to-person mode of transmission [5] , the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across China to other countries worldwide, and the WHO emergency committee declared on January 30, 2020, the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency and a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [4] . As J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f On April 18, 2020, Mauritania officially announced that the country is coronavirusfree, after the last active case had recovered. However, following a 40-day 'COVID-19-free' period, during which only two cases were registered, the disease resurged on May 12, 2020, and since that time, COVID-19 cases have been registered daily.In the present study, we address the current situation of COVID-19 in Mauritania, as of July 1, 2020, and discuss the efforts of Mauritanian authorities to combat this potentially life-threatening respiratory illness.There were three pathways through which the Mauritanian Ministry of Health recruited Covid-19-positive cases: (i) the mobile alert management teams (ii) sentinel reception sites created n collaboration with the army, and (iii) patients attending health facilities with suspected COVID-19 signs and symptoms. Using the national case-based surveillance, the present study describes the epidemiological feature of COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritania. A low rate of mortality (2.9%) due to COVID-19 was observed during the period between March 13 and July 1, 2020 in Mauritania. This result is within the range of 1.6-6.5% reported for the same period in some neighboring countries of Mauritania, such as Senegal (1.6%), Morocco (1.8%), Mali (5.3%), and Algeria (6.5%) [9] . Consistent with reports on morbidity and deaths in individuals with COVID-19, the majority of positive patients were males (56.6%) and most deceased patients (72%) were aged ≥ 55 years [11, 12] .Mauritania has a young population with a majority of its inhabitants belonging to the age group between 24 and 45 years old [13] , which corresponds to the most affected individuals during the current epidemic. However, young people have been reported to be less susceptible to COVID-19 infection than older people aged ≥ 55 years [14] . This is consistent with the high rate of asymptomatic individuals (84.6%) observed among young persons in this study and could be a favorable condition in limiting the mortality rate of the disease. This assumption is supported by a recent study showing that only a small proportion (within the range of 0-10%) of asymptomatic carriers eventually develop symptoms of COVID-19 [15] .Although the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 13, 2020, the exponential growth phase in the number of positive cases was observed only from June. This could be due to the fact that the majority of initial cases of COVID-19 were detected among foreigners who had little contact with Mauritanians and the rapid riposte of the health authorities to trace few positive individuals who were in contact with them. The opposite situation was observed after the 40-day 'COVID-19-free' period, during which death of Mauritanians, who apparently had no history of contact with a COVID-19-infected patient, was announced. Increasing growth observed during June could be due to the exponential number of persons tested for COVID-19 during contact tracing.During the study period, a relatively low prevalence (10.8%) of COVID-19 was detected in Mauritania. Although the age distribution of infected patients was similar to that of the general population in Mauritania, the reported prevalence could be biased because the study population mostly consisted of individuals identified during contact tracing, which may not necessarily represent the general population. To overcome the possible weakness in the reported prevalence, a population based-data on COVID-19 using immunodiagnostic tests that are rapid, less expensive, and easier-to-use than PCR assay in the field are urgently needed.Moreover, because COVID-19-infected individuals can have mild illness or may be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f asymptomatic (and therefore might not be tested for diagnosis or receive medical care), COVID-19 sero-prevalence surveys based on the detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be more informative about the proportion of persons who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. These surveys are also suitable and useful for disease surveillance [16] .To combat COVID-19 epidemic, preventive control measures were rapidly implemented in Mauritania. As a riposte against COVID-19, the Mauritanian authorities through an inter-ministerial committee announced a set of preventive measures, including closure of land and air borders, night curfew, closure of markets, restaurants, cafeterias, schools and universities, prohibition of prayer in mosques, and restriction of population movement between cities. Control measures included the systematic testing of symptomatic patients, isolation and management of active cases, and contact tracing and quarantine of persons who had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual to prevent onward transmission. A call center received and processed thousands of calls daily.Also, despite a mediatic controversies, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, has been approved as a first line treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases in many African countries, and was included in the regimen against COVID-19 in Mauritania [17, 18] .However, as for most national health system in developing countries, Mauritanian national health system was clearly not prepared to manage a sanitary crisis of such magnitude.For instance, a very limited number of beds in intensive care units existed in health facilities","Mauritania","abstract","2020-10-15",10

As of May 26, 2020, there were more than 5.3 million documented cases, and over 300,000 patients have succumbed to this disease globally [2] . e morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 have found to increase with age and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or chronic obstructive lung disease [3] .With the rising death toll and a vaccine unlikely very soon, extensive global efforts are underway to develop safe and effective therapeutics against COVID-19 [4] . Among the efforts undergoing to treat the disease, repurposing of old medications is a compelling strategy for which their safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and potential drug interactions are well studied [5] .Initially, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was utilized as the first-line agent in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the disease. However, a previous study [5] failed to show the beneficial clinical effects of this combination. Indeed, it has received considerable criticism from the scientific community [6] .Meanwhile, the aminoquinolines, chloroquine (CQ), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have emerged as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and some studies also demonstrated their clinical benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients [7] [8] [9] . On March 30, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency authorization that allowed the use of these drugs in hospitalized COVID-19-pneumonia [10] .To date, regardless of limited evidence, HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZ) is widely utilized in clinical settings to treat thousands of COVID-19 patients around the world [4] . e studies supporting the use of HCQ had suffered from methodological flaws including small sample size and ill quality of design creating difficulty in measuring the true clinical effects. e first study from France showed HCQ and AZ combination as an effective therapy for COVID- 19 . In this open-label non-randomized clinical trial, a total of 20 patients were treated with HCQ at a dose of 200 mg three times daily for 10 days, and the data showed a significant reduction in viral carriage at day 6 post-inclusion compared to controls (70.0% clearance by day 6 vs. 12.5% clearance by day 6 in control groups). Interestingly, the addition of AZ to HCQ (n � 6) resulted in a 100% virological cure on day 6 postinclusion, compared with 57.1% virological cure in the HCQ alone arm (n � 14) and 12.5% virological cure in the control arm (n � 16) [8] . Similarly, Million et al. [11] showed HCQ/AZ combination to be safe with a lower death rate. On the contrary, a more recent study conducted by Molina and his colleagues [12] failed to show evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of HCQ in combination with AZ for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Notably, the patients included in this study belonged to the severe COVID-19 category and had significant comorbidities including solid and hematological cancers, HIV, and obesity.A large observational study conducted in the USA reported that HCQ use among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was not associated with either a greatly lowered or increased risk of intubation or death [4] . A very recent study by Mahévas et al. [13] and Rosenberg et al. [14] also did not show significant differences in terms of in-hospital mortality among patients receiving HCQ with/without AZ compared with standard care. Besides, a systematic review by Sarma and his colleagues [15] concluded that treatment with HCQ had benefits in terms of fewer cases showing radiological progression, time to body temperature normalization, and the number of cough days compared to standard treatment. However, no difference was seen in terms of virological cure, death, or clinical worsening of the disease. e safety of HCQ with/without AZ in COVID-19 patients, including cardiac arrest and QTc prolongation, was also investigated by several studies [14, 16] . Interestingly, both drugs can potentially cause QTc prolongation, leading to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes [17] . Critically ill admitted COVID-19 patients with multiorgan failure and metabolic derangements and those having other drugs that can increase the risk of QTc prolongation are at greater risk [18] . A study conducted in New York recorded higher rates of cardiac arrest among patients receiving a combination of HCQ and AZ [14] . Similarly, Ramireddy et al. [19] reported a significant number of patients with QTc-interval prolongation, and the highest QTc values were recorded in those treated with a combination of HCQ and AZ.Despite numerous studies with small sample size, the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 patients remained unclear. Given the inconclusiveness of the existing evidence and awaiting findings from large randomized controlled clinical trials to clear the controversy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in the interim to investigate the safety and effectiveness of HCQ in the clinical setup.e objective of this review is to synthesize an evidence for the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of HCQ with or without AZ among patients treated for COVID-19.is review was described by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework.e studies were identified from PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCO-PUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library. e search was conducted to include human studies published in English language from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. e search terms included 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus, COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019, hydroxychloroquine, Plaquenil, and hydroxychloroquine sulphate. Details of the search strategy for some databases are annexed (Appendix A).Study designs with single-group prospective/retrospective observational studies and controlled clinical trials were pooled using meta-proportion, while prospective/retrospective observational studies and controlled clinical trials comparing HCQ with or without AZ versus usual care or HCQ with HCQ plus AZ were pooled using RevMan version 5.3. Controlled clinical trials with serious risk of bias were not included in the pooled analysis, and their findings were narrated descriptively.After removing all irrelevant articles, TAM, TMF, and GZN independently reviewed articles for data quality and methodological validity using standardized critical appraisal instruments obtained from https://www.joannabriggs.org/ assets/docs/jbc/...sr.../jbi-sr-protocol-template.docx. Any disagreement was handled by consulting KKG and DDB. Data extraction was handled by DD and KK using the standardized data extraction tool available at https://www.joannabriggs.org/ assets/docs/jbc/...sr.../jbi-sr-protocol-template.docx.Studies were considered if they included patients who received HCQ alone or in combination with other specific treatment modalities for COVID-19 infection. Both controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and observational studies with and without the comparator group were considered for inclusion. Data on at least one of the following outcomes had to be available for inclusion: virologic efficacy, mortality, disease progression, adverse effects, QTc prolongation, and drug discontinuation due to adverse effects (tolerability). Studies conducted among pediatric COVID-19 patients, case reports, preclinical studies, and studies that did not report outcomes with HCQ in COVID-19 were excluded.e risk of bias for comparative clinical trials [8, [20] [21] [22] was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled studies [23] . e study by Gautret et al. [8] was a non-randomized clinical trial and hence assessed using the ROBINS-I scale [24] . e results of the risk of bias for the studies included in the meta-analysis are found in Appendix B.e Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scale [25] was used for observational studies, and the full results are presented in Appendix B.e virologic efficacy, mortality, disease progression, adverse effects, QTc prolongation, and drug discontinuation due to adverse effects (tolerability) were assessed. Virologic efficacy is defined as two negative results of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24 hours apart. Disease progression is defined as the need for admission to the intensive care unit, the need for mechanical ventilation, and hospital admission of previously mild cases. Adverse effect is defined as any adverse effect (side effect) reported in a study except QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation is defined as an increase of greater than 60 ms from baseline, and absolute QTc increases to greater than 500 ms.Open Meta [Analyst] was used to analyse the proportions of mortality, QTc prolongation, and tolerability in single-arm studies [11, 12, 16, [26] [27] [28] [29] . e pooled proportion of the outcomes was reported with its 95% confidence interval (CI). RevMan 5.3 was used to estimate the risk of virologic efficacy, mortality, disease progression, and adverse effects in studies that compared HCQ with usual care or HCQ with HCQ plus AZ. e odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI were calculated to estimate the effect sizes. Meta-analysis using the Mantel Hazel method was conducted, and either the fixed-effect or random-effects model was applied. A fixed-effect model was used when the heterogeneity was low to moderate [23] ; otherwise, the random-effects model was applied.e databases (9 databases) search produced 442 articles. After removing the duplicates and excluding 138 articles with thorough evaluation for inclusion using titles and abstracts, 56 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Furthermore, 30 full-text articles were subjected to critical appraisal, and 10 articles were dropped with reasons. Twenty full-text articles (5 controlled clinical trials with 288 patients and 15 observational studies with 6,742 patients) were included in the final analysis. Of these, 12 [4, 8, 13, 14, 20-22, 26, 30-32] were double-arm studies ( Figure 1 ). ese studies compared hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) either with usual/standard care or HCQ with HCQ and azithromycin (AZ). e details of the studies are described in Table 1 . Two of the controlled clinical trials [20, 22] were at the preprint stage.Both the double-arm (Table 1 ) and single-arm (Table 2 ) studies were subjected to meta-analysis to estimate the effects of the interventions. e outcomes assessed with double-arm studies include virologic efficacy [8, 20, 21] , clinical efficacy (mortality [4, 8, 13, 14, 30, 31] and disease progression [4, 8, 13, 14, 22, 31, 32] ), safety (risk of adverse effects) [8, [20] [21] [22] , and tolerability and QT prolongation [14, 26, 34] . Outcomes were assessed for both HCQ versus standard care and HCQ versus HCQ + AZ. e outcome assessed in single-arm studies include the proportions of mortality, QTc prolongation [11, 12, 16, [26] [27] [28] 34] , and drug discontinuation [12, [26] [27] [28] .To estimate the risk of virologic cure, the data of 180 patients (90 HCQ and 90 non-HCQ groups) from two controlled clinical trials [20, 21] , with moderate risk of bias, were pooled. Although Gautret et al. [8] reported improved virologic cure rate among the HCQ group as compared to the non-HCQ group (16/20 versus 2/16), the finding was not included in the pooled data due to its serious risk of bias. Hence, the pooled result indicated that the virologic cure rate of the HCQ group was not statistically different from the non-HCQ/standard care group (OR � 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56). e test for the overall effect was Z � 0.69 (p � 0.49) (Tau 2 � 0.00; Chi 2 � 0.18, df � 1 (p � 0.67); I 2 � 0%) ( Figure 2 ).e finding was generated from five observational studies [4, 13, 14, 30, 31] comprising the data of 2,864 COVID-19 patients (1,311 HCQ and 1,553 non-HCQ groups). e overall result indicated that treatment with HCQ did not result in improved survival (OR � 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39) as compared to the routine care. e test for the overall effect, Z � 0.71 (p � 0.48). However, the interpretation of this finding might be limited by the substantial heterogeneity; heterogeneity: Tau 2 � 0.42; Chi 2 � 24.91, df � 4 (p ≤ 0.001); and I 2 � 84% ( Figure 3) . A controlled clinical trial [8] also reported one death out of 14 HCQ-exposed patients and no death out of 16 in the opposite arm. Of note, the study was removed from pooled analysis as it carries a serious risk of bias (Appendix A).Likewise, the data of 1,487 COVID-19 patients from single-arm observational studies [12, 13, 16, 17] were included to determine the pooled prevalence of mortality among patients treated with HCQ with or without AZ. e pooled prevalence was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-10.8%) with considerable heterogeneity (I 2 � 92.28%, p < 0.001) ( Figure 4 ). e heterogeneity could be attributed to the age difference of the COVID-19 patients, as the studies with death reports had a median age of greater than 60 years.In the three [11, 16, 27] of the observational studies, the cause of death was respiratory and multiorgan failure. ere was no death due to arrhythmogenic adverse effects.e outcome coded as ""disease progression"" included the need for admission to the intensive care unit, the need for mechanical ventilation, and hospital admission of previously mild cases. e data of 3,003 COVID-19 patients (1,699 HCQ and 1,304 non-HCQ group) extracted from one controlled clinical trial [22] and five observational studies [4, 13, 14, 31, 32] were pooled. e overall random effect analysis indicated HCQ therapy did not appear to halt disease progression (OR � 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29). e test result for the overall effect, Z � 0.21is finding was also replicated by subgroup analysis of observational studies (OR � 1.15; 95% CI: 0.45-2.95). However, in subgroup analysis, the finding from a single controlled clinical trial (OR � 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.86) was in favor of the HCQ group ( Figure 5 ).ough the study had no risk of bias, the small sample size (31 in each arm) used made the interpretation of the finding extremely tricky. Several studies also indicated HCQ may not improve the rate of disease progression in COVID-19 patients. In a controlled clinical trial [8] , which was not included in the pooled analysis, 3 patients were progressed to severe disease in the HCQ group (3/14 versus 0/14). Moreover, in three noncomparative studies [7, 17, 21, 22] , out of 1,192 COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ with or without AZ, 42 patients were transferred to ICU and intubated.e data from four controlled clinical trials [8, [20] [21] [22] of 278 COVID-19 patients (141 HCQ and 137 from the non-HCQ group) were included to assess overall adverse effects (except QTc prolongation) among HCQ-exposed patients.ree controlled clinical trials [20] [21] [22] were pooled, and one controlled clinical trial [8] was described narratively due to its risk of bias A. In the pooled analysis, the odds of adverse effects among COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ patients were increased by 2.35 (OR � 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). e test for the overall effect Case studies (n = 5) was statistically significant (p � 0.02), and the summary effect of the meta-analysis was heterogeneity: Chi 2 � 3.91, df � 3 (p � 0.27); I 2 � 23% ( Figure 6 ). Besides, Gautret et al. [8] found more adverse effects among patients randomized to HCQ (1/14 versus 0/16).QTc prolongation was reported in two ways in most of the studies. e cut-off points, an increase in greater than 60 ms from baseline, and absolute QTc increase to greater than 500 ms were used as a threshold to discontinue medications responsible or suspected to cause QTc prolongation. ese cut-off points were described by recent guidelines and FDA [18, 35] . An absolute QTc prolongation greater than 500 ms was reported in two observation studies [26, 31] , which compared HCQ alone with HCQ plus AZ. A study by Rosenberg et al. [14] reported that after ECG screening, 80 patients (12.6%) had a QTc prolongation in the combination group, whereas 39 patients (16.7%) developed QTc prolongation in the HCQ group.In the current review, the data of 291 patients from two observational studies [26, 31] were pooled to estimate the risk of QTc prolongation in patients exposed to HCQ versus HCQ plus AZ. e result indicated the risk of QTc prolongation above 500 ms due to HCQ was statistically not different from those receiving HCQ plus AZ (OR � 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28) with the test for the overall effect of Z � 0.27 (p � 0.79); heterogeneity: Chi 2 � 0.00, df � 1 (p � 0.97); I 2 � 0% (Figure 7) .However, the findings from noncomparative studies appeared much concerning. Seven single-arm studies reported data on QT prolongation after HCQ ± AZ exposure. Six studies (1,657 patients) were reported a baseline increase in QTc by more than 60 ms [11, 12, 16, [26] [27] [28] after HCQ ± AZ exposure. e result of the analysis showed about 13.0% (95% CI: 3.8%-22%) of patients had an increase of QTc by more than 60 ms from the baseline. Considerable heterogeneity was present between studies (Q � 104.16, I 2 � 95.2%, p < 0.001) (Figure 8 ). Several studies also raised concerns regarding QTc prolongation following HCQ exposure with or without other medications. In four studies [16, [26] [27] [28] , concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications was reported ( of therapy. Similarly, from five single-arm studies [16, [26] [27] [28] 36] , which comprised of 607 COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ ± AZ, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%-15.5%) of patients had developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms ( Figure 9 ). However, a study by Million et al. [11] reported there were no patients who had an increased QTc greater than 500 ms. A meta-regression was conducted to assess the effect of baseline use of other drugs suspected to cause QTc prolongation to above 500 ms. Indeed, the result did not show any significant effect (coefficients (Q) � −0.0; 95% CI: −0.002-0.000; p � 0.79).In turn, the pooled prevalence of drug discontinuation due to the increased QTc prolongation to greater than 500 ms in three studies [26] [27] [28] and to greater than 60 ms from baseline in one study [12] among COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ with or without AZ was 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1-7.1). e heterogeneity among the included studies was also acceptable enough (I 2 � 52.19, p � 0.099) ( Figure 10 ). In one study [11] , three patients had discontinued the treatment due to adverse events other than QTc prolongation.e data of 2,413 (729 HCQ and 1684 HCQ + AZ) COVID-19 patients were included to estimate the independent effect of AZ on mortality and ICU admission [14, 31] . Accordingly, HCQ plus AZ did not improve the risk of mortality (OR � 0.93; 95% CI: 0.51-1.72) and ICU admission (OR � 0.97; 95% CI: 0.26-3.61). e overall pooled result showed a statistically insignificant result for the composite outcome (OR � 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.43). e test for the overall effect was Z � 0.50 (p � 0.61), and the heterogeneity was Tau 2 � 0.16; Chi 2 � 11.3, df � 3 (p � 0.01); I 2 � 73% ( Figure 11 ).e global community is in the state of urgency to mitigate the health and economic crisis instigated by COVID-19. Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases. e drugs have possible activity against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical practice [36] . However, clinical studies were reporting contradictory results on the efficacy and safety of HCQ when used for treating COVID-19 patients. us, systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing studies was performed to explore the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HCQ with or without AZ in COVID-19 patients. e finding of this meta-analysis suggested the use of HCQ did not result in a rapid viral clearance. It also failed to improve survival and rate of disease progression. e pooled prevalence of mortality was higher in patients exposed to HCQ with or without AZ. Moreover, HCQ exposure carried a significant risk of adverse effects and a sizable proportion of patients ended up with drug discontinuation.On the other hand, a combination of HCQ and AZ did not result in increased risk of QTc prolongation, improved survival, or preventing admission to ICU. However, the pooled proportion of observational studies indicated an alarming rate of QTc prolongation among patients receiving HCQ with or without AZ. e finding of this study showed an absence of rapid viral clearance (OR � 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56) in patients treated with HCQ compared to the standard care. However, the review by Yang et al. [35] found better virologic efficacy with statistically insignificant results. e finding of this review was based on the data from a single study [8] , which had a high risk of bias. More importantly, the former review compared HCQ + AZ with the standard care (control group). is arm of the study had a virologic cure rate of 100% reported from 6 patients. Nevertheless, the current review considered the arm which compared HCQ alone versus the control group, which reported a virologic cure rate of 57% in the HCQ arm versus 12.5% in the control arm. e study by Shamshirian et al. [37] had also questioned the virologic potency of HCQ + AZ (RR � 2.15, 95% CI: 0.31-14.77). Moreover, the optimal duration for virologic clearance is not well known. Gautret et al. [8] , Jun et al. [21] , and Tang et al. [20] reported a virologic cure after 6, 7, and 28 days of treatment, respectively. erefore, drawing a conclusion from such findings irrespective of the incurred heterogeneity may be erroneous. Of note, all the included studies were open-labeled, non-randomized, and the authors did not describe the type of treatment given for the control group. Similarly, HCQ could not demonstrate improved survival (OR � 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39) among COVID-19 patients. Gautret et al. [8] also reported an episode of death in the HCQ group, but not in the control group. Previous reviews [37] [38] [39] reported either increased mortality among HCQ groups or no statistically significant difference. As compared to our review, earlier reviews included a limited number of studies, while Sarma et al. [15] combined result of mortality and clinical worsening. Our finding was not different from former studies [15, 39] . is review also found a 5.8% pooled prevalence of mortality from five observational studies [11, 12, 16, 27, 29] among COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ with or without AZ. In three [11, 16, 27] of these studies, respiratory and multiorgan failure was the cause of death. ere was no reported death due to adverse effects. In all of the included studies, patients had active comorbidity. ere was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 � 92.28%, p ≤ 0.001), which could be attributed to the differences in disease severity and age of the participants. Yet, meta-regression analysis did not produce any evidence.Furthermore, HCQ therapy was not significantly associated with slowing the composite end point of disease progression (OR � 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29), unlike the finding by Chen et al. [22] (OR � 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.86). e finding by Chen et al. [22] may not be dependable as it included limited number of patients (31 in each arm). e subgroup analysis result of observational studies also indicated HCQ therapy was not significantly affecting disease progression (OR � 1.15; 95% CI: 0.45-2.95). Analogous results were reported by the preceding studies [15, 38, 40] . However, one review indicated that HCQ may prevent progression to severe disease among COVID-19 patients [35] . Since the previous review included a limited number of studies, its finding must be interpreted cautiously. Our finding was in agreement with reviews by Sarma et al. [15] and Shamshirian et al. [37] . Nonetheless, these studies reported better outcomes of radiological progression in the HCQ arm, a finding generated from two poorly designed controlled trials [21, 22] . e safety of HCQ with or without AZ has been questioned by several studies [37, 41] . Diarrhoea, vomiting, blurred vision, rash, and headache were commonly reported adverse effects. In this review, the risk of adverse effects among COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ was 2.35 (OR � 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). Shamshirian et al. [37] also found an increase in the odds of the adverse effect among patients exposed to HCQ (OR � 3.55, 95% CI: 1.61-7.82). Similar findings were also reported by other studies [40] [41] [42] .However, one study reported a conflicting finding where HCQ may be safe and effective, though the authors hinted more data are required for a definitive conclusion [15] . A study conducted in China reported 37.8% of ADRs in a cluster of 217 COVID-19 patients. e predominant adverse effects were drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders [43] . Cardiac side effects including conduction disturbances (bundle-branch block, incomplete or complete atrioventricular block, QT prolongation, and subsequent torsade de pointes) and cardiomyopathy (hypertrophy and congestive heart failure) were also described [44, 45] .In this review, although the risk of QTc prolongation above 500 ms among those exposed to HCQ (OR � 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28) may not appear concerning, HCQ/AZ combination could be more worrisome. A finding generated from five single-arm studies [16, [26] [27] [28] 36] , which comprised the data of 607 COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ ± AZ, showed 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%-15.5%) in the pooled prevalence of QTc prolongation above 500 ms. In addition, a finding generated from other observational studies [11, 12, 16, [26] [27] [28] indicated 13.0% (95% CI: 3.8%-22%) of patients had an increase in QTc by more than 60 ms from the baseline. is finding was not similar to the data synthesized from double-arm studies. is is because of the fact that the double-arm section had compared the data of HCQ alone with HCQ + AZ. As adverse cardiovascular sequels, such as myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure, have been reported in COVID-19 patients and these off-label therapies are not familiar to cardiovascular clinicians managing these patients [46] , emergency care physicians should outweigh the risk and the benefits. In a nutshell, numerous studies [14, 16, 17, 26, 27, 46] have raised concerns over the cardiac safety of this combination.Drug discontinuation due to adverse effects was also a common finding. e current study showed 4.1% of patients discontinued treatment due to an increase in QTc prolongation. Another study also indicated 4.5% of COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ with or without AZ have discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Similarly, one patient out of 117 discontinued HCQ in patients receiving HCQ with or without AZ after three days due to QTc prolongation [47] .ough the combination of HCQ + AZ was effective in some studies [15, 35] , the other study [37] found it carries more hazard of death (RR � 3.65; 95% CI: 1.10-12.10) as compared to the control group. Our findings showed a lack of evidence for curbing mortality and intensive care unit admission of this combination (OR � 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.45).It is irrefutable that our study has several limitations. e inclusion of studies with a high risk of bias and methodological flaws, combining findings from controlled and uncontrolled studies, may limit its generalizability. We also reported more than one outcome, for instance, ICU admission and need of hospitalization under a single heading, namely, disease progression. is may not show the true picture of the real-world. e existence of heterogeneity, uniform treatment of all cases (mild to severe), and inclusion of limited studies with a small sample size for outcomes such Selection: (1) representativeness of the exposed cohort: A, consecutive eligible participants were selected, participants were randomly selected, or all participants were invited to participate from the source population; B, not satisfying requirements in part (a) or not stated.

Note: ≥7, high-quality study; 5-7, moderate quality study; <5, lowquality study.as virologic efficacy may result in biased findings. We could not retrieve some of the important findings such as disease severity scale for each study and the treatments used in the standard care setting.is systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed controlled clinical trials and several real-world studies of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, found that the use of a regimen containing HCQ with or without AZ did not offer clinical benefit. HCQ with or without AZ did not improve the rate of virologic cure, disease progression, and mortality. ese regimes were associated with more adverse effects. erefore, these drug regimens should only be used in a clinical trial setting, and a large pool of data from randomized clinical trials is warranted to have concrete evidence for safety, efficacy, and tolerability [48] .","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-13",10

Furthermore hypertension is responsible for at least 45% of deaths due to heart disease and 51% of deaths due to stroke. 3 Despite all its known adverse health consequences, high blood pressure is still poorly controlled globally due to low non-pharmacological interventions such as lifestyle modifications. 5, 6 Therefore health promotion should integrate the use of prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications, as they have been proven to prevent and control high blood pressure. 6 Lifestyle modifications consist of five components: adoption of Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension plans (DASH), low sodium diet, engage in physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption and cease smoking. 7, 8 Even though most people choose therapeutic drugs, the adherence to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment should be considered equally. 7 To reduce morbidity and mortality various studies have been conducted in different parts of the world. Though, there was significant variation across countries, adherence to lifestyle modifications for hypertension is less than optimal in all countries. Adherence to self-care practice in Ethiopia is still poor at 23% but for antihypertensive medications adherence is at about 67%. 8 Lifestyle-and diet-related factors are often modifiable, so their effects have specific importance in hypertension prevention and treatment. Lifestyle modification is particularly helpful in the large proportion of hypertensive patients who have additional risk factors for premature cardiovascular diseases, especially dyslipidemia and diabetes. 9, 10 Hypertension is affected by different factors. Among these adherence to lifestyle modification and to therapeutic drugs are the most important. Adherence to recommended lifestyle modification can be affected by demographic factors; patients' level of monthly income, educational level, age, co-morbidity, knowledge about the disease, self-efficacy, social support, smoking, obesity, harmful use of alcohol and sedentary lifestyle, continuity of health education and counseling as well as motivation. [5] [6] [7] [8] 11 To achieve lifestyle modification activities, it is likely that system changes are needed, such as the creation of multidisciplinary teams with expertise in counseling and the remuneration of time spent in lifestyle counseling. Promotion will need to include a component indicating that hypertension in itself is not a condition that hampers one's lifestyle -on the contrary, if controlled, it will allow a normal lifestyle for a longer period of time. Generally primary care practitioners should recommend lifestyle modifications for all their pre-hypertensive and hypertensive patients. 9, 12 Hypertension is an important public health challenge in the developing and the developed world alike. It is not always taken seriously and is often poorly controlled mostly due to neglected causes resulting from unhealthy lifestyles. It is possible to prevent the development of hypertension and to lower blood pressure levels by simply adopting a healthy lifestyle. From the available literature search there is no study that showed lifestyle modifications adherence and associated factors in the study area despite its advantages. Therefore this study aimed to assess adherence to lifestyle modifications and associated factors among hypertensive patients attending chronic follow-up units of Dessie referral hospital.An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Dessie referral hospital in the South Wollo Zone from May 10 to July 8, 2020. South Wollo Zone is one of the 11 zones found in Amhara regional state. Its major city administration is Dessie town located 401 km away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia and 480 km from Bahir Dar, the capital city of Amhara regional state. Dessie referral hospital is the only referral hospital in Wollo province, serving about 7 million people including the neighboring regions.All hypertensive patients who were on antihypertensive therapy and attending chronic follow-up units of Dessie referral hospital. All adult registered hypertensive patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were available during the time of data collection were included in the study. Data collectors approached 301 adult registered hypertensive patients and no one refused to participate.Inclusion Criteria: All hypertensive patients who were 18 years and older and on anti-hypertensive treatment for at least for 6 months before commencement of the study were included.Exclusion Criteria: Hypertensive patients who were unable to communicate, were critically ill, had mental health issues or refused to participate at the time of data collection were excluded.Sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula by considering proportion of adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications 23%, 7 95% CI and 5% of marginal error. Sample size was estimated using the following assumptions. Patients who were found during the study period in the study area who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study exclusively for lifestyle modification adherence at Dessie referral hospital. The reason why we selected a convenient sampling technique was the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic that only allowed antihypertensive treatment appointments every 3 months rather than every month. This method meant that we could reach 301 hypertensive patients during the study period. Before starting data collection informed consent was obtained from each interviewee by assuring confidentiality and explaining the objective of the study.Dependent variable: Adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications.Independent variables: Socio-demographic factors (age, sex, marital status, religion, ethnicity, level of education), Personal factors (co-morbidities, knowledge about the disease, duration of hypertension, type and duration of anti-hypertensive medication intake), Behavioral factors (self-efficacy), Social factors (support from families and non-family members of the society).Duke Social Support and Stress Scale with 12 items was used to assess support gained from family and nonfamily. 13 Responses were coded as: ""none"" = 0, ""some"" = 1, ""a lot"" = 2, ""yes"" = 2, ""no"" = 0 and ""there is no such person"" = 0. Blank responses were considered as ""0"".A modified 10-item hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and management (HELM) scale was used as a tool to measure respondents' knowledge. 14 Responses were coded as right answer as ""1"" and wrong answer as ""0"".Self-efficacy was assessed by Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale which contains 6 items with internal reliability of Cronbach's Alpha value 0.879. 15 Responses were coded as completely unconfident = 1, unconfident = 2, not sure = 3, confident = 4, and totally confident = 5.Moderation of alcohol consumption was assessed by the 4-item Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) questionnaire which is a short version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) 16 with internal consistency of Cronbach's Alpha value 0.783 and scored ""never"" as 0, ""less than monthly"" = 1, ""monthly"" = 2, ""weekly"" = 3, and ""daily or almost daily"" = 4.Adherence: the extent to which a persons' behavior corresponds with recommendations from health-care providers.Adherence to lifestyle modifications: respondents who were adherent to diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption related recommendations.DASH: a diet rich in fruits, vegetables; low sodium, reduced saturated and total fat.Diet-related adherence: in this study, those respondents who reported that they usually or always consumed a diet rich in vegetables, grains and fruits; rarely or never consume salt; rarely or never consumed Integrated Blood Pressure Control 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comfoods rich in spices and saturated fat were considered to be adherent.Exercise-related adherence: respondents who reported that they exercise for >30 minutes per day, at least three times per week.Smoking-related adherence: respondents who reported that they either never smoked or have stopped smoking.Alcohol consumption related adherence: respondents who reported that they either never consumed alcohol or whose overall score on FAST is < 3 were taken as adherent to moderation of alcohol consumption.Co-morbidities: respondents with one or more medical conditions in addition to hypertension.Knowledge about hypertension: respondents with scores above the mean value on hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and management scale were taken as having good knowledge about hypertension.Social support: the support gained from family and non-family members. In this study, respondents whose score was above the mean value on the Duke Social Support and Stress scale were taken as having social support.Self-efficacy: is the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainment. In this study, respondents who scored above the mean value on the 6-item Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale were considered as having good selfefficacy to cope with and manage their disease.Data were collected through a structured, validated and pretested face to face interviewer-administered questionnaire which was adapted from different reviewed literatures 3, 8, [13] [14] [15] [16] since there were no available standard questionnaires to assess total adherence to lifestyle modifications. Primarily the questions were prepared in English and translated to the local language (Amharic); the Amharic version was used for interview and then retranslated back to English to ensure its consistency by bilingual experts. The interview took on average a total of 20 minutes.The questionnaire contained information on sociodemographic, personal, social support, knowledge and behavioral related variables and lifestyle modification related variables which can be expressed in terms of DASH and low sodium diet, regular exercise, moderation of alcohol consumption and cessation of smoking. Duke Social Support and Stress Scale with 12 items was used to assess support gained from family and nonfamily. 13 A modified 10-item hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and management (HELM) scale was used as a tool to measure respondents' knowledge. 14 Selfefficacy was assessed by Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale which contains 6 items with internal reliability of Cronbach's alpha value 0.879. 15 Moderation of alcohol consumption was assessed with the 4-item Fast alcohol screening test (FAST) which is a short version of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) with internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha value 0.783. 16 Pre-test in 5% of the selected patients was done by the principal investigator in Boru hospital which was not included in the study, to assess the content, approach of the questionnaire and to correct unclear and vague issues on the questionnaires.Two data collectors (BSc nurses) and one BSc nurse for supervision activities were recruited. The data collectors and supervisor had previous experience of data collection. They were given training for one day on the method of extracting the needed information, how to fill the information on a structured questionnaire and the ethical aspect in approaching the participants as well as the aim of the study and contents of the instruments. Therefore, the data collectors were familiar for each question. They were to approach the participants in a polite and respectful manner. The supervisor monitored the data collection process of the data collectors daily and if any problem happened she tried to solve it or contact the principal investigator by phone or in person.To assure the data quality, the questionnaire was originally prepared in English then translated to Amharic, then back to English by bilingual experts to keep its consistency and the data were collected and supervised by trained nurses. Each questionnaire was pre-tested and checked for its completeness, followed by modification. The principal investigator and supervisor were making spot-checks of at least 5 questionnaires per day. Reviewing the completed questionnaire by the data collectors ensures completeness and consistency of the informations that were collected. The collected data were checked visually for its completeness, and the responses were coded and entered into the computer using the Epi data version 4.4 statistical package and 10% of the responses were randomly selected and checked for the consistency of data entry. Then data were exported toStatistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 25.0 for data analysis. During the process of analysis, descriptive statistics was used to provide an overall and coherent presentation and description of the data. Binary logistic regression was done to evaluate the crude significant relation of each independent variable with dependent variable. Variables with a 95% CI and P-value ≤ 0.2 during the bivariable analysis were entered to multivariable logistic regression analysis to see the relative effect of confounding variables and interaction of variables. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was taken as a cut-off value for significance. The results were displayed by using tables and charts.A total of 301 eligible hypertensive patients who were attending chronic follow-up units of Dessie referral hospital were interviewed during the study period giving a response rate of 100%. The study included 154 (51.2%) males. The mean age of the respondents was 51 ± 17.16 years while 38.9% were more than 55 years old. The majority of the respondents (170; 56.5%) were Muslim by religion and 173 (57.5%) were married. About 268 (89.0%) of the respondents were Amhara by ethnicity. Out of the respondents 88 (29.2%) had attended college or university and 60 (19.9%) of respondents were governmental employees. One hundred and one (33.6%) respondents have an income of 1000-1999 Ethiopian Birr and 59 (19.6%) did not have a regular income and lived with support from others ( Table 1) .Of the respondents 37 (12.3%) had blood pressure ≥160/ 100 mmHg and 139 (46.2%) participants had a normal BMI of between 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 . One hundred and fifty-nine (52.8%) were hypertensive for four or more years and 130 (43.2%) were on hypertensive treatment for the same period. Most of the respondents (154; 51.2%) were on ≤ 2 antihypertensive medications.Most respondents (183; 60.8%) had co-morbidity, most commonly DM and renal disorder (85; 46.4%).In order to determine level of respondents' knowledge regarding hypertension, 10 modified questions from the 14-item hypertension evaluation of lifestyle and Figure 1 ).The 6-item Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale was used to measure self-efficacy with 5 modified alternatives. The minimum and maximum score were 11 and 25 out of 30 respectively with a mean score of 19.85 and the standard deviation 3.51. Based on this mean value, 166 (55.1%) of study participants had good self efficacy ( Figure 2 ).The Duke Social Support and Stress Scale which contains 12 items was used to assess support gained from family, friends or significant others. The total mean score of respondents' social support on this scale was 48.38 ±16.75. By using this mean score as a cut-off point 148 (51%) of respondents benefited from social support from family, friends or significant others while 142 (49%) did not. From 148 respondents 143 (96.62%) got social support from their family whereas 5 (3.38%) respondents got non-family support.A majority (188; 62.5%) of the respondents included fruits, vegetables, grains and beans in their diet since their hypertension diagnosis. Almost 58%, 81.5% and 75.4% of total participants rarely or never consumed foods that contain high saturated fat, spicy foods and salt in their food since being diagnosed respectively.Approximately half (156; 51.8%) of the hypertensive patients performed physical exercise; of them 136 (87.2%) exercised three or greater than three times per a week and 126 (80.8%) participants exercised for at least 30 minutes per session. As shown in Figure 3 , among 156 respondents who performed exercise walking was the dominant type (74; 47.5%) followed by running (42; 26.9%). Adherence to Cessation of Smoking About 9.6% of the patients had ever used tobacco; of these 37.9% were still smokers. Among 11 respondents who still smoked cigarettes five had tried to quit smoking.Based on the FAST score 283 (94%) hypertensive patients were FAST negative or adherent to moderation of alcohol consumption ( Table 2 ). Figure 4 shows that 79.1% of the respondents never engaged in harmful drinking (>8 drinks for men and >6 for women) on one or more occasions. The remaining 18.6% and 2.3% of respondents engaged in harmful drinking less than monthly and monthly respectively. Out of the 63 respondents who reported that they consumed alcohol, the majority never had a history of inability to remember what happened after drinking the night before (91.7%) or failure to do what was expected from them in the last year (95%). Around 11.3% of these respondents confirmed that a relative/friend/doctor/health worker was concerned about their drinking and advised them to cut down on their drinking; 1.7% of them were advised before the last year and 9.6% during the last year.The overall adherence (including diet, exercise, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol consumption) in this study was only 23.6% with 95% CI of 18.6 -28.4%. Around 76.4% of the total respondents were adherent to diet-related recommendations. Out of the total 301 participants only 120 (39.9%) were adherent to recommended physical activities. Around 270 hypertensive patients did not smoke or ceased smoking and 94% of respondents were adherent to moderation of alcohol consumption (Table 2) .The association of dependent and independent variables was investigated using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Table 3 showed that age, sex, marital status, education level, occupational status, monthly income, having co-morbidities, knowledge level and self-efficacy were significantly associated with adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications from the bivariable binary logistic regression analysis model at P ≤ 0.2. After controlling the effect of other factors (confounders) in multivariable logistic regression, marital status, education level, monthly income, having comorbidities, knowledge level and self-efficacy were found to be statistically significant predictors of adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications at P ≤ 0.05. Compared with married adult hypertensive patients, divorced and widowed patients were 65% and 73% less likely to be adherent to recommended lifestyle modifications [AOR=0.35; 95% CI (0.13-0.94)] and [AOR=0.27; 95% CI (0.10-0.75)] respectively. Patients with educational status of secondary (Grades 9-12) were almost 5 times more likely to be adherent than respondents who were illiterate [AOR=4.85; 95% CI (1.54-15.22) ]. Respondents who had no regular income were around 78% less likely to be adherent times more likely to be adherent than those who had poor self-efficacy.Hypertension is one of the most important public health challenges in which patients' outcomes are disability and death if it is not effectively prevented and controlled. Nonpharmacological management requires great attention in addition to pharmacological treatment to control hypertension and its complications. This study aimed to investigate adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications and associated factors among hypertensive patients attending chronic follow-up units of Dessie referral hospital, North East Ethiopia.In this study the overall adherence (including diet, exercise, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol consumption) among hypertensive patients was 23.6%. This finding was similar to studies in Iran (27.79%), 17 18 and Addis Ababa (23%). 8 This might be due to the similarities of some parts of the standard tool as well as the study design used in all studies.The adherence rate of the current study was lower than studies in India (54.7), 9 Nepal (54%), 19 and Ghana (72%). 20 The possible reasons for this discrepancy might include tool differences, age differences in the study population (in this study patients were ≥18 years but in India patients were above 30 years of age), dietary habit difference between the countries, 9 sample size and study period difference, 19 tool quality difference and study area setup difference. 20 In contrast this study's adherence result was higher than findings from studies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (4.2%) 7 and Eastern Nigeria (16.4%). 21 The possible justification for this difference might be due to variances in the study participants' knowledge and awareness about the disease and lifestyle modification, living standard differences and gender inclusion (this study included men and women but the study in Saudi Arabia included only men), 7 socio-cultural variation that influences lifestyle of individuals, methodological differences and low level of education and low level of awareness related to risk of hypertension complications. 21 The prevalence of diet-related adherence of respondents in this study was 76.4%. This finding was higher than the study conducted in Saudi Arabia (11.8%). 7 This discrepancy might be due to the study population gender proportion variance (only men were included in Saudi Arabia). Similarly our study finding on adherence to consumption of vegetables, fruits, unsaturated oil and reduction in dairy food intake in the control of high blood pressure was higher than the study in Nigeria (20%); 10 this might be due to the current study having used a larger sample size, as well as socio-cultural differences. This result was also higher than that from a study done in Addis Ababa (69.1%). 8 The possible reason for this variation might be due to a time difference in which the increment of the disease prevalence alerts people to be vegetarian and to eat the recommended healthy diet.The current study found that around 39.9% were adherent to recommended physical activities . This result was comparable with a study conducted in the USA which reported 36.6% of hypertensive patients engaged in physical activity. 22 However this result was lower than those from other studies in the USA (52.2%) 6 and in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia (96.3%). 23 The discrepancies in the adherence rate might be due to study population and methodological differences, and measuring instrument difference. The rate of physical exercise adherence in this study was also higher than studies in Nigeria (6.2%), 24 12.9%, 10 and Addis Ababa (31.4%). 8 The possible justification for these discrepancies is the fact that adherence to physical exercise is a patient personal behavior and attitude that varies between different communities and cultures. It could be due to socio-economic status variation in which those people who live in low socio-economic areas are obligated to be pedestrians.Regarding recommended moderation of alcohol consumption, the current study revealed around 94% of respondents were adherent. Some studies reported low levels of adherence to alcohol consumption as compared with our study finding; Nigeria (87.6%) 24 and Addis Ababa (74.8%). 8 The possible reasons might be sociocultural differences and differences in study participants' dominant religion (in our case more than half of participants were Muslim and thus do not consume alcohol due to their religious direction, but in the other studies most participants were not Islam).The results of this study indicated that 89.7% of hypertensive patients did not smoke or ceased smoking. This finding was similar with study reports in Israel that stated 87% of study participants were adherent to smoking related recommendations. 25 On the other hand the current study finding was lower than a study conducted in Eastern Nigeria (100.0%); 21 this might be due to socio-cultural reasons, difference in patient education about the adverse effect of smoking and sample size variation. Moreover this finding was higher than studies done in USA (75%), 6 Turkey (49.0%), 26 and Addis Ababa (85.9%). 8 This might be due to religious reasons, socio-cultural variance and methodological differences.According to the multivariable analysis, marital status, education level, monthly income, having co-morbidities, knowledge level and self-efficacy were strongly associated with adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications. Our study concluded that compared with married adult hypertensive patients, divorced and widowed patients were 65% and 73% less likely to be adherent to recommended lifestyle modifications. This finding was supported by studies in Ghana 20 -married patients were twice as likely to adhere to recommended lifestyle modifications than widowed patients, Addis Ababa 27 -married respondents were twice as likely to adhere to self-care Integrated Blood Pressure Control 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress practice compared with divorced respondents. This was possibly explained as married respondents give more concern for the choice of the recommended lifestyle by sharing ideas about its importance with each other. Also, a widowed or divorced individual's life might not be stable enough for a lifestyle modification due to the absence of their partner.Patients with educational status of secondary school were almost five times more likely to be adherent than illiterate respondents. This finding was consistent with findings of studies in China, 28 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 7 Ghana, 20 Ayder Hospital-Tigray 29 and Harar. 30 The possible explanation might be related to an increment of patients' awareness on the importance of recommended lifestyle modifications to prevent hypertension and its complications as formal education level rises. In addition it might be because illiterate respondents cannot read written information about the disease and recommended lifestyle modification.Another finding of this study was respondents who had monthly income of 3000 ETB and greater were almost six times more likely to be adherent than those with less than 3000 ETB, which was supported by study findings in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 7 and Southern Ethiopia. 18 The explanation might be that those patients with low monthly income cannot afford all domains of the recommended lifestyle and also they might not ever think about the modifications.This study indicated that the odds of being adherent to recommended lifestyle modifications by adult hypertensive patients who had co-morbidities were two times higher compared with patients without co-morbidities. This result was mirrored by findings of studies in Saudi Arabia 7 and Addis Ababa. 8 The possible justification might be that the presence of other co-morbidities and their multiple burdens may incentivize patients to modify their lifestyle based on the recommendations. Also, lifestyle changes are easier to afford than medication, since medication is expensive.According to our study result respondents with good knowledge of the disease were almost twice as likely to be adherent than those with poor knowledge. This was supported by studies done in the USA, 31 Korea, 32 Nigeria, 33 Ayder hospital-Tigray 29 and Addis Ababa. 8 This is probably because knowledgeable patients might know about the disease, its severity, its complications and how it can be prevented, controlled and managed and asks health care providers about ambiguous information about it. Those participants who had good self-efficacy were approximately four times more likely to be adherent than those who had poor self-efficacy, which was supported by studies done in China, 34 Addis Ababa 8 and Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. 35 The possible explanation might be that the more confident patients are that they will be motivated and have emotional well-being to modify their lifestyle based on the recommendations, the more likely they are to be adherent.Since there were no similar studies conducted in this area, this study can offer ideas and information for further studies. The study uses appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics.The quantitative questionnaire might be prone to social desirability bias, because individuals do not want to expose any inability, and the cross-sectional nature of the design makes it difficult to draw causal relationships. The chosen participants might be less representative of other hypertensive patients since the selection process was completely consecutive due to the change of hypertensive patients' appointment schedules from one month to three months because of the COVD 19 pandemic. There might be selection bias. It was very difficult to collect data due to the pandemic of COVD 19.In this study we tried to identify the pattern of adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications and associated factors. The overall adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications among hypertensive patients in this study was very low. Independent predictors of adherence to lifestyle modifications were: marital status, educational level, monthly income, having co-morbidities, knowledge level, and self-efficacy.Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations were forwarded to the concerned body engaged in this area about adherence to life style modifications: Amhara Regional Health Bureau should create programs to increase hypertensive clients' adherence capacity for lifestyle modifications and health-care facility managers should facilitate training for health-care professionals about lifestyle modifications to manage hypertension. Health-care providers should give special attention for the proper practice of lifestyle modifications. Healthcare facilities should provide health education to submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comIntegrated Blood Pressure Control 2020:13 hypertensive clientsabout recommended lifestyle modifications. It is important to increase information access to patients about risk factors, signs and symptoms of hypertension and the management as well as the recommendations of lifestyle modifications. More studies should be conducted on a larger scale especially at regional levels or nationwide to identify gaps in hypertensive patients' adherence to lifestyle modifications and should consider qualitative aspects of the issue. The datasets generated or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author but will be shared for only reasonable request in order to protect participants' anonymity.Ethical clearance and supportive letter were obtained from Wollo University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences Research and Community Service (RCS) office in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. A supportive letter was given to the hospital and permission was obtained to start data collection. After gaining written consent from each respondent by telling each the objective of the study and assuring confidentiality, data collection was commenced anonymously.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-23",10

Koh J et al 2020; Lapostolle et al 2020; Lechien et al 2020) There is limited research on the symptom profile of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.The first and only study in Nigeria that reported the symptomatology of COVID-19 in Lagos State found that admitted early cases of COVID-19 had an average age of 38.1 years, were mostly male and had moderately severe symptoms (66%), while only 16% were asymptomatic. 7 The validity of the findings of this study is limited by its small sample size (only 32 patients) and the fact that the data was obtained from a single isolation centre in Lagos state. (Bowale et al 2020) COVID-19 is a new and rapidly evolving disease. Understanding the symptoms profile of the infection is important in formulating a practicable approach to rapidly identify cases and assess the course of infection. This will improve treatment outcomes and reduce disease transmission and death rates. Assessing the relationship between symptom severity and COVID-19 outcomes may provide some insights into the understanding of the disease and its risk or protective factors. The objective of this study is to use data from a large cohort of the first 2184 patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 admitted in nine isolation and treatment centres in Lagos State, to describe the pattern of symptoms and predictors of mortality from COVID-19. It is hoped that these findings will fill some critical gaps in research on COVID-19 in Nigeria and provide locally relevant evidence on COVID-19 among Nigerians. The findings will also inform state and national policy and decision-making to improve health outcomes for the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.The cases reported in this study were patients admitted at all of the nine treatment centres in Lagos state, Southwest Nigeria, though their places of residence were diverse in the Lagos Metropolis. Treatment centers refer to a place that provides in-patient hospital care specifically for COVID-19 cases.This was a retrospective study using medical records of 2184 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done with nasooropharyngeal and sputum specimens that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using realtime reverse transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in accordance with the protocol established by the World Health Organisation.(WHO 2020) Patients were considered negative and discharged after a negative PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 virus test. All patients were treated with Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Vitamin C, Vitamin D and Zinc.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Data extraction and analysis: Data were extracted from electronic medical records of the 2,184 patients as maintained by the case management teams at the hospital or isolation centres. We obtained data on patients age, gender, admitting facility, presenting symptoms, severity of initial presenting symptoms, the presence of co-morbidities and patient's final outcome (i.e. Dead or Discharged).Patient's severity at presentation was based on clinical parameters and the need for oxygen and assisted ventilation. Mild patients are those who were asymptomatic at presentation; Moderate, if patient presented with fever, cough, respiratory rate <30breaths per minutes and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (spO2) >90% for adults and >92% for children. A patient with grunting respiration, respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, spO2 <90% for adults and <92% for children requiring oxygenation was classified as severe while a patient with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was classified as critical. Our case definition was adapted from a handbook on clinical experience in China (Yu 2020) STATA version 16 (StataCorp, USA) was used to conduct the data analysis.Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as means (SD) while categorical variables were presented in tables as frequencies and percentages. To determine the variables associated with COVID-19 deaths, we first of all conducted a bivariate analysis using the student's T test and the Pearson's chi square tests for continuous or categorical variables respectively. Thereafter, we conducted two multivariable logistic regression models using variables that were significant at p<0.2. (Hosmer et al 2013 , Lee et al 2014 The first model was designed to determine the socio-demographic and clinical predictors of COVID19 death, while the second model was designed to identify the presenting symptoms most predictive of COVID-19 death among our COVID-19 patients. Variables that were collinear were dropped from the analysis. Results were presented in adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Ethics: Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. All patient data was anonymized and handled only by authorized personnel in order to ensure confidentiality.Data from two thousand one hundred and eighty-four (2,184) laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients presenting in nine treatment facilities in Lagos state. The ages of the patients ranged from 4 days to 98 years with a mean of 43.0(SD16.0) years. More than half (53.2%) were aged between 30 and 50 years. Only 2.9 % were children i.e. less than 18 years of age) while 3.8% were aged 70 years and older. The patients were mostly male (65.8%) and seen in in government owned COVID-19 treatment facilities (97%). More than half (57.5%) were tested within a hospital setting while 42.4% were tested at designated ambulatory centreand thereafter referred to the isolaton and treatment centres.At presentation, majority were considered to have mild disease, while 6.8% of them were either in severe or critical condition at presentation. Less than a quarter (22.5%) presented with at least one other comorbidity. Of these, 25.4% presented with more than one comorbidity. The cases fatality rate was 4.3%.(Tables 1& 2)Of the patients who presented with symptoms, cough (19.3%) was the most common presenting symptom. This was followed by fever (13.7%), difficulty in breathing, (10.9%) headaches (7.3%), weakness (6.3%), loss of sense of smell and taste (4.9%), throat irritation (4.9%), chest pain (3.8%), body pains (3.2%), nasal congestion (2.4%) and diarrhea (2.4%). All other symptoms were experienced by less than 1% of the patients. Figure 1 displays symptoms profile of patients. We report all symptoms that were presented by at least 2 patients. All other symptoms were presented by only one patient and include: hoarse voice, tooth pain, easy satiety, dry mouth, dark urine, frequent urination, stained mucus, body rash, bleeding, hemiparesis, increased thirst, hiccups, hearing impairment, metallic taste, swollen feet, leg shaking, tingling sensations, anorexia, osteoarthritis, vaginal discharge, weight loss, anxiety, convulsion, ear heaviness, excessive sweating, constipation and body itchingThe bivariate analysis showed that more deaths occurred among older patients, males and patients admitted in non-government treatment facilities (p<0.05). Also, more deaths occurred in patients who were considered as being severe or critical at presentation also had more deaths.More deaths also occurred in persons with existing co-morbidities and this increased with increasing number of co-morbidities. The most significant predictor of death was the severity of initial presentation. Patients presenting in a severe/critical state were 153 times more likely to have J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f died (95%CI:30.74-766.35) while those presenting in a moderate state were 6.33 times (95%CI: This is the first study that reports the pattern of presenting symptoms and predictors of death among a large cohort of PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nigeria, and one of the first in sub Saharan Africa. COVID-19 patients with dyspnea may have a higher risk of severe and critical disease outcomes. In our study, difficulty in breathing was the most significant predictive symptom More than half (58.3%) of patients in our study were asymptomatic and often reluctant to be admitted into isolation units. These patients though asymptomatic, can transmit the virus to others and as a result serve as an important source of hospital and community-based transmission. Two separate reviews of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections report slightly lower figures, ranging from 1.6% to 51.8% in the first review and 40%-45% of asymptomatic cases in the second review. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Nigeria and one of the first in sub Saharan Africa to explore the symptomatology and predictors of mortality using data from a large cohort of COVID 19 patients in several treatment facilities. It however has some important limitations and the findings should be interpreted with some caution. First, data on symptoms was obtained by self-report and may be subject to recall or reporting bias. Secondly, inferences on causality cannot be made due to the cross-sectional nature of data extraction.Thirdly, this represents finding from the early stages of a dynamic and rapidly changing pandemic and the evidence provided may change over time or as more data becomes available.Nevertheless, this study provides valuable evidence on the symptom profile and predictors of mortality for COVID-19 at a time where evidence from African countries is sparse.Conclusion: Respiratory symptoms i.e. cough and difficulty in breathing, as well as fever are the most common presenting symptoms for the COVID-19 patients in our study. Difficulty in breathing is the most important symptom predictive of COVID-19 death. Body weakness and cough are also predictive symptoms of poor outcomes.. Severe symptoms at presentation, which may be brought about by late presentation, is the most significant predictor of death. Males, patients with coexisting morbidities and increasing age have poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Primary care physicians and COVID-19 frontline workers should maintain a high index of suspicion and prioritize the care of patients presenting with these symptoms. Emphasis should be placed on older males with comorbid conditions. Community members should ensure that patients with these symptoms seek care early to reduce the risk of deaths associated with COVID-19.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Postfusion trimers could be expressed to protect the virus from the host immune response, as it shields the prefusion trimers from the neutralizing antibodies. Thus it is essential to be considered during vaccine formulation.The most impressive aspect is that both isoforms of the spike trimers are flexible to tilt out of the viral membrane with a tilting angle range 0 0 -90 0 , while the membrane-proximal stalk region acts as a flexible hinge. This view is critical in vaccine development as the head domain's base and the stalk region can be accessible for neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the spike trimers are sparsely distributed over the virion membrane giving more chances for antibodies to go through the inner parts of the trimer having a lower level of glycan protection.The Overall, the authors bring to light the details of spike protein structure on the virion surface using cryo-EM, which could be a hub in immunogene design for vaccination.","Egypt","first author","2020-10-30",10

SARS-CoV-2 infection has then become a threat to public health. This disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is affecting patients of a mild disease in most of them. However, in few cases, patients develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [13] .Until today, no specific vaccine has been developed to stop the spread of the virus and the need of a cure is now urgent. Viruses possess the ability to adapt and mutate quickly, leading research to find new therapeutic approaches. The main approach is to block the life cycle of the virus or to interfere in its fusion with the membrane so that the life cycle can be interrupted [14] [15] [16] [17] .Another approach is the development of new drugs based on computational research tools. These tools are now fundamental to gain time and accuracy for developing new pharmacophores [18] [19] [20] . The process of identifying novel antiviral drugs to face the disease can rely on the screening of existing natural compounds known for their antiviral activity [21] .As flavonoids (Fig 1) are one of the most widely distributed plant compounds and play essential roles in plant physiology, they have been intensively investigated. In plants, flavonoids are mainly synthesized as aglycones, glycosides and methylated derivatives. They are biosynthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway, transforming phenylalanine into 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which then enters the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway [22] . They possess a wide range of biological activities such as antioxidant [23] [24] [25] [26] , anticancer [27, 28] , antibacterial [29, 30] , antifungal [31] and antiviral activity [32] [33] [34] . Different classes of flavonoids display antiviral activities in vitro and in vivo specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin [35, 36] .Flavonols, the most widely spread flavonoids (Fig 1) are characterized by a 3-hydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one backbone; and quercetin is the first representative compound and the most extensively investigated. Recent investigations also pointed out the antiviral activity of quercetin against a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains. It interacts with influenza hemagglutinin protein, thereby inhibiting viral-cell fusion [37] . Several other flavonols and derivatives have antivirals activities as a sulfated substituted rutin, showing significant activity against different HIV-1 isolates [38] . Several flavonoids are known by inhibiting virus proliferation either by stopping virus multiplication or by blocking cell entry. Indeed, several natural compounds including baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, nicotianamine and glycyrrhizin were predicted to have a capacity to binding ACE2 receptor with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2effects [36] . Moreover, quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechingallate, gallocatechingallate and kaempferol were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL hydrolase [39] . Proteases and spike proteins are targets of choice for inhibition of SARS and MERS, and constant work is made to find novel molecules which can be able to interfere with virus life cycle either by computational methods or by experimental investigation [17, [40] [41] [42] .The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a chymotrypsine like hydrolase (3CL hydrolase) is an attractive target for anti-CoV drug design due to its responsibility for the maturation of main functional enzymes such as replicase and helicase [43] [44] [45] .In this work, a screening of natural flavonoids has been made and their potential inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by molecular docking and molecular dynamics has been tested. Indeed, our computed data suggest that strong interaction occur between flavonoids with sugar moieties and the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2virus. These results can represent a promising starting point for antiviral therapies that are alternative to the vaccination strategy.The three-dimensional structure of flavonoids were obtained from PubChem, in.sdf format and the structures were optimized using the Avogadro software and saved as mol2 files. The 3D structure of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) (PDB ID: 6LU7) protein was obtained from Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). The resolution of the retrieved structure was 2.16 Å. The Mpro 3D structure was loaded into UCSF Chimera for molecular docking preparation [46] .The inhibitory effect of thirty eight flavonoids on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was studied by docking experiments using Autodock Vina software. The protease crystal structure consists of a 306 residues length chain with an excellent resolution of 2.16 Å co-crystallized with an engineered peptide inhibitor (N3) [47] . UCSF Chimera was used to remove all water molecules, heteroatoms, and co-crystallized solvent. The inhibitor was also abstracted from the PDB file and saved as a PDB file and used as positive control during docking studies. Finally, polar hydrogens and partial charges were added to the structure using UCSF Chimera point for antiviral therapies that are alternative to the vaccination strategy [46] . Molecular docking was finally performed by the AutoDock Vina [48] program in a rectangular box. The retained flavonoids were those with conformations of lower binding energy which are matching the active site defined by the co-crystallized N3 inhibitor.Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the GROMACS 2020 package using CHARMM36 force field installed on Linux system [49, 50] . The protein topology was prepared with the pdb2gmx tool. The protein complexes were solvated in a triclinic box.Energy minimization of the system was performed by using the steepest descent algorithm [51] . Protein was solvated by TIP3 solvent model and 4 Na + ions were introduced into the system to make the whole system neutral. The complexes consisting of the flavonoids and the Mpro were solvated in a water box with a minimal margin of 1.5 Å from any edge to any protein atom. An overall pressure and a temperature equal to 1 bar and 300 K were used with a time gap of 2 fs to stabilize the system. Temperature was kept constant inside the box, the vrescale, an optimized Berendsen thermostat temperature coupling technique, was used. Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling method was utilized in NPT equilibration. Energy minimization of the system was carried out by the steepest descent algorithm for 50,000 iteration steps and cut-off up to 1000 kJ.mol -1 to reduce the steric clashes. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to treat long-range electrostatics interactions with a Coulomb cut-off of 1.0 nm. The system was subjected to a final 50 ns molecular dynamic run each step of 2 fs.Trajectory analysis was performed using various GROMACS analysis tools. The gmx rms, and gmx rmsf tools were respectively used to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of protein. Hydrogen bonds were analyzed using gmx hbond tool, and the radius of gyration with the gyrate tool. Finally, plots were prepared using Grace Software.The crystallographic structure of 3C like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB id: 6LU7) in complex with a peptide-like inhibitor (N3) was made very recently available in the Protein Data Bank. From the above mentioned structure, we can clearly see a closed binding pocket around the peptide-like inhibitor.Docking of all flavonoid structures (Fig 2) was done against the active site of Mpro protein. Docking analysis provided several configurations that were scored to determine favorable binding modes. The flavonoid structures with the highest docking scores are summarized in Table 1 . The three compounds with highest affinity (Fig 2) for the active site are quercetin 3-rhamonoside, myricetin 3-rutinoside and rutin with binding energies of -9.7, -9,3 and -9.2 kcal.mol -1 respectively. These values are higher than those obtained for the N3 inhibitor (-7.5 kcal.mol -1 ).Thirty eight flavonoids have been tested in this study by molecular docking against the active site of the SARS-CoV-2Mpro. The results which are summarized in Table 1 show that natural aglycone flavonoids possess high docking scores; with a maximum score achieved by EGCG with -7,9 kcal.mol -1 .This value is comparable to the score obtained for N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6LU7), used here as a positive control (-7,7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, we can clearly see that glycosylated flavonoids display the highest scores; with a maximum value of 9,7 kcal.mol -1 for quercetin 3-rhamnoside. As shown in Fig 3, quercetin 3-rhamnoside is well installed in the active site and the position is matching with the N3 peptide inhibitor.The best compounds possess sugar moieties in their structure, and the position seems to be important. Compounds substituted at the carbon 3 display higher scores than those substituted at the carbone 7. Genistin, a flavonoid substituted at position 7 displays low score (-7,5 kcal. mol -1 ) compared to datiscin or hyperoside (-8,2; -8,4 kcal.mol -1 ) among others. Glycosylated flavonoids as SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors: A molecular docking and simulation studiesThe nature of the sugar moiety is also important to the activity.As we can see, the top 5 compounds are flavonols and they possess either a rhamnose or a rutinoside (a dissaccharide: Glucose-Rhamnose) at position 3. Quercetin 3-Rhamnoside (Fig 3) and myricetin 3-Rutinoside bind with more strength than datiscin which is substituted at position 3 with glucose.However, low bioavailability of flavonoids is a major inconvenient to their use as natural drugs. The presence of sugar moieties usually leads to enhanced bioavailability of the respective flavonoid aglycone depending on the nature of the substituted sugar. Flavonoids with glucose moieties seems to be absorbed more rapidly than flavonoids with rhamnosides, rhamnoglucosides, rutinosides and neohesperidosides substitutions [52] . It is assumed that bioavailability of glyco-flavonoids is achieved by aglycone part in blood plasma after the cleavage of the glycosidic part by hydrolyzing enzymes in the human gastrointestinal tract [53] . Glucose moieties are easily hydrolyzed in the small intestine epithelial cells. However, the lack of α-L -rhamnosidase or rutinosidase in human cells makes the bioavailability of relative flavonoids largely dependent on their hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria [53] . Furthermore, few intestinal bacterial strains can achieve cleavage of these types of bonds [54] .Discovery studio visualizer was further used to determine hydrogen bonds occurring between amino acids of the active site and flavonoids (Fig 5) . The N3 inhibitor was docked to the SARS-CoV-2Mpro to be further compared to docked generated model with Autodock vina. The superimposed structures of the co-crystallized N3 inhibitor (Fig 4) are closely related indicating a good accuracy of the automated tool.Results (Table 2) show that compounds that undertake bonds with the highest strength usually bind to Thr26, Ty54, His41, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145and Glu166 in the substrate binding subsite S1 Fig for the proteolytic activity [55, 56] , leading to strong binding due to hydrogen bonds. Mpro consists of three domains and substrate binding site resides in a cleft between domain I and II, while domain III is involved in catalytic function. Dimerization of the protein is required for its catalytic regulation [57] . Glu166 residue is a key amino acid involved in the dimerization of Mpro and creation of substrate binding pocket [45, 58] . Cys141 and His41 residue forms a catalytic dyad on the active site of the protein essential for its catalytic function. Similar results were recently obtained by molecular docking with different molecules against the Mpro protein [57, 59, 60] . Quercetin 3-Rhamnose, a flavonol with a rhamnose at position 3 of the C ring, is involved in several hydrogen bonds contracted with Thr26, Phe140, Leu141 and Gly143 (Fig 5A) .The second and third flavonoids with highest affinity, myrictin 3-Rutinoside and rutin are also flavonols but with a rutinoside (Glucose-Rhamnose) at the 3 position. Fig 5B and 5C show that both compounds display hydrogen bonds with Mpro leading to high affinity binding to the active site. Results show that glycosylated flavonols with a sugar moiety at position 3 with at least a rhamnose in their structure are the compounds that bind with higher affinity to the active site pocket of the Mpro.Molecular dynamics simulations are of proven in-silico methods for obtaining dynamic data at atomic spatial resolution [2, 51] . The docked Mpro complexes with the three compounds with highest scores: Quercetin -3 Rhamnose, Myricetin 3-rutinoside and Rutin were subjected to MD simulations for 50 ns to analyze the stability of the complexes.RMSD plot is usually used to understand the stability of the complex while RMSF is used to understand the structural flexibility (Fig 6) The Mpro in complex with rutin (green) showed the most stable RMSD during the 50 ns simulation around 0.2 nm. The M pro with compound Myricetin 3-rutinoside (red) is also stable and constant range of RMSD between 0.15 nm and 0.25 nm. Slight increase was observed after 40 ns simulation. The quercetin 3-rhamnose (black) showed stable RMSD between 5 and 40 ns with values close to 0.3 nm. After 40 ns RMSD value decreased to 0.25 nm (Fig 6) . The differences of backbone RMSD in quercetin 3-Rhamnoside and myricetin 3-rutinoside indicate that M pro undergoes conformational changes.RMSF trajectories provide important information regarding the stability of the complex. High fluctuations in the plot indicate more flexibility and unstable bonds. On the other side, low value or less fluctuation indicates well structured regions in the complex and less distortion. As depicted in Fig 6, all the systems showed almost similar patterns. The overall value of RMSF for all the three complexes was around 0.1 nm as clearly seen in Fig 6. In order to determine the compactness of the system, Rg was plotted against time. Higher Rg values illustrate less compactness with conformational entropy, while low Rg values are The simulation Rg values of the three compounds reported as 2.2-2.3 nm. The fewer changes in the Rg value showed the stability of the protein in the complex suggesting that the binding of these three molecules does not induce structural changes. The Rg range of the three complexes (Fig 7) support their condensed architecture as well as size. Moreover; potential and kinetic energy plots confirm the stability of the complexes (S1 Fig). Hydrogen bonding plays an essential role in determining the binding strength between ligands and protein. Rutin (green) id (black) has constant range of hydrogen bond between 2 to 4 in whole simulation while quercetin 3-rhamnose and myricetin 3-rutinoside showed changes in bonding. More hydrogen(>6) bonds between 10 to 25 ns for myricetin 3-rutinoside, suggesting a conformational change in the binding site during simulation (Fig 7) . Over all, observation suggested that Mpro protein in complex with the three compounds is stable during simulation. However, it is clear that rutin complex is more stable and therefore a better candidate as potential drug for inhibiting the Mpro protein.Until now, the spread of SARS-CoV-2has stimulated research to find an existing drug for a rapid treatment. At that time, the confirmed cases are over 7 million and rising, and the deaths are approaching 400000, and governments fear a second infection wave. Isolation strategy was mandatory to limit the spread of the virus, but solutions have to be found urgently. The main protease taken into account as molecular target for stopping the spread of the virus is an interesting strategy.Results show that glycosylated flavonoids display a strong inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Glycosylated flavonoids seems to bind with more strength than the N3 co-crystallized inhibitor. The binding of the flavonoids at the protease active site is clearly structure dependant. Compounds binding with more strength are flavonols substituted with mono or disaccharides at position C3. The nature of sugar is also primordial to the activities, as flavonoids with a rhamnose possess the strongest binding affinity. As flavonoids with rhamnose moiety undergo no or little modification in the intestine, they might be a good candidate in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2coronavirus.

It has caused worldwide major disruption in public health and in social aspects, as well as in the economy. It is an infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Airborne transmission of the virus is the primary mode of transmission. Through sneezing, coughing and breathing, both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit this virus by contaminating the air around them. Uncovered cough can expel droplets up to 4 m [1] . Droplets and aerosols created by these infected individuals are inhaled by uninfected individuals. Experimental research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in aerosols [2, 3] . In addition, virus containing droplets and aerosols eventually settle down due to gravity, contaminating surfaces where the virus can survive for a long time. It is known that in favourable conditions, SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel (7 days), treated wood and cloth (2 days) cardboard (24 h) and the outer layer of surgical masks for up to 7 days [4] . This makes these surfaces a potential vehicle for virus transmission through contact, and it stresses the importance of hand hygiene. This is a general review covering infection control aspects in dentistry during the COVID pandemic. A literature search was made at National Library of Medicine, Pubmed.gov using key words such as ""dentistry and COVID"" (357 publications), ""dentistry and COVID and infection control"" (70 publications). Publications related to behaviour, education, ethics, treatment and childcare were excluded. Publications describing general aspects of infection control were reviewed.Saliva is an important source of transmission due to aerosols created through natural activities such as breathing, sneezing and coughing, posing potential danger to healthy uninfected individuals as well as healthcare workers in medical facilities. However, dental personnel who work in close proximity to the oral cavity are at a greater risk due to the extensive aerosols created during dental treatment particularly during the use of high speed drills, ultrasonic scalers and air/water syringes.SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in saliva samples of 87-100% of clinical patients [5, 6, 7] . Moreover, in a study on COVID-19 positive patients, it was shown that posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were serially positive for viral load from the onset of symptoms to 25 days, whereas the serum samples were positive only for 14 days [7] . There are three pathways for SARS-CoV-2 to be present in saliva: the direct exchange of secretions from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and the oral cavity. The latter is the first and most important pathway. Gingival crevicular fluid present in the gingival crevice is rich with blood components and can also add viruses to the saliva. Lastly, major and minor salivary glands can be a source of this virus [8] because epithelial cells of salivary gland ducts are found to be an early target for SARS-CoV infections [9] through Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor to invade cells [10] .Following infection control principles and measures is a moral obligation of all healthcare workers. Dentistry is no exception. Infection control is important in dentistry because patient saliva may be contaminated with oral commensals and opportunistic pathogens. In addition, it can harbour specific pathogens during infection as well as during the carrier state, including SARS-CoV-2. Due to the nature of the dental procedures, exposure to the blood and saliva aerosols is unavoidable. Direct contact with fluid contaminated environmental surfaces, instruments and equipment are also a potential source of pathogen transmission. In a dental practice the dentist, dental assistant, instrument processing and administration staff, as well as the patients are at risk of transmission of infections. Dental laboratory staff members are also at risk due to the cross contamination between the clinic and the laboratory. In addition, it can be extended to their families if the infection control measures are not taken correctly. Therefore, historically step by step infection control measures have been recommended by the CDC and countries across the globe have drawn up individual country specific guidelines [11] . These infection control measures were drawn up with the understanding of the chain of infection and cross contamination. Infection control measures can be grouped into 6 categories as shown in Figure 1 . These standard precautions, previously called universal precautions, covered all the aspects of infection control required in dental settings and they will not be discussed here.What has changed in the infection control in dental practice during the present pandemic? Little if any research is available regarding transmission of COVID-19 in a dental setting. However, past literature of possible transmission of infections in dental settings, the known route of transmission and pathogenesis of COVID-19, the highly infectious nature of the causative virus and perhaps the requirement of low infectious dose, suggest the urgent need for modification of infection control measures. In addition, pre-and post-symptomatic and completely asymptomatic carriers can transmit the causative virus. He et al., (2020) has shown that viral shedding may begin 5-6 days before the appearance of the first symptoms. Presymptomatic carriers are difficult to identify. Although the viral load is shown to be the highest at the time of symptom onset, the infectiousness of the virus peaks on or before symptom onset [12] . Therefore, any person who enters into the surgery may be a potential source of transmission. The infection control regime can be modified for the current pandemic and thereafter for the long term endemic era. Many countries have banned or restricted dental procedures allowing only the minimum emergency treatment. This is not economical and not a long term solution. Therefore, if the dental practices are allowed to operate, until the vaccine is available, drastic infection control measures are required to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Thereafter during the endemic period the standard precautions can be applied.Generally the history of a patient is taken just before examination. During the present pandemic the urgency of dental treatment should be determined before booking the patient. Before the appointment, a general history should be taken telephonically, via e-mails or other internetbased systems [13] . A COVID-19 screening questionnaire including symptoms, contacts and travel history should be taken. If it provides any indication of presence or possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the patient requires urgent treatment, extra infection control measures should be taken. During the peak epidemic period, non-emergency procedures should be postponed. If an appointment is made, the patient should be requested to come alone and wear a mask. If a patient requires assistance, only one person should be allowed while also wearing a mask and with a completed COVID-19 questionnaire. Heliyon 6 (2020) e05402Minimum and absolutely essential items should be left open and exposed. Toys and magazines should be removed. The administration and patient waiting area should be separated with a glass or plastic panel. A minimum number of chairs must be placed 6 feet apart either in the corridor or in the waiting area. Hand sanitisers containing 70% alcohol or other approved substance should be available for the patient and the accompanying person. Patients should be booked for 30 min longer than the required treatment time to allow step by step precautionary measures to take place and to minimise the number of waiting individuals and patients. Minimum administration staff with mask, social distancing and hand hygiene should be allowed and if it is not possible due to space constraints, staff should be rostered for working hours without an overlap. Transfer of patient records and related administrative material from the treatment area to the administration area should be avoided. Apart from the screening questionnaire, temperatures should be taken for all the individuals entering the practice using a contact free laser thermometer.Mouth rinses containing antimicrobial compounds are commonly used for general oral hygiene and therapy. Among these antimicrobial compounds, the most commonly used are chlorhexidine, fluoride, triclosan, cetylpyridinium chloride, essential oils and iodine. The use of a therapeutic antimicrobial mouth rinse prior to the dental treatment can reduce aerosol contamination. It has been shown that cetylpyridinium chloride with or without domiphen bromide can reduce the bacterial burden by 57% [14, 15] . Although chlorhexidine with antibacterial and antifungal properties have been effectively used in dentistry, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Corona virus pneumonia (5 th edition) of the National Health Commission of the Republic of China, it may not be significantly effective against SARS-CoV-2 [16] . Kampf et al. [17] , also showed that chlorhexidine was less effective against Corona viruses, however they investigated the efficacy at 0.02%. Nevertheless up to 0.2% can be used on the mucous membrane in the form of a mouth rinse. Therefore, further research should be done to explore the efficacy and possible use of 0.1-0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse before dental treatment.Based on a surface disinfectant study on Corona viruses as a mouth rinse, the use of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 1% povidone iodine have been recommended [17, 18, 19] . Povidone iodine is generally used in the maintenance of oral health and in the prevention and treatment of oral infections as it is safe to use [20] . Although hydrogen peroxide is a known carcinogen, it has been used in cosmetic products as a beaching agent and in mouth rinses. At low concentrations used occasionally it has beneficial effects [21, 22] . In a study on patients admitted to the intensive care unit, 3% hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse reduced the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia [21] . Carrouel et al, [23] have proposed the use of β-cyclodextrin together with a flavone, Citrox, to reduce the carriage of this virus. However, it requires further research to establish its efficacy. Since no data are currently available, use of any antimicrobial mouth rinse may reduce the number of microorganisms including SARS-CoV-2. During this pandemic period, patients should be advised to brush their teeth and use antimicrobial mouth rinse before they appear for dental treatment. Alternatively mouth rinse can be provided by the practitioner prior to the treatment. Since 62-71% ethanol has been shown to be effective against Corona viruses within 1 min [17] , perhaps oral gel containing ethanol can be developed and applied in the oral cavity prior to dental treatment. The concentration of ethanol might be higher for use in the oral cavity, since it will soon become diluted due to the water spray during treatment and cleared by high and low volume evacuators. Due to the organic nature of saliva some of the antimicrobials may not be effective. Alcohol might be a better option because it was found to be effective within 30 s in the presence of organic material such as serum [24, 25] .Barriers and personal protective gear are even more important in the dental practice because of the nature of the treatment. The use of high speed hand pieces and the use of water and air create saliva and blood contaminated aerosol (<50 μM size particles) or splatter (>50 μM size particles) [26, 27] . This aerosol contaminates an area of up to a distance of 8 feet from the patient's oral cavity [28] . Figure 2 shows the spread of aerosol around the patient including the back of the dental chair. With a use of a simulation model, Veena et al. [29] , have shown that during ultrasonic scaling, the aerosols can extend up to 4 feet from the back of the chair. They also showed that the operator and the assistant's head, chest, arms and face mask were heavily contaminated. Even the inside of the face masks were contaminated. Therefore, appropriate gloves, mask, protective gowns, eye and hair cover has to be used. N95 or surgical masks are generally recommended. Nevertheless, the fit of the mask, proper positioning of the mask, movement by the wearer, length of the facial hair and voice level while speaking, all affect the bacterial filtration [30] . Facial shields covering the forehead, eyes and mask should preferably be used. Hair should be short and covered with a disposable cover. For males, beard should be removed. Although before and after patient treatment in the dental practice, hand hygiene is a prerequisite during the COVID-19 outbreak, it must be enforced. It should be practiced before and after patient contact, before putting on and after removing personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves. Hand hygiene after removing PPE is particularly important. Gowns must be high collared, long sleeved and long enough to cover street clothes. A disposable long sleeve high collar protective plastic apron can be used over the gown. Closed shoes must be worn. Aerosol settles down slowly contaminating surfaces and floor, therefore during this epidemic disposable shoe covers should be used.Studies have shown that aerosol cloud remains around the dental chair for more than 30 min after scaling [29, 31] , therefore the protective barriers should not be removed immediately after the procedure.In the treatment area only essential items and instruments should be exposed. The dental chair should be covered with thick plastic that can be disinfected before and after patient treatment. Spray and wipe technique should be used for the disinfection of all the exposed areas including chair, surfaces, light and handles. Dental prostheses, impressions and other prosthodontic materials should be disinfected before receiving and sending them to the dental laboratory.According to CDC recommendation patient-care items (dental instruments, devices and equipment) are categorised as critical, semicritical and non-critical. Semi-critical and critical items should be sterilised as most items are heat-tolerant. Heat-sensitive items should be processed with high-level disinfectant or sterilant. During the pandemic aerosol generating procedures should be avoided if at all possible, bearing in mind that economic effect may be punitive. If not then as many procedures as possible should be carried out under rubber dam. Figure 2 shows the extent of contamination during high speed procedures. Therefore, hand pieces and air/water syringes preferably should not be used. Using hand instrument procedures such as the atraumatic restorative technique should be performed wherever possible and indicated [11, 32] . A large bore tip (8 mm diameter or more) can remove air at the rate of 100 cubic feet per minute reducing aerosol and splatter by 93-96% [11, 33, 34] . Therefore, where possible during procedures high volume evacuators should be used.Chlorine based disinfectants are known to act as high-level disinfectant and sterilants. Chlorine-based disinfectants have proved to be effective against Corona viruses [17] . They can be used on non-metal surfaces and floors, however care should be taken due to its corrosiveness. The effective concentration is 2000 mg/L which can be used to wipe high frequency contact surfaces. In addition, chlorinated solutions are not stable and therefore they have to be prepared fresh for use which has time and cost implications. Chlorinated compound such as Sodium dichloro isocyanurate is also beneficial because it is stable and proved to have antiviral effect [35] . Ethyl alcohol (70%) can also be used which is relatively inert and evaporates rapidly leaving surfaces dry. Benzalkonium chloride with or without Isopropyl alcohol has also shown antibacterial and antiviral properties [17, 36] . Slow release solution-based chlorine dioxide which has shown to have multipurpose use in dentistry should be further explored [37, 38] . It can be used as a surface disinfectant and to disinfect impression material. It can also be used in the dental unit water line (DUWL) and as a mouth rinse [39, 40, 41, 42] . Some chlorine dioxide tablets contain anticorrosive compounds which can be of additional advantage particularly in dentistry where many instruments are made of metal. Diluted alcohol can last for a long time. Floors should be wiped with a disinfectant twice a day.DUWLs are potential sources of microorganisms due to the development of microbial biofilms and intermittent release of microorganisms into the treatment water. Many DUWLs has an anti-retraction valve which prevents the suck-back effect where the contaminated water is sucked from the patient's oral cavity contaminating the DUWL system. Therefore, dental practitioners should evaluate the anti-retraction valve or have it installed. A different type of water is used in the DUWL depending on the type of dental chair and the system. Treatment water can be either potable municipal water or from a dental chair reservoir which can be filled with sterile or nonsterile distilled water or disinfectant. All DUWL should carry disinfectant, therefore dental chair units that do not have reservoirs and connect to municipal water supplies should be immediately converted to reservoirs into which potable disinfectants can be placed. Chlorinated disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide and hypochlorous acid should be considered which has shown efficacy in the DUWL disinfection. In addition several studies have recommended a weekly shock treatment of DUWLs using a high-level disinfectant.Sterilizers should be inspected and the efficacy should be determined using conventional biological, chemical and mechanical indicators [11] .The success of an effective infection control program depends on proper office design. Floor plan, traffic flow, fixtures, dental chair, instrument processing and the recirculation area should be considered. The requirements are described in the 2003 CDC guidelines for infection control in dental settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not economical to refurbish the practice but some modifications can be done to prevent cross contamination and transmission of infectious material. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and UV chambers in the ventilation system can reduce the aerosol related contamination [24] . An UV chamber with HEPA filters is ideal because regular decontamination of filters is not necessary. If possible these filters should be installed directly above the dental chair with an air flow as such that the contaminated air can be filtered. In the dental practice the air flow should be from the waiting and administration area to the room with the dental chair. The contaminated air from the dental chair area should not be spreading or circulating into the non-treatment area. During patient treatment portable HEPA filters are recommended by CDC (2019) which can be placed in the vicinity of the patient's chair. This can reduce particle count including droplets in the room [32] . In addition to the ventilation and air circulation, use of UV germicidal irradiation should be considered. Bathroom air extractors should run continuously during consulting times. Generally no carpets are allowed in dental practices. Floor material and upholstery of the dental chair should have minimum stitching. The floor must be disinfected twice a day. The dental chair can be covered with plastic which can also be disinfected before and after patient treatment and at the beginning and at the end of the day. Medical waste can be disposed according to the local regulations. Staff should be educated with regards to all the infection control principles and practices.In conclusion, infection control has always been important in dentistry, however, during epidemics and pandemics of air borne infections extra precautions are required. Generally in medical facilities, patients can only transmit pathogens through coughs, sneeze and direct contacts, whereas in dentistry with the creation of saliva aerosols the pathogens are literally removed from the nasopharynx and oral cavity, and spread around contaminating air and surfaces. In dental practices, many people such as the practitioner, assistant, patients, administration staff, cleaning staff and perhaps accompanying individuals are at risk. Standard precautions, although they are good, are not enough during this pandemic caused by the highly infectious and easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2. Adequate PPE and hand hygiene are unavoidable, however, hair and shoe cover should be considered. The sequence of consultation and scheduling of patient appointments and modification in the waiting area are also important. To minimise contamination by aerosols, mouth rinses before treatment, although it is an additional cost to the practitioner should be considered. Major alterations of practices are not economical and often not possible. Nevertheless, ventilators with HEPA filters can greatly reduce aerosols and the majority of aerosols can be extracted and filtered through these filters. These measures are summarised in Table 1 . This will reduce aerial, floor and surface contamination. These measures and modifications would also prepare the dental fraternity for similar future experiences.Author contribution statement Dental chair and whatever can be covered must be covered with plastic Before and after treatment all the surfaces including dental chair must be disinfected with 70% alcohol Minimum necessary things must be left out Dental practitioner and assistant must wear high-collar long sleeve gown and plastic apron, gloves, mask, disposable hair and shoe cover and a facial shield (PPE) PPE must not be removed immediately after treatment After treatment unused material must be considered contaminated and should be processed or disposed appropriately Treatment If possible use rubber dam Use high and low volume evacuators If possible do not use high speed handpieces and ultrasonic scalers Instruments, DUWL Heat-resistant things and instruments must be sterilised Sterilisers must be inspected and tested for the efficacy Spay-wipe technique must be used to disinfect everything before and after the treatment 70% alcohol or chlorinated compounds (2000 mg/L) can be used DUWL must be disinfected by flushing with disinfectant DUWL water must be replaced with appropriate disinfectant bearing in mind that the water is used in the patient's oral cavity Floor Floor must be disinfected twice daily with 2000 mg/L chlorinated solutionAir flow must be adjusted to allow clean air coming in to the treatment area from the rest of the surgery Bathroom air extractors must be kept running continuously during consulting time.HEPA filters with UV light must be installed above the dental chair Or portable HEPA filters should be used placing as close as possible to the patient during treatment UV germicidal irradiation should be considered Biohazard waste must be disposed appropriately M.

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the newest member of the family Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV1 and Middle East Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belong to the genus Betacoronavirus, thus, share particular genomic and proteomic similarities. It has been reported that SARS-CoV2 genome shares approximately 80% and 50% similarity with SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, respectively [1, 2] . The structural proteins and enzymes of SARS-CoV2 are 90% homologous to those of SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV [3] . The clinical symptoms at the early stages of the disease include fever, fatigue and dry cough [4, 5] . Progression of the disease to a severe case is manifested as pneumonia and is usually accompanied by dyspnea and dry cough [6] . There are several complications associated with the SARS disease which include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ dysfunction, cardiac injury and systemic inflammation [4, 6] . The structural proteins of SARS-CoV2 namely; spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, play crucial roles during entry and survival of the virus in the host cell. The primary roles of the coronavirus N protein are to interacts with the viral genome and pack them into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure [7] [8] [9] .Notwithstanding, the coronavirus N protein is multifunctional, having critical roles at many stages of the viral life cycle [10] . Notable among them are viral budding [10] , viral assembly [11] , regulation of host cell cycle [12] and regulation of viral mRNA replication [13, 14] . Considering the roles of the N protein and its high expression during viral infections, the N protein can be a promising target for drug and vaccine development. Targeting the N-protein provides opportunities to interfere with coronavirus assembly, transcription and replication. With the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, search for pharmaceutical options are mainly driven by drug repurposing to reduce the drug discovery timeline [15] .Considering the novelty and timing of COVID-19, research groups are beginning to understand aspects of the immunological response to the SARS-CoV2 to aid in the discovery of vaccines. The quest for safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 has resulted in potential candidates with varying strategies and stages of developments.According to reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 10 th August, 2020, 28 vaccine candidates have been registered and are currently in clinical evaluations and 139 candidates in pre-clinical evaluations [16] . Many of these candidates are sub-unit vaccines, as they provide a more logistically workable approach [17] and are capable of inducing both cellular and humoral responses [18] . Majority of the candidates in clinical evaluations target the S protein, considering its immuno-dominant nature.However, there are reports that depict the N-protein as highly immunogenic with antigenic regions that are highly conserved across the coronaviruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The conventional approaches for epitope-based vaccine identification are resourcedemanding, thus, designing epitope-based vaccines using bioinformatics offer a safer, inexpensive and more effective approach. In this paper, we integrate immunoinformatics, structure-based drug discovery and other computational methods to identify potential epitope-based vaccine and drug candidates that target the N-protein of SARS-CoV2. The results reveal potential N-protein epitopes that are highly immunogenic and elicit B-cell immunity, T-cell immunity, virus-specific antibody neutralization and natural killer cell-mediated immunity. The anti-HIV agent, zidovudine triphosphate was identified to potentially inhibit the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein based on binding energy and simulation analysis.The SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) sequence was fetched from the NCBI protein database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QIC53221.1) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) protein sequences were retrieved from the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/). We used the SWISS-MODEL server (https://www.swissmodel.expasy.org/) to generate structures of the SARS-CoV2 Nprotein and the HLA proteins based on the co-ordinates of their respective homologous protein structures available at the protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted using Bepipred 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/index.php) and ElliPro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/), respectively. We used the interface provided by the IEBD web server (http://www.iedb.org/) for the predictions. Bepipred 2.0 uses a Random Forest regression algorithm to predict the probability that a residue of the antigenic protein is a member of an epitope [25] . The algorithm considers several properties of the antigenic residues including surface accessibility, hydrophobicity, secondary structure and polarity [25] . ElliPro combines three algorithms to predict discontinuous epitopes from a protein structure [26] . The first algorithm reconfigures the shape and surface of the query protein structure into an ellipsoid. Based on the ellipsoid shape, another algorithm estimates the protrusion index (PI) of each residue such that when a particular residue is seen outside the ellipsoid shape after 70% of the protein atoms are captured within the ellipsoid shape, then the PI of that residue is 0.7.The last algorithm then determines the discontinuous epitopes by clustering neighboring residues based on a PI cut-off.All T-cell epitopes were predicted using the IEBD web server The predicted epitopes were assessed based on toxicity, allergenicity and ability to induce IFN-γ. The toxicity of the peptides was predicted using a support vector machine-based algorithm developed by Gupta et al. [27] . We used AllerTop [28] to predict the antigenicity of each peptide. The ability of the epitopes to induce IFN-γ was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f predicted by IFNepitope [29] using the hybrid approach (motif and support vector machine).Structural configurations of the selected epitopes were modeled using PEP-FOLD 3 [30] . The peptide models were then simulated using GROMACS 2020.3, following the protocol described in section 2.1.7. A 20 ns run was performed for each epitope and their root mean square deviation was computed using the GROMACS analysis tool.The population coverage analysis tool available at IEBD (http://tools.iedb.org/population) was used to predict the percentage of individuals that would respond to the epitope(s) based on the HLA allele genotypic frequency within their ethnicities/areas. The frequency of HLA genotype within a population is provided by the Allele frequency database (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/).The occurrence of the epitope sequence in other related coronaviruses was analyzed using Clustal omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The Nprotein of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, Human coronaviruses (hCoV) OC43 and NL63were considered for the homology analysis, noting the conservation of the epitope sequences across the related coronaviruses.The best binding conformation of the epitope-HLA complex was determined with Cluspro 2.0 server [31] using the antibody model [32] . The Cluspro algorithm performs three steps in the protein-protein binding prediction [31] . The algorithm performs a rigid-body docking on a very large set of conformations using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-dependent algorithm called PIPER [33, 34] . The docked conformations are the clustered based on root mean square deviation to select representative conformations of lowest energy [31] . The last computational step is energy minimization of the top conformations from step 2 using CHARMM force field [35] . The server is available at https://cluspro.bu.edu/home.php.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe proteins were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS 2020.3 software suite [36] and CHARMM 2019 force filed. The structures were centered in a dodecahedron box, at least 1nm from the edges and solvated with spc216 water model. The system was electrostatically neutralized with 0.154 M NaCl. In order to get rid of inappropriate geometry and steric hindrances, energy minimization was performed on the system using the steepest descent algorithm for 10,000 steps with a maximum force threshold of 100 kJ/mol/nm. Van der-Waals interactions were treated with a single cut-off of 1.216 nm and long-range electrostatics were treated with the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method with 0.16 FFT grid spacing and 4th order B-spline interpolation. Neighbor search was performed every 20 steps using the grid method with Verlet cut-off scheme. Protein and non-protein components of the system were independently coupled to v-rescale thermostat and an isotropic Berendsen algorithm for pressure coupling. The pressure was maintained by weak coupling to a reference pressure of 1 bar, with an isothermal compressibility of 4.6x10-5 bar -1 . The bond lengths within the protein were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. The system was subjected to a 400ps NVT and NPT equilibration, followed by 200 ns simulation using the leap-frog integrator. The trajectories were analyzed with built-in GROMACS commands and all graphic data were generated with the GRACE tool (http://plasmagate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace).The immune response that would be elicited by the predicted epitopes was simulated using the C-ImmSim server (http://150.146.2.1/C-IMMSIM/index.php). C-ImmSim is based on the models developed by Celada-Seiden [37] [38] [39] and operates as an agent-based model that uses machine learning techniques to simulate the immune response towards a particular pathogen. The players of the immune system are represented as agents and the interactions between the agents are guided by set of rules that emanate from present understanding of immunological principles. These principles that are incorporated into the C-ImmSim algorithm include MHC restriction [40] , development of memory [41, 42] , clonal deletion theory [43] , processing and presentation of antigens [44] [45] [46] among others [47] . The algorithm does well to mimic the immune system as it simultaneously simulates immunological processes in the bone J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f marrow (production of lymphoid and myeloid cells), the thymus (T-cell education), and the lymphatic system (immune surveillance) [47] . Three injections were given according to the dose series of 0, 2 and 6 months. All simulation parameters were set at default with time steps set at 1, 180, and 360 (each time step represent 8 hrs in reality).In our structure-based drug discovery approach, we targeted the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein because the domain is reported to have binding pockets for ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates such as adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) [8] .We then retrieved an experimental structure of a related coronavirus in complex with AMP to aid in our analysis of the ligand's binding site in SARS-CoV2 N-protein. The receptor (SARS-CoV2 N-protein) was energy minimized for 10,000 steps using GROMACS 2020.3 and the low-energy structure was used for the analysis.The AMP binding site in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein was elucidated through alignment of protein structures using PyMol 2.2 [48] . The algorithm performs sequence alignment followed by a structural superposition, and then cycle refinement in order to reject structural outliers found during the fitting. Since we were also interested in the all-atom root mean square deviation, we turned off the refinement process.The N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid protein was targeted for potential inhibitors using a library of approved antiviral drugs. RMS cluster tolerance was set to 2.0Å. We clustered the docking conformations based on root mean square deviation and a tolerance of 2.0Å. The docked conformations were evaluated on the basis of binding energy and frequency of pose (cluster).The energy terms governing the protein-ligand interactions were analyzed using The behavior of the protein-ligand complexes at the atomistic level was elucidated with molecular dynamics simulation using the method described in section 2. To determine the regions of SARS-CoV2 N-protein that may induce B-cell immunity, we predicted both linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes using Bepipred We also predicted epitopes that may induce T-cell response against SARS-CoV2, based on ability to interact with specific HLA alleles. With over 3,400 predicted MHC class I restricted epitopes, consideration was given to those below a percentile rank of 0.5%. The percentile rank represents a randomly selected number of epitopes that are graded better than the candidate of interest, hence, a lower percentile rank is preferred.As potential vaccine candidates, the predicted epitopes were profiled according to their toxicity, allergenicity and ability to induce IFN-γ. For the B-cell epitopes, preference was given to the non-toxins and non-allergen candidates with 8-11 amino acid residues. This resulted in 4 B-cell epitope candidates. The MHC-restricted epitopes that were predicted to be non-toxic, non-allergic and capable of inducing IFN-γ were considered for further analysis. This resulted in a total of 9 MHC-restricted epitopes.The sequences of the selected epitopes after the evaluation process are shown in Table   1 .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWe performed molecular dynamics simulation for all the selected epitopes in order to inspect the stability of the peptides at the atomistic level. Prior to that, we built structural models for the epitopes using the PEP-FOLD3.5 server. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) from a 20 ns simulation was computed for each peptide and the results are shown in Table 1 . The RMSD tool compares the simulating model to the initial structural configuration (reference structure) and computes the deviation between the two structures. The epitopes with low RMSD values were selected for further analysis.The aim of the population coverage analysis was to predict the percentage of a population that would respond to the epitopes, considering the frequency of HLA genotypic traits in the population. In general, a higher fraction of the population was predicted to respond to the MHCI-restricted epitope than the MHCII-restricted epitopes. Considering the global population, 75.47% of individuals would respond to the MHCI-restricted epitope while 56.23% of the individuals would respond to the MHCII-restricted epitopes ( Fig. 2A and B) . The lowest population coverage for the epitopes (both MHC I and II) was recorded in Central America and the highest recorded in East Asia (Fig. 2C) . The South African population did not respond very well to the MHCII-restricted epitopes, although there was a significant population coverage in other regions of Africa. The best coverage of the MHCI-restricted epitope was observed in Europe, South Asia, Africa, North and Southern America and the Oceania.In order to check the cross-reactivity of the predicted epitopes across other related coronaviruses, a multiple sequence alignment study was performed using Clustal The interaction between the selected epitopes and their respective HLA proteins were studied using docking and simulation analysis. We predicted the binding conformations of the T-cell epitopes to HLA alleles using the Cluspro 2 server. The best binding conformations of the T-cell epitopes to their respective HLA alleles are shown in the epitope-HLA interactions. Although structural deviation was not significantly different for the MHCII-epitope complexes (Fig. 5B) , the HLA-DRB1*09:01-305 AQFAPSASAFFGMSR 319 complex seems to form the highest number of hydrogen bonds among the MHCII-restricted epitopes with ≈11 hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5D) . The results also suggest that the epitopes remained in close proximity to the HLA alleles with minimum distances ranging from 0.15 to 0.20 nm (Fig. 5E, F) .We used the C-ImmSim server to simulate the immune response to the SARS- observed. The levels of these antibodies were low after the first injection but increased significantly following subsequent doses and this was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of antigen levels (Fig. 6A) . The major cytokines observed were IFN-γ and IL-2 (Fig. 6B) . Protection from B-cells and T-cells were notable along with development of immune memory. The immune memory developed by both B-cells and T-cells lasted for the period of the simulation (Fig. 6C, D) . Other immune cells,including T-cytotoxic cells and natural killer cells, also elicited strong immune response to the antigen (Fig. 6E, F) .The 7B ).A library of 21 antiviral drugs with varying targets was used in our virtual screening analysis. The nomenclature, molecular weight, chemical structure and autodock score (estimated free energy of binding) are provided in Table 2 . Among the studied ligands, pleconaril (PLE), raltegravir (RAL) and zidovudine triphosphate (ZTP) recorded higher J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f free energy of binding than AMP. The binding energy is referred to as 'autodock score' because the value, although efficient at discriminating suitable ligands from nonsuitable ones, does not accurately represent the binding affinity.The molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann and surface area solvation (MM/PBSA) method of binding energy calculation is designed to be more accurate than the docking and scoring approach. For g_mmpbsa binding energy calculations, three energy terms are used namely molecular mechanics, polar solvation and non-polar solvation energies. The molecular mechanics potential energy includes energy of bonded and non-bonded interactions (Van-der Waals and electrostatic energies). The polar solvation term is calculated by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation [52] . The non-polar solvation term was calculated using the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) model and indicates repulsion and attraction between solvent and solute [52] .The total binding energy of ZTP (-1312.837 kJ/mol) is significantly higher as compared to AMP (-108.234 kJ/mol) with major contributions from the electrostatic terms in both cases (Table 3) .The 100 ns simulation revealed that the NTD-ZTP complex seems to be the most stable with RMSD of ≈ 0.3 nm while the NTD-AMP complex recorded RMSD of ≈ 0.35 nm (Fig. 8A) . Evolution of the total hydrogen bonds between the ligands and the NTD are shown in (Fig. 8B ) and ranged from 2 to 8 hydrogen bonds for NTD-AMP and NTD-ZTP complexes. The minimum distance between ligands and the protein (Fig.   8C ) ranged from 0.15 to 0.25 nm, suggesting close proximity especially for ZTP (≈ 0.15 nm). The compactness of the ZTP-NTD complex seems to be significantly low as compared to AMP-ZTP complex (see Fig. 8D ). Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) values for residues 91-102 (residues of the β-hairpin) were significantly higher upon binding of AMP than ZTP (Fig. 9A) . The flexibility of the β-hairpin residues was similar for the NTD and NTD-AMP complex. ZTP occupied the binding pocket of AMP and interacts with residues T49, S51, F53, R88, Y109, Y111 and R149 (Fig. 9B ). package of viral genome into a ribonucleoprotein complex [70, 71] . Kang et al. [72] solved the structure of the NTD of SARS-CoV2 N-protein (PDB ID: 6M3M) andidentified potential pockets for drug targeting. Considering the urgent need to contain the SARS-CoV2 infection, drug repurposing seems to be the best tool in the search for therapeutic options. Existing drugs for different targets such as chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have been re-oriented to target the SARS-CoV2 and several in-vitro and in-vivo studies are providing positive outcomes [73] [74] [75] . Based on MM/PBSA binding energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulation analysis, zidovudine triphosphate (ZTP) has higher affinity and interacts better with the NTD of N-protein than AMP. ZTP is an anti-HIV agent that targets the viral reverse transcriptase, thus interfering with the reverse transcription process [76] . Residual fluctuation analysis from the simulation studies revealed that upon binding of ZTP, the flexibility of the NTD β-hairpin (basic palm) residues significantly reduce. The impact could be detrimental for the NTD considering the roles of the flexible, positively charged β-hairpin. The β-hairpin has been proposed to be essential for RNA packaging by interacting with phosphate groups of the viral RNA [77] [78] [79] . This observation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f together with the high binding affinity depicts ZTP as a promising N-protein inhibitor and should be further validated by experimental studies.We have explored the SARS-CoV2 N-protein for potential epitope-based vaccine candidates using immuno-informatics and identified an antiviral drug that binds to the Data is available upon requestThe authors declare they have no competing interest.

Reductions in R 0 are consistent with the comparatively low epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term.Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Social contacts, Physical distancing Background Over 18.3 million cases and 694,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded worldwide as of 4 August 2020 [1] . Most recorded cases and deaths have occurred in high-income countries in Europe and North America. Many countries introduced extreme physical distancing control measures to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission [2] . Modelling studies suggest that without substantial mitigation measures, most low-and middle-income (LMIC) settings, including sub-Saharan Africa, will experience a delayed, but severe epidemic [3, 4] . Yet to-date, the numbers of recorded cases and deaths in Africa are much lower than predictions, prompting speculation on why many African countries have so far avoided a severe uncontrolled epidemic. A range of reasons has been proposed, including differences between settings in case and death detection capacity, demographic factors such as population age distribution, and the role of temperature and aridity in transmission [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, many sub-Saharan African countries implemented lockdown and curfew measures far earlier in their country's epidemic trajectories than most higher-income settings in Europe and North America. For example, Kenya-the focus of the current studyimplemented a partial lockdown on 6 April 2020 when the country had recorded just 158 cases and 6 deaths. In contrast, although case detection rates may differ between settings, the UK implemented its own lockdown on 23 March 2020 after recording 6650 cases and 335 deaths [1, 2] . The first reported case in Kenya was on 13 March 2020, and schools closed on 15 March 2020. Suspension of international flights, including mandatory quarantine of incoming residents; closure of bars and restrictions on restaurant opening hours; and a ban on large gatherings were imposed on 25 March 2020, soon followed by an enactment of a nationwide curfew from 7 pm to 5 am. On 5 April 2020, the Kenyan government declared wearing face masks as mandatory in any public place. Recently, cessation of movement was imposed in informal settlements in Mombasa and Nairobi, following a rise in cases in Nairobi's Kibera informal settlement. Consequently, the government has indicated additional physical distancing measures may be authorised.Physical distancing control measures seek to reduce the number of contacts between people where transmission could occur. To predict the impact of control measures accurately, quantitative data on the number and type of contacts between people is required. Todate, only a few empirical studies have been published to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on contacts; these have been conducted in China [11] , the USA [12] , and Europe [13] ; but none were undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, prior to the current pandemic, a systematic review [14] reported that just four social contact surveys out of 64 had been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, including one in Kenya [15] [16] [17] . To our knowledge, just one LMIC study has been published since this review [18] . This lack of evidence means that many SARS-CoV-2 transmission models primarily use synthetic contact matrices for LMIC settings, which use demographic, household composition, classroom size, and other data to adjust social contact data from primarily high-income settings [19, 20] . Although one social mixing study was conducted in Kilifi, a coastal area of Kenya [21] , outside of one study which collected data from a South African township [16] , no published contact data exist from informal settlements, which may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to high levels of population density, indoor crowding, and household sizes, alongside intergenerational mixing within the household.Between-person contacts drive the transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Understanding how contact patterns change under different control measures is important to inform decisions on whether and how to implement them. In this study, we describe a survey of contact patterns conducted among a sample of adults from five informal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas around Nairobi. We explore how direct contacts vary across respondent characteristics, including by socioeconomic status. We estimate the impact of current control measures on the reproduction number, R 0 , to evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic. We also describe income losses and food security that respondents attribute to COVID-19 and control measures.Participation in the study was voluntary, and analyses were conducted on anonymised data. The study was approved by the internal review board of the Population Council (study number 936), the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (reference number 22294), and the AMREF Health Africa Ethics and Scientific Review Committee in Kenya (P803/ 2020).Adult respondents were recruited from two existing Population Council cohorts in five informal settlements around Nairobi (Kibera, Huruma, Kariobangi, Dandora, and Mathare). The existing cohorts were part of the Adolescent Girls Initiative Kenya (AGI-K) and Nisikilize Tujengane (NISITU -Listen to Me, Let us Grow Together) studies. The cohorts were in place to study the impacts of multi-sectoral interventions on adolescents, and consisted of randomly selected households from informal settlements which contained at least one adolescent in January 2015 (AGI-K) or January 2018 (NISITU). In May 2020, 1750 respondents from AGI-K and NISI TU cohorts completed a telephone survey on COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP). Of these 1750, an age-and sex-stratified random sample of 213 respondents completed a contact survey. Stratification was based on 2019 Kenya census data for Nairobi county, with a target sample size of 200 and 20% oversampling to account for refusal. This was based on the sample sizes of similar contact surveys [14] , alongside feasibility of phone interviewing during lockdown. Background data, including household ownership of assets, were merged from previous survey rounds. Respondents were first asked a range of questions on COVID-19 including knowledge and experience of testing and symptoms, economic impacts on the household, and food availability and cost. Then, respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made between 5 am the day preceding the survey and 5 am the day of the survey. A direct contact was defined as someone respondents met in person and with whom they had either (i) ""physical contact (any sort of skin-toskin contact e.g. a handshake, embracing, kissing, sleeping on the same bed/mat/blanket, sharing a meal together out of the same bowl, playing football or other contact sports, sitting next to someone while touching shoulder to shoulder, etc."", or (ii) ""Non-physical contact (you did not touch the person, but exchanged at least a few words, face-to-face within 2 metresfor example, someone you bought something from in the market, or rode with on a minibus, or worked with in the same area)"". All respondents were over the age of 18, so no contact data were collected from children; however, respondents were able to list contacts under the age of 18.We made pragmatic adaptations to existing contact measurement tools to allow them to be conducted over the phone, primarily to reduce respondent burden and to ensure that aggregate contact data were not biassed downwards by respondent fatigue. Respondents were first asked about contacts with members of their household the previous day, recording the contact age, gender, and whether contacts were physical or non-physical. Then, respondents were asked how many nonhousehold contacts they had had in the same timeframe. Those who reported nine or fewer outside-household contacts were asked to describe each contact's age, gender, whether the contact was physical or non-physical, the duration of the contact, and whether a mask was worn by the respondent or contact. Those who reported ten or more outside-household contacts were asked how many of these contacts were physical/non-physical, in the age ranges under 18, 18-60, and over 60. The contact tool is shown in Additional file 1.R version 4.0.0 and Stata 15 were used for analyses; the code and data are publicly available at https://github. com/mquaife/kenya_mixing. The age and gender of respondents were compared to the full sample from which they were drawn, alongside census data to assess the representativeness of the sample. Data on household assets were used to classify respondents into wealth quintiles using principal component analysis; Additional file 2 gives information on this, alongside methods used to estimate economic and food security.We calculated the mean number of social contacts per person per day, stratified by respondent age, sex, household size, and education level. We then calculated social contact matrices for the age category-specific daily frequency of direct contacts, adjusting for contact reciprocity and the age distribution using census data from informal settlement sub-counties. We then compared the mean total number of daily contacts by age group to the only empirical dataset available from Kenya in Kiti et al. [21] , alongside synthetic matrices from 2017 [19] and 2020 [20] . Kiti et al. collected data on physical contacts only, so we restrict our sample to physical contacts when comparing with this study. We adjusted both matrices to match the age structure of the informal settlement setting, using the 2019 Kenyan Population and Housing Census to adjust from Kilifi and nationally representative populations, respectively [22] . Additional file 3 provides more detail. Because Kiti et al. collected data on the age of contacts in categories (< 1, 1-5, 6-15, 16-19, 20-49, 50+) which were different to those in this survey, we restructured both age matrices and used 1000 bootstrapped samples of both datasets to impute the number of contacts for matching age ranges. We adjusted for symmetry after bootstrapping because one age range in our data (60+) had fewer than five respondents. Bootstrapping was not possible with Prem et al. matrices as they do not relate to individual level data.As respondents under the age of 18 were not included as survey respondents, we imputed child contacts using methods developed by Klepac et al. [23] , and implemented for the same purpose in a UK study [13] . This involved taking the ratio of the dominant eigenvalues between our matrices and the comparable setting-adjusted matrices to scale missing matrix elements.Finally, we estimated the impact of control measures on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) in this population. Because there are no baseline contact data from this population without control measures, we assume that contact patterns in this sample prior to control measures were similar to those estimated by Kiti et al. or Prem et al. We make the common assumption for respiratory infections that the next-generation matrix is a function of the age-specific number of contacts, the percontact transmission probability, and the duration of infectiousness, and that R 0 is therefore proportional to the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrix [17, 18] . We assume that existing matrices are comparable to the informal settlement setting of this study after adjusting for age distribution, that there were no changes in the duration of infectiousness during the study period, that percontact transmission probability also remained constant, and that all age groups have the same per-contact transmission probability, given infection. With these assumptions, the relative reduction in R 0 can be estimated as the reduction in the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrices. Our central estimate of the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.6 (SD = 0.54), as estimated in a meta-analysis of published estimates of R 0 prior to the introduction of control measures [13] . Because studies in this meta-analysis were predominantly based on European and Asian countries, we explore a lower bound of 1.46 (SD = 0.38) based on the earliest estimate of the time-varying reproduction number in Kenya [24] . We also use a higher bound R 0 of 3.8 (SD = 0.71) based on modelling analyses from European countries [25] . Finally, although there is limited evidence of age-specific variation in infectiousness or symptomatic rate given infection, there is some evidence that children are around half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults [26] . In a sensitivity analysis, we explore whether this impacts R 0 estimates.Out of the 1970 people sampled for the KAP survey, 1745 interviews were completed. Of the initial 1970 sampled, 237 were sampled to complete the additional contacts module. In total, 213 were successfully interviewed and recorded 3809 contacts. Eight hundred thirty (22%) of these were household contacts, and 324 (9%) were non-household contacts on which we have detailed information. The remaining 2655 (70%) were nonhousehold contacts of respondents who reported ten or more such contacts. The mean age of respondents was 33 (SD 11.38, max 70), and 51% were female (108/213). Table 1 shows that the age and gender distribution of respondents broadly matched that of (a) the sample from which respondents were randomly chosen and (b) the Kenyan adult population. Compared to both groups, there is some indication that our sample has more 18-29 year olds and fewer 60+ year olds than national data, whilst our sample is substantially older than that of Kiti et al.Eight respondents (4%) reported two or more COVID-19 symptoms 1 in the previous 7 days. Forty-two percent of respondents (89/213) thought they had a high chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, and 81% (172/213) thought the implications would be ""severe"" or ""very severe"" if they caught the virus. When asked an open-ended question without prompting what they would do if they developed COVID-19 symptoms, 64% (136/213) thought they would take a test, and 7% (16/213) said they would stay at home or avoid social gatherings. Just 6% (13/213) of respondents knew someone either who was suspected of having COVID-19 or who had tested positive.Respondents reported substantial food and economic insecurity due to COVID-19 and control measures. Around a third (36%, 76/213) reported the pandemic had caused a complete loss of income, and an additional 50% (107/213) reported partial income losses. Eightythree percent (177) reported experiencing increases in food prices, and three quarters of respondents reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food (74%, 158/213); all but one (157/158) reported that this was due to the situation with COVID-19. Just 21% (44/213) reported receiving monetary or non-monetary assistance in the previous 7 days-78% (166) reported that food was the one of the biggest needs that was currently unmet.COVID-19 control measures meant 92% (196/213) of respondents reported seeing friends less, and 64% (136) seeing family less. Twenty-five percent of respondents (54/213) reported leaving the settlement where the interview was conducted in the previous 24 h. At the time of data collection, mask wearing was required by the Kenyan government in public places and was very common: 94% (199/211) of respondents reported ""always"" wearing a mask outside of their house.The mean number of contacts reported was 18 (median 13, IQR 7-23), 4 household contacts (median 4, IQR 3-12) and 15 non-household contacts (median 10, IQR 4-20). As shown in Fig. 1 , respondents in the poorest quintile reported 1.5 times as many contacts as those in the richest quintile and we find evidence of a downwards trend in contacts as socioeconomic status increases (non-parametric test for trend p = 0.02). There was weak evidence that men had more contacts than women (20.3 − 15.5 = 4.8, t test p = 0.04) and contacts increased with age (non-parametric test for trend p = 0.05). Just 22% (847/3841) of contacts were reported within the household, and total contacts did not vary substantially by household size or by respondent education level. This lack of variation by household size is consistent with most contacts being outside of the household. Figure 2 summarises the characteristics of contacts for which we have detailed information (830 household contacts and 324 non-household contacts where a respondent reported fewer than ten non-household contacts). Most physical contacts were household contacts, and the proportion of female contacts was higher among household than non-household contacts. Just 8% (27/324) of non-household contacts took place without a mask being worn by either the respondent or the contact. Most reported non-household contacts were brief: 40% (130/324) were under 5 min, and a further 23% (75/324) between 5 and 15 min. Finally, 41% (133/324) of non-household contacts took place in an outside location, and 34% (110/324) of non-household contacts were in the home of the respondent or contact. Figure 3 shows age-specific contact matrices disaggregated by contact location and type; these are asymmetric and not adjusted for demography. Matrices are consistent with the majority of contacts occurring outside of the household and being non-physical. Figure 4 uses the two existing contact matrices for Kenya to impute contact patterns for under 18 s, adjusting for age-distribution and symmetry. The two pre-COVID-19 data sources differ substantially in their methods, and the differences are propagated in these adjusted matrices. We find a 62% reduction in physical contacts, and a 63-67% reduction in all contacts compared to before the epidemic. We estimate R 0 under control measures, shown in Fig. 5 . All comparisons to pre-COVID-19 matrices assuming R 0 = 2.64 suggest that control measures reduced R 0 to below one, to 0.6 (IQR 0.50, 0.68) for physical contacts and to either 0.54 (IQR 0.46, 0.61) or 0.67 (IQR 0.57, 0.76) depending the synthetic matrix used as comparator, based on Prem et al. 2017 [19] and 2020 [20] , respectively. Using the lower R 0 estimate of 1.46, we estimate reductions to 0. 33 [19] or either 3.9 or 4.8 assuming all contacts are equally risky. As shown in Additional file 4, assuming that children are half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults has little impact on R 0 estimates.COVID-19 control measures in informal settlements appear to have led to a large reduction in social contacts. We find a 62-67% reduction in eigenvalues of contact matrices depending on the pre-COVID-19 matrix used; assuming an R 0 of 2.6, this would translate to an R 0 of between 0.5 and 0.7 at the time of data collection. By contrast, simulation estimates of the R 0 in an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya were between 1.78 (95% CI 1.44-2.14) and 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17) [27] . The R 0 we estimate here is consistent with the slow growth of the Kenyan epidemic to-date compared to epidemics in China and Europe. The large reductions in contacts we estimate are of similar magnitude to those seen in both the UK [13] (74% reduction in contacts), Wuhan and Shanghai [11] (86% reduction), and the USA (70% reduction) [12] . We are not aware of any comparable post-lockdown studies from low-or middle-income settings to-date, including sub-Saharan Africa. Considerable food and economic vulnerability was reported due to COVID-19 control measures. Over 80% of respondents reported a partial or complete loss of income, and three quarters reported eating less or skipping Fig. 2 Characteristics of a household and b non-household contacts for which full information was gathered Fig. 3 Age-stratified mean number of reported contacts from survey respondents recruited from five informal settlements around Nairobi. a The aggregate mixing matrix. b Household contacts only. c Non-household contacts only. d Physical contacts only. e Non-physical contacts only meals due to COVID-19. Households reported they were receiving some assistance, but that their biggest remaining unmet need was food. Although the prevalence of COVID-19 was low, and these factors can largely be attributed to control measures rather than illness from COVID-19 itself, it is important to recognise the counterfactual of no control measures is an unmitigated epidemic, and not an absence of these harms. The socioeconomic situation of informal settlements means that respondents may face greater economic precarity than residents of formal urban areas. Even within this sample, the poorest quintile of respondents reported 1.5 times as many contacts as the richest, suggesting an inequitable impact of COVID-19 transmission. This inequity would be exacerbated if socially patterned financial and access barriers inhibit the poor from seeking care for COVID-19 [28, 29] . Stringent control measures which cause economic and food insecurity are not likely to be sustainable in the long term if not accompanied by social protection mechanisms. These estimates of R 0 are lower than those suggested by the linear growth of the epidemic in Kenya under control measures [1] which implies an R 0 of around 1, suggesting that there are other factors which influence transmission which we do not consider here. Contact patterns measured here only reflect community transmission, and if proportionately more infections occur due to contacts in non-community or clinical settings, then these estimates will overestimate the impact of control measures. As seen in many other settings, the number of reported cases is likely to be a significant underestimate of true cases given constraints in case finding and laboratory testing capacity: estimates suggest that during the study period, Kenya was detecting around 30% of symptomatic cases, compared to around 15% in the UK and the USA [30] . At present, evidence on how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is inconclusive [31, 32] ; however, if fomites are a substantive cause of transmission in Kenyan informal settlements, then the current analysis will likely overstate the impact of control measures on R 0 . We conject fomite transmission may be more likely in this setting due to high population density, and low and unequal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene amenities. Furthermore, the next-generation matrix approach of calculating R 0 which we use assumes uniform susceptibility and infectivity by age. In reality, younger people are less likely to acquire and transmit SARS-CoV-2 [26] . Because our contact data are collected in wide age ranges, if younger people have reduced contacts proportionately more than older people, our results may overestimate the impact on R 0 . We found that assuming reduced susceptibility among children did not substantively change results.Since data were collected for this study, the case numbers have continued to increase in Kenya. As of late July 2020, a progressive re-opening was occurring, including the lifting of movement restrictions in areas considered hotspots including parts of Nairobi and coastal counties, moving the start of nightly curfew from 7 pm to 9 pm, and allowing the opening of places of worship, restaurants, and other places of communal gathering. Local air travel resumed on 15 July. Restrictions on the number of people allowed in such places remain, for example gatherings in places of worship are limited to 100 people for 1 h, only for those over 13 or under 58 years of age. Schools remain closed until January 2021.This study has a number of limitations. In the absence of baseline contact data (i.e. before control measures were put in place), we use empirical matrices from a different area of Kenya and synthetic matrices based on adjusting contact surveys from higher income countries to household and other characteristics in Kenya. Although we adjust these datasets by the age structure of the Kenyan population, other factors such as household size were not reported and may influence number of contacts and therefore pathogen transmission. The pre-COVID-19 setting of Kiti et al. is very different to this sample, not least as estimates place population density around 24 times greater in informal settlements (Kibera, 55,000 persons/km 2 ) compared to urban Kilifi (2325 persons/km 2 ) [33] . Because we would expect contacts to be greater in more densely populated areas, the true reduction in contacts may be more than we estimate here. Although we have a range of background data on respondents from using existing sampling frames, households in the AGI-K and NITISU cohorts were initially selected as having an adolescent residing there in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Finally, although face mask use was reported by almost all participants, because of uncertainty in the effectiveness of masks in reducing SARS2-NCoV transmission, the impact of different types of face masks, and real-world adherence of mask users, R 0 calculations do not assume any protective effect from mask use.Other social contact surveys have used a prospective study design, asking respondents to record contacts in a daily diary [34] . Because we asked respondents to recall contacts from the previous day, these data may be subject to recall bias, although it is not clear in which direction this may act. Furthermore, we impute adjusted child contacts using the comparison studies. An alternative approach, such as that taken by Kiti et al., would have been for respondents to record contacts for children in their household-arranging this was not possible during COVID-19 restrictions. To make the contact survey feasible for phone-based data collection, we simplified the tool for respondents who reported more than ten outside-household contacts. We are therefore limited to knowing these contacts' age and whether the contact was physical or non-physical. Contacts reported in this way were a substantial proportion (70%) of the total sample. The main risk of bias from this may stem from respondents rounding up or down to anchor numbers (e.g. units of ten); Fig. 1e shows a few respondents cluster around 50 and 100 contacts. Overall, the loss of granularity was beneficial to reducing respondent burden.We do not calculate the net reproduction number, R, but because reported case numbers in Kenya are low, the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible is likely minimal. We assume that direct contacts are a proxy for effective contacts and therefore transmission, and that transmissibility does not vary by age. In addition, we do not account for the very high proportion of respondents who report that they or their direct contacts wore face masks. Considering these factors would mean R is below the R 0 estimated here.Kenya has implemented strict control measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the difficult decisions policymakers face as we find that control measures are likely to have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission, but also negatively impacted food and economic security of informal settlement residents. This is the first study to measure social contact patterns after COVID-19 control measures have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. There is evidence that impacts are inequitable, as the poorest quintile report 1.5 times more contacts than the richest quintile, and 86% of respondents reported complete or partial income losses. Negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term without social protection.","Kenya","abstract","2020-10-05",10

The novel coronavirus has been a serious threat to public health [4] . In late December 2019, the disease COVID-19 was first discovered in Wuhan (Hubei province) and caused the first pandemic of this century. The virus appears to be transferred mostly through narrow respiratory 5 droplets by coughing, sneezing, or peoples interaction in close proximity (usually less than one meter) with each other for a certain time frame. However, it might be possible that other unobserved environmental exposures may have facilitated the rate the disease spreads through human-to-human transmission. In [13] , it is reported that COVID-19 infected individuals generally develop symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). At the present, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19 in the world. Therefore the only way to stop the spread of this disease is to quarantine or isolate the initially infected population as showed by guide line of World Health Organization. By the end of June 2020, the COVID-19 virus has infected more than 10 927 025 people and died at least 521 512 in all over the world [27] . However, since the randomness of population mobility and uncertainty of 15 control measures, methods of predicting COVID-19 and then preventing and controlling the disease for public health departments still remain unclear.Recently, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has attracted much attention from many researchers and various comprehensions have been made to deepen understanding and grasping the valuable inferences through mathematical modeling [14, 15, 16] . Therefore, it is of great significance to 20 establish and study the model of infectious diseases. Mathematical modelling is an important decision tool that can be useful to analyze the spread and understand the level of manageability and the effect of prevention and control mechanisms applied to the pandemic. A numerous number of models are being used to project the current COVID-19 pandemic. Wang et al. [17] developed an SEIR model to estimate the epidemic trends in Wuhan, assuming the prevention and control 25 measures were either sufficient or insufficient to control the epidemic. Hellewell et al.[18] developed a transmission model and found that highly effective contact tracing and case isolation are enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within three months in most scenarios. In another recent work, Chakraborty and Ghosh [28] have considered a hybrid ARIMA-WBF model to forecast various COVID-19 affected countries throughout the globe. Several other models established 30 a stochastic transition model to evaluate the transmission of COVID-19 and also emphasized the necessity of interventions such as social-distancing, isolation and quarantine [19, 21] .In [24] , Mandal et al. consider a mathematical model of COVID-19 where human populations are subdivided into five time-dependant classes, namely, Susceptible S(t), Exposed E(t), Quarantined Q(t), Hospitalized infected I(t) and Recovered or Removed R(t). They have assumed that the virus COVID-19 is spreading when a vulnerable person comes into contact with an exposed person. The model is a system of five first order ordinary differential equations shown as below:where all parameters are positive numbers. A is the constant recruitment rate to the susceptible population; β stands for the disease transmission rate; ρ 1 (0 < ρ 1 < 1) is portion of susceptible human would maintain proper precaution measure and ρ 2 (0 < ρ 2 < 1) represents portion of the exposed class would take proper precaution measure for disease transmission (i.e, use of face mask, social distancing and implementing hygiene). Therefore (1 − ρ 1 )S denotes portion of susceptible individuals due to the contact of (1 − ρ 2 )E portion of exposed individuals; α and b 2 are the portions of the exposed class going to the infected class and quarantine class, respectively. However, b 1 and c represent the portions of the quarantine class moving to susceptible class and infected class, respectively. η and ν stand for the recovery rate of hospitalized infected population I and exposed class E; µ denotes the natural death rate and δ is the COVID-19 induced death rate.According to the theory in [24] , the system (1) always has a disease-free equilibriumR 0 = Aβ(1 − ρ 1 )(1 − ρ 2 ) µ(b 2 + α + ν + µ) > 1, there exists a unique endemic 35 equilibrium E * = (S * d , E * d , Q * d , I * d , R * d ), where S * d = b2+α+ν+µ β(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2) , E * d = (b 1 + c + µ) Aβ(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2)−µ(b2+α+ν+µ) β(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2){b2(c+µ)+(α+ν+µ)(b1+c+µ)} , Q * d = b 2 Aβ(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2)−µ(b2+α+ν+µ) β(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2){b2(c+µ)+(α+ν+µ)(b1+c+µ)} , 40 I * d = {α(b1+c+µ)+b2c}{Aβ(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2)−µ(b2+α+ν+µ)} β(1−ρ1)(1−ρ2){b2(c+µ)+(α+ν+µ)(b1+c+µ)}(η+µ+δ) , R * d = ηI * d +νE * d µ .[24] established the following theoretical results about the stability of the equilibriums:(i) If R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium E 0 of system (1) is locally asymptotically stable.(ii) If R 0 = 1, the system (1) passes through a transcritical bifurcation around its disease-free equilibrium.(iii) If R 0 > 1, then the endemic equilibrium E * of system (1) is locally asymptotically stable.In fact, the COVID-19 epidemic model is unavoidably subjected to the environmental noise, which made the parameters involved in the system often fluctuate randomly around some average values as the surrounding environment fluctuation. See [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 29] and references therein for epidemic models with environmental noise. Therefore, it is necessary to include random fluctuations in the process of COVID-19 modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic COVID-19 model adopting a generalized incidence function [25, 26] as follows:where B(t) is a real-valued Brownian motion and σ 2 > 0 represents the intensity of the white noisė. The function f (·) is generally assumed to be a non-negative twice continuously differentiablex < f (0) for any x > 0). Note that the COVID-19 epidemic models may be perturbed by telegraph noise which can causes the system to switch from one environmental regime to another [22] . Mostly the switching between environmental regimes is often memoryless and the waiting time for the next switching follows the exponential distribution [23] . Hence the regime switching can be modelled by a continuous time Markov chain (r(t)) t 0 with values in a finite state space S = {1, 2, ..., N }. Then model (2) disturbed by white noise and telegraph noise develops towhere Markov chain r(.) is F t -adapted but independent of Brownian motion B(.) and defined onof Markovian chain is defined byIn this paper, we assume that γ ij > 0 for i, j = 1, ..., N with j = i. This assumption assures that the Markov chain r(t) is irreducible, which implies that it has a unique stationary distribution π = (π 1 , π 2 , ..., π N ), which can be determined by solving the following equationsubject to N k=1 π k = 1, π k > 0, for any k ∈ S.For convenience, we denote for any fixed vectorTo begin the analysis of the model, we define the subsetsThroughout this paper, we carry out the case of small noises:The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: In section 3, we show the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the system (3). In the sections 4 and 5, we study the 55 existence of a stochastic threshold for the extinction and the persistence in mean of the disease. In last section, we present some numerical simulations to demonstrate our main theoretical results.To study the dynamical behaviour of an epidemic model, we firstly need to consider whether the solution is global and positive. In this section, we will prove there is a unique global positive Proof. Obviously, the coefficient of model (3) are locally Lipschitz continuous, so there is a unique lo-where τ e is the explosion time [31] . If τ e = ∞ a.s., then this local solution is global. To this end, where throughout this paper we set inf ∅ = ∞ (∅ denotes the empty set). Clearly, τ n is increasing For any n ≥ n 1 and t ∈ [0, τ n ), we haveIt then follows thatThe non-negativity of this function can be obtained from u − 1 − log u 0 for any u > 0.Let n n 1 and T > 0 be arbitrary. For any 0 t min{τ n , T }, applying the generalized Itô's formula [31] to V yieldswhere LV : R 5 + → R is defined by)Ǎ µ f (0) + 5μ +b 1 +b 2 +α +ν +č +η +δwhere the inequality f (E) E ≤ f (0) is used and K is a positive constant which is independent of 80 S, E, Q, I, R and k. The remaining part of the proof is similar to [30] and hence is omitted here.This completes the proof.It is most crucial to deal with the conditions for the extinction of diseases when their dynamics is under investigation. This section is devoted to establish sufficient conditions so that the COVID-19 85 goes out of the population. First, we need to define the following numberAt this stage, we have the following theorem: Proof. Applying the generalized Itô's formula to log E, we haveMoreover, for any k ∈ S, the function defined byUsing the 90 boundedness of the solution and the fact that f (E) ≤ f (0)E, we obtainIntegrating (5) from 0 to t and then dividing by t on both sides lead toIt follows from the ergodic property of r(t) that lim supTaking the superior limit on the both sides of (6), (7) and making use of the large number theorem for local martingales, we getwhich implies that Substituting this into the third equation of system (3), we obtain for all ω ∈ Λ, t > T,Thus by the comparison theorem we get Recalling that P(Λ) = 1, hence we obtainSimilarly, when lim t→∞ E(t) = 0 a.s., and lim t→∞ Q(t) = 0 a.s., then by using the same approach as above, we can conclude that Remark 1. Obviously, the quantity R 0 s is smaller than R 0 . Hence, the extinction of the disease in system (3) could be ensured even if the condition R 0 < 1 is not verified.To investigate epidemic dynamical system, we are also interested in when the disease persists 110 in host population. In this section we need to assume that the function f (·) · is C−Lipschitz and we have the following result on the prevailing behaviour of the COVID-19 disease. for some positive constants M i , i = 1, · · · , 4.Proof. Applying the Itô's formula on the function E → log E, we getwhereUsing the fact that S ≤Ǎ µ and f (E) E ≤ f (0), one can easily show thatFrom the first equation of (3), we can easily claim thatNow, let u and v in (0,Ǎ/μ). Without loss of generality, assume that u < v. The monotonocity andConsequently,Substituting this inequality into (11) and making use of (9), we obtainwhereThen, applying the generalized Itô's formula on the function V (E, k) = log E +ω(k) and using (12),Since the generator Γ is irreducible, then for P 0 = (P (1), · · · , P (N )) with P (k) = F Ǎ µ f (0), k , there is a solutionω = (ω(1), · · · ,ω(N )) to the system Γω = −P 0 + N k=1 π k P (k)1, where 1 is the unit vector of R N . That is,Substituting the above equality into the inequality (13), integrating from 0 to t and dividing by t,we obtainThe large number theorem for local martingales and the boundedness of S implies that lim From the third equation of (3), we can establish thatTaking the inferior limit and making use of both the boundedness of Q and the inequality (14), we get lim infwhere M 2 =b 2 M 1 / b 1 +č +μ . Following the same way, we can easily claim that lim infwhere M 3 = (αM 1 +ĉM 2 ) / η +μ +δ and M 4 = (νM 1 +ηM 3 ) /μ. This makes finish of the proof. are assumed to be more likely than the first one to show the applicability of the analytical results established along this paper. The parameter values chosen are given in [24] and reported in the Table 1 .To demonstrate the effect of telegraph noise on the dynamics of COVID-19 disease, in addition to data of Table 1 , we set the following settings: Then, by direct computation, we obtain R 0 s = 0.6303 < 1. In other words, the conditions of the Theorem 4.1 hold and the Fig. 2 shows the empirical means and the standard deviations of the solution to (3) in a 5 × 10 3 samples, as well as the trajectories of the deterministic system (1) without switching for different values of the three considered regimes. So the stochastic process (3) for COVID-19 disease switches over the states 1, 2 and 3 before going to extinction.On the other hand, when the following parameter values are considered, This paper investigates a stochastic epidemic model describing COVID-19 dynamics affected 125 by mixture of environmental perturbations modeled by white and telegraph noises. By means of Lyapunov approach, the existence and positivity of a global solution is well proved. In terms of a stochastic threshold R 0 s , the extinction and the persistence in mean of the COVID-19 epidemic are investigated. Particularly, under small noises, the condition R 0 s < 1 is sufficient to reduce the daily number of confirmed infectives and make the coronavirus disease 2019 extinct. Reciprocally, the 130 persistence of this novel epidemic is inevitable once R 0 s stays away from unity. Based on the data from different states of India, we performed numerical simulations in order to support and illustrate the main results of this paper.Although many important contributions are made in literature to draw the dynamical properties of the COVID-19, some of them still unidentified and much more efforts are recommended to 135 make it more comprehensible and help humanity to overcome the current pandemic. As a further suggestion, other improvements such us time varying parameters can be considered to make the studied COVID-19 model more realistic. A task which we leave for next works. ☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.☐ The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:","Morocco","first author","2020-10-16",10

Water supply in 58 these regions often suffers from diverse issues: numerous and institutional bottlenecks, These problems prevent municipalities from providing reliable potable water to people, thus 62 increasing the vulnerability of millions to diseases and pandemics such as COVID-19.

Short-and long-term 69 measures are needed to improve water supply and access and create resilient water 70 1 WHO save lives: clean your hands in the context of COVID-19. A handout with key guidelines on the systems that mitigate the shocks of future disasters and pandemic diseases. This is essential 71 to protect millions of people that live in the informal and densely populated areas within 72 cities. As COVID-19 continues to spread to developing countries without sustainable access 73 to safe drinking water, people in these regions remain highly vulnerable (Aboelnga, Elmahd 74 & Unver, 2020). There is a strong agreement that people in developing regions lack access 75 to reliable water supply and hand washing facilities (WHO, 2019; UN, 2017) 76 77 Globally, 2.1 billion people lack access to clean and safe water, they are using either an 78 unimproved water source or an improved source that is contaminated with faecal matter 79 (WHO, 2017). According to UNICEF and WHO (2019), as many as one in three of the 80 world's people do not enjoy access to safe and reliable water services. Three billion people 81 across the world do not have basic hand-washing facilities (soap and water) in their home. 82 Increasing water scarcity in urban areas is projected to intensify even more during the 83 coming years. Almost 900 million people live in cities that are facing seasonal water 84 shortages, in which potable water supplies dip below 100 l/day at least one month each year. 85 By 2050, these numbers are expected to grow to 1 billion and 3.1 billion people, respectively 86 (Britto et al., 2019) . Nearly a third of humanity, including over half of the 6 billion urban 87 dwellers predicted by 2050, will face critical water shortages in their cities (Xylem, 2013) . In 88 Africa, 400 million people lack access to clean water 2 . African cities are also facing 89 increasing water insecurity (Grasham et al., 2019) . The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates 90 this situation. In such circumstances, planning and governance responses need to be both 91 flexible and proactive in order to manage this shock and its associated effects (Rodina, 92 2019).Access to clean water including handwashing facilities, is widely accepted as a cost-94 effective way to reduce the disease burden in lower income countries (Jamison, 2018 settlements without basic services i.e., access to water to practice basic hygiene, and social 101 amenities 3 . They can, therefore, hardly comply with the COVID-19 transmission-prevention 102 measures. This places millions of people at risk of the fast spreading COVID-19 in SSA.Water provision in developing regions is mainly provided through municipalities. These 104 municipalities are often under-resourced (Jacobsen et al., 2013 ) and are exposed to severe 105 water supply rationing. Urban water scarcity in developing countries is getting more real, 106 compelling, and growing day by day (Britto et al., 2019 When should I wash my hands?In the context of COVID-19 prevention, you should make sure to wash your hands at the following times: We calculated the key aspects below of water supply service provision related to daily water 189 consumption using recommended benchmarks and standards of best practices and the Using best standards practices, WHO guidelines and repeated demonstrations, we established that one person use 1.5l of water in 40-60 seconds of safely and thoroughly washing hands. Staddon et al. (2020) found that if a person's hands are washed in running water, the average hand basin tap uses 2-3 litres per minute, which implies a total water requirement of 8-10 litres of clean water per person per day assuming they practicing safe hands for 8-10 times.Assumption: Based on the notes provided in Box 1 and 2, we assumed that one person practices the 'safe hands' challenge at least three times a day (for illustration purpose). Therefore, a person per day uses a total of 4.5 litres of water washing hands. We added this amount to the current demand. The new water demand was calculated as follows: Intermittent water supply is becoming more severe in Chitungwiza. The interviewees 277 expressed that since the start of lockdown, their suburbs never had access to potable water.

In addition to the above, this article presents other key measures that households within 387 urban areas of Africa can implement. -Don't let the tap or shower run when it is not being used.-Run the dishwasher and clothes washer only when they are fully loaded.-Fix leaks to conserve water and also save on repair costs.-Education (public awareness).-Setting up awareness programs through social media for sharing information and for providing advice, training and capacity building support.-Allocate adequate amount of water for drinking and hand washing in each community at important locations where public gathering and crowds are noticed.-Ensure alternatives to hand washing are available such as the use of hand sanitizers, in the case of extreme lack of water resources.However, the household roles above cannot replace the responsibility of municipalities to Chitungwiza.The global call for 'Safe Hands' has exposed how weak the water governance is in The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal 542 relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. ☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.☐The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:","Zimbabwe","abstract","2020-10-16",10

Then, a subsequent test showed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as an etiology of this huge outbreak. 1, 2 The present pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, China and it was because of the rigorous acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with considerable mortality and morbidity rate. 3 The outbreak of this pandemic virus has been brought to global consideration and was confirmed as a pandemic virus by the WHO on March 11, 2020. 4 COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease. 5 The COVID-19 pandemic remains a worldwide challenge. In spite of extreme study efforts globally, the effective treatment, and vaccine options have eluded the investigators. Thus, the strategies like infection prevention protocols, early viral detection, and identification of effective treatment could offer significant tools in the controlling of the spread of this disease. 6 The evidence showed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the China epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. This infection has been transmitted to other countries. 7 The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the essential health crises of the communities worldwide. The pandemic has affected individuals of all socioeconomic groups, races, nations, and continents, while the responses have been the quarantining of entire communities, social isolation, closing of schools, and shelter in-place orders, which have suddenly changed daily life. 8 Despite the rigorous global control and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to increase globally. 9 COVID-19 is spreading quickly. Even though the etiology was rapidly recognized as a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, the knowledge of this novel virus remains very limited. Because of the high infectivity of the virus, the large asymptomatic peoples, and lack of effective antivirals and vaccines, the management of COVID-19 has become very difficult. 10 The knowledge, attitude, and practice of individuals towards this COVID-19 pandemic could play a key role in the way they accept the measures put in place to control its spread and their willingness to seek and adhere to care. The continuous rise in the number of cases and the overall good knowledge, attitude, and practice justify a further investigation to determine the effectiveness of the measures put in place to control the spread of this disease. 11 Understanding the public attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors is important and significant during this pandemic situation. Encouraging the public for these behaviors suggests a chance to normalize safe practices and promote a continued use of these and other recommended personal protective behaviors to reduce the further spread of COVID-19. 12 The study revealed that social media has the potential to provide rapid and effective dissemination routes for key information if used responsibly and appropriately in control of the present COVID-19 pandemic. 13 The literature search conducted included the articles published up to July 30, 2020 to identify the research done on knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors regarding COVID-19 by using PubMed and EBSCO databases, involving both medical subject heading (MeSH) terminology and relevant keywords for search strings to locate articles that assess the knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors about COVID-19. The following keywords: ""knowledge,"" ""attitude,"" ""practice,"" and ""COVID-19"" were used to search for the research conducted on these topics. The present review article was done to summarize the latest articles and provide future perspectives on knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19.As briefly summarized in Table 1 , studies were conducted to assess knowledge towards COVID-19 in different countries over the world. For instance, Egypt, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, the US and UK, Vietnam, Jordan, China, Philippines, Iran, Italy, Uganda, Nigeria, India, Tanzania, and Greece. Overall, most of these studies showed a sufficient level of knowledge towards COVID-19 with respect to their countries. The findings of each study are discussed.According to a study conducted in Egypt among 559 participants, the level of knowledge was good with a mean knowledge score of 16.39 out of 23. 14 A study done in Pakistan among 1004 residents showed that 50.1% of them had knowledge of human-to-human transmission, 46.6% of them had seen a COVID-19 patient, 54.7% of them did not know that physical contact is a main cause of infection spread, while 45.3% of them were aware of it. 15 A study conducted among 404 chronic disease patients in Ethiopia showed that only 33.9% of them had good knowledge towards the pandemic. 16 According to a research study done among 3388 participants in Saudi Arabia, most of the participants had a high level of knowledge, with a mean knowledge score of 17.96 (SD=2.24, range= [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . 17 A study conducted among 4850 residents in Malaysia revealed that 77.2% of them had an acceptable level of knowledge. The average knowledge score for participants was (10.5) (SD=1.4, range=0-13). 18 3820 knowledge towards COVID-19 transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%). 19 According to a study done among 2017 respondents in Bangladesh, less than half (48.3%) of them had more accurate knowledge regarding COVID-19. 20 A study conducted among 2986 adult residents in the US and 2988 adult residents in the UK revealed that the participants had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. 21 In Vietnam, a study conducted among 327 healthcare workers showed that the majority (88.4%) of them had good knowledge regarding COVID-19, with a mean score of knowledge of 8.17±1.3 (range=4-10). 22 A study done among 592 medical and non-medical university students in Jordan showed that a positive response regarding the overall knowledge about the symptoms of COVID-19 was observed in more than 90% of the students with the Knowledge score of 0.81±0. 15. 23 According to the research done among 114 primary healthcare providers in Pakistan, the majority (90.7%) of them had good overall knowledge about COVID-19, with a mean knowledge score of 12.7±0.89 (range=0-14). 24 The study done among 6910 participants in China showed that the overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%, with a mean score of 10.8 (SD=1.6, range=0-12). 25 In the Philippines, a research study conducted among 2090 respondents showed that 89.5% of them were able to identify coughing and sneezing as a transmission route, 72.6% of them recognized a transmission route was indirect hand contact, 82.2% of them recognized hand washing, 32.4% of them identified social distancing, and 40.6% of them recognized avoiding crowds as potential preventive measures. 26 The study conducted among 240 medical students in Iran showed that 79.6% of them had a high, 13.8% of them had a moderate, and 6.7% of them had a low level of knowledge regarding COVID-19. 27 In Italy, research done among 2046 hospital staff showed that there was good knowledge on COVID-19 control measures. The mean correct answers for questions on general aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic was 71.6% for healthcare workers and 61.2% for non-healthcare workers. The mean of correct answers for questions on COVID-19 patient management was 57.8% among healthcare workers. 28 According to a study done among 2045 respondents in Bangladesh, more than half (54.87%) of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. 29 had good knowledge regarding the sources, transmission, signs, symptoms, prognosis, treatment, and mortality rate of COVID-19. 30 In Uganda, research conducted among 136 healthcare workers revealed that 69% of them had sufficient knowledge towards COVID-19. 31 According to a study done among 589 participants in Nigeria, the majority (99.5%) of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. 32 A study conducted among 662 respondents in India showed that the respondents had a moderate level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. It showed that 29.5% of them answered that the virus spreads through multiple modes like touching, kissing, sneezing, and food, 43% of them regarded COVID-19 as a highly contagious disease, 97% of them acknowledged that washing hands frequently could stop the spread of infection, and 18.2% of them regarded fever as a symptom of COVID-19, which is known to be a major symptom. 33 In Tanzania, a study done among 400 respondents showed that 84.4% of them had good knowledge towards COVID-19. 34 According to research conducted among 414 healthcare workers in Pakistan, 93.2% of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. 35 A study done among 311 medical staff in China revealed that 89.51% of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. 36 In the US, a study conducted among 630 adults with chronic conditions showed that 53.6% of them reported that infected persons will have only mild symptoms, 14.2% of them reported that an infected person will die of COVID-19, 71.7% of them correctly identified three symptoms, and 69.8% of them identified the ways to prevent infection. 37 Another study conducted in China among 1357 healthcare workers showed that 89% of them had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Doctors' showed a higher knowledge score (38.56±3.31) than nurses (37.85±2.63) and paramedics (36.72±4.82). 38 A study conducted in Greece among the healthcare professionals revealed that the majority of them (88.28%) had a good level of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection. 39Of the listed studies in Table 1 , some studies have identified factors that had an association with knowledge towards COVID-19. Below is a brief summary of the findings of each study.According to the study conducted in Egypt among 559 adult Egyptians, knowledge towards COVID-19 was significantly lower among older age, less educated, rural residents, and lower income respondents. 14 A study conducted among 404 chronic disease patients in Ethiopia showed that age, educational status of cannot read and write, rural residence, and monthly income were factors significantly associated with poor knowledge. 16 A prospective Web-based cross-sectional study conducted among 529 healthcare workers globally showed that age and profession were factors associated with inadequate knowledge of COVID-19. 19 According to a study done among 2017 respondents in Bangladesh, the more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. 20 The study done among 6910 participants in China showed that knowledge was significantly different across genders, age-groups, categories of marital status, education levels, and residence. 25 According to a study done among 2045 respondents in Bangladesh, knowledge was significantly diverged across age, gender, education levels, residences, income groups, and marital status. 29 A study done among 85 nurses in Iran showed that age>40 years and news media were factors associated with knowledge towards COVID-19. 31 In Tanzania, a study done among 400 respondents showed that the education level was significantly associated with good knowledge. 34 Attitude Regarding COVID-19Studies were done to assess attitude towards COVID-19 in different countries over the world. For example; Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Jordan, China, Nigeria, India, Tanzania, the US, Ethiopia, Philippines, Uganda, and Greece as listed in Table 2 . Generally, most of these studies showed a positive attitude regarding COVID-19 with respect to their countries. The findings of each study are briefly discussed below.In Egypt, a study done among 559 participants showed that the majority of them had a positive attitude towards different items of the inquired preventive measures. 14 According to a study conducted among 1004 participants in Pakistan, 93.0%, 57.1%, and 42.9% of them showed a positive attitude for the requirement of masks and hand sanitizers, treatment facilities, and vaccination campaigns respectively. 15 the virus was highly threatening for chronic disease patients, and 51.7% of them perceived that practicing physical distancing is very difficult. 16 In Saudi Arabia, research done among 1767 participants showed that 95% of them presented with a high attitude.

Below is a brief summary of the findings of each study.A study done among 4850 residents in Malaysia showed that the attitude of successfully controlling COVID-19 was significantly associated with age, region, and occupation. 18 In Bangladesh, research conducted among 2017 participants showed that factors significantly associated with a positive attitude were older age, higher education, employment, monthly income (>30,000 BDT), and having more frequent prevention practices. 20 A study done among 6910 participants in China revealed that the attitude towards a final success in controlling COVID-19 significantly differed across gender, educational levels, occupation categories, and residence places. 25 According to a study done in Greece, the knowledge score was significantly associated with attitude score. This indicates that individuals with a high knowledge score demonstrated a more positive perception on preventive measures. 39 The studies were conducted to assess practice towards COVID-19 in different countries over the world. For instance; Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Jordan, China, Philippines, Iran, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Greece, as listed in Table 3 . Overall, the majority of the studies showed a sufficient level of practice towards COVID-19 respective to their countries. The findings of each study are discussed.In Pakistan, research conducted among 1004 participants showed that 55.9%, 43.4%, and 68.6% of them had exposure to unknown people, met people with an international travel history, and their work included public dealing, respectively. Regarding personal hygiene, 85.5% of them wash hands frequently, 59.8% of them wash hands before eating, and 92.6% of them wash hands after coming home, while 50.5% of them cover their face when sneezing or coughing, and 92.8% of them practiced maintaining a safe physical distance. 15 A study done among 404 chronic disease patients in Ethiopia indicated that the general prevalence of good practice was 25.9%. 16 According to research conducted among 1767 participants in Saudi Arabia, 81% of them showed an adequate practice regarding COVID-19. Another study done in Saudi Arabia among 3388 participants showed that they had a good practice, with a mean score of 4.34 (SD=0.87, range=0-5). 17 A study done among 4850 residents in Malaysia revealed that 83.4% of them were taking precautions such as avoiding crowds, 87.8% of them practiced proper hand hygiene in the week before the movement control order started, and the wearing of face masks was less common, at 51.2% of them. 18 According to research conducted among 2017 respondents in Bangladesh, 55.1% of them had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention, while 98.7% of them wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% of them agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% of them implemented washing hands with soap and water. 20 In Jordan, a study among 592 medical and nonmedical university students showed that 96.8% of them do avoid hand shaking, 98.8% of them wash their hands, 93.3% of them use alcoholic rub, 95.8% of them cough or sneeze in a tissue and dispose of it in waste bin, 51% of them will drink ginger with honey, and 42.7% of them eat garlic for infection prevention. 23 Research done among 114 primary healthcare providers in Pakistan indicated that the overall COVID-19 preventive practices were good, with a mean practice score of 7.3±1.2. 24 In China, research conducted among 6910 participants showed that 96.4% of them had not visited any crowded place, and 98.0% of them wore masks when going out in recent days. 25 According to a study conducted among 2090 respondents in the Philippines, 89.9% of them applied hand washing as a preventive practice to COVID-19, 62.9% of them reported that they now avoid crowded places because of COVID-19, 40.6% of them selected avoiding large crowds as a preventive measure against the virus, 32.4% of them selected social distancing as an option, and 28.0% of them reported wearing face masks as a response to the virus. 26 A study done among 240 medical students in Iran showed that 94.2% of them had a high performance in preventive behaviors. 27 In Bangladesh, research done among 2045 respondents showed that the practices of respondents regarding COVID-19 were unimpressive. 29 A study done among 136 healthcare workers in Uganda showed that 74% of the healthcare workers had a good practice towards COVID-19. 31 According to the research conducted among 589 participants in Nigeria, 90.2% of them reported social distancing/avoiding crowd, 78.8% of them reported avoiding handshakes, and 74.4% of them reported avoiding face kissing as some of the practices to reduce community spread of COVID-19. 32 A study done among 400 participants in Tanzania showed that the majority (77%) of them had not visited any crowded place, 80.0% of them wore masks when going out in recent days, and 98% of them correctly identified that COVID-19 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and also factors such as chronic illnesses and obesity can lead to a serious case. 34 In Pakistan, research done among 414 healthcare workers showed that 88.7% of them had a good practice regarding COVID-19. 35 Another study done among 1357 healthcare workers in China showed that 89.7% of them had a good practice regarding COVID-19. 38 According to a study done in Greece, only 24.9% of healthcare professionals reported that they washed their hands before and after contact with the patient/patient's environment. 39 From the studies listed in Table 3 , some studies have identified factors that had an association with practice towards COVID-19. Below is a brief summary of the findings of each study.A study done among 404 chronic disease patients in Ethiopia indicated that the marital status of unmarried, educational status; cannot read and write, and read and write, rural residence, monthly income of less than a mean, and poor knowledge were factors significantly associated with poor practice. 16 According to research conducted among 2017 respondents in Bangladesh, female sex, older age, higher education, monthly income (>30,000 BDT), urban residence, and having more positive attitude were factors significantly associated with the more frequent prevention practice. 20 According to a study done in Greece, the knowledge score was significantly associated with practice score. This indicated that individuals with a high knowledge score would practice more preventive measures. 39 What Is the Significance of Assessing KAP Regarding COVID-19?The present review showed that there were discrepancies between the studies reported on the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19, as discussed above. For instance, the studies of Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the US and UK, Vietnam, Jordan, Concerning the attitude towards COVID-19, the studies of Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Greece, Jordan, Nigeria, India, Tanzania, the US, and China reported that the majority of the respondents had a positive attitude. But, the studies of Ethiopia, Philippines, Bangladesh, and Uganda reported that the majority of the respondents had a negative attitude. Regarding the practice towards COVID-19, the studies of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Jordan, China, Philippines, Iran, Uganda, Nigeria, and Tanzania were reported a sufficient level of practice. However, the studies of Ethiopia and Bangladesh reported unimpressive levels of practice.Collectively, the findings from different studies showed that the majority of their participants had a sufficient knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice. This reflects that there were participants who had poor knowledge, a negative attitude, and poor practice in their studies, even though they were relatively low in number. Further, some studies reported that the majority of their participants had an inadequate knowledge, negative attitude, and insufficient practice towards COVID-19 in different countries all over the world, as briefly explained above. These reflect that there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries all over the world. This suggests that still extensive improvements are needed to manage and control this pandemic.Moreover, the significance of assessing the level of KAP regarding COVID-19 is because the knowledge, attitude, and practice are inter-related. They affect each other while the effect could be positive or negative. This was supported by a study which reported that the knowledge was positively correlated with attitude and practices. 15 It was also supported by a study which reported that knowledge was significantly associated with both attitude and practice. This indicates that individuals with a high knowledge score demonstrate a more positive perception on preventive measures and would practice more preventive measures. 39 Further, it was also supported by a study which reported that poor knowledge was found to be significantly associated with poor practice. 16 It was also supported by the study which reported that having more frequent prevention practices were factors associated with positive attitude. 20 It was also supported by the study which reported that attitude was positively correlated with practices. 15 Therefore, understanding the relationship of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic is significant and essential to enhance the strategies required to manage and control this pandemic.It was identified that a novel COVID-19 originated from China and quickly crossed all borders by infecting individuals of all age categories throughout the entire world. This COVID-19 pandemic contributes a major global challenge, with a massive yet possibly underestimated burden and numerous unidentified events. This phenomenon has several global burdens, such as morbidity, mortality, closure of schools, political crisis, economic crisis, burden on healthcare providers, and considerable public reaction.Overall, the majority of the studies reflect good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice towards COVID-19, respective to their countries. Further, some studies have identified factors that were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19. For instance; age, educational level, residence, monthly income, profession, gender, marital status, and news media were factors significantly associated with knowledge towards COVID-19. Age, occupation, educational level, monthly income, gender, residence, knowledge, and practice were factors significantly associated with attitude towards COVID-19. Age, marital status, educational level, residence, monthly income, knowledge, gender, and attitude were factors significantly associated with practice towards COVID-19.Even though the majority of the studies reported good knowledge, an optimistic attitude and good practice regarding COVID-19, some studies showed unimpressive knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19. Particularly, this is more critical for healthcare workers. This is because, since the healthcare workers are at the frontline defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, insufficient knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice can significantly affect the management and control of this pandemic. The insufficient knowledge and negative attitude could directly affect the practice and lead to poor infection control, spread of virus, delayed diagnosis, and increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, improvement is still needed and community submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 education should take place as usual with a commitment by using all the strategies that could support the improvement of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the population. Also, training should be provided for healthcare workers to update and make them more effective in diagnosing, managing, and controlling this pandemic.Since the clinical presentation is mainly asymptomatic, and the specific treatment and vaccines are absent, it is clear that a good knowledge, positive attitude, and sufficient practice toward COVID-19 are vital for the management and control of this pandemic. Hopefully, the integration of these components could contribute a significant and essential role in managing and controlling this pandemic. Finally, the present review suggests further research to be conducted on COVID-19 considering the barriers that contribute for the quick distributions and the reason for the reduction of the precautions toward this pandemic virus.The author declares no conflicts of interest for this work.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-27",10

Most participants described face masks/respirators as the ""only"" and the ""best protection"" method available to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory infections. 1 Preventing health professionals from infectious diseases/respiratory infections is crucial to promote the health and safety of staff and to maintain the performance and capability of the health workforce during outbreaks of emerging infections, such as pandemic COVID-19, influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebolavirus. 2 In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) protection from contamination is based on the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE). 3 Transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 include direct transmission (droplet, eg cough, sneeze) and contact transmission (contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes). 4 The existence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV -2) in the environment of patients with COVID-19 reinforces the belief that fomites play a role in the transmission of the virus; however, the relative significance of this route of transmission relative to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still obscure. 5 In developing countries, where the occurrence of communicable disease is high and the hospital environmental conditions are often poor, hospitals may rely mostly on PPE to protect their staffs. 6 Face masks use (including medical and cloth masks) and respirators are strongly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a standard for transmission-based safety measures. 7 The coronavirus disease, which is known as COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Since then, it has spread to more than 200 countries; declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there are more than 6 million positive COVID-19 cases recorded with at least 450,000 deaths globally. 1 The first case of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was detected in February 2020 involving one tourist from Japan. 2 The number of cases highly increased after two months of the first case detected. As of 2 September 2020, Ethiopia has recorded 54,409 positive cases involving 846 deaths. A majority of these more 39,033 cases were from the capital city of the country, Addis Ababa. 3 Healthcare workers are crucial to any healthcare system. 9 During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. 10 Healthcare professionals are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 because of the nature of their job. They could be exposed to atypical patients, infected family members, contacts, and colleagues, or live in communities of active transmission, as this type of work is very difficult to maintain social distancing. Due to this reason proper face mask as recommended by WHO guideline is needed for safe workforce reentry for people with elevated individual and occupational risk from COVID- 19. 11 According to the report of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that healthcare workers account for at least 11% of reported SARSCoV-2 infections. 12 A study conducted in a large public hospital in Spain reported that 11.6% of the employees tested positive for COVID-19. 13 The Ethiopia Minister of health also enforced different prevention methods to reduce community spread of COVID-19, and the overburdening of the country's health system which is already affected by infectious diseases. Unlike other community, the police force has no limited restriction on movement due to the nature of their work, which may increase the transmission of COVID-19 among police members, which in turn affects healthcare provider in the institution. In addition, police members are the turning agent for COVID-19 dissemination if we are equipped with the right information and skill. This study may also help the Ethiopian Federal Police Commission to take important prevention measures to limit the transmission of COVID-19 among police members of health professionals by developing a guideline on how to use the face mask as well as the development of ICC and BCC materials. It is also expected to help researchers use it as a base and/or source to do further and wider research exploration on this issue. Hence, this study was conducted to examine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of face mask utilization among healthcare providers at Federal Police Health Facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A health facility-based quantitative approach was conducted in federal police health facilities found in Addis Ababa from June to July/2020. Addis Ababa is the capital city of Ethiopia with a population of around 4.7million. 7 The capital has ten administrative sub-cities and 99 Kebeles. There are a total of 38 hospitals (ten public and 28 NGO and private) in the study area. 8 At the time of the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13 study period, there were about 578 health professionals from the different departments working in all of the federal police health facilities in Addis Ababa.The source population was all health professionals who were working at federal police health facilities found in Addis Ababa. The study population for this study was all health professionals working at federal police health facilities in Addis Ababa during the study period and who fulfill the inclusion criteria were the study population. The inclusion criteria for this study were those health professionals who were willing to give informed consent and available at the time of the study. The total health professionals available during the study period were 578 and all of them were included in this study.The questionnaire was developed by reviewing previous different literature on the proper use of surgical face mask and the guidelines of the Centre for Health Protection WHO and the CDC [14] [15] [16] and in consultation with experts from different fields to check the relevance and make necessary changes according to the study requirements. The questions were modified according to the suggestions received from the expert panel and output from the pretest. Guidelines for layout, question design, formatting, and pretesting testing were followed.The self-administered questionnaire developed by the investigators contained the following 4 sections: 1 basic demographic characteristics (age, gender, police rank, monthly income profession), and 2 knowledge, 3 attitude, and 4 practices regarding the use of proper face mask utilization. The data were collected through a selfadministered method by two trained data collectors.SPSS version 23 computer software package was used to analyze the data. Frequency, percent, and standard deviation of given data for each variable were calculated. Summary statistics of given data for each variable were calculated. A logistic regression model was used to measure the association between the outcome like Knowledge attitude and practice of proper face mask utilization and the associated factors. Statistical significance was declared at p-value<0.05. Direction and strength of association were expressed using OR and 95% CI.A preliminary phase was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire before its use. Initially, three Ethiopian experts in the field of epidemiology and research in Ethiopian universities were asked to assess the degree to which items in the questionnaires are relevant and can correctly measure knowledge, attitude, and practice of proper face mask use in case of COVID-19 and then correction was made accordingly. Pretesting of the questionnaire was also done on 20 participants who were excluded later from the study sample. The data from the pre-test were used to assess internal consistency and reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The results showed adequate internal consistency and reliability with Cronbach's alpha= 0.78for attitude questions,0.67 for knowledge question, and 0.89 for practice question.Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Police College of Health Science, which was confirmed to the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. Official permission was also obtained from the principals of the health facilities before approaching the study participants. The objective and purpose of the study were clearly explained to the study subjects to obtain written informed consent before data collection. Participants were also informed that they can discontinue or decline to participate in the study at any time. Confidentiality of the information was maintained and the data were recorded anonymously throughout the study.For the convenience of analyses, each correct response in the knowledge category was scored 1, and each incorrect response was scored 0. The final score was calculated and then labeled based on score (out of 9). The correct response of >7 out of 9 questions (>80%) was considered as good knowledge and ≤7 (≤80%) was considered as poor knowledge. 14 Respondents were asked nine questions (eg Face mask are very effective at preventing potentially infectious droplets from spreading) to describe their level of agreement in Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress a five scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. If it is above or equal to the average it was considered a positive attitude. 14For the convenience of analyses, each correct response in the practice category was scored 1, and each incorrect response was scored 0. The correct response of >11 out of 14 questions (>80%) was considered as good practice and ≤11 (≤80%) was considered as poor practice. 14A total of 408 health workers working in Police health facilities of Addis Ababa were included in this study.Around one-third of the study subjects, 127 (31.1%) were under the age group of 30years with a mean ± SD of 36.20 ± 9.05 years and ranges from 22 to 59 years old. The majority of the respondent 246 (60.3%) were males and more than half 258 (63.2%) of them were married. The majority 254 (62.3%) and 170 (41.7%) of them were degree holders by educational level and high level in rank, respectively. Most 178 (43.6%) of them were nurses in their profession. Concerning their experience, more than half 218 (53.4%) of the study participants had 10 and above years of experience ( Table 1) .Of the total of 408 respondents, 310 (76.5%) of them had poor knowledge about face mask ( Figure 1 ).Almost all 350 (85.8%) and 362 (89.7%) of the health professional know surgical mask can protect from COVID-19 and correct use of surgical face mask, respectively. Two hundred fifty-four (62.3%) and 230 (56.4%) of the participants know the lyres of the surgical mask and the layer which acts as a filter media, respectively. Concerning the type of mask, for protection against COVID-19, 276 (67.6) of the participants were responded to the correct answer. Less than half 196 (48%) of them know the duration of surgical mask use (Table 2 ). More than half 223 (54.7%) of the respondents had a negative attitude towards face mask utilization ( Figure 2 ). This study identified most 332 (81.4%) and 327 (80.1%) of the health professionals were willing to know the correct steps of face mask wearing and believe that face mask should be carefully put-on and taken off, respectively. Regarding the effectiveness of face mask in preventing the spread of droplets, 326 (77.5%) of them believe it is effective while 86 (21%) of them disagreed. Half 220 (53.9%) of the professionals believe in changing face mask before going to another patient while 160 (39.2%) think it is not necessary to change face mask before going to another patient. Close to one-fourth of 92 (22.5%) disagreed it is not necessary to wear a face mask while in contact with patients and 174 (42.6%) said it is necessary to wear a face mask as am afraid of getting COVID-19. The large majority of 255 (62.5%) of the professionals believe that it is necessary to wear a face mask as infected with COVID-19 is the worst thing that could happen to me (Table 3) .Of the total of 408 respondents, 272 (66.7%) of them had a poor practice of face mask utilization (Figure 3 ). Good practice of face mask use was higher among nurses (48.20%) and medical doctors (9.60%). The proportion of poor face mask use was higher among midwives (30.1%) and health offices (19.10%) (Figure 4 ).More than half 243 (59.6%) of the professionals removed their face mask if there is a need to talk to the patient while 317 (77.7%) of the store using a mask in a bag for later use if not sick. One-third of 136 (33.3%) of the study participants do not wear face mask in public places and most 372 (91.3%) of them wore face masks in hospital premises. A significant number of 151 (37.0%) of health professionals do not clean their hands before wearing their face mask and more than half 233 (57.1%) of them check the inside and outside of the mask before wearing. Close to three-fourth 229 (71.6%) of them did not clean their hands after taking off the mask and 314 (77.0%) re-used a single-use mask ( Table 4 ).Sex, educational level, and profession were found to be significantly associated with knowledge about face mask used with a P-value < 0.05.Male health professionals were 2.20 times less knowledgeable about face mask and its use compared to female professionals (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.86). Similarly, nurses, midwives, and public health officers were less knowledgeable about face mask and its use compared to other professionals [(AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.17, 5.65), (AOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.41, 7.89), (AOR = 9.30, 95% CI: 3.44, 25.02)], respectively (Table 5 ).Attitude towards face mask use was significantly associated with the educational status, rank, profession, and knowledge about face mask and its use with a P-value < 0.05. Professionals with an educational level of diploma and degree were more likely to have a negative attitude about face mask use compared to professionals with an educational level of master and above professionals [(AOR = 5.0, 95% CI: 2.08, 12.20), (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.07, 5.47)], respectively.Lower rank police professionals were less likely to have a negative attitude about face mask use than professionals with higher police rank (AOR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.64). Similarly, nurses and public health officers were less likely to have negative attitude than other professionals [(AOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.84), (AOR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.79)]. Police health professionals with poor knowledge about face mask and its use were less likely to have a negative attitude about face mask use compared to police health professionals with good knowledge about face mask and its use (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI: 0.05,0.17) ( Table 6 ).Educational status, police rank, profession, and knowledge about face mask use were significantly associated with the proper practice of face mask use. Police health professionals with an educational status of degree were ten Professionals with poor knowledge about face mask and its use were less likely to properly use face mask than professionals with good knowledge of face mask and its use (AOR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.003,0.023) ( Table 7) .Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs like COVID-19. 16 So the main aim of this study was to determine the knowledge attitude, practice, and associated factors of proper face mask utilization practice at police health professionals in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted to assess the efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission were showed that the proper use of masks by healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80%. 17 But, in the current study, the magnitude of proper face mask utilization in the study area was 33.3%. This is almost in line with the study conducted at Dessie referral hospital, Northeast Ethiopia which was reported as 35.1% of the health professionals were wore a face mask when handling TB suspected patients only 18 and with the study conducted in Pakistan which was 35.2 of the healthcare workers wear face mask correctly. 6 Similarly, the current result was much lower compared to the study conducted in Malaysia which reported as 51.2% of the public had not used face mask. 19 This difference might be due to the study's aim difference the current study was focusing on the proper utilization of masks. But the current study was higher than with the study conducted in Hong Kong among adults in the community which was only 7.6 of the participants reported that they always wore face mask when taking care of family members with fever or respiratory infections. 20 With regard attitude of health professionals towards face mask utilization, in the current study, less than half 45.3% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards proper face mask utilization. This was much lower compared to the 18 This difference might be due to the difference in study area and tool, and similarly, it was lower compared to the study done in Malaysian public which accounted 83.1. 19 These discrepancies might be explained by the qualitative study conducted among healthcare workers in Vietnam identified that as most of the discussants had a reservation on face mask protection against the respiratory disease as they did not have adequate data on the efficiency of face mask on the prevention of respiratory illness like COVID-19 and other discussants also raise the issue of face mask use might hurt the patient feelings. 1 The current study identified that 24% of the health professionals had poor knowledge about face masks. The result was lower than the study conducted in Dessie, Ethiopia which in which 86.4% of them had good knowledge 18 and with the study conducted in Public Malaysia which accounted for 80.5% of the public participants were knowledgeable. 19 This difference might be contributed to the different study population sample size determination and operational definition.This study has some limitations. One of the limitations is bias occurred as a result of the study design (crosssectional) since the study took the information at specified time-points and cause and effect association cannot be studied. Different mechanisms were used to reduce potential bias in the study. This study was also limited to a quantitative approach. In addition to this, a lack of sufficient similar study limited comparison to this study finding with other studies.This study identified the knowledge, attitude, and practice of proper face mask utilization among police health professionals in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. This study concluded that the knowledge of face mask attitude towards proper face mask use and practice of proper face mask utilization of police health professionals extremely low. Educational status, police rank, profession, and knowledge about face mask use were significantly associated with the proper practice of face mask use. Comprehensive training about a face mask that focuses on its proper use should be designed and given by the authorities to healthcare workers who are on the frontline in the fight against COVID-19. Authorities should design policies and guidelines that address the different types of face mask, their use, and the importance of proper use of face mask use during this pandemic.Consent to publish is not applicable for this manuscript because there are no individual data details like images or videos.The result of this research was extracted from the data gathered and analyzed based on the stated methods and materials.

There is hope that public health interventions will be able to slow the pandemic. By reducing the rate of spread of the disease, public health countermeasures can buy time for the development of medical countermeasures while also helping to ensure that the health-care system does not become overwhelmed by a surge of patients. Unfortunately, each type of public health intervention raises serious ethical and human rights concerns. 4 Quarantine is among those public health strategies that keeps people who have been exposed to a highly contagious illness separate from people who have not been exposed. 5, 6 It is also a public health measure designed to reduce the potential for the spread of diseases that are considered to be of major public health concern, and for which vaccines and treatments are not readily available. 7, 8 Quarantine has been used for many centuries as a strategy to control epidemic diseases that threaten to spread nationally or internationally, with the first formal system being documented in Italy during the fourteenth century plague epidemic. 9 Quarantine may be used under the following conditions such as if a person or a welldefined group of people have been exposed to a highly dangerous and highly contagious disease, resources are available to care for quarantined people, and resources are available to implement and maintain the quarantine and deliver essential services. 6, 9 Quarantine applies for people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but who may or may not become ill. 10 Relative to other health policy areas, literature on quarantine tends to lack quantitative expressions of effectiveness, or agreement on how best to report differences in outcomes attributable to control measures. 11 Study revealed that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce and control reproduction number and transmission risk of COVID-19. However, the effect of travel restriction is almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. 12 Developing countries, however, face distinct pressures and constraints which make it significantly harder for them to enact effective stimulus without facing binding foreign exchange constraints. 13 If it is not controlled early a devastating outcome may happen related to COVID-19. Food Aid Organization is seeking USD 110 million to maintain the provision of critical assistance where there are already high levels of need, while meeting new needs emerging from the effects of COVID-19. 14 Ethiopia is a major African airline gateway. Since the COVID-19 pandemic Ethiopia started screening passengers at Bole international airport and used a laboratory in South Africa for confirmation of suspected cases. Laboratory tests for COVID-19 started on February 7, 2020 in the country. 15 At the beginning the country dedicated one hospital (COVID-19), Eka Kotebe Hospital for isolation and treatment of COVID-19 cases. Now, the treatment and testing facilities are being expanded to cities outside the capital. The first COVID-19 case was identified on March 2020 in the country. Quarantining of passengers for 14 days, isolation, testing, and contact tracing was actively conducted by repurposing different hotels and universities. The government called on the residents to implement physical distancing, hand washing, and cough hygiene. 16 If appropriate preventive measures are not implemented the burden COVID-19 is more severe in developing nations because of limited resources. Quarantine and travel bans are often the first response against new infectious diseases. Despite the breadth and allure of travel bans and mandatory quarantine, an effective response to COVID-19 requires newer, more creative legal tools. With COVID-19 in our communities, the time has come to imagine and implement public health laws that emphasize support rather than restriction. 17 Study also revealed that COVID-19 severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors uniquely predicted mental health over and above gender, age, and chronic diseases. 18 In addition to this, community risk perception correlates with adoption of preventative health behaviors. 19 Different activities are being undertaken to combat COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. 20 In the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2020:13 early days of China's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, leaders recognized the behavioral health impact of the outbreak and response efforts on citizens. 21 Mandatory public health measures like quarantine are essential to combat infectious diseases, especially for new emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 where no vaccine or cure exists. Therefore, high adherence rate to this public measure has a critical role in a successful control of pandemic disease; however, some individuals are reluctant to comply with a quarantine, perhaps owing to uncertainty, scarce information, economic pressure, and a widespread perception of loss of control. 22 In contrast loneliness, social boycott and pressure to quarantine are among factors mentioned as suicide causalities. 23, 24 During the 2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the use of quarantine, border controls, contact tracing, and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat in just over three months. 25 In Ethiopia, only little is known about lay perceptions of and attitudes toward its modern-day use of quarantine. In view of the evidence of potential adverse effects on individual well-being and psychosocial health, and owing to the critical necessity of high compliance in the event of a major infectious disease outbreak, it is increasingly important to understand how quarantine is perceived by the public. Determining prevailing public attitudes toward the use of quarantine as a means of infectious disease control is a critical issue to increase its use among suspected individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess community perception toward quarantine for COVID-19 and associated factors among adult residents of selected towns in Southwest Ethiopia, 2020.The study was conducted in Mizan-Aman, Bonga and Tepi towns among adult residents from 1 to 15 June 2020. Mizan-Aman town is located 561 km southwest of Addis Ababa which is the capital city of Ethiopia. Bonga town is located to the southwest direction 460 km from Addis Ababa while Tepi town is located 611 km southwest of Addis Ababa. There is one health center and one general hospital in each town. In the three selected towns there are places prepared for public quarantine sites.Community-based cross-sectional study triangulated with qualitative data collection was conducted. All adult population found in selected towns in Bonga, Mizan-Aman, and Tepi towns were the source population while randomly selected adult population found in the towns were study population. Adult individuals who were residents of study area for at least six months were included while adults who were unable to hear and severely ill during the data collection time were excluded from the study.Sample size for quantitative study: the sample was determined using single population proportion formula 26 based on the following assumptions n=[(Z a/2 ) 2 *p (1-p)]/d 2 Where, n=sample size, Z α/2=standard score for 95% confidence level (1.96), p=50% proportion of positive perception. n= [(1.96) 2 *0.5(1-0.5)]/(0.05) 2 =385. By adding 10% nonresponse the sample size became 422. Using design effect of two the final sample size was 844.Sample size for qualitative study: in-depth interview was conducted among selected community members in selected towns. Five in-depth interviews from each town, a total of 15 in-depth interviews were conducted.Sampling technique for quantitative study: the three towns Mizan-Aman, Bonga, and Tepi were purposely selected because of the large population size and high mobility of people across them. Systematic random sampling was used to select the study participants. Thirty percent of kebeles were selected from each town ie, two from Mizan-Aman (Kometa and Idget), one from Bonga (Kebele-02) and one from Tepi town (Andinet). Sample size was proportionally allocated from selected kebeles based on their total households. Accordingly, 206 allocated for Kometa, 217 for Ideget, 168 for Kebele 02, and 253 for Andinet. K was calculated by dividing total households in the kebele to total sample size, and it became nine. Since there is a possibility of more than one adult from each household, a lottery method was used to select one adult from those households.Sampling technique for qualitative study: purposive/ judgmental sampling technique was employed in order to obtain individuals with detail information about perception of community toward quarantine. Elders and development army leaders were selected.The questionnaire was adapted from related literature. 27 It has four parts including sociodemographic, knowledge of International Journal of General Medicine 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comCOVID-19, knowledge about quarantine, and perception toward quarantine. The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the sample size in Kite town which is 8 km away from Mizan-Aman town.Data were collected by trained data collectors. Diploma nurses were recruited for data collection. Three supervisors were recruited and facilitate the data collection procedures. A two-day training was given for data collectors and supervisors on objective of the study, interview techniques and informed consent. Internal consistency was checked using Cronbach's alpha giving the value of 0.73 for items used to assess perception toward quarantine.Knowledge of COVID-19 was measured by 26 yes or no items. Correct answers were coded as 1 and incorrect as 0. The maximum score will be 26 while the minimum is 0. Then those residents who answered more than half of the knowledge questions were considered as having good knowledge of COVID-19 otherwise it was poor. 28, 29 Knowledge of Quarantine Knowledge of quarantine was measured by eight yes or no items. Correct answers were coded as 1 and incorrect as 0. The maximum score will be eight while the minimum is 0. Then those residents who answer more than half of the knowledge question were considered as having good knowledge of quarantine otherwise it was poor. 28, 29 Perception Toward Quarantine Perception was measured by 15 Likert scale items: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral (3), agree (4) and strongly agree (5) and was adapted from related literatures. The reverse coding was done for negatively written questions. Sum score and mean score were computed. The sum score ranged between 15 and 75. Then the higher the score indicates the more perception toward quarantine while the lower the score indicates negative perception toward quarantine. Based on mean score the respondents who scored above the mean score were considered as having positive perception otherwise negative perception toward quarantine. 28 The collected data were checked for completeness manually, and entered, cleaned and checked by EpiData manager version 4.0.2 and then exported to SPSS version 23 statistical packages for analysis. Descriptive analysis of different variables was presented in terms of frequencies, percentages and text. Simple (bivariate) linear regression was performed to select variables for multiple linear regression analysis. Then, variables with p-value <0.25 in the simple linear regression analysis were taken as candidates for multiple linear regression analysis.At the end multiple linear regression analysis were performed to control for possible confounding effect of the selected variables and variables with p-value <0.05 will be taken as statistically significant association with community perception toward quarantine and OR with its 95%CI was used to show the degree of association between the independent and outcome variables. Assumption of linear regression and multicollinearity were checked.The audiotape data recorded during interview was transcribed verbatim by the principal investigator. The transcribed data were then translated from local language to English language by an expert. Then, thematic analysis approaches were used and the principal investigator coded, categorized, and thematized the data by using Atlas.ti software version 7.0.71. The principal investigator started coding of the data after reading and rereading to become familiar with it.A pretest was conducted on 5% of the sample size before the main study in Kite town. The data collected during the pretest was not included in final analysis part of the main study. A two-day training was given for data collectors and supervisors on how to collect data.The data collection methods, tools and how to handle ethical issues was discussed with the data collectors. The questionnaire was translated into respondent's language during data collection. Regular supervision by the supervisor and the principal investigator was made to ensure that all necessary data was properly collected. Each day during data collection, filled questionnaires were checked for completeness and consistency. submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInternational Journal of General Medicine 2020:13The total of 816 study participants were interviewed making a response rate of 96.6%. The median age of respondents were 30 years. From interviewed participants 450 (55.1%) were male, 576 (70.6%) were married, 269 (33%) attended above secondary school, 447 (54.8%) were orthodox Christian and 312 (38.2%) of them were Kaffa in ethnicity. Table 1 Sources of Information About COVID-19Six hundred and ninety-six (85.3%) of the respondents heard about quarantine from TV while 354 (43.4%) heard from the radio (Figure 1 ).The mean score of knowledge about COVID-19 was 13.41 (SD: 3.09). Four hundred and fifty-five (55.8%) of the respondents have poor knowledge about COVID-19. Regarding the symptoms of the disease, 592 (2.5%) of them mentioned dry cough followed by headache and sore throat, 428 (52.5) and 403 (49.4%), respectively. Six hundred and eighty (83.3%) of them mentioned direct contact with infected people as the main mode of transmission followed by droplet contacted from infected persons, 525 (64.3%). Hand washing with soap and water was the main preventive mechanism mentioned by the majority of the respondents, 653 (80%) ( Table 2 ).The mean score of knowledge of quarantine was 5.98 (SD: 1.71). About two thirds, 522 (64.0%) of the study participants have adequate knowledge about quarantine based on mean score ( Table 3 ). The majority of in-depth interview participants also explained very well what quarantine is. For instance, a 44 years female participant explained quarantine as Quarantine is the place where people suspected with COVID-19 stay for 2 weeks in order not to infect other community members. The person who is suspected for COVID-19 will be released from quarantine after 15 days when he/she is told by health professionals as he/ she is free of COVID-19.The participants have also explained the use of quarantine correctly. A 39 years old male participants explained the importance of quarantine like this ""Having quarantine is helpful because it reduces the chance of infection among the community members by putting the suspected people away from the community"".Mean scores difference for perception of quarantine was assessed by one-way ANOVA and independent sample t-test. A one-way ANOVA revealed that the mean quarantine perception score was significantly different by educational status (F 3 , 812=17.31, p<0.001), occupational status (F5, 812=9.46, p<0.001). The post hoc test indicated that the mean perception score for educational status of secondary education was 56.72 (SD: 5.43) and above secondary education 54.18 (SD: 5.34) were significantly greater than the mean attitude score for educational status of no education and primary education. An independent In simple linear regression age of respondents, sex, presence of radio/TV, marital status, educational status, occupation, having training on COVID-19, knowledge of COVID-19 and quarantine were found to have a p-value of <0.25. After controlling possible confounding variables in multiple linear regression, having training on COVID-19, educational status, occupation, knowledge of COVID-19, and knowledge of quarantine were significantly associated with perception toward quarantine. Having training on COVID-19 was among a factor positively associated with perception toward quarantine ie, when we change the status of training from nontrained to trained the perception toward quarantine score will be increased by 2.76 units keeping other variables constant (β=2.76, p=0.005). When we change the educational status to secondary the perception score will be increased by 2.73 keeping other variables constant (β=2.73, p=0.001) . Similarly, when we change educational status to above secondary the perception mean score will be increased by 2.24 keeping other variables constant (β=2.24, p=0.011). Being a merchant in occupational status was also associated with perception toward quarantine. As we change occupation to merchant the perception score will be increased by 1.73 keeping other variables constant (β=1.73, p=0.020). Knowledge of COVID-19 was also positively associated with perception score. When knowledge increase by one unit the perception score will increase by 0.23 keeping other variables constant (β=0.23, p=0.001). Lastly, knowledge of quarantine positively affects the perception toward the quarantine. As knowledge of quarantine increase by one unit the perception of quarantine score increases by 0.59 keeping other variables unchanged (β=0.59, p<0.001) Table 5 .The current study was aimed to assess community perception toward quarantine. Six hundred and ninety-six (85.3%) of the respondents heard about quarantine from the TV while 354 (43.4%) heard from the radio. In contrast to this, a study done in Turkey showed twothirds of the participants had never heard about COVID-19 and more than half have not known what COVID-19 is. This discrepancy might be the result of an information gap related to time. In this study the main preventive mechanism mentioned by the majority of the respondents was hand washing with soap and water. Similarly, a study done on Turkish adults revealed that the mostly practiced preventive method were avoidance of public transportation and frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub. 30 In addition, a study showed that the relationship between hope and resilience was mediated by preventive behaviors. 31 The result of this study showed that only 427 (52.3%) of the respondents have a positive perception toward quarantine. This indicates that efforts have to be made in increasing their perception through health information dissemination regarding the disease and quarantine. In this 996 study, 734 (90%) of the respondents believed that quarantine is the best way to stop the spread of COVID-19. In contrast to this, a study conducted in South Korea revealed that most of the participants believed quarantine was ineffective to control Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or even increases risk of spreading MERS. 32 This might be related to study time gap, as study conducted in South Korea was in 2015 so there is high information difference related to quarantine compared to the current study.According to this study, having training on COVID-19 was positively associated with perception toward quarantine. This shows creating awareness through training has an effect on the perception of quarantine and the disease. This might be when confronting new and frightening diseases like COVID-19, training people to understand the reason for quarantine might increase belief in its effectiveness and thus, their compliance with quarantine. A qualitative study conducted on risk perception and compliance with quarantine during the SARS outbreak showed that all participants reportedly agreed with the need for quarantine and people adhered to the quarantine protocols with differing levels of awareness. 33 Moreover, an untrained person may lack of clear information about the different levels of risk which might led to fearing the worst.Participants who attended secondary education and above have more positive perception of quarantine. This shows attention has to give to those participants with a low level of educational status. Similarly, a study done in Toronto showed that education is needed about the meaning of quarantine, who needs to be quarantined and why, how diseases spread, and whose health is being protected by quarantine. 22 In contrast to this, a study conducted in South Korea on Middle East respiratory syndrome risk perception among students at a university demonstrated that respondents with higher educational attainment held negative perception toward quarantine. 32 This might be due to access to different written information related to COVID-19 by educated persons. From the occupation of the respondent's, merchants have a more positive perception of quarantine. This might be related to a merchant's contacts with different individuals that helps to get information from different people. The finding from this study also revealed that knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with more positive perception of quarantine. This might be respondents who have knowledge of COVID-19 may have information regarding the prevention of the disease since quarantine is also one option of COVID-19 control. Finally, the knowledge of quarantine was associated with perception of quarantine. Respondents who have knowledge of quarantine have a more positive perception of quarantine. The systematic review conducted on how to improve adherence with quarantine also showed that the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedures were the main factors that affect adherence to quarantine. 34• On some questions, community may hide the actual response ie, social desirability bias may affect the study. In addition to this it may susceptible to interviewer bias. • Reverse causality: it is difficult to determine whether the exposure (factors associated) or outcome (perception toward quarantine) came first.Only 52.3% of the respondents have positive perception toward quarantine.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends RT-PCR test as gold standard for COVID-19 case identification [2] [3] [4] . The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal 5, 6 making the identification of ""cases"" very complex. The response plan to the pandemic requires epidemiological data that shows the true magnitude of the disease and the serology test can be used for such purposes 7 . The specificity of the RT-PCR test is almost 100%. However, sensitivity is reported as low as 64% [8] [9] [10] . Differences in the detection limits of the test kits used, low initial viral load due to timing as well as improper specimen collection [11] [12] [13] may account for such low sensitivity.The lower sensitivity or ""false negative"" RT-PCR results and/or the ""immune passport"" led to the rapid development of serologic assays [14] [15] [16] . The serologic tests in the market have different formats (lateral flow immunoassays, ELISA, and chemiluminescent immunoassays), detect different classes of antibodies (total antibody, IgG, IgM, and IgA), target different antigens (recombinant nucleocapsid protein [NP] , subunit 1 of the spike glycoprotein [S1], and the Spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain [RBD] ) and accept different types of the specimen (whole blood, serum, and plasma) 16 . Data generated from population-based serology can be used for various purposes including estimation of community transmission rates and assess the impact of nonpharmacological interventions 14 . Despite the potential of the serology test, equally, the availability of a serology test with excellent sensitivity and specificity is a discussion point.Since the report of the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 inflection in Ethiopia on March 13, 2020 , the rate of increment has been largely slow at the beginning. This required a more precise estimation of the magnitude of SARS CoV-2 infection on top of the estimates based on routine RT-PCR testing. To this end, we set a goal to conduct a series of sero-epidemiological studies. Here were reporting our first findings on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among permanent residents in Addis Ababa conducted to estimate what extent SARS-CoV-2 infection has been circulating in the population.A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted from April 23-28, 2020. The study was undertaken in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, with an estimated total population of 4,793,699 17 .The study population were adult (≥ 18 years), residents of Addis Ababa, with no history of known contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases and no recent history of travel out of Ethiopia in the past four months prior to the period of data collection. Individuals who were unable to consent, those with unstable mental state and suspected to have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded.Sample size was calculated using a samples size formula for single population proportion, assuming the proportion of people with immunity among community members. with no close contact with SARS-CoV-2Infected individuals to be14% based on earlier European studies about the time of the study 18 , 80% power and 99% confidence level The Epi Info/Open Epi program is used for the sample size calculation 19 . Accordingly, the sample size calculated was 319.Study participants were recruited from the community level randomly through sub-city health extension focal personnel. All randomly selected individuals who fulfilled study inclusion criteria were invited to the study.They were approached and received an invitation through health extension workers (HEWs) from the respective sub-city. All study participants were briefed about the study and gave written consent before proceeding to interview and sample collection.Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected through interviewer administered questionnaire. Whole blood sample for antibody testing and combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swab for RT-PCR testing was collected from each participant. A questionnaire comprising socio-demographic characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, and place of residence; a history of illness in the past three to five months like signs and symptoms of pneumonia and/ or influenza-like illness; and perceived severity of illness, etc was administered.Prior to data collection, the questionnaire was pre-tested and necessary adjustments made. Peripheral blood (4ml) was collected from each participant by experienced phlebotomist by venipuncture using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and transported to the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) Influenza laboratory for analysis. Plasma was extracted following centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10 minutes in level-II bio-safety cabinet. Plasma was stored using cryovials in refrigerator at 2-8  C until the next day. The leftover plasma was stored at -80  C for future use at EPHI bio-bank. A combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swab was collected from each participant using a Dacron or polyester flocked swabs (KANGJIAN Medical Apparatus Co., Ltd.) by trained personnel, and in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) (Longsee, LAKEbio) transported to EPHI for RT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in cold chain (2-8  C) and processed immediately or stored for 1 to 3 days at -80  C.Analysis for the presence of plasma IgM and/or IgG antibodies was done using a commercially available immunolateral flow immunoassay kit (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China) following manufacturers instruction. The interpretation of the test was made by two experts (microbiologists and laboratory technologist). According to the manufacturer the test has a sensitivity and specificity of 87.9 and 100 % respectively. Another validation study has reported the test has lower sensitivity (69% for IgM and 93.1%for IgG and the specificity was found to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG using RT-PCR assay as a comparator 20 .The combined swab (Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) was transferred into lysis buffer that contains a guanidinium-based inactivating agent and viral RNA was extracted using Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Da'an Gene Corporation) following manufacturer's instruction. Briefly a 200 μL of combined swab in VTM was used for viral RNA extraction and viral RNA was eluted with 60 μL elution buffer. Real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagent of Da'an Gene cooperation was employed for SARS-CoV-2 detection following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, two PCR primer and probe sets, which target the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF 1a/b) (FAM reporter) and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes and N (VIC reporter) genes were added in the same reaction mixture. In each run, positive and negative controls were included. Samples were considered to be positive when both sets gave reliable signal (<40CT value).All demographic, epidemiologic and laboratory data were cleaned and entered into EPI DATA using a controlled and programmed data entry format. The data was coded and anonymized data were merged to laboratory data which were exported into SPSS for windows. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise key findings. Estimation of true values for sero-prevalence for the given levels of sensitivity and specificity were computed via web-based statistical software and epidemiologic calculator including EPI Tools (https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/trueprevalence) 21 . Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the outcome variable. Variables whose p value less than 0.05 at bivariate analysis were included in multivariable analysis.The research proposal is approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of both the College of Health Sciences of the Addis Ababa University and EPHI. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. All study participants were informed of their RT-PCR test results as per the national testing protocol.While we had no any official sponsor, costs of the research were met by resources from Addis Ababa University and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI).A total of 301 participants were included in the study with a response rate of 94.4%. Most of the study participants were in the age group 18-30 years (48.2%) (with a median age of 30 years ± 10.9 years), males (62·5%), single (47·0%), and health professionals (25·6%), educated above high school (37·9%), non-smokers (78·7%), with no history of regular alcohol (42·5%), chat (70·8%), shisha (94·7%) use, vaccinated for BCG (47·8%), No contact with PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases (99·0%) (Table1). Out of the 301 individuals included in the study, 23 (7·6%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with an unadjusted antibody-based crude prevalence was 7·6%. Accordingly true prevalence adjusted for the test sensitivity and specificity was estimated at 8·8% (95% CI 5·5%-11·6%). Higher sero-prevalence were observed for Males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2), students and unemployed (15.6) , those with primary education (12.1), smokers (7.8), alcohol consumers (8.6), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%).( Table 2 ) On binary logistic regression there was negative association between chat chewing and SARS Co2Seropositivity (OR=0·35, 95% CI: 0·2, 0·9). Associations were lost on adjusted logistic regression. .Government/NGO workers were found to be associated as protective effect for SARS-CoV-2 sero status (OR=0·052, 95% CI: 0.0, 0·57) ( Table 3 ) As far as our literature review during the writing of this paper goes, this was the first SARS-CoV-2 sero- The study identified an overall SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence of 7·6% which is found to be higher than the estimates based on RT-PCT testing in Addis Ababa, during the period of the study. 20 . This reflects the fact that the actual estimates of seropositivity in the study subjects could even be higher, when adjusted to the lower values of sensitivity.Sero-prevalence studies conducted in other countries during the period of the study reported varied magnitudes of SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence: Spain health workers (9·3%) 24 and community (5%) 18 ; Germany (14%) 25 , Switzerland (5·5%) 25 , Massachusetts (30%) 25 , Los Angeles (4·1%) 25 , Santa Clara (1·5%) 25 , New York (13%) 25 Addis Ababa population is predominantly young and the prevalence of chronic diseases is relatively low compared to western countries.In the presence of such a big burden of cases in a big city like Addis Ababa, why did not we see an increase or surge in the number of severe cases in the health facilities? The same factors i.e. predominantly asymptomatic cases could explain this owing to the predominantly young population and lower levels of non-communicable diseases in the Ethiopian population. However, our study did not get any supporting evidence to the looming theory of the protective association between BCG Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection.The implications of the study: As the first antibody testing among the general public in Addis Ababa, the study signified the need for extensive serological evidence to make comprehensive estimates of the true extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population especially in a situation where we have the limited testing capacity for RT-PCR. Comparative advantages of antibody testing include cost-effectiveness, easy technology, and point of care testing. This makes serological estimates very much appealing to the low-resource settings. However, in the given circumstances, serological tests are taken as complementary rather than independent in generating epidemiologic evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is indicative of the need for more precise populationbased sero prevalence and surveillance to have a better sense of the extent of the epidemic and to monitor its progress over time, which further guides the design and implementation of targeted interventions. As this is the first of series of studies we planned, we plan to conduct nationwide sero-prevalence study and possibly set-up sentinel sero-prevalence longitudinal studies.Policy implications: Such serological estimates provide a substantial and comprehensive input to the epidemiologic projections of SARS-CoV-2 especially in a setting where extensive and reliable viral antigen tests are a limitation. In addition, the current and subsequent data will provide evidence for policy makers to make decisions on locally generated evidence.While this possibly the first SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence study in Ethiopia (possibly in Africa, there are a number of limitations. The test kit utilized was not validated in our population and the target antigen of the kit is not described by the company. In addition the relatively smaller number subjects included in the study may affect generalisability. The test kit has been validated in Sweden and used for population based studies in Spain and China. In-country validation of the study is currently being done by EPHI but not completed. The serological tests were not primarily done to detect a concurrent active infection with no contribution to SARS-CoV-2 case detection and management purposes.  It is recommended that a more extensive sero-prevalence study be conducted with a more representative population sample to further establish more substantial evidence on the extent of SARS-CoV-2infection in Addis Ababa and nationally.  Establish a system for longitudinal sero-prevalence studies in Addis Ababa and other parts of the country to have a continued precise estimate of the extent of SARS-CoV-2infection The national estimate of cases should be complemented with appropriate serology tests in the community to diagnose and identify levels of community transmission and guide containment strategies among different population groups while maintaining non-pharmacological interventions","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-13",10

The procedure of constructing a mathematical model is called mathematical modeling [2] . Mathematical modeling plays a vital role in the investigation of problems that affect our day-to-day life more specifically in the field of medicine and biological sciences. For example, mathematical models gave insight into tumorigenesis [3] , avascular tumor growth [3] , tumor metabolism during invasion [4] , cell migration [5] , angiogenesis [3, 6, 7] , tumor evolution [3, 8] , and cancer stem cells [9] .Robots are man-made computerized machines which perform tasks on human commands or by themselves and seek to make work easier for human beings. The research of robot modeling provides better understanding of the interaction of robots and its environment [10] . These models can help us learn the main factors of the behaviors of the system and also help us in improving the understanding of the properties of robot collective behaviors that emerged. The methodology known as probabilistic robotics for programing robots was described by Thrun [11] . The probabilistic method for the multiple robot coordination was presented by Burgard et al. [12] ; the method considers both the utility of target points and the cost of reaching a target point. The algorithm for localization of collaborative mobile robots was presented by Fox et al. [13] ; the method was successfully able to use the sample-based version of Markov localization to localize mobile robots in any time fashion.Towards the end of December 2019, a massive case of pneumonia from an unknown source was found in China which spread throughout the country within a month. Later, the pathogen of the disease was identified by means of molecular methods as a novel coronavirus and it was named as novel coronavirus 2019 (2019 n-CoV); however, in February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) renamed the epidemic disease as coronavirus disease 2019 [14 -17] . Patients with this illness are frequently presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath within 2 to 14 days after exposure [18] . As of March 23, 2020, there had been 332,930 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported globally, and 14,510 deaths had been reported [19] . In recognition of the widespread global transmission of COVID-19, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [20] .There is no treatment and vaccine against the infection yet, but the standard recommendation to prevent infection spread at the individual level is the compliance with orientation strategies that include reporting of suspected case, selfisolation, regular hand washing using sanitizers, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and avoiding contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing [21] .However, to curtail the spread of the infection, many governments undertake the following policies: prohibit migration of individuals into their countries especially from those countries that were known to have COVID-19 epidemic, wide public orientation on distancing from public gatherings that include social and religious, banning both the local and international air trip, closing both public and private institutions that may attract large gathering, contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals, providing sanitizers at public domains like markets and car park, fumigating the area where an infected individual comes from, and to a large extent imposing stay at home curfew.Considering the current disastrous situation, robots are well suited for caring for the well-being of COVID-19 patients thus replacing or at least sharing the workload of the medical staff in hospitals under oversaturated conditions. A number of robotic systems are used for medical support in hospitals today [22] . In China, robots have been assigned multiple tasks to minimize the spread of COVID-19, such as utilizing them for cleaning and food preparation jobs in infected areas hazardous for humans. This study is one of the first studies which highlight the importance of robotics in hospitals and healthcare facilities specially concerned with the COVID-19 outbreak.Looking at the nature of the spread of COVID-19, i.e., from an infected to a healthy person through the eye, nose, and mouth, via droplets produced upon coughing or sneezing and contact with contaminated surfaces, objects, or items of personal use [23] , this put the life of medical practitioners at risk. The prime utilization of robots is to minimize personto-person contact and to ensure cleaning, sterilization, and support in hospitals especially in carrying out tests. This will result in minimizing the life threat to medical staff and doctors taking an active role in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention of the present research is to highlight the importance of medical robotics in general and then to connect its utilization with the perspective of COVID-19 management so that the hospital management can direct themselves to maximize the use of medical robots for various medical procedures. Also, some of the government policies were excellent in curtailing the spread of the disease, but employing a single policy may not be very much effective. In this paper, we developed a model that suggests the use of robots in identifying COVID-19-positive patients and which studies the effectiveness of the government policy of prohibiting migration of individuals into their countries especially from those countries that were known to have COVID-19 epidemic.The paper is arranged as follows. Section 1 gives the introduction; Section 2 studies the model formulation and meaning of parameters and variables; Section 3 gives the stability analysis of the equilibria; Section 4 gives the detailed numerical simulations and studies the effect of the control measures taken; and finally, Section 5 gives the summary and conclusion of the paper.We consider a compartmental model consisting of two equations; the first equation illustrates the dynamics of infected individual population. The population of infected individuals increases by introducing new infected individuals by one of the methods of infection αI or by migration of infected individuals from another country CðIÞ. It is reduced by death due to infection μI or when a robot identifies an infected individual βRI, who will subsequently be taken into isolation (when he shows no sign of infection) or quarantine (when he shows a sign of infection). The second compartment illustrates the dynamics of the robot population. It increases by constant introduction of newly formed robots γ and reduces when a robot stops functioning θR. Table 1 gives the meaning of the variables and parameters.Then,whereCðIÞ = C when there are many infected human migrants, and CðIÞ = C/I when there are few infected human migrants.We consider and analyze two models in this paper:In model (3), there is no government restriction on the migration of individuals into the country, as such the infective population increases by C (many infected human migrants).In model (4), there is government restriction on the migration of individuals into the country, as such the infective population increases by C/I (few infected human migrants).LetIf R = 0, α − μ ð ÞI * = −C,Therefore, this equilibrium point E 0 = ðI * , 0Þ = ðC/μ − α, 0Þ exists (biologically meaningful) if μ > α.This equilibrium entails a situation whereby there are infected individuals in the population but there are no available robots to identify them. In this case, asymptomatic cases cannot be identified as such the disease will continue to spread.If I ≠ 0 and R ≠ 0, thenTherefore, this equilibrium point exists (biologically meaningful) if ðβγ/θÞ + μ > α.This equilibrium entails a situation whereby both infected individuals and robots are present in the population. It is expected that infected individuals will be identified by the robots, and hence, the disease spread can be curtailed. Theorem 1. The equilibrium point E 0 is locally asymptotically stable when α/μ < 1.Consider the Jacobian matrix of (3)The characteristic equation of the Jacobian matrix is in general given asThe solution is locally asymptotically stable if t r ðJÞλ < 0 and det ðJÞ > 0. So both the eigenvalues have negative real parts. Now, substituting E 0 = ðC/α − μ, 0Þ in (8), we getTheorem 2. The equilibrium point E 1 is locally asymptotically stable when ðμθ + βγ + θ 2 Þ/αθ > 1.Proof: Substitute E 1 = ðCθ/ðβγ + μθ − αθÞ, γ/θÞ in (8), we get If R = 0, we haveBut biologically,is not meaningful. So, we consider, with μ > α.This equilibrium entails a situation whereby infected individuals and migration restrictions are present in the population. It is expected that the population of infected individuals will not increase much. Now, when both I * ≠ 0 and R * ≠ 0, we haveAgain, I * = − ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi C/ððβγ/θÞ + μ − αÞ p is not biologically meaningful; hence, we consider I * = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi C/ððβγ/θÞ + μ − αÞ p which exists only when βγ θ + μ > α,This equilibrium entails a situation whereby infected individuals, robots, and migration restrictions are present in the population. It is expected that infected individuals will be identified by the robots and the inflow of new infection will be stopped; hence, the disease spread can be drastically reduced.Theorem 3. The equilibrium point E 2 is locally asymptotically stable when μ > α.Proof: The proof is trivial. Theorem 4. The equilibrium point E 3 is locally asymptotically stable when ðβγ/θÞ + μ > α.Since 2ðα − βðγ/θÞ − μÞ < 0 and −θ < 0, thenNote that the steady state solution in which the infected individuals are absent is not considered here, because it is not biologically important.Numerical simulations using the variable and parameter values as given in Table 2 were carried out. Simulations for the various equilibrium solutions in Section 3 were given. Figure 1 gives the dynamics of the infected individuals when there are robots for identification of the infected individuals but there is no restriction on migration, which is equivalent to E 1 . Figure 2 gives the dynamics of the infected individuals when there are robots for identification of the infected individuals and there is restriction on migration, which is equivalent to E 3 . Figure 3 gives the dynamics of the infected individuals when there are no robots for identification of the infected individuals but there is restriction on migration, which is equivalent to E 2 . Finally, Figure 4 gives the dynamics of the infected individuals when there are no robots for identification of the infected individuals and there is no restriction on migration, which is equivalent to E 0 .From the graphs, we can see that the best policy is to adopt the robot identification and migration restriction policies together as illustrated in Figure 2 . From Figure 1 , even though there is robot identification policy but with time due to the increase in the number of migrants, the number of infected individuals shoots up. Figure 3 shows that the restriction of migration policy alone cannot be used to curtail the spread of the disease. Figure 4 shows that the situation becomes worst when there are no robots for identification and there is no restriction on migration.In this paper, we used a mathematical modeling approach to study the effectiveness of some of the strategies adopted by policy makers to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Two compartmental models were constructed. The first model considered migration into the infective population, while the second model considered migration restriction.In the first model, two equilibrium solutions were obtained: E 0 and E 1 . E 0 is the solution obtained when there are infected individuals in the population but there are no robots to identify them. E 1 is the solution obtained when there are infected individuals in the population and there are robots to identify them. Local stability analyses of the equilibria were proved. Figures 4 and 1 show the numerical results corresponding to E 0 and E 1 , respectively.In the second model, two equilibrium solutions were also obtained: E 2 and E 3 . E 2 is the solution obtained when there are infected individuals and migration restrictions in the population. E 3 is the solution obtained when there are infected individuals, migration restrictions, and robots in the population. Local stability analyses of the equilibria were proved. Figures 3 and 2 show the numerical results corresponding to E 2 and E 3 , respectively.From the graphs, one can conclude that the best policy is to adopt the robot identification and migration restriction policies together as illustrated in the second graph.There is no data available for this research.There is no conflict of interest related to this research.","Nigeria","first author","2020-10-13",10

SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019, as a cluster of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan (pneumonia of unknown cause), Hubei Province, China, from where it spread rapidly around the globe involving more than 190 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. 1, 2 As of 22 April 2020, more than 2.57 million cases have been reported across 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 178,558 deaths. About three-fourth (701,838) the people with COVID- 19 have recovered while about 52, 262 of them are in a serious or critical condition. 3, 4 There are now more than 24,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection across the continent Africa, resulting in more than 1190 mortalities. Similarly, about 116 cases and 3 death of COVID-19 are reported in Ethiopia as of 22 April 2020. 5 COVID-19 causes a range of respiratory symptoms including fever, fatigue, dry cough, and difficulty of breathing. It may result in serious complications like ARDS and death especially among elderly patients and patients with underlying medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. A study done in China shows those patients with a severe form of COVID 9 developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. At this stage of the diseases, the mortality rate is high (15%). 6, 7 For five decades, the Health Belief Model (HBM) has been one of the most widely used conceptual frameworks in health behavior. The HBM has been used both to explain change and maintenance of health-related behaviors and as a guiding framework for health behavior intervention. 8 It is now believed that people will take action to prevent or control ill-health conditions like COVID-19 if they regard themselves as susceptible to the COVID-19; if they believe it would have potentially serious consequences; if they believe that a course of action like stay home, keep social distance, wear face mask, etc available to them would help reduce either their susceptibility to the disease or the severity of the condition; and if they think that the likely barriers (or cost) of taking the actions outweighed by its benefits. 9 Given that health motivation is it's a central focus, the Health Belief Model is an ideal option for addressing behavioral problems that evoke health concerns. The model has been tested repeatedly in western countries that it fits best for health behavior change studies as well as a planning model together with other health education and planning models, such as the PRECEDE-PROCEDE model. To date, a vaccine and effective treatment are not available for COVID-19. In a situation like this, basic hygiene principles and aggressive public health measures are virtually important for preventing the spread of the disease and hence reducing its impact in the community. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing predictors of COVID-19 prevention practice among Higher Education employees in Addis Ababa Ethiopia using a Health Belief Model.The study was conducted to determine the predictors of COVID-19 prevention practice among employees working in Addis, Ethiopia, May 2020. Addis Ababa is the capital city of Ethiopia with a population of around 4.7 million. Addis Ababa has 10 9 administrative sub-cities and a total of 99 Kebeles. The study was done among employees selected from four organizations in Addis Ababa (Ethiopian Airlines, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Black Lion Hospital, and Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation). The study was done from May to June 2020.A multicentered cross-sectional study design was used to assess predictors of COVID-19 prevention practices using a Health Belief Model among employees in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2020.Employees from the four stated organizations and who are willing to participate were included in this study. Employees with hearing and visual impairment were excluded from this study.The sample size for the study was calculated using a single proportion formula by assuming 95% CL, 4% marginal error, and 50% proportion of COVID-19 prevention practice. Therefore, by adding a 10% non-response rate, the final sample size for this study was 628.The sample size was proportionally allocated to each of the four organizations. Then, a systematic sampling method was used to select the study participants from each of the four organizations. According to the available submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 data during the study period, a total of 4396 active workers were available in the four selected organizations in Addis Ababa. Hence, by dividing the total active employees during the study period (4396) with the total sample size (628), (N/n), the sampling interval (K) of 7 was obtained. The first employee was selected at random from each organization and consecutive participants were selected every seventh employee. Participants were approached in their working area.Variables COVID-19 prevention practice was the dependent variable. Demographic variables, knowledge about COVID-19, and the HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, cues to action, and self-efficacy) were the independent variables.The questionnaire was developed by reviewing previous different literature conducted on prevention practice of COVID-19 and in consultation with experts from different fields to check the relevance and make necessary changes according to the study requirements. The questions were modified according to the suggestions received from the expert panel and output from the pre-test. Guidelines for layout, question design, formatting, and pretesting testing were followed.The questionnaire was used to gather employees' demographic data, knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention, Health Belief Model constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, and cues to action self-efficacy), and practice of COVID-19 prevention.SPSS version 23 computer software package was used to analyze the data. The collected data were entered into SPSS and data cleaning was undertaken before data analysis. Summary statistics like frequency, percent, mean, and standard deviation of a given data for each variable were calculated. A logistic regression model was used to measure the association between the outcome (COVID-19 prevention practice) and the predictor variables (socio-demographic variables, knowledge, and the HBM constructs). Statistical significance was declared at p-value<0.05. Direction and strength of association was expressed using OR and 95% CI.A preliminary phase was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire before its use. Initially, three Ethiopian experts in the field of epidemiology and research in Ethiopian universities were asked to assess the degree to which items in the questionnaires were relevant and can correctly measure predictors of COVID-19 prevention practice using the Health Belief Model, and a correction was made accordingly. Then, the questionnaire was pretested on 30 participants who were excluded later from the study sample. Data were used to assess internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The results showed adequate internal consistency reliability (with Cronbach's alpha= 0.915 or perceived susceptibility, 0.773 for perceived severity, 0.954 for the perceived benefit, 0.869 for the perceived barrier, 0.806 for cues to action, and 0.986for self-efficacy questions).Approval and ethical clearance was obtained from the Institution Review Board (IRB) of Universal Medical and Business College (UMBC) which was in accordance with the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. Official permission was also obtained from the principals of the four selected organizations before approaching the study participants. The objective and purpose of the study was clearly explained to the study subjects to obtain written informed consent before data collection. Participants were also informed that they can discontinue or decline to participate in the study at any time. Confidentiality of the information was maintained and the data were recorded anonymously throughout the study.Knowledge of COVID-19: knowledge of COVID-19 was measured using 12 questions. Each correct response was scored 1, and each incorrect response was scored 0. A total score of ≥9 (≥80%) out of 12 was considered as having good knowledge whereas a score <9 (<80%) was considered as poor knowledge towards COVID-19 and its prevention.COVID-19 prevention practices: Practice of COVID-19 prevention was measured using eleven questions. Each correct response in the practice category was scored 1, and Infection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress each incorrect response was scored 0. A total score of ≥8 (≥80%) out of eleven was considered as having good practice whereas a score <8 (<80%) was considered as having a poor practice of COVID-19 prevention. 10 Perceived susceptibility: one's belief regarding the chance of getting COVID-19. Respondents will be asked eight 7 questions (eg I am not afraid of getting Coronavirus infection) to describe their level of agreement in a five-scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. If it is above or equal to the average score, it was indicative of high perceived susceptibility. 11 Perceived severity: one's belief of how serious COVID-19 and its squeal are. Respondents were asked six 6 questions (eg Becoming Corona virus-infected is the worst thing that could happen to me) to describe their level of agreement in a five scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. If it is above or equal to the average score, it was indicative of high perceived severity. 12 Perceived benefit: one's beliefs in the efficacy of COVID-19 prevention practice like hand washing, social distancing, etc. to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19. Respondents were asked 10 9 questions (eg Washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills the virus that causes COVID-19) to describe their level of agreement in a five-scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. If it is above or equal to the average score, it was indicative of a high perceived benefit. 13 Perceived barrier: one's belief about the tangible and psychological costs of practicing COVID-19 prevention mechanisms like staying at home. Respondents were asked six 6 questions (eg Face mask is hard to get) to describe their level of agreement in a five-scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing it by the total number of items. If it is above or equal to the average score, it was indicative of a low level of perceived barrier. 14 Cues to action: strategies to activate one's ""readiness"" to use COVID-19 prevention practices. Based on prior research (Wilson et al, 1991), a 6-item yes/no scale was used to assess participant's exposure to cues that could influence them to engage in COVID-19 practice. The scale was developed. Typical items as follows: ""Do you know someone with COVID-19?"" The sum of the score ranged from 6 to 12; higher scores indicated exposure to more COVID-19 information. Scale score was obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. 15 Self-efficacy: one's confidence in one's ability to use or apply prevention of COVID-19 practices recommended by WHO in a different situation. Respondents were asked five 5 questions (eg feel confident that I could talk to any person to using a face mask) to describe their level of agreement in a five-scale response format from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"". The 5-point Likert scale response options, scored from 1 to 5, were strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Subscale scores were obtained by summing item scores and dividing by the total number of items. If it was above or equal to the average score, it was indicative of a high level of self-efficacy. 16A total of 628 employees working in four organizations in Addis Ababa were included in this study. More than half of the study subjects 414 (65.9%) were in the age category of 24-28 years with a mean ± SD of 28.76 ± 5.10 years. The majority of the respondent 434 (69.1%) were males and more than half 361 (57.5%) of them were single. The majority 376 (59.9%) and 402 (64.0%) of them were degree holders by educational level and earn a monthly income of 2500-7499 birr, respectively. Most 247 (39.3%) of them were bank workers, while 131 (20.9%) of them were health workers ( Table 1) .Of the total of 628 respondents, 248 (39.5%) of them had poor knowledge about COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). All of the respondents heard about the disease. More than half 337 (53.7%) of them were not aware of the call center service number to seek information about COVID-19 and half 309 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 (49.2%) of the employees were aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19 like fever, dry cough, and difficulty of breathing. Two hundred ninety-seven (47.3%) of them believed that persons infected with COVID-19, but has no symptoms cannot transmit the virus to others. Close to half 297 (47.3%) of them said children and young adults do not need to take measures to prevent COVID-19, and people who have contact with someone infected with the COVID-19 should be immediately quarantined. Only 261 (41.6%) of them said the length of quarantine of people who have contact with COVID-19 cases is 14 days ( Table 2) . The major sources of information about COVID-19 for the study subjects were government media (TV/Radio) (69.6%), social media (67.7%), local sources like posters, banners (59.1%), national sources (MOH/EPHI) (55.4%) and private medias TV/Radio (52.7%) (Figure 2 ).Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were carried out to determine the factors affecting the employees' knowledge of COVID-19. Only variables with a p-value ≤0.2 (age, level of education, occupation, income) were included in the multivariate regression. After adjusting for possible confounding factors with multivariate regression; age, level of education, and income were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19 with a p-value <0.05.Employees in the age category of 24-28 years were 2.75 times [AOR = 2.75, 95% CI (1.72, 4.41)] more likely to have a poor level of knowledge about COVID-19 compared to employees whose age was greater than 28 years. Similarly, employees with an educational level of the certificate were 10.02 times [AOR = 10.02, 95% CI (5.02, 19.99)] more likely to have a poor level of knowledge about COVID-19 than employees with an educational level of degree an above. Employees with a monthly income of 7500-12,499 birr were less likely to have a poor level of knowledge about COVID-19 ( Table 3) .Three hundred ninety-one (62.3%) of the respondents had high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 while the rest 237 (37.7%) had low perceived susceptibility to Coronavirus infection with a mean score ± SD of 14.65±8.5 and a median value of 11. Concerning the perceived severity of the disease, 337 (53.7%) of the respondents had high perceived severity to coronavirus infection while the rest 291 (46.3%) had low perceived severity and the mean score for perceived severity was 22.34 with a standard deviation ±7.8 and median value 24. Concerning the third component of the Health Belief Model, half 316 (50.3%) of the respondents had low perceptions about the benefit of coronavirus infection prevention practice. But 312 (49.7%) of the participants had high perceived benefit with a mean ± SD score of 34.0± 12.7 with a median value of 39. Three hundred twenty-five (51.8%) of the respondents were exposed to low triggering factors for coronavirus infection prevention with a mean ± SD score of 8.9±2.3 and median value 8. Four hundred ninety-seven (79.1%) of the respondents had a high perceived barrier and the rest 131 (20.9%) of the participants had low perceived barrier with a mean ± SD score of 18.02 ± 7.3 with a median value of 21. About 329 (52.4%) had low selfefficacy towards coronavirus infection prevention with a mean ± SD score of 15.6 ± 7.5 with and a median value of 15 (Table 4) . Of the total of 628 respondents, 432 (68.8%) of them had a poor practice of COVID-19 prevention. More than half 58.3% of them did not clean surfaces. Only 39.8% of them cover their mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing while 42.4% of them disposed used tissues properly after coughing and sneezing. The majority of 60.8% of them washed their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds and 58.9% of them cleaned their hands with alcohol-based sanitizer if water is not available. More than half 55.7% of them wear masks in public areas and none of them kept their distance. More than two-thirds of 68.85% of them avoided groups and all of them stayed at home if they feel sick (Figures 3  and 4 ).A bivariate and a multivariate logistic regression model was carried out to determine the factors affecting the employees' knowledge of COVID-19. Only variables with a p-value ≤0.2 (sex, knowledge, perceived severity) were included in the multivariate regression.After adjusting for possible confounding factors with multivariate regression; income, perceived barrier, cues to action, and self-efficacy were significantly associated with prevention practice of COVID-19 with a p-value <0.05.Employees with a monthly income of 7500-12,499 birr and 7500-12,499 birr were more likely to practice the prevention of COVID-19 compared to employees with a monthly income of ≥12,500 birr [AOR = 3.67, 95% CI (1.09,12.42)] and [AOR = 4.25, 955CI (1.23,14.65)], respectively. Employees with low level of perceived barriers were less likely to have a poor practice of COVID-19 prevention compared to employees with a high level of perceived barrier [AOR = 0.03, 95% CI (0.01,0.05)]. Similarly, employees with low cues to action and employees with a low level of self-efficacy were practiced COVID prevention measures to a lesser extent compared those with high cues to action and high level Table 5 ).COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that poses a significant threat to public health. 17 Given the severe threats imposed by COVID-19 and the lack of a COVID-19 vaccine, preventive measures play a vital role in decreasing infection rates and halting the spread of the disease. 18 This indicates the necessity of employees to practice the preventive and control measures, which is affected by socio-demographic characteristics, level of knowledge, perceived susceptibility, severity, benefit, barrier, cues to action, and self-efficacy. Therefore, this study was the first study to assess the predictors of coronavirus infection prevention practice among employees of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia using the Health Belief Model. In this study, the level of COVID-19 prevention practice was 196 (31.2%). This was similar to a study conducted in residents of Ethiopia. 19 However, this was lower when compared to the previous study done among health professionals in Ethiopia which were 63%, 20, 21 and with the study conducted among the high-risk group of Addis Ababa Ethiopia which was 49% 22 with the study conducted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 23 And with the study conducted in Hong Kong which was 77% of the participants reported good health performance for COVID-19. 24 This discrepancy might be due to the difference in the study population.A perceived barrier is one of the components of HBM that deals with the perception of barriers that do not allow the performance of coronavirus infection prevention (ie availability and accessibility of water, home environment, and the availability of electricity and internet connection). 25 The present study finds out that employees with low level of perceived barriers were less likely to have a poor practice of COVID-19 prevention compared to employees with a high level of perceived barrier [AOR = 0.03, 95% CI (0.01,0.05)]. This might be due to the finding proportion of households with soap and water for handwashing was 13% and current levels of access to water and hand-washing facilities, and characteristics of the home environment are not conducive for effective implementation of basic prevention measures, including social distancing 26 and limited access to electricity and internet connection discourages work from home. 27 Self-efficacy is one of the components of HBM that refers to the level of a person's confidence in his or her ability to successfully perform the prevention mechanism of COVID-19. 8 The current study identified that employees with low cues to action and employees with a low level of self-efficacy were practice COVID prevention measures to a lesser extent compared with those with high cues to action and high level of cues to action [AOR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.026,0.10)] and [AOR = 0.08, 95% CI (0.04,0.14)], respectively. This was in line with the study conducted in Turkish adults 28 and with the study conducted in Iran among hospital staff. 29 Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing a COVID-19 are more likely to engage in unhealthy, or risky, behaviors like not wearing a face mask, unable to keep social distancing, etc., 30 and the combination of Perceived severity and Perceived susceptibility is referred to as perceived threat 31 which depend on knowledge about the COVID-19 situation. 32 The HBM predicts that higher perceived threat leads to a higher likelihood of engagement in health-promoting behaviors like keeping social distancing, properly wearing a face mask, hand hygiene, etc. But the current study failed to show the significant association between COVID-19 prevention practice and perceived severity and perceived susceptibility. This might be due to the knowledge gap that was found among the employees towards the COVID-19 situation was 40%. A study conducted in Sudan to determine the Sudanese perceptions of COVID-19 using the Health Belief Model showed that low perceived susceptibility (beliefs about the likelihood of getting COVID-19) and severity (beliefs about the seriousness of contracting COVID-19, including consequences) was 45% and 40%, respectively. 33 This is slightly higher compared to the current study, which was 37.7% of the employee had low perceived susceptibility. But the perceived severity was slightly lower which 53.7% of the employees had low perceived severity. This difference might be due to the difference in the study area.and the source of the population. In the current study of a total of 628 respondents, 380 (60.5%) of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. This was higher when it compared with the study that was done in Ethiopia which was 52% of the participants had good knowledge on transmission of COVID-19 22 and with the study conducted in India which was 39% of the participants have good perceived knowledge for preventive measures. 34This study has some limitations. One of the limitations is bias occurred as a result of the study design (crosssectional) since the study took the information at specified time-points and cause and effect association cannot be studied. Different mechanisms were used to reduce potential bias in the study. In addition to this, a lack of sufficient similar study limited comparison to this study finding with other studies. However, identifying knowledge gaps, perceived susceptibility, severity, benefit, barrier, cues to action, self-efficacy, and practice can be used to develop effective interventions and establish baseline levels to set priorities for program managers.This study examined the predictors of COVID-19 prevention practice using the Health Belief Model among employees of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A significant number of employees had poor knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention. The proportion of poor prevention practice of COVID-19 was also high. Income, perceived barrier, cues to action, and self-efficacy were significantly associated with the prevention practice of COVID-19 with a p-value<0.05. Hence, policymakers and other concerned bodies should focus on those areas to improve the prevention practice of COVID-19.Consent to publish is not applicable for this manuscript because there are no individual data details like images or videos.The result of this research was extracted from the data gathered and analyzed based on the stated methods and materials.

It spreads mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs and/or sneezes. The droplets are transferred to another individual through close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, touching an object or surface with the virus on it, and subsequently touching one's face with contaminated hands [2] . People can also get the infection through breathing in droplets coughed by someone infected [3] . The global spread is increasing and has infected millions, with the highest recorded cases in the USA, Brazil, and India [4] [5] [6] [7] . In South Africa, the emergence of COVID-19 was initially influenced by human factors which included international travel to infected countries and consequently local travels, human behaviour, and crowding in cities, among others [8] . Various ways can be used to address, prevent, and combat the spread of COVID-19. These include regular and thorough cleaning of hands with alcohol-based sanitizers, social distancing, avoiding touching one's face, practising good respiratory hygiene, self-isolation, quarantining, restricting travel, and lockdown [3] . There is currently no antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and thus, most procedures are just supportive treatment such as the provision of oxygen [8] .In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and a novel coronavirus was eventually identified [9] . The first COVID-19 case in South Africa was identified on March 5, 2020, as an imported case from one of the hotspot countries, Italy. The number of imported cases continued to rise in the country until March 17, 2020, when the first locally transmitted cases were identified. At the time of writing, the total number of cases recorded was 85 inclusive of 8 new locally transmitted cases [8] . The new cases came two days after the pronouncement of the national state of disaster by the president of the nation. On March 26, 2020 , the nation enforced a 21-day national lockdown to restrict the movement of persons during this period. The restriction largely enforced social distancing a measure to delay and prevent new local and international infections [10] . Social distancing entails limiting close contact with individuals outside the household, in indoor and outdoor spaces [11] . If used effectively, it can delay the time to epidemic peak and reduce the overall number of cases, the number of cases at the epidemic peak, and the total number of severe cases and deaths. The reduction of the number of cases during the epidemic peak and the subsequent spread of cases over a longer time period reduces the burden of health care systems thereby promoting effective case management and treatment [12] .South Africa had about 3,000 (out of about 7,000) critical care beds available between the public and private healthcare sectors reserved for critical COVID-19 patients [13] . A study done in 2017 showed that nationally, there was 1 hospital, 187 hospital beds, and 42 surgical beds per 100,000 population [14] . South Africa had the most number of COVID-19 infections in the whole of Africa, with a total of 2,272 cases as of April 13, 2020. On the same day, there was a total of 1,788,942 cumulative cases and over 117,291 deaths reported worldwide. Of the cumulative cases, 34%, 1%, 52%, 6%, 1%, and 6% were apportioned to the Americas, South-Eastern Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and Western Pacific regions, respectively. The same regions had 25,551, 896, 86,288, 5,364, 501, and 4,181 cumulative deaths, respectively [15] . Receiving over 21 million people annually with the capacity to process up to 28 million, O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg is Africa's busiest airport. It is not surprising that South Africa's first 77 cases were due to imported cases, with the first 8 local transmissions reported on March 17, 2020. The South African government, however, acted more decisively than most governments around the world by restricting travel from high-risk countries just 9 days after detection of the first local transmission case.Given that containment of COVID-19 by many countries included lockdown and social distancing, mathematical models that study the transmission dynamics of the pandemic that include the effects of various interventions are of interest [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . These models used the standard or modified SEIR compartmental structure to model the various aspects of COVID-19 dynamics. It is important to note that these models were designed specifically to model the dynamics of the infection for specific countries or regions depending on the level of the epidemic in the affected countries. For instance, [19] presented a modified SEIR model quarantining, death, and protected population compartments to reflect the situation in Italy and [16] presented multiple hosts and reservoirs model for the China situation where the infection is believed to have emanated and introduced into the human population before it spread worldwide. In [21] , an individual-based simulation model was used. To quantify social distancing effectiveness, simulation of virus transmission, with and without social distancing measures, was done. In [22] , a simple Markov chain model was used to represent the dynamics of COVID-19. The effect of social distancing was implemented by redefining the basic reproduction number on the day measures were implemented to reflect a sufficient decline in how many people each shedding or symptomatic person will infect (i.e., R 0 = 0 is perfect social distancing).The model considered in this study considers the effect of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. It resonates with the ideas portrayed in the aforementioned studies. It captures the dynamics of South Africa in the early phase of infection, uses the SEIR structure, uses the public data for COVID-19 data for cumulative cases for South Africa, and incorporates the control measures implemented by the government of South Africa during that phase.2.1. Mobility and the Epidemic Data. The lockdown imposed by the South African government impacted the mobility of citizens significantly. The reduction in mobility meant increased social distancing. So we are concerned with the mobility in South Africa soon after the lockdown. To get a sense of the general pattern of movement of the South African community before and after the lockdown, we use information from Google mobility reports [24] . Figure 1 depicts how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline (i.e., the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period March 1 to April 12, 2020). Insights in these reports are created with aggregated, anonymised sets of data from users who have turned on the ""location history"" settings on their electronic gadgets. The most recent report at the time of writing was until April 12, 2020, and represents data about two to three days in retrospect, the time it takes to produce the reports. Categories that are useful to social distancing efforts, as well as access to essential services, are included in the report. It is evident from Figure 1 that the overall trend in South Africa decreased after the lockdown (March 26, 2020). In particular, the behaviour in retail and recreation (-75%) and grocery and pharmacy (-46%) are similar, particularly a spike just before the lockdown as most people stocked up and did panic-buying, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a). In both categories, there were still movements due to essential workers that needed to go to work, with a decrease in activity during weekends. The opposite trends between workplace (-56%) and residential places (+22%) can also be observed, as seen in Figure 1 (b). In Figure 1 (c), we have the mobility for parks (-58%) and transit stations (-78%).With regard to the effect of social distancing to the COVID-19 cases, we can also observe from Figure 2 that the number of newly infected cases dramatically decreased after the lockdown, as depicted by the graph of the 7-day moving average. The mobility and epidemic data presents an opportunity to assess the possible impact of social distancing on the progression of COVID-19 in South Africa. In the next section, a mathematical model to perform this assessment is presented.We consider an SEIR model where the total population N ðtÞ at any time t is divided into the following compartments: the susceptible population SðtÞ composed of Retail and recreation (-75%) Grocery and pharmacy (-46%) 3 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine individuals with no virus in their system but at risk of contracting the infection when they come into contact with infectious individuals; the exposed population EðtÞ comprising of individuals who have the virus but not yet able to transmit the virus through sneezing or coughing; the infectious population IðtÞ, with either mild or clinical symptoms who can transmit the virus to the healthy individuals resulting in successful infection; and the recovered population RðtÞ , consisting of individuals who would have recovered either naturally due to robust immune responses or due to supportive treatment available in isolation centres or hospitals. Thus,COVID-19, as a lower respiratory infection, can be cleared within a few days, and so we shall use the day as the unit of time for our model. The model presented considers COVID-19 infection dynamics over a short period. We, therefore, consider a model for COVID-19 with no vital dynamics as a befitting assumption. As the first cases of COVID-19 in South Africa were due to imported cases, we assume the flow of individuals into South Africa as both susceptible and exposed, since no infectious cases were picked at the entry point but a few days after entry. We assume a constant immigration rate of Λ. A proportion p (0 < p < 1) of the immigrants are assumed to be exposed, and 1 − p is assumed to be susceptible. The recruitment rates Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine of SðtÞ and EðtÞ are therefore ð1 − pÞΛ and pΛ, respectively. All the imported exposed cases converted into active cases within a minimum of 2 days, and these active cases were the sources of secondary infections in the country. We assume that the new cases were a result of contacts between the susceptible individuals SðtÞ with the proportion of infectious individuals, IðtÞ/NðtÞ. The effective contact rate is β, giving a force of infection λ = β ðIðtÞ/NðtÞÞ, and the number of new infections out of SðtÞ and into EðtÞ as βIðtÞSðtÞ/NðtÞ. The exposed cases progress to active cases between 2 and 14 days at a constant progression rate κ giving the number of individuals moving out of EðtÞ and into IðtÞ as κE(t). The infectious individuals are assumed to recover at a constant rate σ. The total number of recovered individuals moving out of IðtÞ into RðtÞ is given by σIðtÞ. Currently, there is no evidence of reinfection after recovery in South Africa, and hence, we assume that no recovered individual can become susceptible to the infection. South Africa implemented a national lockdown on day 21 since the announcement of the first case, where day 1 is March 5, 2020. The lockdown saw the complete blockage of imported cases, and hence, the infection after day 21 was driven by the imported cases which were already in the country until day 21 and the local cases which resulted from these imported cases. After day 21, there were no more recruitments into the susceptible and exposed populations due to immigration as a result of the lockdown. This is tantamount to setting both Λ and p to zero after day 21. We represent the recruitment rate S rec of imported susceptibles bywhere t = t 0 is the time in which the first infectious case was identified and t = t lock is the time in which the lockdown was effected. In our model, t 0 = 0 and t lock = 21. Similarly, the recruitment rate E rec of the exposed population is given byAt the inception of the lockdown, the main mitigation strategy against the pandemic was social distancing between individuals. Social distancing reduces the contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals. We incorporate social distancing through a constant rate ρ (0 < ρ < 1), where ρ 0 means that the social distancing is near perfect, and ρ 1 means there is no social distancing. We assume that ρ does not assume its extreme values since the locking down in its inherent nature enforces some social distancing, and due to the nature of the settlement patterns in some parts of South African suburbs and the socialisation of family units, perfect social distancing is not attainable. The force of infection is modified as follows:The model diagram is presented in Figure 3 . The system of differential equations capturing the assumptions on COVID-19 for South Africa before and after the lockdown is presented in (5) and given bysubject to the following initial conditionsUsing the next-generation matrix method as in [25, 26] , the basic reproduction number R 0 of the model system (5) is determined whereThe product of FV −1 is given bywith the spectral radius denoted by3. ResultsEstimation. The epidemic data was obtained from [27] and the information released through the South African government newsroom [28] . According to Statistics South Africa [29] , the midyear population estimates for 2019 showed that the country's population stood at 58,775,022. This statistic is important in estimating the number of susceptible individuals at the start of the epidemic. It is important to note that at the beginning of the epidemic, the entire country is considered to be naive as the index cases 5 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine were all as a result of individuals who travelled to places that had already ongoing epidemics such as Asia, Europe, and North America. The first case of COVID-19 in South Africa is reported to have travelled to Italy with his wife (as a part of a group of 10) and had returned on March 1, 2020 [8] . The data on COVID-19 in this study was mainly obtained from the media releases by the South African government [28] and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases [8] from March 5 to April 13, 2020. The data included the daily updates on the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases and their distribution per province. The number of cumulative cases used for our simulations is available at the data repository and newsroom [27, 28] . The formulated model is then fitted to the data in two epochs, viz., the period before the lockdown and the duration after the lockdown. The uniqueness of this model is that it considers a constant daily influx of people into South Africa with a proportion of those coming into the country having been exposed to COVID-19. After the lockdown, the constants that model the movement of people into the country are then set to zero, and then, the epidemic is assumed to be mainly driven by local transmission dynamics.We fit the model to the data recorded before the lockdown using the least-squares curve fitting method in Matlab. Parameter bounds are set based on recent work on the epidemic in countries such as China [30] [31] [32] [33] , Korea [34, 35] , and Italy [36] . The reproduction numbers of COVID-19 were determined from various mathematical models for the epidemic in China [33, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Given the known values of the incubation period, 1/k, and the duration of infectivity, 1/σ, we estimate the effective contact rate β, for the current epidemic in South Africa. The parameter values are given in Table 1 .Analysis. The SEIR model (5) has some limitations especially on determining the parameter values. The various processes driving the model dynamics have several complexities, and hence, the model parameters are best measured approximately. The parameters have substantial variations depending on the geographical region, demographic factors, settlement patterns, and several other factors. Besides, some of the parameters may just be stochastic. The model thus has inherent epistemic uncertainty which results from a lack of knowledge about the value of parameters which are then assumed to be constant throughout the model analysis [42] . To adapt the model simulations to the South African scenario, we first used parameter values from other regions, fitted the model to the daily cumulative cases, and obtained the best fit values of the parameters. To cater to the inherent complexities around these best-fit values, we use the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. This is a reliable and efficient technique for the detection of such epistemic uncertainties allowing unbiased estimates of the average model output with fewer samples than other sampling methods to achieve the same accuracy. To measure the strength of the relationship between each input variable and each output variable, the LHS technique is combined with the partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) [43] . We use Figures 4(a) and 4(b) to show the contribution of different parameters before and after the lockdown. Their contribution is measured against the number of cumulative cases in South Africa. The range of values used is given in Table 1 . Figure 4(a) shows that the immigration parameters p and Λ are strongly positively correlated to the number of cumulative cases before the lockdown. This means that the increase in the proportion of exposed immigrants and the rate of immigration is associated with the increase in cumulative cases. Figure 4(b) shows that the infection parameter β and the social distancing parameter ρ are strongly positively correlated to the cumulative cases whilst the infection progression and recovery parameters κ and σ are strongly negatively correlated to the cumulative cases after lockdown. The increase in the infection rate and the increase in the social distancing parameter (i.e., decreasing social distancing level) is associated with the increase in cumulative parameters whilst the increase in the progression and recovery rates is associated with the decrease in cumulative cases.In this section, we fit the designed model to the cumulative cases of South Africa before the lockdown (see Figure 5 ) in the absence of any intervention to obtain the best fit model parameter values for the South African dynamics. We present the model simulations with these best fit parameter values to predict the likelihood of occurrence of the peak number of cases had the lockdown not been effected at day 21 (Figures 6  and 7) . We also fit the model to the cumulative cases when lockdown and social distancing ( Figure 8 ) were effected to obtain the best-fit parameter values. We use the resulting fit Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine to make possible predictions of the potential impact of different levels of compliance to social distancing with the lockdown in place (Figure 9 ). Figure 5 shows that the model (5) fits well to the cumulative cases of South Africa, and the best fit parameter values are the current model values that could be used for prediction in the absence of intervention. Using the best-fit parameter values, Figure 6 shows that the peak of cumulative cases would have been reached in mid-May before the number of cases begins to decline. Figure 7 is an extract of Figure 6 showing the number of exposed and infectious populations in the absence of any intervention. The figure shows that there would be more infectious cases at the peak than the exposed cases by the time the peak is reached. April 13, 2020 , in the presence of the intervention, and the best-fit parameter values are the current model values that could be used for prediction in the presence of intervention. We note that the best fit for social distancing after lockdown is about 55% (ρ = 0:45). Figure 9 shows the COVID-19 model fitting and predictions for the cumulative infected cases for various levels of social distancing. The simulations show that if the level of social distancing is maintained at 55%, then the number of cumulative cases will continue to grow exponentially. Reducing the level of social distancing from 55% to 53% (ρ = 0:47) would increase the number of cumulative cases by about 23% at the end of lockdown on April 30, 2020. Increasing the level of social distancing from 55% to 57% (ρ = 0:43), 59% (ρ = 0:41), and 61% (ρ = 0:39) would There has been a huge demand for research to quantify the control measures instituted by many countries to contain COVID-19 globally. Understanding the impact of these control measures requires knowledge and expertise drawn from various scientific disciplines including mathematical modelling. The role of mathematical models' insights formed the national response to the pandemic in South Africa. The idea of social distancing was to flatten the epidemic growth curve, thus allowing time to prepare for the worst-case scenarios, and was drawn from mathematical models for the COVID-19 epidemic. This was critical in preventing the overwhelming of health care facilities and minimising the number of deaths.We presented a deterministic model to assess the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa taking into account the initial imported cases before the lockdown in the early phase of the pandemic. The model fitted well to data with a reproductive number of 2.5 at the initial phase of the pandemic. The fitting generated the estimated COVID-19 transmission rates for South Africa. The insights gained from the current study contributed to the current levels of interventions using social distancing in South Africa.The quantification of the levels of social distancing was significant in deciding the easing of lockdown regulations. The lockdown period had an estimated social distancing parameter of around 0.54.This means that in spaces that accommodated an average of a hundred people, only fifty should be allowed to control the pandemic. The role played by immigration was also crucial in the growth of the pandemic especially in March 2020 before the closure of South African borders. The results suggest that individuals migrating into South Africa played an important role in driving the infection in South Africa, and the prevention of infections happening elsewhere on the globe needs special attention due to improved mobility of humans. Particular attention needs to be focused on travellers beyond the lockdown to ensure that screening is effectively done when travellers enter the country.The sensitivity results show the shift in the drivers of infection before and after the implementation of interventions. This may imply that any intervention leads to emerging challenges due to shifting in the drivers, and hence, proper planning is needed to scale up efforts to avert any emerging issues. Since all the parameters after lockdown have a strong correlation to the number of cumulative cases, holistic strategies are required to reduce the processes that increase the number of cases simultaneously with those decreasing the number of cumulative cases.The current levels of social distancing were predicted to be inadequate especially during the initial stages of the pandemic with exponential growth in the number of cases. There is a need for more aggressive and robust multicontrol approaches that target the reduction of the infection rate, an increase of social distancing levels, rapid detection of exposed cases, and increase in the recovery of active cases. The shifting in drivers of infection after implementation of lockdown imposed threats to the preparedness of the South African health care system in the aftermath of the lockdown. The use of multidisciplinary collaboration and predictive tools is needed to forewarn the South African health care system of such shifts and enhance emergency preparedness responses.Given that the research was done between March 5 and April 13, 2020, the current scenario of the epidemic of September 30, 2020, depicts an epidemic that has passed its peak with the recorded numbers of new cases on the decline. A decline in the number of reported deaths also declined significantly. Fears however remain on the possibility of the second wave of the epidemic as has been observed in Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Serbia.The model presented here is not without shortcomings. The dynamics of COVID-19 combined with the economic and social dynamics of South Africa present a complex scenario from a modelling perspective. On the social dynamics, social distancing in many of the informal settlements has been difficult to enforce due to the high density of people. In addition, the economic dynamics in many of the informal settlements is influenced by informal trading, thus creating difficulties and hardships to people during a lockdown. There were relaxations of the social distancing measures after the lockdown to mitigate the economic and social challenges of the general population. These relaxations had the potential to dilute the intended effects of social distancing. The model presented in this paper was simple and did not capture these complexities. Despite the shortcomings, the results present some interesting results in which even after the simulations, the data that was released on the epidemic still fell within the predictions of the model.The data used in this study is available in https://github.com/ dsfsi/covid19za/tree/master/data.Authors declare no conflict of interest.FN, CWC, and FC were responsible for the initial manuscript preparation.

From the onset of the pandemic, it was feared that Sub-Saharan Africa would not be spared because of the high volume of air traffic and trade between China and Africa [2] . The high prevalence of infectious diseases, coupled with weak healthcare systems in Africa, might lead to high mortality rates because of co-morbidity in populations [2, 3] , but it could also be assumed, on the other hand, that a younger African population distribution would lessen the death rate of COVID-19 on the continent, since mortality rates were generally high in older people [4] .When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 [5] , a total of 47 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 28 (60%) imported cases, with no deaths, had been reported across nine countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with one case in its capital Kinshasa [6] .Even if some Sub-Saharan African countries installed a total lockdown for a long time (e.g., South Africa), many Sub-Saharan African countries did not or were not able to implement lasting draconian lockdown measures because these would too severely affect social and economic systems. In search of income for the day-to-day livelihood of extended families, many Africans were forced to fend for survival and ignore concerns about contracting COVID-19 [3, 7, 8] .Around one week after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the government of the DRC closed schools, churches, bars, and nightclubs and banned all gatherings involving more than 20 people in public places. People were asked to wash hands with hydro-alcoholic solution or water and soap, to avoid close contacts and maintain social distancing, wear a face mask, no longer greet each other by shaking hands, and to call one of the ""COVID-19 attack teams"" telephone numbers in case of a suspected case [9] . However, public markets and shops selling food were exempted from these lockdown regulations. As a result, the markets remained crowded and, hence, potential high-risk places for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The population's behavior has been associated with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . In the current study done during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to assess awareness of the risk of contamination among people frequenting public markets in the former Katanga province in the south of the DRC.Between 16 and 29 April 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study among adult people (>18 years) frequenting ten public markets (mainly selling food) in the former Katanga province. Nine markets were located in three large industrial cities: two markets in Lubumbashi (about 2 million inhabitants) and three markets in Likasi (about 450,000 inhabitants) in the Haut-Katanga province, and four markets in Kolwezi (about 450,000 inhabitants) in the Lualaba province; one market was located in Lwambo (25,000 inhabitants), a small mining town north of Likasi. Authorizations from the local administrative authorities were obtained before the surveys. All participants agreed to participate in the study and the study was approved by the Committee of Medical Ethics of the University of Lubumbashi (UNILU) (UNILU/CENI/223/2020), provided that individual confidentiality would be guaranteed.The questionnaire was elaborated in French, translated into Swahili and back-translated to check for accuracy. The questions were based on the then-available scientific information about COVID-19 and concerned simple sociodemographic characteristics and 20 items to assess knowledge about clinical characteristics, transmission and prevention, and attitudes in relation to COVID-19. The questionnaire was briefly piloted among the research team and their relatives. For the actual surveys, paper questionnaires were administered face-to-face by teams of three trained interviewers who were present during around 5 h on each of the selected markets. They approached potential adult participants, either market vendors or customers, explaining that they were academic researchers (i.e., not governmental employees) doing a survey about COVID-19; anonymity of the findings was guaranteed and participants gave oral consent to respond. No attempts were made to obtain samples having identical sociodemographic characteristics in the various locations.To obtain information on behavior and good practices against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 (such as hand-washing and mask-wearing), the interviewers also checked (unobtrusively) a number of observed practices on the individual questionnaire forms and they further noted general observations in logbooks. Photographs were also made, with care being taken not to make recognizable full-face photographs.To estimate socioeconomic status (SES), we used, as a proxy, the main reported source of information regarding COVID-19: participants who declared having obtained information from watching their own televisions or through the internet (smartphone) were classified as having a ""moderate"" income; participants who obtained information from their radio were considered as having a low income; participants who did not mention the above sources of information and/or received information only from ""other people"" were considered as having a very low income.When a participant responded ""I don't know"", this was assimilated to a ""no"" or ""wrong"" answer. We used SPSS V.20 for statistical analysis, using Chi-square test and Cramer's V test as appropriate. The threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 (two-sided).Our results are based on data obtained from a total of 347 persons present, as sellers or buyers, on 10 markets surveyed between 16 and 29 April 2020. We did not always obtain complete data from each respondent, due to occasional refusals or inability to respond to some questions, as well as a number of incompletely or poorly filled out questionnaires in view of the field conditions. The survey was stopped just after the first positive case of COVID-19 had been reported in the former Katanga province. Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants. The majority were food vendors (83%) and women (83%). The mean age was 37.4 years (SD 10.7; range 18-70 years). Of note, age was available for only 233 respondents (67%) because it is unusual, for cultural reasons, to disclose one's age in this region. In general, participants differed across the four main locations with regards to gender distribution, age, socioeconomic position, and the proportion of sellers versus buyers. Based on their main source of information, half the participants could be considered as having a moderate income (access to TV or internet) and the other half as having a low income (access to radio) or a very low income. Sellers and buyers did not differ by age [37.2 (SD 10.8) years and 38.2 (SD 10.6) years, respectively], but they differed somewhat with regard to gender (15% of sellers being males versus 29% among buyers, p < 0.05) and SES (66% of buyers having a moderate income versus 48% among sellers, p < 0.05).Considering answers to the knowledge questions (Table 2) , two-thirds of the respondents did not know about COVID-19 and 60% answered that the COVID-19 pandemic was not present in the DRC, despite the 400 cases reported at the time of the surveys in Kinshasa, the capital city, admittedly located at more than 1500 km from the study area. The majority of participants (65%) were unaware of the possible COVID-19 transmission by asymptomatic patients. On the other hand, about 60% of the respondents considered COVID-19 as having the same severity as malaria or Ebola disease (an outbreak of which was ongoing in the country, but also at a distance of more than 1500 km). Although statistical comparisons between the various locations revealed significant differences for many questions, no systematic location-specific pattern emerged with regard to knowledge. Data are numbers with percentages. Data in bold (last column) concern the total participants. Socioeconomic status (SES) was based on the reported main source of information received on COVID-19: participants who declared having obtained information from watching their own televisions or through the internet (smartphone) were classified as having a moderate income; participants who obtained information from their radio were considered as having a low income; participants who did not mention these sources of information and/or received information only from ""other people"" were considered as having a very low income.

A substantial proportion (40%) were convinced that COVID-19 had a ""demonic"" origin, and 16% believed the virus had been bioengineered in laboratories. Regarding food security, the COVID-19 pandemic was felt to have a negative impact by nearly all participants, with 98% reporting a reduction in food quantity and the number of daily meals. Most participants (88%) did not agree that COVID-19 would be successfully controlled and defeated in the DRC. Nearly all respondents (97%) reported using public transportation, which in the area consists of generally cramped small minivans. Again, although statistical comparisons between locations showed significant differences for several questions on attitude, no consistent location-specific pattern could be discerned regarding attitudes.However, we found associations between responses and individual participants' characteristics (Table 3) . Knowledge and attitudes were weakly to moderately associated with reported sources of information, since correct answers tended to be given more frequently by those stating to have been informed about COVID-19 through medical staff, followed by audiovisual media. Men and women did not appear to differ much in their responses, except that 39% of men (as opposed to 11.5% of women) declared that no preventive actions were required for children and young adults. Overall, sellers and buyers did not differ significantly for most questions on knowledge, although occasional and inconsistent differences did appear between the two groups depending on location (data not shown, available on request). For instance, in Lwambo, sellers tended to have poorer knowledge than buyers, whereas the opposite was the case in Likasi. No significant differences were found between sellers and buyers with regard to attitude.During the survey, we also systematically recorded general and individual practices against COVID-19. Only five markets had washing devices (an example is shown in Figure 1 ): in Kolwezi, one market had four communal devices; in Likasi, there was one market with three communal devices and one market with four sellers having their own washing device; in Lubumbashi, one market had one communal device; and no hand-washing facilities were available in Lwambo. However, nowhere did we observe either sellers or buyers washing their hands after reciprocal contacts. Nevertheless, we found weak-to-strong significant associations between almost all questions on knowledge and attitudes and the number of hand-washing devices on the market: the proportions of respondents giving correct answers to knowledge questions and reporting good attitudes were significantly higher in markets with more than two hand-washing facilities than in markets without such facilities (Table 3) . Except for only one seller wearing a face mask (in a Lubumbashi market), face masks were not worn, as shown in Figure 2 . All payments were by banknotes, and many buyers were observed touching multiple items before choosing one. We also observed that many sellers would blow into plastic bags before placing food into the bags, but we also saw one buyer requesting another plastic bag without prior blowing. In general, social distancing was not respected, although observance of some social distancing was noted for 105 (30%) of the interviewees, with one Kolwezi market standing out in this respect [42/48 (88%) interviewees].

Except for only one seller wearing a face mask (in a Lubumbashi market), face masks were not worn, as shown in Figure 2 . All payments were by banknotes, and many buyers were observed touching multiple items before choosing one. We also observed that many sellers would blow into plastic bags before placing food into the bags, but we also saw one buyer requesting another plastic bag without prior blowing. In general, social distancing was not respected, although observance of some social distancing was noted for 105 (30%) of the interviewees, with one Kolwezi market standing out in this respect [42/48 (88%) interviewees]. To our knowledge, this is the first survey that attempted to assess public perception in public markets regarding COVID-19 at an early stage of the pandemic in Africa. We administered a simple questionnaire on knowledge and attitudes to people frequenting or working in ten public markets in four different locations in the mining area of the former Katanga province in the southeast of the DRC. Our main findings are that a large proportion of common people had only a poor knowledge of the disease and its prevention, but also that most respondents had little confidence in the ability of the government to tackle the outbreak and that nearly everybody was worried about its consequences on food security rather than on health. Interestingly, positive attitudes seemed to be related to the existence of visible preventive measures, mainly hand-washing facilities, in a market.We acknowledge upfront the methodological limitations of a survey based on a self-elaborated questionnaire that was administered to a convenience sample without consideration of the size and composition of the target population. In the absence of prior evidence (except from some online studies), formal sample size calculation was not possible, but the numbers of participants were based on practical and time constrains. It should be noted that conditions for performing sophisticated sociological surveys are hardly met in the DRC, and that we wanted to work rapidly, i.e., before the eruption of any major outbreak of the COVID-19 in the area. The questionnaire was based on the then existing scientific literature; it was briefly piloted among members and relatives of the research group. We do not know how many people were present on the chosen markets at the time of the surveys, but they numbered many hundreds. We also did not formally register the total number of people approached to respond to the questionnaire, but we estimate that about one in two invited persons accepted to participate. We also acknowledge that, although the interviewers tried to administer the questionnaire in a standardized way, they often needed to clarify or rephrase the questions. On the other hand, we have no reasons to think that our findings were seriously biased by these methodological shortcomings and we consider that our survey of more than 300 people in ten markets in four different locations may provide a faithful picture of the then-prevailing beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19, not only in the studied area but probably also elsewhere in Africa. Indeed, although variations between respondents in the different locations appeared large for some questions, we were unable to find consistent location-specific patterns regarding knowledge, attitude, or practices and we have, therefore, limited our interpretations to the general picture, as obtained from an analysis of the whole sample.As expected, the majority (83%) of our participants were women, thus reflecting the gender distribution of jobs and domestic tasks related to food distribution and preparation in Africa. Based on our crude but probably reliable proxy for relative income, our participants were of very-low-to-moderate SES, keeping in mind that even our notion of a ""moderate"" income must be viewed in the context of a national economy with an average per capita income between 1 and 2 US dollars per day [12] . Although sellers and buyers did vary somewhat by gender and SES, their responses and behavior appeared largely similar, thus supporting again the assumption of representativeness of our cross-sectional sample for the population attending mainly urban markets in this African region.At the time of our survey, i.e., before COVID-19 had arrived in the area, many respondents proved to have very poor or no knowledge of the characteristics of COVID-19, and this did not correlate significantly with our pragmatic measure of SES. For instance, many respondents did not know the differences between COVID-19 and an endemic condition like malaria or the severe Ebola disease, of which the tenth outbreak was ongoing in the country [13] . Clearly, the majority of the participants were mainly concerned by the increasing food insecurity, i.e., obtaining their ""daily food"". This concern was justified since prohibition of moving around would mean loss of income and limited access to food and essential supplies [3, 8] . It has been stated that Sub-Saharan African countries cannot afford to maintain stringent lockdown measures over a long period of time [7] . The main information sources reported by the participants were audiovisual media (television, radio) and ""other people"" in the street, whereas health workers accounted for a very small fraction (4%) of reported information sources. Awareness campaigns, communicated via websites, television, and various social media in the DRC, are usually in French, the education and working language of the DRC, although 22.7% of its people are illiterate (11% among men, 34% among women) [14] , and hardly understand French. We insist that health educative programs should provide messages against COVID-19 mainly in local languages.Our survey indicates that the majority of participants (88%) did not agree that the COVID-19 situation would be under control and defeated in the DRC. A possible explanation for this type of attitude could be the reports of rapid spreading of the disease and the high mortality figures in developed countries, like in Italy and in the United States of America [15] . However, another explanation given by respondents was that ""it is hard to trust the Congolese health system since most political authorities usually travel overseas to seek for a better health care"". These findings are in line with data from Bangladesh [16] . They are, however, in contrast with data from Saudi Arabia showing a positive and optimistic attitude toward COVID-19, with 97% of participants convinced that the Saudi government would control the pandemic [17] , and with a study done in Malaysia where 96% of participants had confidence that the country would be able to win the battle against COVID-19 [18] .The (limited) presence of hand-washing facilities at the markets seemed to increase the general level of knowledge and to favor adequate attitudes among the surveyed market goers. Nevertheless, even when washing facilities were present, no sellers or buyers were seen washing their hands during our presence in the markets for about five hours per day. This apparent contradiction can be due to a lack of awareness of the need or effectiveness of hand-washing, but it could also be attributed, in part, to the widespread belief that COVID-19 is caused by ""demonic forces"" (44% in our sample), with the often-expressed implication that ""children of God can't be infected by this disease"". In China, a study found that residents with a relatively high SES, had good knowledge, optimistic attitudes, and appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak, and good knowledge was associated with optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices towards COVID-19 [19, 20] . An online study in the USA reported that, in response to COVID-19, 95.7% of respondents had made changes to their lifestyle, including hand-washing (93.1%), avoidance of social gatherings (89.0%), and stockpiling food and supplies (74.7%) [21] .It was beyond the scope of this study to address the numerous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRC [22] , but we believed that the objective findings of our pragmatic survey could contribute to offer a holistic approach of its management in Africa [3] . Our study was conducted at a very early stage of the pandemic, i.e., when the first cases were being reported from Kinshasa and before any cases had occurred in the area where the surveys were done (except for the last market surveyed). At that time, it was feared that Sub-Saharan Africa would be severely hit by the pandemic because of the poverty of its population and the resulting difficulties of adopting quarantines, physical distancing, and other barrier methods, on the one hand, and the limited medical and other resources available to manage severe disease, on the other hand. At that early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRC, we found a generally low awareness among people present, as sellers or buyers, on crowded public markets, and this led us to conclude that targeted health education programs were needed to limit the propagation of COVID-19 in this population with a low level of education. However, it was also felt that further surveys would be needed to assess the behavior dynamic in the general population as the COVID-19 pandemic would evolve in the country. The current findings provide a unique baseline for such studies.We stand by these early conclusions of our survey that health education programs must be based on a thorough assessment of the population's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. The information given to the public should be provided in understandable and respectful language, and by reliable sources, including health professionals. The international guidelines for infection prevention and control must be adapted at country level, and they should be tailored to the prevailing socioeconomic and public health situations. These considerations are in line with strategies for promoting the adoption of protective behaviors, which have been formulated in an excellent ""rapid expert consultation"" released by the ""Societal Experts Action Network"" of the (US) National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine [23] .Since the submission of our article, we have come to realize that the anticipated COVID-19 major catastrophe has not taken place in Africa. Indeed, according to the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, by the end of September 2020, the cases of COVID-19 reported for the 55 African Union Member State Countries represented less than 4% of all cases reported globally [24] . In the 47 (mainly Sub-Saharan) countries of the WHO African Region, 1,175,271 cases (and 25,825 deaths) of COVID-19 had been reported by 29 September 2020, with a steady decline since a peak that occurred in July [25] . Moreover, the majority of cases and deaths occurred in a single country, namely South Africa (672, 572 cases, 16,667 deaths) [25] . In the DRC (with a population of 84 million), 10,631 cases and only 272 deaths were reported [25] . The capital Kinshasa was the epicenter, with 77% of the total cases [26, 27] , and only 432 confirmed cases were reported from the two provinces where our survey took place [27] . Although COVID-19 cases undoubtedly escaped recognition, this is not the sole explanation for these relatively low numbers, and the reasons for the hitherto low incidence of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions in the world have not been fully elucidated. Public health interventions, such as travel bans and early lockdowns, may have played a role, but sociodemographic characteristics, such as a younger population, low population density and mobility, as well as cross-immunity with other infections may have contributed [24] . The propagation of SARS-CoV-2 within the general population may also have been less efficient in Sub-Saharan Africa than in more affluent, industrially developed, and highly urbanized areas, because African people spend more time outdoors, not so much because of a ""better climate"", but because of the prevailing socioeconomic circumstances. In other words, it is conceivable that the very need, for most people, to purchase food from open markets (rather than from closed supermarkets) may actually have mitigated the spread of the virus. In addition, and perhaps of equal or more importance than time spent outdoors, it is plausible that building characteristics play a substantial role in viral transmission. In industrially developed countries, people not only spend a large proportion of their time indoors, they generally do so in air-tight buildings with much less natural ventilation than in Africa. This applies to home dwellings and communal buildings, such as workplaces, classrooms, shops, hospitals, churches, restaurants, and bars, and even to public transport vehicles. In this way, an affluent society living in ""high-quality"" buildings may, paradoxically, have been more susceptible to the pandemic than a poor society with relatively open, well-ventilated constructions (sometimes without windowpanes). These hypotheses need to be verified, but if they are confirmed, this should obviously not lead to considering poverty as an acceptable remedy against COVID-19.

The newly emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan, China, and now spread worldwide. The combination of stress and possible exposure makes HCWs highly susceptible for acquiring COVID-19 and potentially transmitting it to others (Neto et al. 2020) .To efficiently stop the spread of COVID-19 infection in Egypt, General Hospitals have designated COVID isolation areas inside them for managing emergency suspected COVID-19 cases and referring other nonemergency cases to Fever or Chest Hospitals which act as Triage Hospitals receiving all suspected COVID-19 cases either referred from General Hospitals or referred by hotline or walk-in patients. Nurses working in COVID isolation areas either in Triage Hospitals or General Hospitals together with other health team members represent the defense frontline (FL) against COVID-19 (Ministry of Health and Population 2020).Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11235-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Occupational stress is a fast-growing cause of work-related diseases and injury; specifically among HCWs (Hassan et al. 2020) . Occupational stress associated with COVID-19 is an essential indicator of mental illness as it can lead to anxiety and depression in the confrontation of the co-occurrence of countless deaths, and long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands. During the global response to the epidemic, HCWs are undoubtedly needed, but they represent one of the most vulnerable individuals in terms of acquiring the highly contagious disease. Lots of HCWs serving on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have become infected and more have been in quarantine after exposure (Neto et al. 2020) . Keeping the health of nurses is of paramount importance in managing infectious diseases as they have always played an essential role in prevention and control during epidemics (Mo et al. 2020) .Occupational stress and job satisfaction are essential factors influencing workforce productivity. Preserving high level of job satisfaction among HCWs especially nurses is critical for achieving the appropriate high quality medical service Semachew et al. 2017) . There is overwhelming evidence that current trends in working environment may have adverse effects on job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is the affective orientation that a worker has towards his/her work which consists of two facets: positive affectivity and negative affectivity. Positive affectivity is represented by high energy, enthusiasm, and enjoyable involvement while negative affectivity is indicated by distress, un-enjoyable involvement, and edginess. Occupational stress plays a vital role in job satisfaction; if it acts as a motivator, it will contribute to creativity and satisfaction and further will remove boredom, and if it acts as a negative factor, it will lead to aggression and low job satisfaction. On the other hand, job satisfaction may protect workers from stressors and act as a regulating factor for stress (Hoboubi et al. 2017) .Occupational stress has substantial direct and indirect effects on intention to leave the current organization and intention to leave the profession in the future. It mainly exerts its indirect effects through job satisfaction, depressed mood and stress adaptation. Intention to leave the current organization usually precedes intention to leave the profession. Policy makers should put intention to leave reduction strategies among nurses that should concentrate on creating a less stressful work environment, increasing job satisfaction and stress adaptation, and decreasing depressed mood concomitantly (Lo et al. 2018) .At present, studies on the COVID-19 pandemic mostly concentrated on epidemiological investigation, prevention and control, diagnosis, and treatment. Fewer studies have investigated the mental health and the working environment of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mo et al. 2020) . The purpose of the present study was to compare occupational stress, job satisfaction, and intent to leave among nurses dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients in triage hospitals versus those working in general hospitals which were neither triage nor isolation hospitals and dealing only with suspected COVID-19 patients in emergency where its role is stabilization of patients then referral to triage hospitals. This comparison would be useful to prioritize occupational stressors, identify degree of satisfaction, and intent to leave among both groups.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses working in Zagazig Fever Hospital (ZFH) which is one of COVID-19 Triage Hospitals (Group I) versus those working in Zagazig General Hospital (ZGH) (Group II) which is neither triage nor isolation hospital and dealing only with suspected COVID-19 patients in emergency at Zagazig City, Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, from 10th to 24th of April 2020.The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info version 6 statistical packages depending on the following data; confidence interval 95%, power of test 80%, ratio between two groups 1:1, the prevalence of work related stress among ZFH Group; 75% from pilot study and its prevalence among ZGH Group; and 62% from previous study (Kamal et al. 2005) . So, the calculated sample size was 402 subjects divided into 201 subjects for each group. The study was conducted in two hospitals which had an adequate number of nurses during the study period. Zagazig Fever Hospital was selected from COVID Triage Hospitals in Sharkia Governorate as it accommodated 275 nurses and 119 beds while Zagazig General Hospital was selected from General hospitals in Sharkia Governorate as it accommodated 315 nurses and 135 beds.Due to the fact that the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current isolation policy calls for reduced face-to-face contact and avoidance of large gatherings. Therefore, the authors decided to collect the data online. The nurses in each hospital already shared in online work groups on ""WhatsApp"" and ""Facebook."" The researcher communicated with the admins of these groups to get permission to share the online questionnaire through these groups. Questionnaire was structured by Google Form App then posted/reposted through nurses groups. The reception of the filled questionnaires had stopped when the sample size had achieved. The final sample size was 420 subjects divided equally between two groups.Inclusion criteria included all on-job nurses that consented to participate in the study and filled in the online questionnaire. Exclusion criteria included (i) pregnant women and (ii) nurses who were on permanent extended leave exceeding 6 weeks duration during the time of the study.The pilot study was done through an online questionnaire on 10% of the sample (40 nurses) working in Zagazig Chest Hospital which is one of COVID-19 Triage Hospitals during March 2020 to test the response to different items of the questionnaires, to test the feasibility of the study, and to test the questionnaire with the most appropriate terms. The results of the pilot were not included in the results of the study. According to the result of the pilot study, the questionnaire was assessed and minor modification was done.An online questionnaire was used which consisted of the following parts:Part I: A brief introduction on the background, objective, procedures, voluntary nature of participation, declarations of anonymity and confidentiality, and exclusion criteria. Part II: Socio-demographic characteristics and occupational history: Age, sex, marital state, education, years of experience, work hours per week, and night duties per week. Part III: The Expanded Nursing Stress Scale (ENSS) was adapted from French et al. 2000 . It is a valid and reliable tool targeting nursing stress. It contains 57 items on a five-point Likert scale with 0 = never exposed, 1 = never stressful, 2 = occasionally stressful, 3 = frequently stressful, and 4 = extremely stressful. The items are grouped into nine subscales: (1) dealing with the death and dying (7 items, minimum score = 0, maximum score = 28), (2) conflicts with physicians (5 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 20), (3) inadequate emotional preparation (3 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 12), (4) problems relating to peers (6 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 24), (5) problems relating to supervisors (7 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 28), (6) workload (9 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 36), (7) uncertainty concerning treatment (9 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 36), (8) unreasonable demands of patients and their families (8 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 32), and (9) experience of being discriminated (3 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 12). For each subscale, the participant's responses on each item are scored and summed to obtain a total score with higher scores indicate higher stress levels. The level of stress was calculated by summing the total score of all subscales, and was classified as follows: low with total score ≤ 76, moderate 77-152, and high 153-228. It was modified by asking the participants to indicate how stressful each situation they have encountered in their present work setting during COVID-19 pandemic then translated into Arabic and validated through a back translation technique and pilot testing. Part IV: Specific COVID-19 stressors derived and modified from US National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 2020 and ""MERS-CoV staff questionnaire"" of Khalid et al. 2016 . It was developed in Arabic language and consisted of 19 items on 5-point Likert scale with 0 = never exposed, 1 = never stressful, 2 = occasionally stressful, 3 = frequently stressful, and 4 = extremely stressful. The items are grouped into four subscales: (1) need to employ strict biosecurity measures (4 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 16), (2) exposure to infection risk (6 items min. score = 0, max. score = 24), (3) personal demands and fears (7 items, min. score = 0, max. score = 28), and (4) stigma (2 items min. score = 0, max. score = 8). For each subscale, the participant's responses on each item are scored and summed to obtain a total score with higher scores indicate higher stress levels. The level of specific COVID-19-associated stress was calculated by summing the total score of all subscales, and was classified as follows: low with total score ≤ 25, moderate 26-50, and high 51-76. Reliability test was done whereas Cronbach's Alpha equals 0.87. Part V: The McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale (MMSS) is one of the most widely used, valid, and reliable scales for measuring job satisfaction among nurses. It is a 31-item on 5-point Likert scale with 1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = moderately dissatisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = moderately satisfied, and 5 = very satisfied (Mueller and McCloskey 1990) . The items are grouped into eight subscales: (1) extrinsic rewards (3 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 15), (2) family and work balance (3 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 15), (3) professional opportunities (4 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 20), (4) work control and responsibility (5 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 25), (5) scheduling (6 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 30), (6) coworkers (2 items, min. Score = 1, max. Score = 10), 7) interaction opportunities (4 items, min. score = 1, max. score= 20), and (8) praise and recognition (4 items, min. score = 1, max. score = 20) (Tourangeau et al. 2006 ). The mean score per subscale and for the entire questionnaire were calculated with higher scores which indicate higher satisfaction levels. The level of job satisfaction was also calculated by summing the total score of all subscales, and was classified as follows: low with total score ≤ 52, moderate 53-104, and high 105-155. It was translated into Arabic then validated through a back translation technique and pilot testing. Part VI: Nurses' intent to leave: The item that measured nurses' intent to leave asked the respondents to rate their feeling about their future work based on dichotomous responses (yes/no) to the survey question: ""If possible, would you leave your current hospital within the next year as a result of job dissatisfaction?"" This question was followed-up with the question, (only used in the descriptive analysis): ""If yes, what do you intend to leave?"" with the response options: ""the current position""; ""the current organization""; ""the field of nursing"" (Lagerlund et al. 2015) .The collected data were statistically analyzed using SPSS program (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 16.0. Chi-square test (χ 2 ) was carried out for comparing the qualitative data. Quantitative data were compared using Student's t test. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors of each studied outcome. The test results were considered significant when p value < 0.05. Charts were drawn using Excel program. To draw Pareto chart, the following were done: (1) each subscale in ENSS and specific COVID-19-associated stressors by itself is basically a workrelated stressor and considered extremely stressful if achieved 75%-100% of subscale total score, (2) the frequency of each extremely stressful stressor was calculated, (3) after descending ranking of the different stressors, the cumulative percentage was calculated, and (4) the level of 80% cumulative percentage was taken as the cutoff point that identifies the corresponding factors related to COVID-19-associated stress.A total number of 420 nurses were included, 210 working in Zagazig Fever Hospital (ZFH Group) and 210 in Zagazig General Hospital (ZGH Group). The mean age of ZFH Group was 24.22 ± 5.16 which was significantly lower than 26.09 ± 4.53 for ZGH Group. The majority of the participants in both groups (85.2% and 78.6%, respectively) were females. The majority of ZFH Group (60.0%) were single compared with (49.5%) in ZGH Group with a statistically significant difference. Concerning occupational history, ZGH Group tended to have significantly higher work experience of 11.39 ± 3.96 years compared with 9.45 ± 2.24 years for ZFH Group. Regarding work hours per week, ZFH Group tended to have significantly longer work hours (89.5%) compared with (60.0%) of ZGH Group. In ZFH Group, only 11.9% did not have night shift work compared with 19.5% in ZGH Group. Difference in number of night shifts was significantly higher among ZFH Group than ZGH Group (Table 1) .Regarding occupational stress, it was significantly higher among ZFH Group (193.55 ± 44.94 ) than ZGH Group (157.58 ± 39.97) with the percent of participants who reported high stress level in ZFH Group which was 75.2% versus 60.5% in ZGH Group; especially in subscales of workload, dealing with the death and dying, inadequate emotional preparation, problems relating to supervisors, and uncertainty concerning treatment, patients, and their families ( Table 2) . Need to employ strict biosecurity measures, personal demands and fears and stigma were significantly higher specific COVID-19-associated stressors among ZFH Group, while exposure to infection risk was significantly higher stressors among ZGH Group. Also, the percent of participants who reported high specific COVID-19-associated stress level in ZFH Group was 71.1% versus 58.1% in ZGH Group with statistically significant difference (Table 2 and  Supplementary Table 1) .Job Satisfaction with work conditions seemed significantly lower among ZFH Group (2.89 ± 0.81) than ZGH Group (3.04 ± 0.57), especially aspects of control and responsibility, scheduling, interaction, extrinsic reward, and family and work Table 2) . Two Pareto charts were drawn to rank work-related stressors during COVID-19 pandemic that were identified as the most important factors causing about 80% of occupational stress scores, one for nurses of ZFH (Fig. 1 ) and the other for nurses of ZGH (Fig. 2) . According to the Pareto rule, the first five stressors, (5 out of 13 studied stressors) i.e., almost 38% of the studied factors, were responsible of 80% of Regarding nurses' ratings of their intent to leave, the study revealed that only 4.8% of nurses in ZFH Group definitely had no intent to leave their present job, while about 24.8% intended to leave the field of nursing (Fig. 3) .Regarding the relationship between socio-demographic and occupational characteristics of the studied nurses and the studied outcomes, there were statistically significant associations between both age and work hours per week and high scores of all the studied outcomes (Table 3) . Accordingly, Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted. Hospital type (ZFH) and work hours/week (> 40 h) were the significant predictors for all the studied outcomes, while night duties/ week (≥ 3) was a predictor for ENSS, specific COVID-19associated stressors, and intent to leave (Table 4 ).Nurses in general are exposed to various stressors from physical, psychological, and social working environments which are markedly increased among the front line nurses working in COVID-19 triage hospitals. The most significant stressors for those nurses in this study are related to their physical working environment, i.e., workload (overtime work, frequent night Fig. 3 Nurses' ratings of their intent to leave among both studied groups the COVID-19, the ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, and heavy workload are putting nursing services under intense pressure. Furthermore, other significant stressors for those nurses are linked to their psychological working environment including dealing with death and dying, inadequate emotional preparation, and uncertainty concerning treatment. This could be explained by the following facts: nurses, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see, and this put them under great stress (Neto et al. 2020) ; the COVID-19 outbreak may cause panic emotions among people, and if nurses are not prepared to deal with these emotions, they will be under great tension (CDC 2020); and COVID-19 is newly emerging disease without well-known management plan so regular updates in management protocols, official recommendations, and policies make the nurses lacking autonomy in making decisions and not knowing what the patient or patient's family ought to be told.Regarding social working environment stressors for those nurses, an analysis of items relating to the factor ""problems with peers"" revealed that the impossibility of exchanging experiences and feelings with peers were important occupational stressors and this may be attributed to lack of opportunities because of COVID-19-associated overwhelming workload. Also, analysis of the factor ""conflicts with supervisors"" revealed that lack of support from direct supervisors and usual blaming for uncontrollable errors were significant stressors which surly increased with COVID-19-associated heavy workload. This is consistent with Ghareeb et al. (2014) who reported that nurses are generally treated as scapegoats by other members of the medical profession. Another significant social factor is ""the problem with patients and their families"" as patient isolation due to COVID-19 and blocking of hospital visits make the nurses the main link between patients and their families with greater exposure to their abuse and unreasonable demands which put them under intense pressure. This is consistent with Hassan et al. (2020) who reported that dealing with angry/blaming relatives and distressed patients, patients/ relatives' expectations of care that cannot be met were important stressors for all healthcare personnel.During respiratory illness epidemic additional work-related stressors arise; the chief among them is increased exposure to the risk of infection. All HCWs are exposed to this risk; however, the extent of this risk is not distributed equally. Some specialties, like emergency and infectious diseases, are likely to be at a higher risk than other specialties (Simonds and Sokol 2009) . The nurses are particularly vulnerable to this risk because they are often the first to respond to patients and have a high level of occupational stress (Oh et al. 2017) . Although the study subjects were nurses working in Fever Hospital and subsequently their exposure to risk of infection was higher, their worry about acquiring infection was lower than their counterparts in General Hospital. This could be explained by those nurses who had sufficient skill mix and experience to deal with infectious patients (Needleman et al. 2002) . This is consistent with Wu et al. (2020) who reported that medical professionals who were not specialized in infectious disease experienced greater pressure when facing infected patients. Another dimension to infection risk exposure is stigmatization where people may consider HCWs a movable source of infection in the community (Fischer et al. 2019) , so stigmatization was a significant stressor for nurses of ZFH. On the other hand, although employing strict biosecurity measures is a must to prevent spread of infection to self and others, it was a significant stressor for nurses of ZFH. This is consistent with Loibner et al. (2019) who reported that reduced dexterity due to multiple glove layers, impaired visibility by flexible face shields and back pain related to the respirator of the fully ventilated suit, heat stress, and liquid loss were perceived as strong stressors especially at high working temperature. Other significant COVID-19-associated stressors for nurses in both ZFH and ZGH were the personal fears of being isolated, transmitting the disease to families or friends, the unknown duration of the epidemic, lack of treatment for the disease, news of new cases of COVID-19 reported in TV/newspaper, and predictable shortages of staff, supplies, and adequate protective measures. Similar stressors were seen among HCWs who faced SARS (Lee et al. 2005 ) and MERSA-COV (Khalid et al. 2016 ) but with variable degrees of stress.This study used Pareto analysis which allows data to be summarized and displayed in a way to assist in the prioritization of causes of problems as targets for improvement (Banks et al. 1995) . It pointed out that 38% of the studied factors were responsible of 80% of occupational stress among nurses of fever hospital, while 30% of these factors were responsible of 80% of the problem in their counterparts in general hospital; these are too many factors; it is more than 80/20 rule illustrated by Pareto. The policy makers should put coping strategies for all the reported factors to resolve 80% of the occupational stress or lower this 80% to 60% or70% thus decrease number of target factors that could be reformed according to the present resources. The most important stressors among nurses of fever hospital were workload, dealing with death and dying, personal demands and fears, employing strict biosecurity measures, and stigma which should be given a priority to be solved through first; to reduce workload, planning of staff numbers according to nursing intensity is required, but this is not always possible so rational distribution of tasks at work is necessary (Riklikienė et al. 2015) . Also, involuntary placement and dispatch of usual ward nurses to front-line areas may be a solution to workload problem, but good training to implement effective infection control procedures and proper isolation measures is paramount important to decrease stress among dispatched nurses as fear of exposure to infection had the highest priority as a source of stress among those nurses according to Pareto analysis. Second, to deal with psychological stressors of dealing with death and dying, psychological consultations should be available to nurses after stressful situations (Makie 2006) . Third, to deal with personal fears and demands, providing timely, clear, and updated information to nurses with regard to new handling procedures, patient numbers, available resources, and the like is very important. Fourth, to reduce physical strain of protective equipment, synthesis of these equipment from material not causing physical strain is required or division of work to allow each nurse to get enough rest periods from wearing these equipment is a reasonable alternative. Finally, to reduce stigmatization, a checklist prepared by CDC to help identify and address stigmatization before, during, and after infectious disease outbreaks can be used (Department of Health and Human Services 2007).This highly stressful work environment had reflected on the overall job satisfaction among nurses of fever hospital which was quite low compared to their counterparts in general hospital. This result is supported by previous studies implying that stress at the individual level affects job satisfaction (Sharma et al. 2014; Riklikienė et al. 2015) . As current results showed, the main contributors to job dissatisfaction among nurses of fever hospital were the following: first being dissatisfied with extrinsic rewards of their job, praise, and recognition which reflected their belief that their stressful work was not met by adequate financial and moral compensations; second, being dissatisfied with scheduling, family and work balance, and team interaction which surly affected by COVID-19-associated heavy workload. Finally, being dissatisfied with control and responsibility as regular updates in COVID-19associated official recommendations and policies hinders the nurses' abilities in making decisions.There is a vicious circle between occupational stress and job satisfaction where intense stress leads to job dissatisfaction which in turn increases stress; therefore, nurses tend to consider quitting a job at an institution or even changing profession (Moustaka et al. 2010) . This explains why the percent of nurses in fever hospital who tend to leave the current organization or even changing job was more than their counterpart in general hospital. Previous studies during the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that HCWs reported reluctance to work or contemplating resignation (Bai et al. 2004) .Although there were statistically significant differences in age, marital state, and experience between both study groups, only statistically significant association was found between age and high scores of all the studied outcomes and when Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to exclude age as a confounding factor, hospital type (ZFH) with its related workload factors was the significant predictor for all the studied outcomes.This study had some limitations. First, the study did not include all nurses who experienced the outbreak especially those of isolation hospital. Second is the use of the simplistic one item of intent to leave that provided only a general orientation about nurses' intent to leave. Lastly, the study hospitals were sampled conventionally so the results may reflect the conditions in these specific hospitals, which affect generalizability of the findings.Conclusion and recommendations Nearly all work-related physical, psychological, and social stressors increased among nurses of COVID-19 triage hospitals compared to those working in general hospitals which are not triage or isolation hospitals indicating that COVID-19 pandemic added an extra load on this already stressful job. Workload, dealing with death and dying, personal demands and fears, employing strict biosecurity measures, and stigma represented the high-priority stressors among nurses of triage hospitals responsible for 80% of occupational stress problem, while exposure to infection risk was the stressor of highest priority among nurses of general hospital. This highly stressful work environment resulted in job dissatisfaction with tendency to leave job in the future. This emphasis adopting strategies to reduce perceived jobrelated stress increases effectively job satisfaction, and decreases turnover intention during these difficult events.","Egypt","abstract","2020-10-17",10

The virus is highly contagious, which causes difficulty in controlling the outbreak [2] . The only proven preventive option is to implement the recommended public health measures, which include the use of personal protective measures such as the use of face masks, wearing of gloves, frequent hand washing, restriction of movement to the more affected areas, maintaining social/physical distance, avoiding touching the nose, mouth, and eyes, were found to be the only proven preventive option to halter the pandemic [3] . Health care workers, especially those whose jobs allow more contact with patients infected with COVID-19, are at risk of adverse health consequences [4, 5] . They are working with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and thus many have died and thousands have tested positive [6] .To adhere to the recommended protective measures, individuals risk perception is one of the major factors that need to be considered [7] . The effectiveness of outbreak control will mainly depend on the behavioral response of the society and adherence level to the recommended precautionary measures [8] . Poor understanding and risk perception of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed recognition and treatment, resulting in the rapid spread of the infection. A significant number of health care workers have inadequate knowledge and poor perceptions of COVID-19. This is evidenced by a cross-sectional, web-based study among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. According to this study, 61% and 63.6% of HCWs had poor knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and symptom onset, respectively. Besides, a significant number of HCWs (22%) showed negative perceptions of COVID-19 [9] .Since May 20, 2020, there are about 365 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 5 deaths reported in Ethiopia [10] . In this time, the disease outbreak is affecting the big cities and towns in the gateways. As the country is in the early stage of infectious disease, the chance of limiting the spread is more feasible during this stage. Thus, the online survey was intended to assess health professionals' risk perception and their precautionary behavioral responses. The finding is essential in haltering the outbreak, and it is important in recommending concerned bodies to implement necessary intervention strategies that safeguard the lives of health care providers.A self-administered online cross-sectional survey was designed on Google form and administered from May 1-14, 2020. The study was conducted on health professionals working in selected public university hospitals in South, Southwest, and Western Ethiopia and it is a part of an online survey titled ""COVID-19 pandemic: psychological impact, perceived risk and preparedness among health care providers working in public university hospitals in Ethiopia: web-based survey."" The university hospitals included in the study are namely: Jimma Medical Center (JMC), Mizan Tepi University Hospital, Wollega University Hospital, Hawassa University Hospital, Wolayta Sodo University Hospital, and Arba Minch University Hospital. All University hospitals were engaged in delivering curative treatment, preventive, and rehabilitative services for millions of people in the south, southwest, and western Ethiopia. For the current COVID-19 pandemic, each university hospital was made ready for testing, treatment, and quarantine center.All teaching and clinical staff working in the selected public university hospital of Ethiopia was considered a source population. A survey link was sent to 864, 521, 343, 271, 123, and 223 staffs of Jimma University, Arba Minch University, Hawassa University, Mizan Tepi University, Wolayta University, and Wollega University staffs, respectively. A total of 273 health professionals took part in the study. Those who were on work leave were not invited to take part in the study.The minimum number of the sample size required for this study was determined by using the formula to estimate a single population proportion. The minimum sample size determination formula used is:where n denotes the minimum sample size, Z α/2 is the reliability coefficient of the standard error at a 5% level of significance = 1.96, and p is the proportion of health care providers who had poor perception about COVID-19 = 22% [9] . Accordingly, the study participants were selected consecutively.Data were collected by an electronically administered questionnaire. All staff was invited to participate in the online survey. Official university e-mail addresses, personal e-mail addresses, and social media networking sites including Facebook and Telegram were used to share the survey link to the staff. The information regarding the purpose of the study, informed consent, and confidentiality of the data were explained for the study subjects in the introduction part of the online survey. The survey questions were adapted from WHO resources and other related studies which were previously used for infectious outbreak like a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8, 11, 12] . The questionnaire was delivered electronically by the English language to get a rapid response to individuals' risk perception and behavioral response. The survey instrument included the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, participants' risk perception which was assessed by a 10-item perceived risk scale. The scale is rated on a 5-point Likert scale and assesses perceived threat level, perceived risk of infection, perceived severity of the infection and perceived vulnerability to infection, and respondents' selfefficacy. The behavioral responses of respondents was assessed by asking respondents questions like avoiding sneezing/couching, avoiding touching the face, nose, and eyes, avoiding large gatherings and public places, avoiding traveling to the affected areas, using alcohol-based disinfectants, and wearing masks and gloves. The scale allows to rate the response of the respondent in the ordered of 1-least likely, to 5-most likely.The data were checked, coded, and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 statistical software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed and presented with a frequency table indicating the mean value and standard deviation with a 95% confidence interval.Ethical approval obtained from the Institute of Ethical Review Board of Jimma University with letter reference number IRB000212/2020. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Information regarding the purpose of the study, voluntary nature of participation, and risk imposed due to involvement presented in the information section of the survey. The survey questionnaire designed in a way the study participants only directed to the survey questions following a respondent click on a response button ""Agree to participate"" after reading the consent information. To ensure anonymity, information identifying the participants was not included in the survey. Furthermore, the data files stored on a password-protected computer.A total of 273 health professionals participated in this study. One-thirds 80 (29.3%) of study participants is from JMC. The mean (± SD) age of participants was 31.03 ± 5.11 years, and range from 23 to 48 years. Two-thirds 177 (64.8%) and one-fourths 71 (26%) of the study participants were engaged in academic service and medical doctors by profession, respectively. Almost all study participants are living in an urban area. Regarding educational attainment and sex of respondents, 61.5% and 89% of participants attended the Master's Degree (MSc) and male by sex, respectively ( Table 1) .Regarding risk perception, the overall mean score was 23.59 ± 4.75, and the highest mean score is for perceived getting an infection (3.67 ± 1.04) and the risk of having serious infection because of COVID-19 (3.48 ± 1.13), respectively ( Table 2 ). The mean score of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 (4.01±1.17) of study participants was higher than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), common cold, malaria, and tuberculosis. Regarding the mean score of perceived severity, COVID-19 rated second next to HIV/AIDS. Study participants were asked a question ""How do you rate perceived ability to avoid infection with COVID-19?"" to rate their self-efficacy on a 5-point scale. Accordingly, the mean score of the participants was found to be (4.01±1.17) ( Table 3) .The precautionary behavioral response of study participants was assessed using a 10-item questionnaire that was scored on a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale. The lowest mean scores were wearing gloves (1.82 ± 1.15) followed by wearing a mask (2.54 ± 1.82). Avoiding while people sneeze or cough had the highest mean score (4.0 ± 1.06) (Fig 1) .Evidence regarding health professionals perceived risk, severity, vulnerability, and self-efficacy of COVID-19 was generated. The findings indicated that the mean score of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 is higher than other diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis (TBC), malaria, and the common cold. However, the mean score of perceived severity is second to HIV. Regarding the practice of recommended health behavior, almost all recommended precautionary measures are applied to the highest level except for wearing masks and gloves. The final multiple linear regression analysis indicated a positive association between overall risk perception score, perceived vulnerability, and self-efficacy with a precautionary health behavioral practice.The overall risk perceptions mean score in this study was found to be 23.59 ± 4.75 (summative score of a 5-point score for the 7-risk perception items). In comparison with this finding, a lower level of risk perception of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was reported in Scandinavian countries [13] [14] [15] . A possible explanation might be the effect of media and massive public mobilization in Ethiopia. The explanation given for the lower risk perception in Scandinavia was that the media tended to report more risks of abroad and given less attention to the risk inside the country [14, 15] . In this study, overall risk perception was found to be positively associated with health behavioral response. A unit increase in overall risk perception increased the precautionary health behavioral practice by 0.45. Similar studies have shown that the higher the perceived risk, the more people are applying protective measures [16, 17] .The findings of the current study found out that the study participants scored the highest mean score of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 as compared to the other diseases. Similarly, a unit increase in perceived vulnerability increased the health behavioral response by 1.21. This finding is in line with a study done in Iran. The Iranian study reported the highest perceived threat level towards the new pandemic and a positive and significant correlation between health behavioral response and perceived susceptibility, severity, and self-efficacy [18] . A study that was done during the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak also reported a higher vulnerability towards COVID-19 [19] . This might be because of the realistic awareness of health professionals related to the mode of transmission of the virus, which made the professionals consider the virus more threatening than any other disease. Aside from this, uncertainty in the scientific understanding of the coronavirus might also contribute to the figure. Furthermore, the geographical location of the country has an impact on the perception of professionals, as the disease is unfamiliar in Ethiopia it might be perceived as more severe. A higher level of severity perception of SARS was reported in Europe [11] .Regarding self-efficacy, the mean score of respondent was 2.71 ± 1.04. About 50% of study participants strongly agreed that they can able to control the infection. It is only 5.5% of participants reported that they did not feel that they could control the illness. This is higher than the perceived self-efficacy of SARS for most European countries and lower than Asian countries [11] .Participants' implementation of the recommended precautionary measures in the current study is to the acceptable level except for wearing masks and gloves. This might be due to the study subjects were well educated, which helped them to better exercise protective behavior, and the higher perceived vulnerability level of the illness. This finding is supported by other studies [12] . Regarding wearing masks and gloves, the mean scores in the current study were 2.54 and 1.82, respectively. The practice is less frequent, despite these is being a key protective measure recommended by the WHO [12] . The lower levels of usage declared in our study may be attributable to the poor habit of mask and glove-wearing, a perception that they interfere with performing tasks, lack of time, and shortage of PPE in the health facilities.The main strength of this study is that researchers used a Likert scale to measure the outcome and explanatory variables, which is much better to measure behavior than the dichotomized response. The limitation of this study was that the measurement tools used relied on participants' self-reported data, which were prone to recall bias and moreover, as the data collection tools is prepared in English language and this might affected the quality of the data. Consecutive sampling used in this study and the data collection method allows non-representation and over-report the precautionary behavioral practice, respectively. Furthermore, the population in the current survey mostly consisted of higher degree health professionals this may over-estimate the outcomes of the study.Participants mean score of perceived vulnerability of coronavirus disease was higher than some of the prevalent infectious disease in the area. Most participants applied recommended protective measures to the acceptable level, except for wearing masks and gloves. There is a need to further intensification of more effective ways of awareness and behavioral change in order to support adherence to major health precautionary measures is important. The health facilities need to in place a safety protocol that encourages and enforces the protective behavioral response and continues monitoring to the adherence protocol need to be followed by the monitory team. Furthermore, ways to positively reinforce the professionals need to be exercised by the facility administrators.Supporting information S1 Questionnaire.(DOCX) ","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-10-29",10

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization(WHO) on 11 March,2020 [2] . As of July 27 th 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has claimed several hundreds of deaths globally and become the greatest threat of its kind in our generation [3] . It also posed a huge risk to public health and economics all over the world [4, 5] . The Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on 13 March, 2020, in Addis Ababa [6] . Despite the fact that the number of confirmed cases and deaths reported varies from time to time, the outbreak has taken the lives of several hundreds and affected different livelihoods in Ethiopia. Since the first case of COVID 19, various mathematicians around the world develop different mathematical models to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus, estimated the basic reproductive number and investigated effects of different intervention strategies via optimal control analysis. For instance, in [7] real data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from January 21,2020 to January 28,2020 is used in a model developed to estimate the basic reproductive numberThe authors developed a 0 2.4829. R  fractional model and solved it numerically. A mathematical model for predicting transmission dynamics of the pandemic for Italy is considered in [8] .The result indicated that the combination of restrictive social distancing measures with widespread testing and contact tracing can result in ending the COVID-19 transmission in Italy. Analysis of Covid-19 infection, based on real data is made in [9] by developing a mathematical model for Wuhan, China. In [10] fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model is developed to predict the evolution of the pandemic and investigated the impact of different plans to reduce the transmission of the disease with different values of fractional order. There are also many other mathematical models that reported on COVID-19 pandemics, refer [11] [12] [13] [14] . Mathematical models developed were mainly used to investigate the effects of different Non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies via simulation using different computing soft-wares [15] . Different scholars used different type of mathematical models in their analysis. For instance, an SEIR model was introduced by Wu et al. [16] for estimating the spread of the pandemic and obtained the basic reproductive number to . Tang et al. [17] used a deterministic 0 2.68 R  model to estimate the basic reproductive number to be as high as and concluded 0 6.47 R  that, contact tracing followed by quarantining and then isolation can mitigate the spread of the pandemic via reducing the basic reproductive number. Kiesha et al. [18] used SEIR model to simulate the outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan and indicated that imposing restriction on Wuhan people movement could help in delaying the peak time of the pandemic. Roda et al. [19] claimed that SIR model performs better than SEIR model and used it to predict COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan and predicted the potential of a second outbreak after the return-towork in the city. Pang et al. used SEIHR mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of quarantine measures applied in Wuhan city and factors affecting its effectiveness [20] .It is not only for COVID-19 that models were used to study the dynamics but also for several other infectious diseases. In [21] a mathematical model for the deadly disease named Ebola hemorrhage fever is developed and investigated the detail of endemic equilibrium points. SIR model with delay in the context of fractional derivative with Mittag-Leffler is considered in [22] . The author established the global and local stability of disease free and endemic equilibrium points using Lyapunov direct method. Mathematical models that investigated the dynamics of various infectious diseases are numerous in the literature [1, 23] and the references there in.Most of these studies have either restricted their domain of study to a particular country or they used data from a certain particular region. Some of the studies also overlooked the issue of optimal control analysis. Moreover, to the best of authors' knowledge, no study has been conducted on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 for the case of Ethiopia. To this end, the main objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 followed by mathematical analysis in order to come up with evidences that may help for designing mitigation strategies relevant to the context of Ethiopian. In this paper a mathematical model for COVID-19 relevant to study the transmission dynamics of coronavirus in Ethiopia is developed. The existence and uniqueness of solution of the model is proved. Local and global stability analysis of the diseases free and endemic equilibrium points are established. Parameter estimation based on real data of confirmed cases is made. The basic reproductive number suggested by the model is calculated. The importance of the basic reproductive number in target setting to control the pandemic is discussed by calculating sensitivity indices of the parameters of the basic reproductive number. Optimal control analysis of the model with three control strategies namely: public health education, personal protective measures and treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 cases were investigated followed by numerical simulation. Discussions, conclusions and limitation of the model are well specified.In this work, a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission dynamics is developed based on compartmental approach of six groups named, S-susceptible, E-exposed, Isymptomatically infected, A-asymptomatically infected, H-hospitalized and R-recovered/ immune compartments. The total population at any time is given by Humans are recruited into the compartment  considered in the model. The above mentioned is the scenario that governmet of Ethiopia is using in combating the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, in the sense that the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia is organized incorporating all the compartments we have used in developing the model of this study. It is these data that we translated into a mathematical model. It seems logical to divide infected cases of COVID-19 into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in agreement with the observed property of coronavirus infection (majority are asymptomatic and the remaining symptomatic) in Ethiopia and elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the isolation/hospitalization is considered to be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 [24] . In addition, it is known that coronavirus infected people don't get infectious immediately after contraction of the virus and this ensures the importance of considering the compartment of exposed cases. As a result, the aforementioned scenario and modification of SEIR [18, 23] model are used to develop the present model. The model developed and the parameters used are indicated in system of differential equation (1) and Table 1 .. The biological validity of the mathematical model depends on the solution of the dynamic system being positive and bounded for all values of time . The boundedness and positivity of the solution is proved in the subsequent Lemmas. remain positive in+ . Proof: It is assumed that all the parameters used in the model are positive and hence we can set a lower bound for each of the equations in (1) as follows:.Solving the above inequalities respectively leads to:.Thus, for all and are positive in, of (1) there applying Groonwall's inequality leads to, ( )and are all bounded since, ,Thus, the region 6 ( , , , , , )is positively invariant region for model (1) .then either the solution of (1) enters in a finite time orasymptotically. Hence the region attracts all solution of (1) in  Since has a continuous first derivative in ,it is then locally Lipschitz. As a result, by the f ℝ 6 + well known fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem [25] and Lemma 1 and 2 proved above, there exists a unique, positive and bounded solution for the system of differential equation (1) in ℝ 6 + . and that satisfies the quadratic equationwhere, The basic reproductive number, denoted by , is defined as number of secondary infections 0 R appears from one infected individual. It provides a threshold condition for the stability of the system. Finding through Jacobian approach using linearization of the dynamic system 0 R often doesn't work for complex systems [26] . Thus, we obtained by establishing the next 0 R generation matrix, , and calculating a spectral radius of the matrix at [27] . Thematrices and are obtained by linearizing the mathematical model (1) about DFE that T 1 V  resulted in the Jacobian matrix given as:After constructing a matrix (M) from infectious components of the and partitioning it into dfe J transmission (V) and transition (T) matrices, we have:The spectral radius of the next generation matrix is the basic reproductive numberNote that, can also be written as whereThis section deals with the local stability analysis of the diseases free and the endemic equilibrium points. Necessary Condition: Since both and , then from the 1 2 and are positive R R, for The two negative eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are .The sign of the real part of the remaining four eigenvalues are determined from a characteristic equation (5) by Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria: Necessary Condition: The coefficient is positive and can be shown to be positiveas follows, In this subsection we showed global asymptotical stability of the DFE and EEP using Lyapunov function method.i. Global Stability Analysis of DFE The locally asymptotically stability of the DFE proved earlier indicates that COVID-19 can be eliminated from Ethiopia when if the initial sizes of the cases in each of the 0 1 R  compartments or in the society is very close to the DFE; initial size is in the basin of attraction of DFE, . In order to show that the stable in the positively invariant region defined in section2. Consider a Lyapunov function candidate defined by, ( , , , , , )Differentiating with respect to time in the direction of the solution of ( , , , , , , )(1), and then substituting the appropriate values from (1) and leads to,Note that, by the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means we have   Differentiating in the direction of the solution of (1) leads to, LReplacing by their respective expression from model (1) we get, , , , , , We can now write Since all the parameters used in model (1) EEP is globally asymptotically stable.Note the implication of Theorem 4 is that, COVID-19 will institute itself in the society whenever regardless of the initial size of infectious individuals in the population. Parameter estimation is made based on real data of COVID-19 confirmed cases of Ethiopia for the first 140 days from 13 March to 31 July 2020 available online at [28] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Ethiopia. Some of the parameters are calculated from the data as follows: The total population of Ethiopia is approximately and the life expectancy of Ethiopians [29] one symptomatic case was confirmed, no individual was confirmed asymptomatic, no hospitalized and no recovery cases. Consequently, assuming initial number of exposed cases to be 200, the initial number of population is assumed where It is also learnt from the data that, in the last 140 days of the pandemic 5700 hospitalized or isolated cases were recovered from the diseases. Hence, the recovery rate of hospitalized  cases is calculated as, =6700/17530 =0.00273/day.  Some of remaining parameters are estimated from the mathematical model (1) via model fit using a computing soft-ware MatLab2018a by optimal estimation of parameters; least square curve fit along with Trust-Region-Reflective to find bounded estimated parameters. The result of model fit versus confirmed cases of COVID-19 is portrayed in Figure 1 . Thus, values of the parameters used in this work are obtained from assumption, calculation, model fitting and from the literature and are indicated in Table 2 . all negative and hence the endemic equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable, and is in agreement with the analytical proof made in subsection 3.2.In order to determine the best control measures using the basic reproductive number, the normalized sensitivity index, which measures the the relative change of with respect to 0 R  denoted by ,and defined as is useful [24, 27] . The magnitude of sensitivity analysis of the reproductive number (3) shows that the most sensitive parameters in descending order are and so on. Increasing the , , , , , ,... It then follows that, if the transmission from asymptomatic cases to suspected cases is reduced by a fraction of at least ( i.e. ), then the transmission of COVID- .Now, the objective is to find an optimal control for the preventive strategies/measures for the relatively reduced coasts of the prevention strategies. The necessary 1 2 3 , and u u u and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal control are established by Pontryagin maximum principle [34] . The function that minimizes the number of Exposed cases , number of symptomatically infected cases , number of asymptomatically infected cases and number of hospitalized cases over a time interval of can be defined as, where the control set is given byconstraint given by system of differential equation (6). The necessary conditions that need to be satisfied by optimal control called Pontryagin's Maximum Principle converts equation (6) and (7) .Differentiating the Hamiltonian function with respect to the compartment variables gives the adjoint variables corresponding to the system given as follows: and   are the adjoint variables  , , , , ,  ( , , , , ,  ) ,.Now, setting the transversality condition:we obtain the optimal controls and the optimality conditions respectively as:Note that, state equation (6), the adjoint equation (9) together with the characterization of the optimal control (13) and the transversality condition (11) are said to be Optimality system. The sections and subsection treated above describe analytical behaviors of the optimal control. The corresponding numerical simulation of the optimal control is treated in the next section.In this section numerical solution for the optimality system is presented. The initial conditions used in the simulation are As can be seen from Figure 2 above, the peak for the spread of the virus is observed around 238 th day of the pandemic. The result indicated that there are about 5095000 exposed, 603500 asymptotic, 479100 symptomatic and 1154000 hospitalized cases at the peak.Case II: In this case, all the three intervention strategies namely: educating the public , using of personal protective measures , and treating the hospitalized Case III: This case considered the combination of optimal personal protective measure and optimal treatment of hospitalized cases with no any public health education intervention . The simulation result of the effect of these two intervention 1 2 3 ( ( ) 0, ( ) 0, ( ) 0 ) u t u t u t    strategies is almost identically the same as in Figure 4 . in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 i.e. case II. But as to case III, the full intensity of using personal protective measures has to be prolonged to the first 50 days before it slowly gets down to the lower bound at the end of the pandemic. Note that, it has been checked that cases where and As can be seen from Figure 6 , using the intervention strategy 'treating hospitalized COVID-19 cases' alone with the maximum effort couldn't reduce the number of exposed, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as the number of cases in Figure 6 is the same as number of cases in Figure 2 for the compartments . Applying this control strategy , and E I A alone reduced the number of hospitalized cases from 1154000 ( Figure 2) to 27130 ( Figure 6 ) at the peak. Further, the control profile of this case is the same as case II for of Figure  3 ( ) u tCase V: In this case, optimal practice of public health education is considered without the intervention of personal protective measures and treatment of hospitalized cases . The simulation result for the effect of optimally practicingthis intervention strategy is presented in Figure 7 for the optimal profile of and in 1 ( ) u t As can be seen from Figure 7 , the control profile that the optimal time range for public education is ranging from 176 th -186 th only for 10 days. Further, Figure 8 reveals that the peak of the pandemic for this case is around 176 th day but it is around 238 th day in Figure 2 . One can also anlyze from Figures 2 and 8 that using optimal public education alone could have reduced the duration of the pandemic, the peak period and number of cases in each of the compartments. Case VI: This case considered the optimal practice of personal protective measure without intervention of the other two control strategies: public health education and treatment of hospitalized cases . The simulation result of the control profileis depicted in Figure 9 where as its effect on the number of cases in the compartments identically the same as in case II. It can be observed from Figure 9 above, the usage of personal protective measures is optimal for the first 120 days of the duration of the pandemic. Comparing cases II and VI, one can learn that both cases lead to the required result of mitigating the transmission of the pandemic independently. However, in case VI the practices of personal protective measures need to be applied optimally for the first 129 days as compared to 8 days for case II. Despite the effort made by the Gvernment to teach the public and many Ethiopians effort to maintain personal protective measures and treatments of hospitalized cases being underway, the transmission of COVID-19 is increasing from time to time (see Figure1) . Consequently, it seems reasonable to make numerical investigation of nonoptimal intensity of practicing personal protective stratgies to appreciate their effect in decreasing the number of cases in the compartments of model (6) . Accordingly, we assumed and simulted the 1 3 ( ) 0 ( ) u t u t   model for different percentage values of pesonal protective measure 2 ( ) 1%, 5%, 9% u t  and the result is shown in Figure 10 below. Figure 10 it can be inferred that, if at least 1% from each of the symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized cases maintained practicing personal protective measures at an optimal level from the onset of the pandemic, then the number of cases in the compartments would have reduced (black) as compared to the graph with no personal , , and E I A H protective (red) measures . The figure further reveals that a pretty improved result 2 ( ( ) 0) u t  would have been obtained for in the different compartments.2 5% and 9% u In this study, a mathematical model for transmission dynamics of COVID-19 for the case of Ethiopia is developed and its different properties including local stability analysis of the diseases free and endemic equilibrium points have been checked. Some of the parameter estimates were taken from Spencer et al., [12] and the remaining parameters were computed via model fitting based on real daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases of Ethiopia from 13 March to 31 July, 2020. It is then calculated that the basic reproductive is . 0 1.5085 R  An optimal analysis of the model for the purpose of assessing the effect of public health education, effect of personal protective measures and effect of treating hospitalized or isolated cases in mitigating transmission of COVID-19 was conducted. The result showed that the optimal practice of combination of all the three intervention strategies significantly reduces the number of exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized cases (see Figures 3 and 4) . Likewise, optimal usage of personal protective measures alone led to the required decreases in the number of cases in the compartments except that the optimal application of the control measure needs to be maintained relatively for a longer period of time (see Figure 9 ). It is also found that combining control strategies personal protective measures and treatment of hospitalized cases (Case III) is as good as combining the three strategies (case I) in combating the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.In this work, the parameters that need to be targeted for suppression of COVID-19 pandemic by decreasing the basic reproductive number, are identified. For instance, it is shown that if the target is to decreasing the rate of transmission from asymptotically infected to suspected individuals then reducing this parameter to at least can suppress coronavirus from , ,  0.47   Ethiopia. The same type of work can be conducted in different countries by adapting to their situation. Moreover, optimal combination of the three intervention strategies proposed in this work or optimal combination of any two of the strategies or optimal practice of personal protective measures alone reduced the number of COVID-19 cases in the compartments as shown in the simulation results. Hence, the result of this study can be used as a policy input for the government of Ethiopia and other countries. The government of Ethiopia has to take necessary measures to make personal protective measures a mandatory practice throughout the period of the pandemic. Personal protective measures such as wearing facemask, regular hand washing and social distancing if practiced with optimum effort, can significantly decrease the disturbing effect of COVID-19 and safeguarded the nation. The government can also target its control strategy on reducing the basic reproductive number, taking into account the sensitivity analysis results of this work while considering the limitations of this work given below.It is ethical to make clear that mathematical models are in general approximations of real phenomena and as such they are naturally inaccurate. Moreover, the parameters used in any mathematical models are determined based on observations and experimentations using different numerical methods of computing software and hence are uncertain. Therefore, readers should take into account the limitation of the models while interpreting the findings.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-10-09",10

For example, since in sub-Saharan Africa traditional media reach is low and mobile data costs to access the internet are high, WhatsApp has become a low-cost ""one-stopshop"" [1, 2] . Unfortunately, social media platforms are also highly susceptible to misinformation due to low cost of access, virality of posts, individuals' trust in their social network, and the high cost of fact-checking [3] [4] [5] [6] . Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, as had been the case with the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic [7] and the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic [8] , social media has exacerbated this misinformation problem and muddied public knowledge about the virus throughout the Global South [9] [10] [11] .We study whether trusted sources of information can also leverage the ubiquity of social media to combat misinformation and related potentially harmful behavior. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of WhatsApp messages from a trusted civil society organization (CSO) in Zimbabwe aimed at targeting misinformation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Zimbabweans rely heavily on WhatsApp to access and share information due to prohibitive data costs and the anonymity that WhatsApp affords. As a result, the social network accounts for close to half of all internet traffic in Zimbabwe, far more than competing platforms such as Facebook, which commands only 1% of internet traffic [12] . While the exact number of unique WhatsApp users is not known, an estimate in 2017 suggests that there are at least 5.2 million WhatsApp users in the country [13] . This is roughly 37% of the country's total population or 60% of the country's population over the age of fourteen. During the study period, the COVID-19 virus had reached Zimbabwe, and the government had just imposed a national lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. Already, across various social media platforms, and particularly through WhatsApp, posts with misinformation about virus transmission and cures had gone viral. Further, due to the low official infection rates, many questioned the necessity of preventative measures [14] . Misinformation about the virus and low trust in the government threatened the likelihood of lockdown compliance in the country.To combat this problem, we partnered with two organizations, Internews and Kubatana, over a two-week period to disseminate truthful information about COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. Each week, we leverage Kubatana's large and wide-reaching WhatsApp subscriber base to randomize the timing of message dissemination, with the treated condition receiving these messages on Monday while the control group receives messages on Saturday. We measure individuals' knowledge through a mid-week survey, and embed a list experiment designed to measure compliance with social distancing, while addressing concerns relating to demand effects and social desirability bias. Contrary to mixed results from the Global North on the dissemination of health-related misinformation [15] [16] [17] [18] , we find that social media messaging against misinformation from a trusted source can increase both knowledge about COVID-19 and also preventative behavior. These results speak to the potential of trusted social media sources to combat misinformation and related potentially harmful behavior among its subscribers. However, more work is needed to extrapolate these findings to other sources and samples.We partner with two organizations in Zimbabwe to carry out this study. First, we partnered with Internews, an international non-governmental organization (NGO) operating in Zimbabwe. Internews focuses on training and supporting independent media across the world to help provide people with trustworthy and high-quality information. Our second partner, which implemented the study, is Kubatana, a trusted online media civil society organization (CSO) that was formed in 2001. Kubatana primarily shares information with its subscribers on issues relating to civil and human rights in Zimbabwe through its email, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp channels. The organization began using WhatsApp as a method of distribution in 2013. Today, it has over 27,000 WhatsApp subscribers from across the country divided roughly across 133 WhatsApp broadcast lists. These lists were created based on the month and year of subscription and contain up to 256 subscribers per list.Zimbabwe, through its WhatsApp broadcast lists. In addition, the organization maintained its usual publishing and activity schedule.To evaluate their effect, we randomized the timing of these messages at the WhatsApp broadcast list level. Subscribers in broadcast lists assigned to the treatment condition in a given week were sent the message on Monday, while subscribers in broadcast lists assigned to the control condition were sent the message on Saturday. Between these two days of the week, Kubatana sent two additional messages to its subscribers through WhatsApp. First, between Tuesday and Wednesday, it sent its weekly newsletter. Second, on Thursday, it distributed a short survey designed to test treatment effects on 1) knowledge of the information disseminated in the messages, and 2) behavior relating to social distancing. Respondents were given the option of responding to the survey either directly through WhatsApp messages or through the survey platform Qualtrics according to their preference. Notably, Kubatana disseminated both the messages and survey without sharing broadcast list information with us, to avoid potential reputational costs in a context where anonymity is highly valued. Therefore, we had no access to individual identifiers from survey respondents. As we discuss later, this did not affect our results.This research design has three advantages. First, by randomizing the timing of each message rather than the dissemination itself, all WhatsApp subscribers eventually received important information regardless of their treatment condition. Second, by having Kubatana's weekly newsletter in between the WhatsApp message to treated broadcast lists, we reduced the likelihood that survey respondents would scroll back to a previous message to search for the correct answer in the knowledge-testing questions. Third, by allowing respondents to respond through WhatsApp, we maximized the response rate. In line with our expectation due to the mobile data costs in Zimbabwe, the survey response rate was four times higher through What-sApp than through Qualtrics.All research was carried out in compliance with local Zimbabwean research standards and was reviewed to be in accordance with standards set forth by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects at Harvard University. By randomizing the timing of the messaging rather than whether recipients received messages at all, we did not withhold potentially important information from the sample. Further, because the researchers received no identifiable data on the participants and did not interact with any of Kubatana's subscribers directly, the research was granted exemption status.In week 1, Kubatana disseminated the messaging to 13,921 individuals on Monday (treatment condition) and to 13,400 individuals on Saturday (control condition). In week 2, for which treatment assignment was re-randomized, messages were sent to 13,566 individuals on Monday (treatment condition) and 13,755 on Saturday (control condition). This yielded a survey sample comprising of 868 respondents over two weeks, with 585 (2% response rate) from the first week and 283 (1% response rate) from the second week. These response rates are similar to those of other studies where survey respondents are recruited through social media in sub-Saharan Africa [19] . Respondents to the survey are demographically representative: 55% of our survey respondents are male and 76% live in urban localities, aligning with evidence from nationally-representative surveys, which estimate that 59% of frequent social media users in Zimbabwe are male and 69% live in urban areas [20] . Descriptively, a substantial share of respondents report believing in fake cures that have prominently spread through social media. 30% of respondents believe that drinking hot water will cure the virus and 25% believe that inhaling steam will. S1 Table provides descriptive statistics relating to the sample.We evaluate outcomes relating to knowledge and behavior. We measured knowledge using a standardized index, or z-score, of responses to factual questions that relate to the message sent in a given week. Directly asking about preventative behavior likely induces demand effects or social desirability bias. Each week, we thus measured behavior using a list experiment, a common technique to estimate the prevalence of sensitive behaviors [21] . Respondents were given a list of activities and asked how many they had performed in the past three days. One version of this list, the short experimental list, comprised a list of four non-sensitive activities. The other version of this list, the long experimental list, used the same four non-sensitive activities and added one sensitive activity-visiting a friend or family member outside of their homes during the mandated nationwide COVID-19 lockdown period. We randomly assigned respondents to a short or long experimental list at the WhatsApp broadcast list level. A comparison of the reported number of activities, across respondents assigned to 'short' and 'long' experimental lists within the same treatment condition (i.e. whether they had received the message on Monday or Saturday of that week), provides an unbiased measure of the prevalence of the sensitive activity among the respondents assigned to a given treatment condition. Comparing this measure across treatment conditions then provides an estimate of the effect of the intervention on behavior.Each week, to assign each WhatsApp broadcast list to a treatment condition, we initially blocked broadcast lists into groups of four, grouping lists which had been created around the same time together. Then, within each block, we randomly assigned one list to each of the four possible combinations of treatment conditions and experimental list length. Such blocking and within-block randomization is commonly done prior to the random assignment of treatment to improve the precision of estimated treatment effects by subsequently including block fixed effects in the estimation [22] . In S2 Table, we show that survey response rates and respondent characteristics are balanced across treatment conditions. This suggests an absence of differential selection into survey participation based on treatment assignment.We estimate treatment effects on knowledge by regressing the z-score index onto a treatment indicator. We estimate treatment effects on behavior by regressing the number of activities reported in the list experiment onto a treatment indicator, a long experimental list indicator, and the interaction between the two. We provide specifications with and without controlling for respondent covariates. We include week fixed effects and either randomization block fixed effects or, more demandingly, WhatsApp broadcast list fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the level of the WhatsApp broadcast list-week throughout. Further, we explore subgroup treatment effects by splitting our sample across gender, urbanity and week of the intervention. We provide additional information on estimation in S4 Appendix. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 16, while graphics are produced in R.First, we examine the effects of treatment assignment on respondent knowledge about the information delivered. Fig 1 plots the treatment effects using different permutations of our specifications. The results suggest substantively large effects of the WhatsApp messages on individual knowledge. In the baseline specification with randomization block fixed effects, respondents assigned to a treated WhatsApp broadcast list in a given week report factual knowledge 0.26σ greater than respondents assigned to a control list (p < 0.001). Treatment effects are slightly larger in the specification with WhatsApp broadcast list fixed effects at 0.45σ (p < 0.001). These correspond to roughly 7 percentage points, or 12% increase, in correct responses. Across specifications, results are unchanged by the addition of respondent covariates.Second, we examine treatment effects on respondents' preventative behavior. Fig 2 plots the treatment effects using different permutations of our specifications. In the baseline specification, among respondents assigned to the control condition, 37% (p < 0.001) did not comply with social distancing. However, among respondents assigned to the treatment condition, this behavior drops to 7% (p = 0.47). The difference between these effects is statistically significantly different (p < 0.05), implying that the WhatsApp messages changed related behavior. Estimated treatment effects are again slightly larger when using WhatsApp broadcast list fixed effects and are robust to the addition of respondent covariates. The magnitudes of these treatment effects are comparable to those from other studies seeking to facilitate healthy behavior in the Global South [23] . Importantly, due to the use of a list experiment, these treatment effects on behavior cannot be explained by demand effects and social desirability bias, or respondents scrolling back to a previous message to search for the correct answer. The consistency of the effects on behavior with the effects on knowledge, which are potentially affected by such possible biases, helps to bolster confidence in the results overall.Lastly, we examine subgroup treatment effects on the two outcomes in Figs 3 and 4 based on gender, rurality, and week of intervention. We find relatively uniformly estimated effects across subgroups. While statistically insignificant, treatment effects on knowledge among women are greater than among men (p = 0.25), while effects on behavior are not different between women and men (p = 0.85). We also find similar treatment effects in Weeks 1 and 2. S3, S4 and S5 Tables provide the estimated regression coefficients to support the figures.In sum, our results indicate encouraging positive changes in knowledge and behavior among WhatsApp subscribers of a trusted source. While WhatsApp has been identified as a platform through which misinformation easily spreads, we show that trusted CSOs can also leverage WhatsApp's reach to successfully get individuals to reassess their misconceptions and correct related behavior. This effect is roughly similar across the urban-rural as well as the gender divide, highlighting the power of WhatsApp messages from a trusted source to counter misinformation. These findings, then, stress the potential of CSOs in sub-Saharan Africa to fight misinformation. They further highlight the similar role that other WhatsApp newspapers in the region might play (e.g., The Continent in South Africa and 263Chat in Zimbabwe). The study's context and findings contribute to recent work on the effectiveness of messages to correct misinformation across a variety of issues ranging from health to politics [15, 18, 24] . These studies present mixed findings and are particularly negative with respect to vaccination campaigns [16, 17] . However, most them provide evidence from lab and online experiments in the Global North, while far fewer studies take place in the Global South. Similarly, there is a dearth of field experimental evidence in this context, which is likely to be most informative for scaling up related policies [25, 26] . Our positive findings from a field experiment in Zimbabwe suggest that there are especially high returns to correcting misinformation, especially surrounding ongoing health crises where people are uncertain and seeking information [7, 27, 28] .Our results may deviate from those in prior scholarship in part due to the population that we study: individuals who have already self-selected into receiving information from a human rights NGO. While the sample appears demographically similar to the broader population of social media users in Zimbabwe, the subscribers are likely already receptive to information delivered to them by Kubatana and hence one should be cautious when extrapolating the treatment effects we find to other samples. However, our sample represents an important, and growing, population in the developing world-of individuals who are exposed to misinformation through social media, but also seek independent, credible sources of information through well-established NGOs.As part of our ongoing surveying efforts in Zimbabwe, we asked respondents for the sources of COVID-19 information that they trust the most. Descriptively, we find that citizens are most likely to trust an international organization first, followed closely by local NGOs or CSOs, and third by a message that mentions a news source (see Fig 5) .In conjunction with the experimental results we present above, this evidence suggests that a trusted source of information can use the same social media channels to disseminate information that both combats misinformation and changes related behavior. Thus, while we caution generalizing our results to general public in Zimbabwe, our results speak specifically to the important role that trusted sources play, particularly in confusing informational situations such as health crises [29] , and in an authoritarian context where trust in information might be low [30] . Existing scholarship emphasizes the importance of how information is framed [31] , and the credibility of the information source for the recipient [32] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, the identification and dissemination of correct information represent an important challenge. While factchecking can contribute to a source's credibility [33] , particularly during emergency situations, it might be outpaced by the spread of misinformation through social media [34, 35] .Future research should consider how best to integrate social media messaging aimed at targeting misinformation into CSOs' ongoing programming, while at the same time highlighting their relative importance. During the study, Kubatana's WhatsApp messaging increased threefold, from one WhatsApp message a week. Even after two weeks, the organization reported four unsubscribers-a number that, while low, is highly unusual for it. Moreover, in the second week, there was a 50% drop in survey responses relative to the first week. Additional work on identifying how to maximize the benefits of such messaging without inducing disengagement will be of great importance for devising a sustainable way to counter misinformation in the Global South.Supporting information S1 Appendix.

Its etiology is multifactorial, resulting from an interaction between the animal and its environment, nutrition and the pathogens involved (Scott et al., 2004) .The etiology of this diarrhoeal syndrome can be infectious (viruses, bacteria and protozoa) or due to non-infectious factors such as herd management, nutritional and immunological status of the host (Garaicoechea et al., 2006; Maes et al., 2003; Stipp et al., 2009) . Infectious diarrhoea in lambs is most often due to different types of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Rotavirus, and Coronavirus or a combination of these pathogens.They can cause clinical disease and/or may lead to suboptimal growth rate of affected animals (Chatzopoulos et al., 2013; Hubalek et al., 2014; Minetti et al., 2014; Scholes et al., 2007 , Yang et al., 2009 .However, in a neonatal diarrhoea syndrome, it is difficult to situate the exact etiological role of each of these pathogens, due to their action which can be isolated or associated, producing practically similar clinical signs. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that the diversity in the degree of association between these agents is often fatal when the infections are mixed (Chatzopoulos et al., 2013; Hubalek et al., 2014; Martella et al., 2015) .In Algeria, the overall sheep population was estimated at 28,393,602 (MADR, 2017).Although, neonatal diarrhoea is one of the major preoccupations of livestock farmers in Algeria. However, to date no studies have been carried out in Algeria to investigate the main agents of neonatal diarrhoea in sheep (Cryptosporidium parvum, Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus). The majority of publications have only concerned cattle (Khelef et J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Ouchene et al, 2012 Ouchene et al, , 2016 and the very few studies that have been carried out on sheep are concerned only Cryptosporidium spp (Baroudi et al, 2018; Sahraoui et al, 2019) .The present study was therefore conducted for evaluate the comparative role of Cryptosporidium spp and other enteric pathogens known as major agents of neonatal diarrhea in lambs on 30 farms located in the north-central region of Algeria.The study was carried out between January 2014 and December 2016 and concerned 559 lambs aged less than 30 days. Lambs were classified into four age groups: ≤ 7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-30 days.The study was carried out in 30 sheepfolds with extensive farming methods, where sheep remain on pasture for the most part of the day. The study was carried out in north-center region of Algeria: Laghouate (33°47′59″ N 2°51′54″ E), Djelfa (34°40′22″ N 3°15′46″ E), Medea (36°15′51″ N 2°45′14″ E) and Bouira (36°22′29″N 3°54′07″ E) ( Figure 1 ). Fecal samples were taken using a rectal swab from each lamb in a sterile plastic vial. The samples were then transported to the laboratory at 4°C. Farm of origin, the date of sampling and the age of each animal were recorded. The aspect of the faeces was registered: diarrhoeal/non-diarrhoeal.Faecal samples were screened for antigens to C. parvum and the other enteric pathogens using a commercial faecal antigen ELISA test (Bio-X Easy-Digest, Bio K 151; Bio-X Diagnostics, Belgium). This kit simultaneously detects specific antigens from C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus and the tests were performed according to the kit manufactures' instructions.Detection rate of prevalence in diarrheic lambs than in no-diarrheic and in the different age groups were compared by chi-square test (χ2) test. For multi-variable comparisons, one-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by Tukey-Kramer testing using the program R software version 3.0.1(R Core Team2013). Differences were considered significant at p˂0.05.Of the 559 lambs, 312 (58.81%), 155 (27.72%), 72 (12.88%) and 20 (3.57%) tested by faecal antigen ELISA were positive for C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus antigens, respectively. The prevalence of C. parvum was the highest (p<0.0001) ( Table 1) .C. parvum, E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus were observed in 23 (76.66%), 17 (56.66%), 9 (30%) and 3 (10%) sheepfolds, respectively. C. parvum was the most widespread (p<0.0001) .Compared to age, the prevalence of C. parvum was highest during the second and third week of age (p<0.001). In contrast, other pathogens were found to be more frequent in lambs aged ≤7 days (p<0.001) ( Table 2 ). Rotavirus and coronavirus were not revealed in lambs aged ≥ 15 days (Table 2) .Lambs aged ≤ 7 days were found to be more infested with E. coli K99 and rotavirus compared to C. parvum and coronavirus (p<0.001) ( Table 2 ). In the other age categories (≥8jours), lambs were more infested with C. parvum than other enteropathogens (p<0.001) ( Table 2 ).The number of lambs with diarrhea was 280 (50.09%) of which 280 (100%), 127 (45.35%), 52 (18.57%) and 10 (3.57%) were found to be infected with C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and coronavirus, respectively. All diarrheal lambs were found to be infected with C. parvum, which showed a significantly higher prevalence than other pathogens (p<0.0001).The prevalence of infection with C. parvum, E. coli and rotavirus was higher in lambs with diarrhea compared to lambs without diarrhea (p<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed for coronavirus (Table 3) .C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus were identified alone in 291, 146, 65 and 15 samples, respectively ( Figure 2 ). C. parvum was the most frequent (p<0.0001).The association between these pathogens was observed only with C. parvum, where associations of C. parvum with E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus were reported in 9, 7 and 5 samples, respectively ( Figure 2 ).The clinical diagnosis of infectious enteritis is difficult to establish because of the frequency of clinical signs, the implication of multiple agents, and the interactions between factors that predispose the host to infection (Athanassious et al., 1994) . C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus are recognized as the most important enteropathogens in diarrhea in young ruminants (Gulliksen et al., 2009) . To our knowledge, this is the first report of neonatal lambs in Algeria in which C. parvum along with E. coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus infections are reported using the ELISA test for fecal antigen detection. The results showed the existence of all this pathogens with a predominance of C. parvum.Prevalence of lambs' infections with C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus revealed in this study were 58.81%, 27.72%, 12.88% and 3.57%, respectively. C. parvum was the most prevalent. This is in agreement with other findings (Ahamed et al., 2015; Gencay, 2012; Munoz et al., 1996; Paze et al., 2014) . C. parvum plays an important role in neonatal diarrhea in lambs (Andres et al., 2007) . In our study, a strong association between diarrhea and the presence of C. parvum oocysts in lamb faeces have been recorded which is in concordance with several other studies (Ahamed et al., 2015; Causape et al., 2002; Mueller-Doblies et al., 2008; Munoz et al., 1996; Paoletti et al., 2009; Ulutaş and Voyvoda, 2004) . The same finding was reported also in cattle (Brandão et al., 2007; Izzo et al., 2011; Stipp et al., 2009 ).C. parvum was observed in 23 sheepfolds (67.66%) which is comparable with Causapé et al.(2002), Munoz et al. (1996) and higher than of Nouri et al. (1993) in Iran, Rossanigo et al. (1987) in Italy and Causape et al. (2002) and Pablo Diaz et al. (2015) in Spain.In this study, the higher prevalence of cryptosporidial infection was observed in lambs aged between 8-21 days. The same was reported by Sevinç et al. (2005) . The presence of Cryptosporidium infection in clinically asymptomatic lambs indicated that particular age group of animals might be reservoir for the parasite (Pritchard et al., 2008) and the prevalence rate decreases with increase in age and, this may be due to age related immunity (Zu et al.,1992) .Neonatal colibacillosis is highly contagious in lambs (Pritchard et al., 2007) . Our results show that E. coli K99 was reported in 27.72% of lambs which is consistent with 26% reported in Spain (Munoz et al., 1996) and higher than 19.2%, 9.42% reported by Fernando et al. (2016) in Brazil and Malik et al. (1983) in Morocco, respectively.The most severe diarrhea was recorded in calves less than three days old with E. coli K99 (King et al., 1991) . In our study, the highest prevalence of E. coli K99 was observed in lambs less than 7 days old which is in agreement with Erhan et al. (2010) .E. coli K99 was identified in 81.93% of the diarrhoeal lambs in our study which is in agreement with Aklilu et al. (2013) in Etiopia (84%). E. coli K99 was isolated from 4% of lambs in the Netherlands (Heuvelink et al., 1995), 0.2% in Italy (Bettelheim and Beutin, 2003) , 31% in USA (Keenan et al., 1986) from sheep flock and between 12.5-26.6% (Bhat et al., 2008; Wani et al., 2003) in India. These reports are much lower than our finding.The high prevalence of E. coli K99 observed in our study can be attributed to delayed or insufficient in first colostrum intake, unclean shepherd and lack of implementation of appropriate prevention and control measures. Olsson et al. (1993) reported that each hour of delay in colostrum ingestion during the first 12 hours of age resulted in a 10% increased risk of a lamb becoming sick. The same observation was suggested by Aklilu et al. (2013) .Lambs are susceptible to different rotavirus serotypes during their first week of life (king et al., 1991) . Rotavirus-associated enteritis in lambs has been the subject of numerous studies; the frequency of infection ranges from 2.1% in Spain (Munoz et al., 1996) and 5.3% in Turkey (Erhan et al., 2010 ) to 25% in India (wani et al., 2004 . In our study, the prevalence encountered (12.88%) falls between these prevalences.In the present study, rotavirus was more observed in lambs less than 7 days old (35.48%). The quantitative and qualitative insufficiency of colostrum can be incriminated, especially since double births are frequent in ewes (Theil et al., 1995) .Several studies have shown high morbidity (75-100%) in outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea in lambs (Papp et al., 2014) . In the present study, rotavirus was more prevalent in diarrhoea than non-diarrhoeal lambs, which is consistent with Kaminjolo et al. (1994) .Rotavirus was isolated from 30% of the farms in our study, which is lower compared to 46% found in Scotland (Wani et al., 2004) .Coronavirus has been reported to play a role in the etiology of diarrhoea in association with rotavirus (Chapman et al., 2001; Ozmen et al., 2006) . In the present study, coronavirus was detected in 3.57% of lambs, which was lower than reported by other authors (Burimuah et al., 2020; Erhan et al., 2010) .In addition, a survey of small ruminants in Spain failed to detect coronaviruses in diarrhoeal neonates (Munoz et al., 1996) .Many enteric pathogens can exist simultaneously with cryptosporidium infection in the same animal (Munoz et al., 1996) . Although infections with C. parvum alone were recorded, mixed infections with the other enteric pathogens tested were more frequent. As demonstrated also, single infections with E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus may be associated with diarrhoea (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . For mixed infections, C. parvum has been variably detected with E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus. These mixed infections are common and are generally thought to increase the severity of the diarrhea when they occur (Cho and Yoon, 2014) .In our study, mixed infections were observed between C. parvum and E. coli K99, rotavirus or coronavirus and no other form of association was found. This suggests that C. parvum is a primary agent in neonatal diarrhoea in lambs and that other agent is synergistic. The same observation has been reported by other authors (De la Fuente et al., 1999; Tartera et al., 2000) .The present study has documented C. parvum, as well as E. coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus in neonatal lambs from Algeria. These enteropathogens were observed in lambs with or without diarrhea. C. parvum was the most common, especially in lambs with diarrhea. ","Algeria","abstract","2020-10-22",10

While initially adopted in developed countries, soon after, developing countries also started following these strategies to contain the virus.The applicability of these policies in developing countries was questionable given that about 70 percent people in these countries are informally employed, including the agriculture sector, with the overrepresentation of women (International Labour Organisation [ILO] , 2018). This paper aims to investigate how far COVID-induced economic hardship, in terms of job and income loss, differs by gender in four developing countries.Labor market participation of women in the developing world is significantly lower than men's (ILO, n.d.) . Women are overly represented in informal work (ILO, 2018) while largely unpaid and underpaid (ILO, 2012) . However, there is variability among developing countries as some are better at integrating women in the labor market than others (Verick, 2014) .Considering these special characteristics of labor market, this paper uses recent survey data from four developing countries with regional and cultural diversity to examine gender inequality in facing economic hardship triggered by COVID-19.The paper further explores the plausible mechanism of gender inequality by individual wealth background. Gender inequality in labor market and its potential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f routes during recession times, and more specifically in COVID-19 crisis, are not investigated much in the contexts of developing countries. The four countries in the study are Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh [AP] and Telangana State [TS]), Peru, and Vietnam. We use phone survey data collected by Young Lives (YL) between early June and early July 2020 [dataset] (Favara et al., 2020) .Evidence remains inconclusive about the effects of economic crises on gender inequality. Some studies on advanced economies suggest that men suffer more from losing jobs and income than women during economic recessions (e.g., Hoynes, Miller, & Schaller, 2012) .However, recent findings on labor market inequalities in COVID-19 crisis report somewhat contesting evidence. Witteveen (2020) finds that in higher wealth quantiles, men are more likely to face financial hardship triggered by COVID-19 than women in the UK. Similarly, Blundell, Costa Dias, Joyce, and Xu (2020) suggest that women and minorities face less risk to lose jobs as they tend to be more employed in essential services, often marked by unsafe and low-paying status.By contrast, Kristal and Yaish (2020) report that women's employment has been hit more severely than men's by coronavirus in Israel. Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020) also find that in the UK and US, women and low educated groups have been hurt stronger.The effect of recessions on gender inequality in facing economic hardship in developing countries is not well documented. The main objective of this paper is to draw evidence on this using COVID-induced job and income loss events in resourcescarce contexts.We further explore whether gender differences in economic hardship varies by household wealth level as existing research observes so. Witteveen (2020) argues that more economic hardship of men in the higher quintiles could be attributable to the fact that women (and minorities) are employed in essential and low earnings jobs. By contrast, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) report that women with lower education face more economic hardship.COVID-19 led to lockdowns in the four countries of this study with varying length: banning public gatherings, quarantine and regional level lockdown in Ethiopia since mid-March and April (Reuters Staff, 2020); nationwide lockdown in India declared at the end of March (BMJ, 2020) and in Peru in mid-March (Associated Press, 2020). While Vietnam has a few COVID-19 cases, the country has gone through a very strict lockdown as well (Sheikh, Sheikh, Sheikh, Dhami, & Sridhar, 2020) . These measures may have significantly reduced economic activities.As shown in Table 1 , a huge proportion of the workforce in these countries is employed in the informal sector. However, gender disparity in informal employment is mixed-while the ratio of women is higher in Ethiopia and Peru it is lower in India and Vietnam.[ Table 1 about here]Previous literature suggests that recessions can disproportionately affect various groups in three ways: (a) direct discrimination during the crisis by prioritizing one social group over another in employment along gender, race, class and ethnicity;(b) suboptimal behavior of people necessary due to resource scarcity during recessions, for instance, by taking jobs below one's minimum expected wage; and (c) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the high concentration of certain groups in the sectors recessions have the strongest impact on (Redbird & Grusky, 2016) .Women's work in traditional societies is largely unpaid, especially in household business and management. Formal employment also proportionately discriminates women in developing countries (Baden, 1993) . Hence, as Table 1 demonstrates, the large concentration of women in informal employment in all these countries possibly means that the work is not duly recognized. Besides, men tend to have a higher employment ratio. Men are also highly concentrated in labor intensivesectors such as heavy industries which were likely shut down because of the pandemic or the job could not be performed remotely (ILO, n.d.).Overrepresentation of men in certain sectors may lead to a higher male unemployment ratio during the pandemic as also Blundell et al. (2020) suggest. In other words, the third route (Redbird & Grusky, 2016) appears to be more applicable.However, the scenario may differ by country cases. Men's economic hardship may be higher in India and Ethiopia. In India, women are far behind in integrating into the labor market. Those who are in the labor market are highly concentrated in informal employment. Somewhat similarly, women's participation in the informal labor market in Ethiopia is almost twice as much as men's ( Table 1) .The same may apply to the cases of Peru and Vietnam as women tend to participate in the labor market less than men. They also participate in the informal sector noticeably, particularly in Peru. However, the informal labor market has been shrinking over time in Peru and Vietnam (ILO, 2018) . Similarly, women's formal employment participation may be higher in these countries compared to India and Ethiopia, indicated by smaller gaps in both employment-to-population and informal employment ratios. Therefore, the gender gap could be lower in Peru and Vietnam.We also assume that since women tend to have much lower participation in the formal labor market, gender gap by wealth may appear at upper quintiles, that would presumably have more people from higher occupational classes, as also suggested by (Witteveen, 2020) . However, this assumption may not hold in all contexts. This is because, due to population pressure and high unemployment, a notable proportion of skilled people with university degrees in developing and emerging economies, who are also likely from a well-off background, are forced to take jobs far below their qualifications (McKenzie, 2017).We use YL COVID-19 phone survey data, collected between 8 June and 12July from Ethiopia, two states of India (AP and TS), Peru and Vietnam [dataset] (Favara et al., 2020) . The study includes all adult population from the sample aged between 18 and 65 years old in the selected countries that are also active in the labor market.YL is a longitudinal survey in the selected countries aimed at analyzing the causes and consequences of childhood poverty since 2002. It has followed 12,000 children from two cohorts born in 2000-2001 and 1994-1995 respectively. Sentinelsite sampling design was used consisting of 20 purposefully selected sites in each country to represent national diversity while with a pro-poor bias. Although poor families were oversampled, non-poor households were also selected to ensure diversity and draw valid comparisons (Wilson & Huttly, 2004) .Despite not being fully nationally representative, previous analyses suggest that YL surveys closely represent the national diversity of families and children, and their wealth level when compared with other nationally representative data such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Nguyen, 2008; Outes-Leon & Sanchez, 2008) .The COVID-19 survey involved the members belonging to the households of the two YL cohorts. We do not link this dataset to the previous YL waves to use more background information as doing so significantly drops observations from the study because of mismatch in YL id.Dependent variableeconomic hardshipis defined by either (a) if someone did not lose income or job; and (iii) Not Applicable, if the person was not working before the pandemic. We exclude the third option as the focus of the study is on those who were active in the labor market. We present the descriptive statistics including people who were not in the labor market in Appendix A. When compared with active labor market participants, the proportion of people facing economic hardship dramatically changes.Gender dummy, the main independent variable, in the summary statistics (Appendix A) shows that when the population outside the labor market are excluded, the proportion of men increases by about 10 percent in India and Peru. Male representation is, nonetheless, also slightly higher in the labor market in Ethiopia and Vietnam.The 'wealth' dummy, originally reported as Home Environment for Protection (HEP), was constructed by YL based on six indicators to report whether a household has protective capacity from COVID-19. The indicators include material possessions of households such as computer and television, people-to-room ratio, private toilet, dwelling having walls and a roof, private water source, and sanitization facilities. The YL team found a strong correlation between YL's previous wealth index and HEP (Favara et al., 2020) . HEP dummy 1 indicates higher wealth or 'rich' and 0 means lower wealth or 'poor'.We also include urban-rural dummy in the analysis as they represent quite distinct features in low-income countries because of continued rural-to-urban mass migration for employment opportunities, COVID-19-related health risks because of high population density and high inequalities (Tacoli, 2012) .In addition, we control for age and age squared, and state only for India (whether AP or TS). The regional id for other countries is not available in the dataset.We use the following logit regression model in equation (1), where outcome variable E is a dummy indicating whether someone faced economic hardship or not. δ is an intercept, β is the coefficient on gender Gi in household h and ϕ is a vector of coefficient on the control variables Zih-household 'wealth', location (urban/rural), age, age squared, and state dummy only for India. εih is an error term. Models are adjusted for household-clustered standard errors.(1)The results are mixed among countries about the association between gender and economic hardship. As Table 2 suggests, holding all other factors constant, we find that men are more likely to face economic hardship than women in Ethiopia (p<0.01) and India (p<0.05). But we do not observe any significant gender difference in Peru and Vietnam. The results hold the same in models without adding controls (not displayed in the paper).This aligns with our initial assumption that due to highly unequal maledominated labor market in India and Ethiopia, potentially concentrated on heavy industries and higher pay, men are likely to have lost their jobs more than women. In Peru and Vietnam, as speculated, the non-significance could potentially be associated with their relatively higher integration of women in formal employment.However, these assumptions cannot be explored further in the study as the data is not available on the type of job, that is, the formal and informal sectors.We also find that apart from India, the association of 'wealth' with economic hardship is not found significant for other countries: on average, 'poor' people are more likely to lose jobs.[ Table 2 here]To explore the plausible route of gender inequality through 'wealth'background we examine the interaction between gender and wealth. However, with the exception of India, we do not find the interaction effect significant for other countries. As Figure 1 illustrates, men from 'wealthy' households tend to experience higher economic hardship than women from the same background. There is a notable gender gap of about 7 percentage points in facing hardship in the 'rich' category. The predictive margins for men and women are 71.4 percent and 64.5 percent, respectively.Our results about 'wealth' interaction could be driven by the way the variable is measured in the dataset. Income and occupational data may show different results for all countries, which future research can embark on.[ Figure 1 about here]Although it is not the main concern of the study, we also find that in all countries but India the association of urban/rural location with economic hardship is significant. As shown in Table 1 , people in urban areas tend to face more economic hardship than rural people. This could be driven by the fact that urban areas were hit by coronavirus and lockdowns much harder than rural areas. However, gender differences in experiencing hardship are not significant by urban and rural location in any country (not displayed).This paper gives an overview of gender inequality in COVID-19-induced economic hardship in terms of job and income loss in four developing countries from four different regions of the world.Our findings suggest some assimilation with past evidence from industrialized countries. We find that men tend to lose jobs and income in India and Ethiopia more than women which aligns with the evidence that economic recessions affect men disproportionately (Hoynes et al., 2012) as well as recent findings from the UK (Witteveen, 2020) .However, we do not find any significant association of gender for Peru and Vietnam. We speculate that this difference may have to do with the pattern of gender integration in the labor market. India's overall labor market is male-dominated while,in Ethiopia, women tend to work outside formal employment nearly twice as much as men. These factors may be associated with a higher job loss of men.On the other hand, in Peru and Vietnam, as said in section 4, the overall gap in the formal labor market is likely to be lower than that of Ethiopia and India. This may have contributed to the lower gender gap in economic hardship.The results, however, indicate labor market inequalities in the early stages of COVID-19 crisis. The relative advantage of women in India and Ethiopia assimilates the pattern of early phases of Great Recessions (Hout, Levanon, & Cumberworth, 2011) , which is likely because of women's greater concentration in essential and lowpaying jobs. The situation may reverse in the later stages of COVID-19-triggered economic crisis potentially resulting in women facing more economic crisis.While 'wealth' proxy is limited to capture a comprehensive measure, the result indicates that in India, men from better-off households tend to face more economic hardship compared to their female counterparts from 'rich' households. This implies that India's formal and upper-end occupations may likely be male-dominated and may have been heavily affected by the crisis. However, better use of wealth measurement with income or occupation data could draw a robust picture of this dimension of inequality.To conclude, as aforementioned, these are early results of COVID-19-induced economic crisis. The long-term effects of coronavirus, lockdown and other measures are yet to be revealed in the coming months and years.Funding.

Leaving no stone unturned: Allosteric targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at putative druggable sites disrupts human angiotensin-converting enzyme interactions at the receptor binding domain","The novel coronavirus disease also referred to as COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), with incidences first reported in Wuhan China in December 2019. 1 This disease has, however, persisted till mid-2020, spreading across 212 countries with over 3,513,507 cases reported coupled with increasingly high casualties numbering over 245,544 globally. 2 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a large group of coronaviruses which are known to cause respiratory infections and related complications. These RNA viruses are spherical, pleomorphic, positive-sensed, single-stranded and polyadenylated. 3 Of all known viruses, coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest RNA genome 4 , with diverse pathogenic effects in animals and humans. This virus class is divided into four genera namely: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta CoV [5] [6] [7] , with the beta-CoV class prominent for their disease-causing effects in humans (HCoVs). Seven HCoVs have been characterized to date [6] [7] [8] ; among which four (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) cause very mild respiratory symptoms. 9, 10 On the other hand, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 cause severe respiratory and gastrointestinal infections which, in most cases, can be fatal. 11 Although SARS-CoV-related infections were zoonotically transmitted into human populations, 12, 13 human to human transmissions has further contributed towards viral super-spread via respiratory aerosols. 14 The entry of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with its replication process in target human cells is achieved by the functionalities of a cohort of components, majorly non-structural and structural proteins, that make up the virus. Generally, about 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) mediate diverse pro-pathogenic functions such as replication, processing and proof-reading of genomic frames, host immune evasion among many others, as previously reported. [15] [16] [17] More so, CoVs comprises of four major structural proteins that are integral to their pathogenesis. [18] [19] [20] These are the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. The N protein makes up the nucleocapsid and other viral genome-related processes 21 while the M protein is the most abundant of the four, playing major roles in maintaining viral structural integrity as well as coordinating other structural proteins. 22 E protein, on the other hand, is crucial to the maturation of the virus [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] while the trimeric S protein mediates viral entry into the host cell via the endosomal or non-endosomal route. 28 Two domains make up the S protein namely the N-terminal S1 domain and the C-terminal S2membrane-anchored domain. The S2 region is extensively conserved in CoVs while constituent S1 region residues are highly diverge across the CoV strains. 29 These domains have been further characterized into subdomains due to specific functionalities with respect to host receptor recognition and binding (S1), coupled with membrane fusion and entry (S2) (Figure 1 ). Similar to SARS-CoV architecture, some recent reports have sub-categorized the SARS-CoV-2 S1 ectodomain into the N-terminal domain (NTD), a conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) which recognizes the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 30 and subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2). During infection, proteolytic cleavage or priming of the S protein is crucial for viral fusion and entry into host cells, a process mediated by host cell proteases such as the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L, [31] [32] [33] at the S1/S2 (boundary between S1 and S2 subunits) and S2' (immediately upstream S2 fusion peptide -FP) cleavage sites. [34] [35] [36] The S protein primarily exists in a metastable prefusion complex prior to cleavage, after which notable conformational arrangements occur in order to fuse the viral membrane into J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the host cell. [37] [38] [39] In addition, the RBD adopts disparate conformational motions to engage the host cell receptor. 40, 41 conformations. [42] [43] [44] The up conformation corresponds to the hACE2 accessible state while the down state cannot engage the host cell receptor. 44 The S2 domain, on the other hand, consists of the functionally important fusion peptide (FP), which is critical for viral fusion and formation of the post-fusion complex; heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2); transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT). The HRs of the S-protein trimer interact to form a fusion core of sixhelical bundle which helps bring the membranes of the virus and host cell in close proximity for fusion and entry. 42 Therefore, the roles of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein present it as an important therapeutic target, which would enable the prevention of viral entry and fusion in host cells.Numerous studies have been reported over the past months with regards to the possibility of blocking direct interactions between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and hACE2. Most of these studies were aimed at targeting the S protein RBD domain with antibodies, peptide-based or small molecule compounds that binds with a much higher affinity to block S-protein-hACE2interactions. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Also, targeting host proteases such as TMPRSS2 was explored in a recent study, with consequential impediments on SARS-CoV-2 entry. 30 Identification of other functional (allosteric) sites on the prefusion S protein could present another dynamic and effective approach of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity relative to its interaction with the host cell ACE2 and proteases. This alternative target approach for SARS-CoV-2 S protein is important because its RBD (similar to other CoVs) has been associated with a high mutational propensity which may in turn alter the affinity of small molecule inhibitors or peptide designed to bind therein. 51 Allosteric targeting was explored in a recent study wherein the CoV-conserved S2 HR1 region was identified as an important target site for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors of human CoVs. The resulting peptide inhibitor (EK1) was evaluated in vivo and exhibited desirable safety and efficacy 52 . More so, the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm was used to map functional allosteric loci on SARS-CoV S protein. 53 Relatively, this study was implemented to (i) identify potential druggable sites across the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein other than the RBD-hACE2 interface (ii) perform high-throughput (virtual) screening of ~1500 FDA approved drugs against the most druggable site(s) (iii) investigate the binding dynamics and interaction mechanisms of the compounds and their consequential effects on the S-protein RBD-ACE2 complex.We believe this systematic study will be able to provide structural and molecular insights into possible allosteric sites on SARS-CoV-2 S protein suitable for selective targeting and structure- Computational methodologiesThe three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (prefusion) was retrieved from PDB with entry 6VSB. 44 This, as previously reported, represents the S-protein RBD conformation inits up (open) state, which is most suitable for hACE2 binding. Also, to model binding interactions between the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (S1/S2) and the hACE2, a crystalized structure with PDB entry 6M0J 54 was separately retrieved. This complex depicts binding between the RBD domain (truncated) of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and the protease domain (PD) of hACE2. Co-crystallized molecules not relevant to this study were removed while missing residues (gaps) in the structures were filled using the MODELLER algorithm. 55 This preparation was performed on the UCSF Chimera Graphic User Interface (GUI). 56 Subsequently, using the structural superposition method, we were able to model a complex between prefusion S-protein (S1/S2) monomer (RBD -up conformation) and the hACE2 protein ( Figure 2 ).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Possible druggable sites other than the SARS-CoV-2 RBD interface were predicted using approaches previously reported. [57] [58] [59] [60] Herein, we employed multiple tools for site identification and validation, which include SiteMap 61 , Fpocket 62 , Discovery studio 2016 Client 63 and Prankweb. 64 SiteMap is an exhaustive tool which ranks protein pockets based on properties such as druggability, surface exposure, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity among others [65] [66] [67] . These details were then used to characterize the predicted pockets after which other predictive algorithms were used complementarily for cross-validation. Two highly ranked sites were then selected for further analyses.Furthering on the rationale of the study, we mapped out the two most druggable sites on the target protein and virtually screened against them a large chemical library of FDA approved drugs (~1500 compounds) derived from the ZINC repository (http://zinc.docking.org/substances/subsets/fda/). This screening was performed using highperformance computing-integrated Autodock vina 68 prior to which coordinates of the predicted sites were mapped using gridboxes. Corresponding binding scores were retrieved from the resulting .pdbqt files and were used to filter down to the topmost 20 compounds for each predicted Sites 1 and 2. Subsequently, two compounds with the highest binding scores (most negative) were selected for the two predicted sites yielding complexes that were subjected to further simulation studies. As explained in 2.1, the prefusion S-proteins (ligand-bound and unbound) were superimposed with the RBD-hACE2 complex (6M0J) after which the single J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f truncated RBD was removed. By so doing, we obtained models of allosterically-bound and unbound pre-fusion S-protein-ACE2 complex. This, as aimed in this study, would provide structural and dynamical insights into the mechanistic effects of allosteric targeting on SARS-CoV-2 host entry machinery.Although computationally expensive (1673 residues), we proceeded with long-timescale MD simulation runs for the systems on AMBER18 Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) using its embedded modules. 69 Protein parameters were defined using the FF14SB forcefield while ligand parameters were generated with the antechamber and parmchk modules. Likewise, the LEAP program was used to define coordinate and topology files for the ligand-bound and unbound protein complexes. This program, also, was used to neutralize (addition of counter-ions; Na + and Cl -) and solvate the systems in a TIP3P water box of size 10Å. Structural minimization was first carried out partially for 5000steps with a restraint potential of 500kcal mol -1 . Å 2 followed by another 100000 steps of full minimization with no restraints. A canonical (NVT) ensemble with a 5kcal mol -1 Å 2 harmonic restraints was used to heat the systems gradually from 0 -300k for 50ps, after which the systems were equilibrated for 10000ps at a constant 300k temperature without restraints in an NPT ensemble. Atmospheric pressure was maintained at 1bar with a Berendsen barostat 70 while each protein system was subjected to a production run of 350ns.Studied systems include ZINC3939013-S-protein-hACE2 (allosteric Site 1), ZINC27990463-Sprotein-hACE2 (allosteric Site 2), and unbound S-protein-hACE2. Corresponding trajectories were saved at every 1ps time-frame until the end of the simulation followed by data plot analyses using Microcal Origin software. 71 Snapshots were also taken and analyzed to monitor structural events and ligand interaction dynamics across the trajectories on the UCSF Chimera user J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f interface (GUI) and Discovery Studio Client. 63 The Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method was used to evaluate binding affinities of the predicted allosteric S-protein binders at their target sites.Binding energy profiles for both compounds, inclusive of their energy components, were estimated using 1000 snapshots from the terminal 30ns of MD trajectories where conformational stabilities were visible. This approach was important in order to minimize the effects of conformational disorder or entropy on ligand interactions. The equations below mathematically express binding energy calculations:As shown, internal (∆E int ), electrostatic (∆E ele ) and van der Waals (∆E vdW ) energies sum up the gas-phase energy (∆G gas ) while the solvation free energy (∆G sol ) is defined by the polar solvation (∆G ele,sol ) and non-polar contribution to solvation (∆G np,sol ) terms. The MM/GBSA method was used to estimate the Generalized Born (GB) for ∆G ele,sol while the linear relationship between the surface tension proportionality constant (γ = 0.0072 mol -1 Å -2 ), solvent accessible surface area (SASA, Å 2 ), and β constant was used to solve ∆G np,sol . Furthermore, estimated ∆G bind was decomposed into individual residue energies, most especially those that constitute the predicted allosteric pockets where the ligands were bound. This method was essential to identify specific residues that contribute crucially to the stability and inhibitory activities of potential allosteric inhibitors.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fBased on the study rationale, we set out to identify possible sites for drugging the target protein Table 1 ). The architectures of these pockets are shown in Figure 3 . Furthermore, defining the druggability of a site on target proteins depends on the size (volume) and hydrophobicity (with minimal hydrophilicity) while, on the other hand, high hydrophilicity, reduced hydrophobicity, small pocket size and shallowness characterize ""difficult-to-drug"" and undruggable pockets 61, [65] [66] [67] . While large hydrophilicity could have repulsive effects on ligand mobility at the binding site, a small or shallow cavity would impede ligand access, fitness, optimal binding and stability.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f From Table 2 , Sites 1 → 3 ranks above the 0.83 Halgren Dscore threshold making them suitable for therapeutic targeting. Relatively, Site 1 appears to be highly surface-exposed with a score of 0.933 while a large pocket size and volume for Site 2 could favor the use of large-molecule compounds. Taken together, high surface-exposure coupled with relatively large volumes, hydrophobicity and favorable donor/acceptor properties for Sites 1 and 2 could account for their suitability as targetable allosteric regions on the S-protein other than the RBD (Figure 3 ). These presumptions are also reflected by the estimated Dscore and SiteScore values. In addition, since these predicted sites are highly functional, particularly the overlapping FP, HR1 and CR, targeting them could High-throughput screening and identification of potential allosteric binders to the predicted Sites 1 and 2High-throughput screening using a library of ~1500 FDA approved drug compounds (http://zinc.docking.org/substances/subsets/fda/) were performed against the two predicted allosteric sites. Results for the top 20 compounds with the highest binding scores are presented in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2 for Sites 1 and 2 respectively.From the screening results, overall highest scores were estimated for ZINC3939013 (-10 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f kcal/mol) at Site 1 and ZINC27990463 (-9.3 kcal/mol) at Site 2.As highlighted in our methods, MD simulations were performed for the prefusion S-protein-hACE2 complexes bound distinctly at two potential allosteric sites.This approach was essential to investigate the likely effects of allosteric targeting on the entry/fusion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 via host hACE2. However, this conformation appeared distorted the allosterically-bound S-proteins and could account for displacement motions of the interacting hACE2 from the RBD interface. Therefore, the allosteric-mediated disruption of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD and its interaction with hACE2, as reported herein, is a major finding that could indicate the viability of allosteric targeting in SARS-CoV-2 therapy.Furthermore, we measured structural stabilities across the ligand-protein complexes relative to the unbound system using the RMSD metrics. As shown in Figure 6 , structural instability was highest in the unbound S-protein while its associated hACE2 was relatively stable compared to This could indicate the structural effects of allosteric targeting on the S-protein and its interaction with hACE2. Estimated mean RMSDs, as presented in Table 2 , corroborates conformational variations among the unbound and bound protein complexes.To minimize the effects of structural disorderliness (entropy) in our calculations, we selected, from the MD trajectories, terminal time-frames (270-300ns) from which the systems appeared to relatively stabilize. These were defined as the finally equilibrated (FE) time-frames and were used for subsequent structural analyses ( Table 2 ). From the resulting FE-RMSD plots, unbound S-protein was highly unstable while its associated hACE2 exhibited low structural motion in line with the RMSD calculations, which could also imply that the binding of S-protein stabilized hACE2. In contrast, the allosterically-bound Sproteins (Sites 1 and 2) were notably stable while their corresponding hACE2 showed high structural instability that could correlate with their systemic motions at the S-protein RBD as earlier mentioned. Structural analyses of ligand orientations at the respective allosteric sites of SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein were performed using averaged structures from the MD trajectories ( Figure 9 ). Findings reveal that the allosteric binding of ZINC3939013 (Fosaprepitant) was stabilized at the NTD.Fosaprepitant contains a terminal triphosphate group that orients towards residues such as N99, K187, N188, R190 and H207. Likewise, its trifluoromethyl group oriented towards D102 while constituent -O and -NH groups mediate interactions with Q173 and N121, among others. These altogether could facilitate high-affinity interactions accountable for its stability and allosteric inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV-2 and associated hACE2.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Binding affinities of the compounds were determined using the MM/PBSA technique, which also allowed us to measure the energy contributions of interactive residues at the predicted allosteric sites. Energy calculations, as presented in Table 4 were performed using relatively stable time-frames (270-300ns) to minimize entropical effects that may interfere with ligand binding activities. In addition, we observed that electrostatic effects contributed most notably to the allosteric binding of ZINC3939013 at the NTD region while van der Waals contributions had the highest effect on the binding of ZINC27990463 at the predicted Site 2 pocket. Electrostatic contributions at Site 1 could be due to the high number of electropositive residues that constitute the pocket, as shown in Figure 10 , which may form high-affinity interactions with electronegative moieties of the compound. Calculations further revealed that ∆E vdW and ∆E ele were more favorable in the gas phase for ZINC3939013 while polar solvation energies were more favorable for ZINC27990463 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f at the S2 region of the S-protein. This could imply that while the former was buried in the deep hydrophobic pocket of the NTD, the latter was surface exposed due to its trans-domain binding activity as earlier reported. To understand the mechanistic binding of the compounds at both predicted sites, we decomposed the binding free energies into individual contributions of the interacting residues. These were juxtaposed with structural analysis that showed the type and (π-alkyl) interactions. More so, π-π stacked interaction between Y313 and a benzene ring (of the 4-tri-fluoromethyl-1,1'-biphenyl group) could be highly crucial for the stability of the compound.Taken together, electrostatic energies favored the binding of ZINC3939013 at Site 1 while vdW energies favored ZINC27990463 binding at Site 2, which consequentially, were able to perturb the S-protein RBD and allosterically disrupt hACE2 interactions.The systemic entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host cell is a crucial process that underlies its virulence and pathogenicity in humans and other animals it infects. This mechanism is mediated by its interaction with the host ACE2 (hACE2) via attachment and fusion. Potential intervention approaches in SARS-CoV-2 treatment include therapeutic strategies that could prevent SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding to hACE2. In this study, we implemented an exhaustive approach to identify drug molecules that could potentially bind to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at other sites other than the RBD. Pertinent to the allosteric targeting approach implemented herein J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was the identification of highly druggable sites inherent in the S-protein (S1/S2), which was carried out using multiple pocket prediction algorithms for identification and validation of possible allosteric sites. Predicted pockets were then characterized based on their attributes after which two highly probable pockets were selected. These were then screened distinctly against a library of ~1500 FDA approved drugs retrieved from the ZINC database. Amongst all, Thermophoresis (MST) can be employed for further validation. These implementations will provide additional insights into the targetability and suitability of these pockets for novel COVID-19 therapeutics. Findings from this study paves way for novelty in the structure-based design of high-affinity allosteric inhibitors or disruptors of SARS-CoV-2 association with host hACE2 thereby preventing viral entry.Authors thank the college of health sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa for providing infrastructural support and we also acknowledge the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC), Capetown, South Africa, for providing computational resources.Authors declare no conflict of interest.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","South Africa","first author","2020-10-16",10

The severity and contagion is so high that no continent has been spared its threat. In fact, empirical reports show that over 3.06 million persons have been infected with the virus, while about 210,000 deaths have been reported across regions of the world, including about 57,000, 27,000, 24,000 and 23,000 deaths reported as of April 28, 2020, in the United States, Italy, Spain, and France, respectively (WHO 2020c) .Across countries, several measures have been adopted to contain the spread of the pandemic. As noted in the World Health Organization Interim Guidance for infection prevention and control, it is imperative that member countries strictly adhere to standard precautions for all infected persons, while the establishment of an infection prevention and control focal centre was also recommended, supported by nationwide and facility senior management across countries (WHO 2020a, b) . In fact, these recommended strategies and practices are considered vital for nations to attain the maximum level of effectiveness in response to the COVID-19 plague. Andrea and Giuseppe (2020) posited that the COVID-19 pandemic is manageable in the foreseeable future, but this is only achievable where and if all-inclusive and stringent control measures are taken.The spread of COVID-19 across countries in the sub-Saharan African region seems to have been relatively low compared to the reported cases originating from other regions of the world. In fact, as of April 18, 2020, with the exception of South Africa, no country in the sub-region has yet reached 2000 reported COVID-19 cases since the outbreak in December 2019. Specifically, only Cameroun has reported up to 1000 COVID-19 cases, closely followed by 42 cases reported in the Ivory Coast, 641 in Ghana, 627 in Niger, 557 in Burkina Faso, and 493 in Nigeria (Worldometer 2020) . In all, the total COVID-19 cases across countries in Africa was estimated at 20,706, with countries in sub-Saharan Africa accounting for about 52.9% (910, 947 reported cases) of infected persons despite housing 49 out of the 56 countries (with the exclusion of Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Djibouti, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, and Somalia) on the African continent (Worldometer 2020) .Arguably, the spread of infection in the sub-region can be questioned. In fact, there are unclassified arguments among peoples of the sub-region that either the cases are overreported or the pandemic scarcely exists in the subcontinent. In contrast, it is also argued that COVID-19 cases are being reported in many of the countries in the sub-region. Specifically, Melinda Gates, in her wake-up call to African leaders, lamented that deaths from COVID-19 in the region may escalate out of control unless drastic and immediate measures are taken (Sahara Reporters 2020). Gates maintained that the logical reason for the present lower number of reported cases (13,814) and deaths (747) is the lack of testing kits. She argued that it was often impossible to practice physical distancing in many African towns and slums (Sahara Reporters 2020). Indeed, personal hygiene and physical distancing may be difficult to adhere to not only because of the widespread poverty in many of the sub-Saharan African countries, but also due to the communal way of life in traditional African settings.Indeed, the possibility of underreported cases of COVID-19 is not likely restricted to countries of sub-Saharan Africa; the outcomes of data-driven modeling analysis in China showed a high likelihood that cases of infection were unreported . Evidence from simulated reported cases revealed a significantly larger number of observed versus actual reported cases within a span of 16 days . Closely related to this, Wu et al. (2020) noted that, in defiance of early expectations, the once-assumed epidemic is not only growing steadily and exponentially in many Chinese communities, but has grown into a pandemic across the continents of the world. A retrospective study of the predicted outcomes of COVID-19 infection from a simulated process revealed a significant likelihood of underreported cases of the virus .In agreement with the aforementioned, there is a clear indication that cases of COVID-19 in the sub-Saharan region are underreported, while many cases are surely not reported at all. The high possibility of unreported cases could be argued from the perspective of the ratio of tests carried out to reported cases of infections. The rate of tests per population is generally low across countries of the region-while the ratio was as low as 194 per 1 million population in the Republic of Niger, the ratios were estimated at 60, 35, 29, 22, and 7 persons per 1 million population in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Malawi, and Burundi, respectively (Worldometer 2020) .Evidence from an empirical survey revealed that personal protective equipment, administrative control, and basic healthcare facilities are not only in short supply, but are also of poor quality in the region (WHO 2020b). As noted by Li et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2020) , there is a need for stringent and timely epidemiological approaches in order to restrict the rate at which the virus is spread. Could it be that these measures are being taken as part of daily routine by countries of this region? In fact, virtually all tests in healthcare facilities in the region were carried out on patients that met the suspected case definition as spelled out by the World Health Organization recommendations for COVID-19 testing (WHO 2020a).According to Oleribe et al. (2019) and Doctor et al. (2018) , practically all the sub-Saharan African countries are faced with a shortage of quality human resources, lack of healthcare financing, poor governance, and management lapses. In fact, the healthcare insurance schemes are either not available or are non-functional in many countries of the region, thereby forcing healthcare workers to risk their lives with no assurance of better lives for their loved ones in the event that they die while working to save the lives of others (Kiri and Ojule 2020; Lawumi 2020; Gautier and Ridde 2017; Olugbenga 2017) .In spite of the weak state of healthcare facilities, shortage of well-trained medical professionals, and low level of adherence to physical distancing, the spread of COVID-19, as well as deaths arising from the viral infection, is still relatively low compared to other regions of the world with better healthcare service delivery systems and fewer slums or shanty communities. It is against this backdrop that the current study asks the question: is the low incidence of COVID-19 in the West African sub-region the mitigating effects of the healthcare delivery system or just a matter of time? The study is restricted to the sub-region of West Africa for three reasons. First, the population density of 65 persons per square kilometre makes it the most congested region of Africa (PRB 2019). Also, the life expectancy of 57 years is the lowest across regions in Africa (PRB 2019; WHO 2019). Lastly, the present state of healthcare service delivery is not only poor but is inadequate for the population of the region (Kiri and Ojule 2020; WHO 2019).The six countries with the highest reported cases of COVID-19 infections as on April 15, 2020, were purposefully and specifically selected for the study, although the aggregated trends for the sub-region (West Africa) and the world at large were also investigated. Hence, the specifically selected countries for the study include Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal.According to McLeroy et al. (1988) , socio-ecological theory is a comprehensive approach to behavioural action, and such detailed action is typically influenced by factors on multiple levels. The proponents of the theory maintain that its adaptation must be built on the agreement between the benefactor and the beneficiaries of the proposed action. Therefore, the fundamental aspects of the ecological approach, with the goal of reducing challenges of subjugation, and particularly repression, is the active involvement of the target population in problem classification, selection of targets for change and appropriate intervention, implementation, and appraisal. The sociological model according to McLeroy et al. (1988) is segmented into five classes, including intrapersonal factors, interpersonal processes, institutional or organizational factors, community factors, and public policy.Our study is supported by the socio-ecological theory. The theory is found relevant since it explains the effect of environmental dynamics on human behaviour, with the primary aim of identifying environmental interference to addressing the phenomenon or subject matter. In the context of preventing and minimizing the spread of COVID-19 in the sub-region of West Africa, it is recommended that governments, stakeholders, and the entire population at large adopt measures that will enable then to become immersed in the immediate environment-while personal hygiene such as regular washing of hands and wearing of masks covering the nose and mouth are encouraged, social and physical distancing is also encouraged-with the governments expected to provide extra support for improving, expanding, and making healthcare facilities accessible for testing (WHO 2020d) .Also, the willingness and the extent to which the recommended measures were adhered to across the West African sub-region is strongly dependent on the ability of the governments to provide the needed COVID-19 test kits across strategically well-equipped healthcare facilities, as well as the provision of palliatives in the form of food, energy, drugs, and other basic necessities, especially to those in dire need of them. Also, the existence of functional or establishment of viable social and health insurance schemes is needed, as this will encourage healthcare workers and others who are directly involved in containing the spread of the virus to willingly perform their assigned duties.Deductively, the extent to which the governments of nations in the West African sub-region are able to provide palliatives that will compel their nationals to totally comply with the pronounced lockdown in some communities, provide the population with a regular and accessible supply of face masks, equip healthcare facilities with COVID-19 test kits and ventilators, and provide or implement social and healthcare insurance, will determine how well the region is prepared to contain the spread of the virus in case the unexpected arises. Hence, there is no doubt that the socio-ecological model provides insight into a theoretical approach to tie the rate at which the infection is spread to the state of healthcare service delivery and socio-ecological factors preventing the population from totally complying with the recommended interim guideline issued by the World Health Organization.The study adopted a cross-sectional time series method. Secondary data were sourced from the World Health Organization COVID-19 databank. Data including daily reports on the total reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the number of related patient deaths were extracted for Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal over the time span covered in this study. The extracted data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and later exported to Stata analysis software. The incidence growth rate for the total number of reported cases was generated from two consecutive intervals (weekly), with the former retrieved data adopted as the base value (denominator) for the specified total reported cases of infection, while the latter was used as the numerator value. Also, the death rate was generated by adopting the former retrieved total death data for each of the specified time intervals (weekly) for specified dates as the base value (denominator), and the latter retrieved data was adopted as the numerator value. Descriptive (figures) and inferential (linear regression, correlation) analytic techniques were adopted to analyse the trend variations, cause-effect association, and strength of the relationship. Stata version 14 software was employed.Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 show the trends in the percentage increase in the rate of reported cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Republic of Niger, West Africa, and the world, respectively. The results show that the growth patterns for Burkina Faso and globally followed the same pattern of growth. Although there are increases in reported cases, a decline in growth across intervals is found, as presented in Figs. 1 and 8, respectively. In contrast, the prevalence rates for Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Niger Republic, and West Africa as presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 generally follow the same patterns; fluctuations in growth patterns were recorded in these four countries, as well as in the West African sub-region.For instance, reported cases of COVID-19 for Burkina Faso as captured in Fig. 1 showed a drop in the infection rate from the initial recorded growth of 2300% in (Tn+1) to 202.6% in (Tn+2) and a further decline to a growth rate of 106.9% in (Tn+3). The infection rate subsequently dropped to 46% in (Tn+4), and further declined to 30% by the end of (Tn+5). For the Ivory Coast, as reported in Fig. 2 , the incidence growth rate of COVID-19 indicated that the reported cases initially increased from 200% in (Tn+1) to 1445.6% in (Tn+2), and subsequently dropped to 75% in (Tn+4). Also, the results indicated that the growth rate for the reported incidence of COVID-19 in the country increased to 125.7% in (Tn+4) and then dropped to 53.2% in (Tn+5).The results as captured in Fig. 3 indicate that the prevalence of reported COVID-19 for Senegal dropped from an initial growth rate of 166.7% recorded in (Tn+1) to 112.5% in (Tn+2). A further drop to 84% was recorded in (Tn+3) and a subsequent decline to 26% in (Tn+4). However, the consistent declining growth rate pattern for the country over time was reversed in (Tn+5), which showed an increase of 32%. The results for Nigeria as captured in Fig. 4 indicate that the country's reported cases of COVID-19 grew by 1000% in (Tn+1). Although the growth rate dropped to 195.5% in (Tn+2), an upward trend of 223.1% was reported in (Tn+3), followed by a decline to 54.1% in (Tn+3). This decline in (Tn+4) was followed by an upward trend to 97.2% by the end of (Tn+5).The growth rate for reported cases of COVID-19 for Ghana is nearly the same as that for Nigeria. The results as captured in Fig. 5 indicate a growth rate of 1850% in (Tn+1), which subsequently dropped to 621.1% in (Tn+2). The results indicate a sporadic decline-this was estimated at 49.6% in (Tn+ 3). Conversely, the country experienced a sharp increase in the rate of reported cases, which stood at 99% in (Tn+4). A further increase in reported cases in Ghana, to 155.4%, was then seen in (Tn+5). The growth rates for reported cases of COVID-19 for Niger Republic, as captured in Fig. 6 , indicate a 0% growth rate in both (Tn+1) and (Tn+2). However, this was followed by an increase of 1340% in (Tn+3), a subsequent drop to 241% in (Tn+4), and a further decline to 32% in (Tn+5).The cumulative results across countries of the West African region as captured in Fig. 7 indicate an increase of 303.1% in cases of COVID-19 in (Tn+1), followed by a decrease to 117.9% growth of reported cases recorded in (Tn+2). The growth rate in reported cases of infection then increased to 177.5% for the region in (Tn+3), and declined to 92.6% in (Tn+4). The growth rate in reported cases of COVID-19 in West Africa was 72.4% in (Tn+5). Globally, the pattern of growth in the incidence of COVID-19 as reported from (Tn+ 1) 1 to (Tn+5) showed a downward slope. The results as captured in Fig. 8 indicate that the growth rate rose to 303.1% in (Tn+1) and dropped to 117.3% in (Tn+2). Similarly, a growth rate of 78.6% was reported in (Tn+3) and 49.6% in (Tn+4). The global rate of growth for the pandemic was 41.7% in (Tn+ 5).The trend in deaths arising from COVID-19 infection was very similar for Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Ghana, Niger Republic, and West Africa. This is captured in Figs. 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. The trend in reported deaths for the Ivory Coast and Senegal followed the same pattern, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 , respectively. However, the global trend in deaths from COVID-19 differed, and is shown in Fig. 16 .As indicated in Fig. 9 , the growth rate for deaths arising from COVID-19 in Burkina Faso increased from 0% in (Td+ 2) to 3400% in (Td+3). No deaths (0%) due to COVID-19 infection were reported in (Td+1) or (Td+2) in Burkina Faso. The results also show that the growth in the country's death rate dropped to 36.7% in (Td+4), but then increased to 89.5% in (Td+5). The results for Ivory Coast as captured in Fig. 10 show that the death rate increased from 0% in (Td+3) to 4100% in (Td+4); no deaths were reported in (Td+1), (Td+ 2), or (Td+3). An increase in deaths of 5125% was reported in (Td+5) as a result of the spread of the pandemic in the Ivory Coast. Figure 11 shows that for Senegal, there was a 0% growth rate in deaths arising from COVID-19 infection in (Td+1), (Td+2), and (Td+3). Recorded deaths due to COVID-19 complications for the country increased from 0% in (Td+4) to 50% in (Td+5). The results for Nigeria as captured in Fig indicate that the death rate increased from 0% in (Td+2) to 3300% in (Td+3). The earlier pattern showed 0% growth in deaths as a result of the infection in (Td+1) and (Td+2). However, the death rate was estimated at 110% in (Td+5).Results for Ghana as captured in Fig. 13 show that a 0% rate in deaths related to COVID-19 infection was recorded in the country in (Td+1) and (Td+2). A 25% increase in the death rate was reported in (Td+3.). The rate increased to 60% in (Td+4) and subsequently dropped to 12.5% in (Td+5.). As captured in Fig. 14 , the rate of deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Niger was 0% in (Td+1) and (Td+2). The rate increased to 3700% in (Td+3) but subsequently dropped to 37.5% in (Td+4). The rate rose to 81.8% for the country in (Td+5).The pattern of deaths for West Africa showed an initial upward movement from 0% in (Td+1) to 566.7% in (Td+2), as captured in Fig. 15 . Deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic then dropped to 135% for the sub-region in (Td+ 3) and further declined to 57.4% in (Td+4), but subsequently increased to 135.1% in (Td+5). The global rate of deaths arising from the pandemic dropped from 1405.1% in (Td+1) 2 to 133.8% in (Td+2), as captured in Fig. 16 . This was followed by a further decline in reported COVID-19-related deaths to 110% and 68.8% in (Td+3) and (Td+4), respectively. The rate then dropped from 68.8% in (Td+4) to 55.7% in (Td+5). Table 1 presents the results of the analysis of the association between the incidence of COVID-19 infection and deaths arising from its complications across the studied countries and regions. The results show that complications of COVID-19 infection accounted for 92.3%, 97.8%, 90.3%, 65%, 90.4%, and 93.6% of patient deaths in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Niger Republic, and Ivory Coast, respectively. Also, the pandemic accounted for 97% and 98.9% of complications leading to the death of patients in the sub-region of West Africa and the world at large. The results further reveal that the increase in deaths arising from COVID-19 complications is positively and strongly associated. Evidence from the study as presented in Table 1 showed a strong positive linear association between COVID-19 incidence and deaths arising from its complications among patients in Burkina Faso (r = 0.968), Nigeria (r = 0.978), Senegal (r = 0.961), Ghana (r = 0.849), Niger (r = 0.849), and Ivory Coast (r = 0.974). Likewise, a strong positive linear association was found between the spread of COVID-19 and an increase in deaths related to its complications among patients in the West African sub-region (r = 0.988) and the world at large (r = 0.996).Correspondingly, the results consistently showed a significant association between the spread of COVID-19 and deaths arising from its complications among patients in the studied countries and regions, including Burkina Faso (ß = 0.059; t = 7.74; p < 0.01), Nigeria (ß = 0.034; t = 14.95; p < 0.001), Senegal (ß = 0.009; t = 6.90; p < 0.01), Ghana (ß = 0.008; t = 2 Note: (Td+1) denotes percentage increase in deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic from March 15 through March 22, 2020; (Td+2) denotes the percentage from March 22 through March 29, 2020; (Td+3) denotes the percentage from March 29 through April 5, 2020; (Td+4) denotes the percentage from April 5 through April 12, 2020; and (Td+5) denotes the percentage from April 12 through April 19, 2020. This study comprehensively investigated the trends in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Republic of Niger. The study also describes the spread of COVID-19 in the West African sub-region as a whole and the world at large. Trends in deaths arising from COVID-19 infection among patients are also described in the study. Moreover, the study establishes a link between the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in deaths arising from the spread of the infection. Our study shows that the spread of COVID-19 in the subregion of West Africa increased gradually. For instance, we observed that the rate of spread varied across the six countries encompassing West Africa; nevertheless, all the countries recorded growth in reported cases within the time frame covered in the study.In Burkina Faso, the spread of the virus peaked in Tn+1 (2300%), while the lowest growth rate of 30% was reported in Tn+2. The growth trend in Nigeria followed the same pattern. However, while the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases was recorded in Tn+1 (1000%), the lowest growth in the spread of the infection was reported in Tn+4 (54.1%). Our findings for the situation in Senegal showed that the highest spread in the country was reported in Tn+1 (166.7%), while the lowest reported case spread was recorded in Tn+4 (26%). We observed that the growth in the spread of COVID-19 in the Ivory Coast peaked in Tn+2 (1445.6%) and was lowest in Tn+5 (53.2%). Our findings further showed that in Ghana, the highest growth in COVID-19 incidence was recorded in Tn+1 (1850%), while the lowest growth rate was reported in Tn+3 (49.6%). In contrast to Ghana, in the Republic of Niger we observed that the lowest COVID-19 pandemic growth rate was recorded in Tn+5 (32%), while the growth rate peaked in Tn+3 (1340%). Collectively, the growth rate in West Africa was highest in Tn+1 (303.1%), while the lowest growth in the sub-region was observed in Tn+5 (72.4%). We found that the Evidence from our study showed a continuous decline in the growth rate of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, while the reverse was observed in the sub-region of West Africa. Thus, our findings showed a fluctuating trend in the spread of the infection in West Africa. Specifically, the trends of growth rates in the spread of COVID-19 for Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Niger Republic, and Ivory Coast vary over the period of the study. Hence, it must be deduced from our findings that the lower cases of COVID-19 infection reported in West Africa as at April 19, 2020, could not be attributed to the existence of a better, functional, and improved healthcare service delivery compared to that obtainable in the developed regions of the world. Based on our findings, if the healthcare service had been the major factor for a lower number of deaths in the region compared to the alarming global figure, the growth rate should also be declining rather than the rise witnessed in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Niger Republic, Burkina Faso, and the subregion of West Africa as a whole.In fact, the lower number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in West Africa could also be attributable to the lower number of tests that have been carried out so far, which agrees with the prediction by Melinda Gates as reported by Sahara Reporters on April 14, 2020. Our assertion is supported by the fact that as of April 19, 2020, a total of 35, 131, 195, and 510 COVID-19 tests per million population had been carried out in Niger, Nigeria, Gambia, and Togo, respectively (Worldometer 2020) . Moreover, evidence from contemporary studies indicates that the state of healthcare service delivery in the sub-Saharan African region is characterised by poor funding, shortage of modern sophisticated healthcare equipment, poor or absent healthcare insurance schemes, shortage of well-trained healthcare personnel, and poor implementation of healthcare policies (Azevedo 2017; Doctor et al. 2018; Kiri and Ojule 2020; Lawumi 2020; Oleribe et al. 2019; WHO 2020a) .We observed from our study that globally, the trends in deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has been steadily declining. Growth in deaths among COVID-19 patients peaked in Td+1 (1405.1%), while the lowest growth rate in deaths was reported in Td+5 (55.7%). Unlike the trend in deaths arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in the world at large, we observed a rise and fall in COVID-19-related deaths among patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Niger Republic, and in the region of West Africa. For instance, we observed that the death rate growth in West Africa peaked in Td+2 (566.7%) and was lowest in Td+4 (57.4%). Specifically, we observed that the growth in deaths arising from COVID-19 complications among patients in Ghana peaked in Td+1 (60%), while the lowest growth in deaths was reported in Td+3 (25%). Also, we discovered that growth rates in deaths arising from COVID-19 infection among patients in Niger peaked in Td+ 3 (700%), while the lowest growth rate in deaths was witnessed in Td+4 (37.5%).Our findings showed that deaths arising from COVID-19 infection peaked among patients in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast in Td+3 (3400%) and Td+5 (5125%), while the lowest growth in the rate of deaths arising from the pandemic was reported in Td+4 (36.7%) and Td+4 (4100%), respectively. In Nigeria, the death rate peaked in Td+3 (300%), and the lowest rate was recorded in Td+5 (110%). Likewise, the death rate in Senegal peaked in Td+5 (50%). Evidence from our study showed that the growth rate of deaths arising from COVID-19 complications has been steadily declining globally. However, the reverse was the case for death growth rates for Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Niger Republic, and West Africa.Our findings, therefore, suggest that if the relatively lower incidence of growth in the reported cases of COVID-19 in West Africa is as a result of the availability of an improved or functional healthcare delivery system, the number of deaths across covered countries and of the region as a whole should have declined gradually rather than the present gradually increasing rate of deaths that are being recorded. Based on our findings, it is possible that cases of COVID-19 are being significantly underreported or not reported at all. This could be due largely to the poor healthcare delivery system in many of the regional countries.In fact, our findings consistently showed the existence of a significant association between increased rates of reported cases of COVID-19 and an increase in the rate of deaths associated with complications arising from the disease. Our findings are supported by Zhao et al. (2020) , who posited that cases of COVID-19 were being underreported in China. Also, our observation that it is possible that COVID-19 cases in West Africa have been significantly underreported as a result of the poor state of healthcare service delivery in the region was corroborated by Wu et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2020) , who argued that the absence of substantial public health interventions could bring about an unanticipated spread of the virus outside China.The threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be low in many countries in West Africa and sub-Saharan Africa in comparison to what is being witnessed in other regions of the world. This study demonstrated in detail that the present situation in the region may not be as a result of the availability and accessibility of functional or improved healthcare facilities for nationals in the region. Therefore, the reason for the current slower trends in terms of growth rates of reported cases or deaths could be a result of lack of test kits, underreported cases, and the like. In fact, it is unlikely that many of the governments in this region could provide their nationals with adequate palliatives that are needed at this trying time. Hence, the study concludes that time will eventually tell whether the region is prepared for the challenges that may arise from the pandemic should it spiral out of control. Certainly, there is a need for the nations of the region to be fully prepared to execute measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the observed pattern of increased incidence of COVID-19 and the increase in the proportion of recorded deaths over the time covered in this study, the authors recommend that the lockdown measures undertaken by governments in the region be fully implemented. Also, in order to achieve total compliance with lockdown, regional governments should provide their nationals with palliatives in the form of food, drugs, preventive supplies (face masks, hand sanitizers), potable water, and other basic necessities of life. Healthcare service delivery should be made available and at no cost to the public. In fact, the governments, and in collaboration with richer and developed countries, should work Note: *Significant at p < 0.05, **significant at p < 0.01, ***significant at p < 0.001; R 0 = adjusted r 2 ; r = correlation coefficients; ß = regression coefficient; T n1_n6 = total cases reported for March 15, 2020 ( n1 ), March 22, 2020 ( n2 ), March 29, 2020 ( n3 ), April 5, 2020 ( n4 ), April 12, 2020 ( n5 ) and April 19, 2020 ( n6 ); T d1_d6 = total deaths reported for March 15, 2020 ( d1 ), March 22, 2020 ( d2 ), March 29, 2020 ( d3 ), April 5, 2020 ( d4 ), April 12, ( d5 ) and April 19, 2020 respectively towards covering a wider range of the population. Hence, there is a need to carry out more testing. There is a need to set up more quarantine centers, especially in high-risk areas. Equally, additional intensive-care units should be established along with the required healthcare equipment such as ventilators, immunity-boosting drugs and the like. Moreover, medical professional support should be sought from countries with a high COVID-19 recovery rate. Hence, there is an urgent need to seek medical support from Germany, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Austria, Iceland, Iran, Thailand, and China. Finally, huge spending on healthcare service delivery and research, particularly in health science and technology, is critical, along with the establishment of functional and well-funded social and healthcare insurance schemes.","Ghana","abstract","2020-10-17",10

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a singlestranded positive-sense RNA containing approximately 30 000 base pairs (bps). 1 CoVs are involved in many diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system in humans and animals. 1 Two groups of proteins characterize CoVs: structural proteins, including Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), [2] [3] [4] and nonstructural proteins, such as proteases (nsp3 and nsp5) and RdRp (nsp12). 5, 6 The CoV S glycoprotein is a precursor protein composed of 1300 amino acids, located on the outer envelope of the virion. It plays an essential role in the attachment, fusion, and entry of the virus into the host cells. Particularly, S protein mediates the fusion of the viral and the cellular membranes 7 by binding to different surface receptors of the host cells via its receptor-binding domain (RBD). The transmembrane (S) spike trimeric glycoprotein of the virus consists of 2 functional subunits: S1 and S2. The first, which made up of 4 domains (S1 A, S1 B, S1 C, and S1 D), contributes to the attachment of the virus to the host cell receptor. Then, S2 coordinates the fusion of the 2 membranes. 8 This fusion activates proteases and allows the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. 9 The latter causes conformational changes to prime the S2 subunit for the fusion of viral and cell membranes. 8 Thus, RBD is the key component by which the virus is translocated inside the cells through its interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), 10, 11 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and or glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78). 12 The SARS-CoV-2 RBD contains 13 disulfide bonds that correspond to 13 cyclic regions considered to be similar to the cyclic form of Pep42. 13 These regions can interact with the GRP78 cell surface.The GRP78 or binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is a member of the heat shock protein family. 14 It is traditionally regarded as a major chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that facilitate protein folding and assembly, protein quality control, Ca 2+ binding, and regulating ER stress signaling. 15 When GRP78 moves to the surface of the cell, it can interact with many ligands or other proteins like a multifunctional receptor. It is therefore involved in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [16] [17] [18] and overexpressed in various human cancers, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. [19] [20] [21] In addition to its role in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of many cancer cells, GRP78 also has a sensitivity to the recognition of viruses through its substrate-binding domain (SBD) 6 and is involved in the assembly of their envelope proteins. [22] [23] [24] [25] Recently, GRP78 has been recognized as an attachment factor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which improves the entry of the virus in the presence of DPP4, 12 and as one of the SARS-CoV entry receptors in the human cell. 1 Most research carried out, or measures taken, are reposed on the idea that ACE2 is the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2. 10, 11 Providing GRP78 as a second receptor in the presence of special physiological conditions when the expression of GRP78 is high, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] this could potentially be more favorable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the presence of ACE2 and GRP78 at a high quantity could classify these additional categories to very high-risk types. As there are no efficacy tools to fight against this disease, it is therefore essential to find out how to protect persons with chronic illnesses (cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure). These people are at greater risk of developing an aggressive form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Betacoronavirus 5,26 which also causes a severe respiratory tract infection with a higher mortality rate. 12, 27 Sequence and structure analysis of S proteins from different CoV strains showed that the specificity of interaction between S proteins and their receptors is the main determinant of the host tropism of these viruses. 28 The main cellular receptors for viral S proteins include ACE2 and DPP4, as well as other molecules that may be involved in the interaction between the virus and the host cell. 29, 30 It has been suggested that GRP78 may also act as another receptor that assists SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the host cells. 13 This same proposition has confirmed by Aguiar et al, 31 who concluded that the GRP78-binding site overlaps with the ACE2-binding site, although the residues involved in the interactions may be a little different. For this purpose, a targeted analysis of the expression of candidate genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed the presence of the GRP78 protein in vitro in epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract and lung tissue. 31 This analysis suggests that for ACE2 to be an integral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, there are probably other mechanisms dynamically regulating the expression of ACE2 in the respiratory mucosa in the context of infection with SARS-CoV-2 32 and/or possibly other co-receptors. These can contribute to the functioning of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the binding and fusion of SARS-CoV-2 in this cell type. 31 In the same context, Palmeira et al 33 have verified that the level of expression of the GRP78 gene is high in the blood of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.The entry of the virus is a key step that can be targeted by a possible therapeutic strategy opting for the prediction of a molecule capable of causing simultaneous inhibition of the 2 proteins. 34, 35 Based on the knowledge gained about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 2 axes of investigation were explored in this study to prevent the translocation of the virus inside host cells. The first was the inhibition of GRP78 recognition by SARS-CoV-2, by targeting both the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and SBD of GRP78 with ATP-competitive small molecules and/or peptides. The second consisted of the inhibition of the viral S protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the GRP78-binding site. Finally, we identified 9 compounds that could act as potential blockers of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through GRP78 for further consideration as possible therapies against this virus.A library of 100 active phytochemicals (polyphenols) [36] [37] [38] [39] was generated from PubChem database (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov). Biologically active peptides were obtained from the Structurally Annotated Therapeutic Peptides Database (SATPdb) (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1114).Two binding domains characterize the structure of GRP78. The first is the NBD that houses ATP, whereas the second (SBD) receives the substrate (peptide or protein) in the form of an excluded segment or partially folded protein. 40 The inhibition of the ATP-binding site interrupts the functional cycle of the protein by modifying its conformation, which may lead to the inhibition of viral penetration.ATP docking was conducted on GRP78 (PDB ID:5F1X) structure to identify the key residues of its ATPase site. 41 The residues (ASP-34, THR-38, TYR-39, ILE-61, GLU-201, ASP-224, PHE-258, GLY-228, GLY-249, ASP-250, GLY-364, SER-365, ILE-368, and ASP-391) were used as references for the search space determination. Similarly, it was considered advisable to prevent the Spike from being attached to the GRP78 by directly targeting their interaction site. The GRP78 residues involved in Spike binding are Ile-426, Thr-428, Val-429, Val-432, Thr-434, Phe-451, Ser-452, Val-457, and Ile-459 as was previously described. 14 According to the study by Ibrahim et al, 13 GRP78 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in 4 regions, in which regions III Allam et al 3 (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) showed stronger affinities for the Spike. Consequently, it was proposed in our study to target these 2 regions to prevent any possibility of Spike binding to the GRP78 receptor.Structures of the GRP78 (PDB ID: 5E84) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike (PDB ID: 6LZG) were downloaded from the RCSB PDB database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home.do) in PDB format. The small-molecule SDF files (molecule.sdf ) downloaded in the previous step were converted to PDB format using Open Babel. 42 All inhibitors and receptors have been optimized and converted to PDBQT format using the standard protocol of the Autodock Tools. 43 Molecular docking of small molecules (ATP and inhibitors) was performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. Docking of ATP on GRP78 was conducted to determine the key residues of its ATPase site. Docking search space was defined on each targeted site of GRP78 and Spike proteins as explained previously. The ClusPro server 44, 45 was used for peptide-protein docking of the selected peptides. The resulting peptide-protein complexes were ranked by cluster size and visual inspection. Small molecules and peptides were selected for each protein site based on their estimated binding energy and the protein residues with which they are to interact.Visual analysis of docking poses and image rendering was performed using PyMOL version 2.3 (Schrodinger, LLC).The global burden of infections and the rapid spread of viral diseases point to the need for new preventive approaches and more effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, particular priority is being given to the emerging SARS-CoV-2, which is considered a pandemic under current circumstances. In this direction, our study focused on the repositioning of approved drugs as well as the investigation of other bioactive compounds that may prevent the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by targeting the region of GRP78 that is required for the interaction with the Spike protein of the virus. Two factors have guided our compound selection process. The first is the identification of peptides that can block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and GRP78, and the second is the screening of small molecules suitable for docking inside GRP78's ATP-binding pocket to inhibit its activity and thus its interaction with the Spike.The effect of the selected phytochemicals and peptides on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and GRP78 was elucidated by molecular docking analysis. The promising candidates were selected based on their binding mode and affinity against the 2 targets.Peptide-protein docking performed between the peptides and their designated targets. The peptides docked against the Spike protein and its binding sites in GRP78. Results from their binding modes analysis were favorable, indicating that the selected compounds could potentially inhibit or prevent the entry of the virus. The sequences of the selected peptides are presented in Table 1 .The peptide satpdb18674 selected to target the Spike protein was mainly bound to region IV (C480-C488), whereas satpdb12488 and satpdb28899 showed more affinity to region III (C391-C525) ( Figure 1 ). Thus, this could directly interfere with the Spike/GRP78 interaction as both regions are necessary for the Spike to recognize the GRP78.Peptides reported as inhibitors of GRP78 (satpdb18674, satpdb18446, satpdb12488, satpdb14438, and satpdb28899) were mainly bound to the region I426-I459 ( Figure 2 ). This region of GRP78 appears to be critical for the Spike to attach to the host cell.These results revealed that the peptides satpdb18674, sat-pdb12488, and satpdb28899 had strong affinities simultaneously with the Spike and with both regions of GRP78 (regions III and IV). We therefore hypothesize that these peptides can prevent the entry of the virus by binding either to regions III and IV of the Spike or to their binding site in GRP78.The peptide satpdb18674 was particularly bound to the key residues ( Figure 3 ) at the GRP78 target site (VAL-429, Analysis of the molecular interactions of the peptides stabilizes the target protein by interacting with the residues of their different binding pockets. Several hydrogen bonds have been observed, ensuring strong bonds with the spike binding site residues (regions III and IV) and with those of GRP78. The residues (ILE-13, SER-12, and THR-9) of satpdb14438 interacted with GRP78 residues THR-434, VAL-429, and THR-458. Finally, the peptide satpdb28899 residues ASP-20, LEU-19, SER-16, and THR-15 interacted with VAL-429 and THR-458 from the same region. The 5 compounds established multiple hydrogen bonds with the residues of the GRP78 substrate-binding pocket. Interactions with V429 and S452 were observed in the 5 peptides, except for satpdb28899 (V429 only). satpdb12488, satpdb14438, and satpdb18446 interacted with THR-434; satpdb14438 and satpdb28899 interacted with GLN-449; satpdb14438 and satpdb28899 interacted with THR-458; and satpdb12488 interacted with LYS-447 and PHE-451. GRP indicates glucose-regulating protein. Table 2 illustrates the details of the interactions between the proteins and peptides selected.The screening of polyphenols was performed against the Spike protein, its binding site in GRP78, and the ATPase domain of GRP78. Postdocking analysis showed favorable binding modes, indicating that the compounds epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), homoeriodictyol, isorhamnetin, and curcumin could bind simultaneously to the 3 sites.The 4 polyphenols have established multiple hydrogen bonds with the residues of the GRP78 pocket ( Figure 4) . Also, these compounds showed high affinity toward the regions III and IV of the Spike protein ( Figure 5 ). The docking results of the compounds EGCG, homoeriodictyol, isorhamnetin, and curcumin in the ATP-binding site of GRP78 showed their favorable positioning inside the receptor's cavity, mimicking ATP in its mode of interaction with the ATPase domain of GRP78 ( Figure 6 ) with binding affinities higher than or close to that of ATP. Therefore, these compounds could potentially interfere with the virus entry to the host cells. Finally, as CoVs acquire the ability to bind to multiple receptors, and cross the interspecies barrier, this work could provide new insights in the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections.The set of interactions between the small molecules and the active sites of the 2 targets (ATPase domain, GRP78/spike interaction sites) is summarized in Table 3 . The best affinity was attributed to EGCG at all the interaction sites. Binding to EGCG regularly folds the protein while ATP binding unfolds the protein. A slightly unfolded form is the native functional form of GRP78. Thus, due to the link of the EGCG and the movements with SBD, GRP78 will not be able to perform its appropriate functions given the changes in conformation. This may be one of the likely mechanisms by which the EGCG inhibitor acts on the full-length GRP78 protein. The several researches show that polyphenols as an antiviral and antiinflammatory agent that can be helpful for both prevention and treatment of new emerging CoV. 46 However, well-designed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the potential efficacy of curcumin against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its ensuing complications. 47 Current drugs have limited efficacy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, given the high number of deaths caused by this virus. Designing new drugs that target specific activities of this virus or stop the stages of its infection cycle is a crucial step. Due to the diverse behavior of SARS-CoV-2 depending on the population type, the production of an appropriate vaccine against this disease is difficult, hence the need for new therapeutic strategies, 48 proposing compounds affecting different stages of the virus's life cycle, and strategies that target the entry of the virus on the ACE2 side and others on the SARS protease side. 49 Our study will complement these strategies by targeting the different sites involved in the SARS/GRP78 interaction (Figure 7) . The neglect of the latter causes a high risk of infections. The set of molecules (4 polyphenols and 5 bioactive peptide) was selected in this study to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/GRP78 interaction. Satpdb18674 and EGCG gave the best results for all the targeted sites for the 2 proteins. Our results, therefore, meet an urgent need, given the absence of an effective drug available. As demonstrated in this combined approach, screening and reassigning bioactive molecules to prevent the entry of this virus on the Spike/GRP78 side can provide an accelerated approach to identify and develop new treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.Inhibition of the interaction between the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 and the receptor by blocking the GRP78 is a strategy interesting to identify drugs that decrease the rate of viral infection. 13 Several studies have given confirmatory evidence to the presence of the GRP78 protein in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. [31] [32] [33] In addition, GRP78 is part of receptors that allow the virus to enter and facilitate the initial infection of host cells, 31 the reason why it has become a molecular target to treat COVID-19. These results, as well as those of the aforementioned studies, allow us to suppose that the GRP78 protein could be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and to propose molecules capable of hindering this interaction. Reducing the level of expression or inhibition of GRP78 by small interfering RNAs or by siRNAs, respectively, blocked the entry of Japanese encephalitis virus 50 replication. 51 A study recently showed by virtual screening that there are molecules that can in silico inhibit the GRP78 protein and prevent virus binding. 33 Interestingly, our results also suggest a compound capable to simultaneously inhibit the 3 binding sites that allow entry of SARS-CoV-2 via GRP78. The peptides proposed in this work targets 2 regions of the S protein (III and IV) and 1 of GRP78. This interaction could interfere with or competitively bind to the S protein S sites of SARS-CoV and GRP78. These results suggest a novel inhibitor mechanism distinct from the anti-SARS-CoV peptide that could disrupt the virus-host cell interaction. We propose, therefore, to combine 2 or 3 of these peptides before or after infection with the virus.Inhibition of ATPase activity of the GRP78 NBD 52 is another potential inhibitory mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have previously reported that after competitive inhibition at the ATP-binding site of GRP78, the SBD of the latter adopts a conformation having a low affinity for the substrates, thus blocking their transport. 53 Binding of various inhibitors to the ATP-binding site established by crystallographic studies 54 allows altering the function of GRP78 and, therefore, theoretically avoids infection with SARS-CoV-2.Pretreatment of GRP78 with the small molecule EGCG inhibited the Ebola virus infection, 51 what supports our results obtained where EGCG is suggested to have an inhibitory effect on GRP78 with high affinity (-10.5 kcal/mol). Interestingly, a recent study showed by molecular docking that certain natural products (estrogen and phytoestrogens) could interfere with the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to stressed cells. 55 As for the natural products (EGCG, homoeriodictyol, isorhamnetin, and curcumin) selected in our study, they could also interfere with this attachment.There are several proofs on the antiviral potential of herbal compounds. 56 Pharmacological investigations have revealed many pharmacological activities for certain phytochemicals as the EGCG, and Curcumin. Reducing the charge and inhibiting the expression of viral core proteins are the main effects of polyphenols. 57, 58 These effects are of great interest for the development of synthetic drugs against SARS-CoV-2-specific polyphenols. The inhibitory effect of curcumin on SARS-CoV replication has been demonstrated by Wen et al 59 . Likewise, the impact of curcumin on cells before or after a viral infection reach the infectivity of certain viruses. 60 Recently, mooring studies revealed that curcumin could potentially inhibit ACE2 to remove COVID-19 entry in the cell (potential effect). These results and that shown in our work are proof that confirms the potential role of curcumin as a promising antiviral agent.GRP78 has a strong affinity for hydrophilic or hydrophobic regions, such as those of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. 13 As GRP78 can act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, 61,62 compounds with a high affinity could hinder this interaction, by competing molecules have established at least 6 hydrogen bonds with these residues in GRP78. The best affinity was attributed to EGCG (-10.2 kcal/mol), higher than that of ATP (-9.6 kcal/mol). All molecules interact through hydrogen bonds with Gly-228, Phe-258, Asp-224 residues; EGCG established 3 other H bonds with Gly-364, Ser-365, and Ile-368. Homoeriodictyol, isorhamnetin, and curcumine interact through hydrophobic bonds with Thr-38 and Thr-39. EGCG indicates epigallocatechin gallate; GRP78, glucose-regulating protein 78. with the viral spike 55 ; this specificity increases the probability of the compounds selected in our study to rival with the Spike and GRP78, thus preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting infection.Drug repositioning is an effective and rapid strategy for providing therapeutic solutions to COVID-19. In silico approaches can be very useful in identifying new indications for approved drugs whose pharmacokinetic data are already known, allowing them to move rapidly to the final phases of clinical trials.In this work, we identified 4 phytochemicals (polyphenols) that could potentially inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with GRP78, in addition to 5 peptides (sat-pdb18674, satpdb18446, satpdb12488, satpdb14438, and sat-pdb28899) that target simultaneously the Spike protein and its binding region in GRP78. The satpdb18674 and EGCG gave the best results for all of the targeted sites for the 2 proteins. As these results appear very promising, further bioassays are needed to confirm the inhibitory activity of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Figure 7 .

As of February 11, 2020, the epidemic registered 42 708 cases in China and spread to 25 countries that reported a total of 395 cases. All continents have now reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on February 14, 2020. Because China is one of Africa's leading commercial partner; it is believed that the large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus could reach the continent would have promoted the propagation of the virus in the continent. Yet, at the same date only 03 African countries were infected (Gilbert et al., 2020) .Many studies have been undertaken to analyze the early dynamics of the COVID-19 transmission in almost all continents (e.g., Li et al 2020 , Pongkitivanichkul et al 2020 , Shim et al 2020 . However, little attention has been given to the situation of African countries. This is perhaps due to the slow transmission rate of the epidemic observed in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa to date. Indeed, the initial cases of COVID-19 were identified in most West African countries (particularly, Cameroon, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria) between late February and early March of 2020. But it is only after March 15, 2020 that the number of cases started rising significantly to reach nearly 165,000 cases in these four countries as of September 13, 2020. Nonetheless, nearly 5 months after the effective onset of the pandemic in West Africa, it seems useful to analyze and understand the characteristics of this epidemic in the context of this region in order to envisage appropriate steps.The purpose of this paper is therefore to fill this gap by providing a data-driven analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa. We combine models of mathematical epidemiology and statistical modeling to estimate the main disease transmission characteristics in four major West African countries using publicly available data. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to provide statistical estimates of the dynamics of this epidemic in this region, with the aim of providing insights to the discussion related to mitigation efforts and containment measures. While several approaches such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and its extension (SEIR, SIS, etc.) are often used to model the transmission of epidemics (Murray 2003 , Tsanou et al 2016 , the logistic growth models are very popular and useful to predict the final size of the epidemic (Batista 2020a ,b, Pell et al 2018 , Viboud et al 2016 . The latter has the interesting property that its ""S-shaped"" (Sigmoid curve) feature is suitable to describe processes that consist of a slow early transmission stage, followed by a phase of rapid transmission which then tails off as the susceptible population becomes saturated. Logistic functions are often used in demography, medicine, telecommunication, physics, linguistics, and agriculture. We use it in the present context to estimate the initial doubling time, the peak time, the peak rate, the final size and the short-term transmission forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic for these countries. Policy implications for the effectiveness of control measures and for assessing the potential impact on public health are discussed in order to accompany these governments and others in their efforts to curb down the disease progression.While there might be other channels of inception of this type of epidemic in a population, the current infection came to Africa through an exogenous route, that is, through imported cases from abroad (Gilbert et al., 2020) . This further justifies the use of the abovementioned mathematical models to assess its early dynamics. These models rely on the assumption that the initial number of infected cases is exogenously given and generates all the subsequent cases. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the models that we use to assess the disease transmission, and the main quantities of interest are derived analytically. Section 3 provides the empirical analysis where the data and background are described, the estimation approach is discussed, and results are presented. Concluding remarks and policy implications are discussed in Section 4.While many of the approaches used to model disease transmissions are based on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models and its extensions (Murray 2003; Tsanou et al 2016 Tsanou et al , 2018 , the Logistic growth model (sometimes referred to as the Verhulst model) is one of the most popular approach (Batista 2020a,b; Chowell et al 2014; Pell et al 2018; Viboud et al 2016) . While both models may give similar results for countries at an advanced stage of the epidemic such as China, Italy, France, USA (e.g. Lega and Brown 2017) , SIR models have different goals and would require a relatively large number of data points that are not available for the countries studied here (Becker and Greffell 2017, Lega and Brown 2017 ). The logistic model seems more appropriate for countries at their early epidemic stage, and is given by explicit formulas which make statistical analysis much simpler. 1 When one uses a phenomenological approach, the epidemic dynamics can be described following the logistic growth model. The underlying assumption of this model is that the rate of change in the number of new cases per capita linearly decreases with the number of cases. Hence, if is the accumulated number of cases observed at time , then the model is given bywhere is the infection rate, and is the final epidemic size. The initial number of cases is > 0 and is given. Solving for this equation gives the logistic response function defined bywhere is the integration constant, given by = 0 − 1.1 In the SIR model, one must solve a system of ordinary differential equations on each optimization step, making it less numerically appealing. It is however useful to compute ℛ , the basic reproduction number, an important statistic in epidemiology.The number of new cases, , reaches its maximum when its slope changes sign, implying ! ! = 0. By solving this condition, we obtain that the peak in the number of new cases occurs at time "" = #$ % & , the corresponding number of cases is "" = ' ( , and the peak rate is given byDenote by Δ . the doubling time of the epidemic, that is, the time it takes to double the number of cases. Then Δ . is obtained by solving the equation /0 1 = 2 , which yields:Note that Δ . is positive and increasing with , and we have Δ . → ∞ and →This means the doubling time can only be defined on the left hand side of the peak time, and lost its meaning after that. Given ; and , the estimated values for and whose estimation procedure is described in the next section, the average doubling time, Δ, can then be estimated at the early stages of the epidemic (i.e. before the epidemic reaches its peak when = <? @ One of the drawbacks of the logistics growth model is that it tends to underestimate the final epidemic size such that the actual number of cases may be slightly larger than that predicted by the logistics model (Batista 2020b) . If one observes that the actual number of cases is starting to systematically go beyond the predicted final state, then the model will no longer be applicable as a second phase of the epidemic is likely to arise.This section estimates the model and quantities discussed above using the data. We describe the data and provide a brief statistical background of the sample countries. We then explain the estimation approach and present the results as well as the short-term forecasts that are derived.The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, and Nigeria were extracted from publicly available data including Our World in Data website 2 , Worldometer, 3 and Wikipedia. Although the initial cases occurred from late February to early March in these countries, it is only around March 15, 2020 that the number of new cases started rising and the phenomenon became increasingly intense. Hence, in our analysis, we assume that the epidemic started on the latter date with the initial cases corresponding to the reported cases, and the entire populations from these countries were assumed initially susceptible. Table 1 gives summary statistics of the epidemic in the countries in the sample, including the total number of cases, deaths, recovery cases, and the initial dates where first cases where detected. To understand the background of these countries, we also provided basic country statistics such as population size, GDP (gross domestic product), median age, proportion of population aged 65+, and density of the population. These countries have a relatively young population with median age ranging between 18 and 22 and the proportion of elderly (65+) is 3 percent of total population in these countries. The fact that individuals aged 65 and over are at higher risk than younger ones who might be less likely to become infected (Li et al 2020) may partly explain the slow growth in the number of infected cases in these countries. 4 Nigeria has the largest population, representing more than 6 times the population of any other country in the sample, and, as a consequence, also has the highest density of population per squared kilometer. Figure 1 compares the evolution of infected cases in the sample countries. Overall, the number of infected cases has been consistently higher in Nigeria compared to the other countries. This might be due to the fact that the population of Nigeria is much larger than any other country in the sample and so the number of susceptible cases in Nigeria is likely to be larger as well (at least given the country's relatively high population density, see Table 1 ). The number of cases in Ghana has also been rising drastically in recent months compared to Cameroon, although the death toll remains relatively lower in Ghana as shown in Table  1 .In general, Figure 1 shows features and patterns that suggest that the number of cases have been growing drastically in these countries and is likely to continue to grow. This therefore calls for the need to harness the pandemic more efficiently. An important step is to understand the transmission characteristics of the epidemic and get a sense of what one should expect in the near future. This is where statistical estimation and short-term forecasting may come in handy.Clearly, all the relationships derived above are made in a deterministic way for simplicity. In reality, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty that surrounds the intertemporal relationship among stochastic processes. Our empirical analysis accounts for this possibility by specifying an empirical model for the Logistic equation (2) defined by:for a sample of observed time series data of accumulated number of cases { , = 1, . . , =}. We assume that the disturbance terms, u . , are stationary with constant mean and variance.To fit this infectious disease model to the data, we use numerical optimization that requires reasonable start values for the parameters. A good way to choose those values should use insightful information about the structure of the data. For these countries, we fitted the logistic model which has three unknown parameters, , , and that need to be estimated. Because the model is nonlinear, the initial guesses need to be made carefully. We proceed by grid search, assuming that by the end of the epidemic, the final size of the epidemic would be a fraction H of the population thus setting the starting value of as HI. Then, using the same reasoning as in Nguimkeu and Rekkas (2011) , we can derive the starting value for as the corresponding objective function (i.e. sum of squared residuals or likelihood function), we select the appropriate starting values for , , and . Another excellent method can be found in Batista (2020a,b) . We estimated the parameters of this model to fit the data of the sample countries using the maximum likelihood method assuming normality. Preliminary analysis suggested that the disturbance terms in Equation (3) are serially correlated with an AR(1) structure (autoregressive of order 1) such thatwhere |Q| < 1, and the error terms R can be assumed to be independently and normally distributed, i.e. R ~I(0, V ( ). The graphical inspection of B is given in Figure 2 and confirms the suggested error structure with positive autocorrelation. Denoting W = ( , , ) and X (W) = 1 + exp(− ) , the estimation can then proceed by finding the values of the parameter vector (W, Q, V ( ) that maximizes the log-likelihood function defined by 5where = , … , ? ′; X(W) = X (W), … , X ? (W) \ ; and the weighting matrix Ω(Q) is defined byAll data and code required to reproduce the analysis are available from the authors. From the parameter estimates of the model, ; , , A , Q h, and V h ( , one can easily derive estimates for "" , "" , Δ and ) "" by pluggingin these parameter values in the corresponding formulas obtained above. Their standard errors can then be computed using the delta method, and the standard errors of the predicted values of the model can be computed as well. Table 2 reports the maximum likelihood estimation of the model (3) with errors defined as in Equation (4), including parameter estimates, standard errors and significance. Given the substantial sample sizes, we use asymptotic variances to compute the +-values for evaluating the significance of the parameters. The results show that the final sizes of the epidemic are estimated to be relatively larger in Nigeria, compared to all other countries with estimated 58 335 cases by November 09, 2020. For the remaining countries, Cameroon, Ghana and Guinea, the epidemic is estimated to reach its final size by October 10, 2020, with final sizes equal to 19 573, 50 254 and 10 399, respectively. The initial doubling time in these countries is estimated to range between 26.65 and 39.18 days on average. The peak time is estimated at 95 and 106 days from the onset for Cameroon and Guinea, respectively, whereas for Ghana and Nigeria, it is relatively larger and estimated at 120 days and 115 days, respectively. This means that the epidemic is progressing relatively slowly in the latter countries compared to the former. These countries are expected to reach their peak rates at very different numbers of cases per day. While Nigeria and Ghana have the highest expected peak rates to reach 637 and 541 cases per day, Cameroon and Guinea rates are 236 and 80, respectively. However, these countries growth rates are quite similar and are estimated to range between 0.031 and 0.048. All these estimates are significant at 5% significance level or less. On this figure, the peak dates are shown to have occurred around June 12 th and 23 rd for Cameroon and Guinea, respectively, and around July 4 th and 10 th for Nigeria and Ghana, respectively. These peak dates also correspond to the inflexion point in the disease trends. The post-estimation residual diagnostics confirm the independence assumption of the error terms R , and a graphical inspection of these residuals is given in Figure 4 . There are many other sigmoid models that are often used to analyze disease spreads and diffusion processes in the literature (see, e.g., Meade and Islam 2002 for a review). However, as explained by Martino (2003) , the alternative growth curve most commonly used by forecasters is the Gompertz model. Using a selection test developed by Nguimkeu (2014) , we found that the Logistic curve better fits our data than the Gompertz.The parameter estimates obtained for the models are data-driven. Hence they are as reliable as the data are. These estimates should therefore be understood and interpreted with caution as the quality of the available data is uncertain and likely misreported. The uncertainties in these data are especially more serious in African countries where testing and recording procedures are limited. Nonetheless, if we assume that these data have some informative content, the derived estimates provide useful insights about what we are to expect in the future about the dynamics of the disease spread. Figure 3 also shows the evolution of the projected number of cases and infection rate over time for the next 50 to 60 days. In Table 3 , we present the estimates that compare the actual values and the predicted values obtained from the model for a period of 20 days, covering 10 days in-sample periods (the before dates) and 10 days out-of-sample periods (the after dates). Standard errors of the projected values are also reported to assess the precision of these projections.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Overall, the in-sample predictions are pretty accurate, with low standard errors and all prediction errors (i.e. percent difference between the actual and the predicted values) falling below 10% of the actual numbers. This suggests that the out-of-sample predictions should also be satisfactory. In particular, the results show that by September 23, (that is, ten days from the estimation date), Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria will have on average 19403, 48110, 9727 and 56424 cases, respectively, with standard errors 1420, 3344, 618, and 3975 respectively, if no further actions are taken in the fight against the pandemic in these countries. Note: Actual is the actual number of cases, Pred. is the predicted value from the estimation, and Std Error is the standard error of the predicted value.As one should expect, these predictions are less accurate as the prediction horizon increases. Assuming that from the current date, stronger measures are taken in these countries to fight the pandemic or there is a new wave of contaminations otherwise, then our predictions may not hold as much since they are based on a statu quo hypothesis. However, our predictions would still be useful as they could serve as a counterfactual (or control) basis to evaluate the impact of the policies implemented in these countries. In particular, by comparing the actual number of cases with those predicted in our study, one could assess the extent of the efforts conceded to fight the pandemic.Using publicly available data, we estimated the early dynamics of transmissions and projections of the COVID-19 in four major West African countries (Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria). On the basis of this information and employing both models of mathematical epidemiology and statistical inference, we estimated the main disease transmission characteristics of the epidemic in these countries. We found evidence of early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in West Africa, with relatively low growth. We predicted the number of infected cases that are expected to arise in the near future, if no measures are taken or if no new and surprising information becomes available. In all countries, the final size of the epidemic is estimated to be at least 10 000 cases as in Guinea and could reach up to 60 000 cases in Nigeria by early November 2020.In spite of this seemingly optimistic results in most of these countries compared to other parts of the world, this region remains one with a high potential risk, and considerable efforts to reduce transmission is therefore required to control and prevent the spread of the epidemic. This includes not only social distancing but also the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control (Gilbert et al., 2020) . These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts (Minesh et al., 2020) . For instance, the incidence of the disease in Ghana and in Nigeria has been evolving in almost similar patterns and close sizes suggesting a better control strategy and preparedness in Nigeria at the early stage (given its 6 times larger population). However, projections suggest that the pandemic may become more severe for Nigeria over time while slowing down in Ghana.The results found in this study may therefore appear as perhaps surprising overall, given the concerns that the WHO initially raised regarding the potential vulnerability of African countries, including those from West Africa such as Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria (WHO, 2020). Whether it is a matter of faulty detection, climatic factors or simple fluke, the remarkably low rate of coronavirus infection in African countries, with their fragile health systems, continues to puzzle. This adds to the optimistic predictions and estimation of the epidemic characteristics that we find in this study. Many arguments in favor of the environmental factors in Africa, as well as their demographic and epidemiologic characteristics discussed earlier are advanced as an advantage that countervails the transmission of the COVID-19. However, this should not pose as a disincentive for governments to take adequate measures to halt the progression of the diseases. This is being emphasized as the outbreak is gradually gaining ground in these West African countries and their neighboring countries. Should better strategies to cope with the pandemic be implemented in these countries, the predicted number of cases obtained in this study as well as other disease characteristics (growth rate, final size of the epidemic, etc.) may not hold going forward. The comparison between these predictions and the observed characteristics may then serve to evaluate the impact of the strategies implemented to fight the pandemic.Finally, the hypothesis that demographic, epidemiologic and geographic factors prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa may explain the slow COVID-19 transmission --in spite of the limited capacities to diagnose and handle such outbreaks --is one that merits more in-depth research and analysis. The authors plan to examine this question in a future research.","Cameroon","abstract","2020-10-17",10

In Ethiopia the first case was identified on March 13, 2020, two days after the pandemic was declared. According to the national report, as of October 5, 2020, 79,437 cases were identified with 34,016 recovered and 1230 deaths. Since the disease transmission dynamic shifted to a community transmission, the number of new cases, those who need critical care and daily deaths are increasing, with 292 cases on critical care at different treatment centers in the country on the same day 2 . Considering the countries over burdened health care system, providing adequate care for COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization and especially supplemental oxygen therapy might be challenging if the pandemic continues.To halt the transmission of the dynamics and because of limited knowledge on the disease progression and outcome, at first every patient who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 used to be quarantined and observed till recovery (declared by two consecutive negative RT-PCR results which are done 24 hours apart). But eventually as the number of case increases the admission and discharge criteria changed in order to accommodate the service to those who needs it most, this was also applied in our country 3, 4 .Assessing the resources needed for admitted patients can be guided by the length of hospital stay or time needed to get biochemically or clinically improved. Assessing the later provides better detail about the disease effect on the patient and its burden on the health care system compared to assessing the length of stay per se as it also tells us the associated resource requirement during the hospital stay. In other words, a patient staying at a mild ward with no need of oxygen therapy or expensive antibiotics and someone on intensive care doesn't cost the same to the institution. This implies that, hospital length of stay could be influenced by not only the clinical condition of the patient but also because of the existing policies that differ with time and place that is set to control the pandemic better. Therefore, using length of stay as a clinical parameter may be biased and should not be used as an end point to assess clinical improvement from the disease.Different studies are conducted that assessed the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients with a wide difference in reported values [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A systematic review that analyzed 45 studies conducted in different countries shows that the median length of hospital stay ranges from 4-53 days in China and 4-21 days outside China 13 . As explained above, these studies are influenced by the above changing criteria in admission and discharge that results in a different implication of length of hospital stay at different time of the pandemic and at different countries, one might imply duration from getting diagnosed to getting negative and another might imply from time of becoming symptomatic to a week or two after getting symptom free.In addition, studies concerning biochemical recovery are conducted measuring the time from getting positive up to negative viral shedding as declared by two consecutive laboratory result of a RT-PCR that is done at least 24 hours apart [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Such kind of studies can provide an input in terms of understanding the viral shedding pattern so that decision about quarantine and self isolation can be made so that infection transmission can be minimized. Because of the change in the practice, being positive by itself is no more a criteria to guide patient admission and discharge. Thereby, its current cost implication to the health care system is minimal.Since the current hospitalization policy focused on those who are symptomatic and need medication or supplemental oxygen therapy, understanding the oxygen requirement of severe COVID-19 patients and what predicts it is important. Knowing average duration of supplemental oxygen requirement helps not only in identifying who is at most risk and should be protected but it also assists in deciding on building hospitals capacity in terms of oxygen facility arrangement and organizing ICU and wards with inbuilt supplemental oxygen system. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such study conducted yet in both Ethiopia and outside.Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess severe COVID-19 patients' clinical improvement by measuring the time needed from admission and being on supplemental oxygen therapy to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and its predictors among patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.The study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia.The study design was hospital based prospective observational design. The observation was made from July to September, 2020.The source population was all severe cases of COVID-19 admitted at MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using RT-PCR, as reported by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ministry of Health and who were on follow up from July to September, 2020 3 .All consecutively admitted Severe COVID-19 patients during the follow up period were included in the study.All Severe COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the MCCC from July to September, 2020 were included.Censoring: Includes patients lost to follow-up, transferred out, died or completed the follow-up period before getting off supplemental oxygen therapy. Time to event or censoring: time between initiations of supplemental oxygen therapy to getting off oxygen supplement (in days).An interviewer administered pretested questionnaire that consists of the variables of interest was developed from the patient registration and follow up form and used to collect the necessary data from the patients and their medical charts.Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection tool was given for ten data collectors (Bsc nurses and General practitioners) and two supervisors (General practitioner and public health specialist) for one day.Data consistency and completeness was checked before an attempt was made to enter the code and analyze the data.The collected data was coded and entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned and stored and exported into SPSS version 23 for analysis. Frequency tables, Kaplan Meier (KM) plots and median survival times were used to describe the data. Survival experience of different groups was compared using KM survival curves. Log-rank test was used to assess significant difference among survival distributions of groups for equality.Among the 244 patients, 191 (78.3%) of the patients achieved the event (getting off supplemental oxygen therapy) while 53 (21.7%) were censored.The median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy was 6 days and it ranges from 2 to 35 days.Equal proportions (21.7%) of patients were included in the study in the age groups; below 40 years, 60 to 69 years and ≥ 70 years. A smaller proportion was in 50 to 59 years. Two third (67.6%) of the patients were males. More than half (56.9%) had a history of one or more comorbid illness. The greater proportion of the study participants were hypertensive (33.6%), followed by diabetes mellitus (28.7%), cardiac illness (11.9%) and asthma (6.1%). Thirty three (13.5%) had a history of ACEIs and/or ARBs and/or NSAID use within 14 days of admission to the center.In all of the variable categories, the number of event achieved is greater than the censored observation. The proportion of censored observation is relatively larger as age increases, for males, for those patients with one or more pre-existing comorbid illness history and Khat chewers. On the other, those with a history of drug use had a relatively less censored observation than those with no drug use history.The log rank test result shows that, there was a significant difference in the survival time among the patients based on age group, history of pre-existing co-morbid illness, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, the median duration of oxygen requirement is significantly longer for those patients ≥ 70 years (22 days) followed by 50 to 69 years (8 days) and then < 50 years (6 days) (X 2 (4)= 15.162, P-value= 0.004). Having a history of one or more pre-existing comorbid illness (7 Vs 8 days, X 2 (4)= 4.449, P-value= 0.035), hypertension (7 Vs 9 days, X 2(1)= 5.204, P-value= 0.023) and diabetes mellitus (7 Vs 8 days, X 2 (1)= 6.773, P-value= 0.009) resulted in a prolonged oxygen therapy requirement compared to those with no such illness.The proportion of patients who achieved the event was greater than the censored observation in all of the patients with the above symptom categories.Univariate analysis of each independent variable with the dependent variable was run. From univariate analysis at 25% level of significance; age group, sex, cardiac illness, hypertension, diabetes and Shortness of breath were significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients.However; only age group and a complaint of shortness of breath were found to be significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model at 5% level of significance.Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among patients ≥ 70 years was 47.8% lower than patients < 40 years old (HR= 0.522, 95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008). This implies that the time needed to get off supplemental oxygen therapy was significantly longer among older patients compared with the younger patients.The median time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population was 6 days. Previous studies that focused on length of hospital stay are conducted but there is no study that assessed duration of oxygen requirement [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Our study assessed this outcome as an indicator of clinical improvement from the disease as duration of stay is affected by national and international recommendations which varies from time to time based on admission and discharge criteria that might result in delayed discharge of patients till becoming non infectious even after clinical improvement. Knowing median duration of oxygen requirement assists in deciding on building hospitals capacity in terms of oxygen facility arrangement and organizing ICU and wards with inbuilt supplemental oxygen system so that maximum capacity can be used to provide better care to patients in the country.Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among patients 70 years and above was 47.8% lower than patients less than 40 years old. This implies that the time needed to get off supplemental oxygen therapy was significantly longer among older patients compared with the younger patients. This could be because of the increased risk of having concomitant comorbid illness and the normal aging process that diminishes body's defense mechanism. These factors result in a more severe disease progression with delayed recovery or death. Studies also support this finding showing that old age is associated with high risk of developing symptomatic disease, severe disease category and death from COVID-19 as compared to younger age group. Especially the patients 70 years and above were found to be vulnerable to much worse disease progression and outcome than other age groups [20] [21] [22] [23] .Having a complaint of shortness of breath at admission was found to be associated with a significantly prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen requirement. The rate of getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among patients with shortness of breath was 29.5% lower compared to those patients with no such complaint on admission. Shortness of breath is a sign of lung disease. SARS-COV-2 can affect any part of the body system but the lungs are said to be more susceptible because the virus entry in to the body is made through the airways. The other reason is the abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the lungs that is used as a receptor by the SARS-COV-2 to enter in to the body cells. Also, if the individual develops pneumonia, it is usually going to affect both lungs compromising the lungs capacity and resulting in a drop in blood oxygen level. Because of these reasons, if the lungs got hit by the virus, it results in a more severe disease especially among those with underlying pulmonary disease resulting in a severe disease presentation and delayed recovery causing a prolonged oxygen requirement.On the other hand, the result shows that the duration of oxygen requirement doesn't significantly differ based on sex and co-morbid illness/s history.Age group of 70 years and above and having shortness of breath were found to be associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement. This implies that, earlier identification of disease progression is advised to identify these groups of patients so that early intervention and maximum care can be provided to prevent complication from the disease and the supplemental oxygen therapy itself.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-10-13",10

The Africa continent, which is already burdened with communicable diseases like HIV and Tuberculosis with limited health care infrastructure and underdeveloped healthcare sector, seemed to be less affected by the pandemic. According to the World Health Organization weekly epidemiological report, as of October 11, 2020 globally there were 37,109,851 confirmed cases. Africa constituted only 3% (1, 227, 719) of the global case. So far, a total of 27,255 deaths were reported in the continent and this constitutes only 3% of the global cumulative death. In Ethiopia, on the same day, there were a total of 83,429 confirmed cases and 1277 deaths 1 .Numerous studies are conducted globally to understand the pandemic better, but still studies are scarce in Africa. A recent study conducted in Democratic Republic of Congo, that assessed the characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 patients, showed that mortality rate from COVID-19 was 13.2% and significant predictors were age group, body mass index andhistory of chronic kidney disease 2 .Different clinical presentation, disease course and outcome have been reported that varies from study to study and place to place implying the need for further study to understand the disease better. Regarding the clinical presentation, symptomatic and asymptomatic presentationshave been reported during the entire disease course. In addition, the type of symptoms could vary manifesting as different body system symptoms with some presenting with what is called atypical presentations for a virus that attacks the respiratory system. The commonly reported symptoms are respiratory and constitutional symptoms [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .The disease outcome is reported to vary between a complete recovery without any complication, development of one or more systemic complication or death [10] [11] [12] . These disease outcomes seemed to be determined by underlying patient characteristics, history of pre-existing medical conditions, the COVID-19 disease severity, disease progression and the development of complication 11,13-20 . Due to varying reports from studies conducted in different countries, understanding the disease characteristics and its outcome in the local context is crucial for targeted intervention.Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess the characteristics and outcome of 1345 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and to identify the determinants of the disease outcome among patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.An institution based prospective cohort study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.The follow up was made from July, when the center started functioning with full capacity, up to the end of September, 2020.The source population was all cases of COVID-19 admitted at MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using RT-PCR, as reported by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ministry of Health and who were on follow up from July to September, 2020 21 .During this interval a total of 1741 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Center.All COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at the center from July to September, 2020 and with complete follow up data were included.Clinical improvement from COVID-19.Censoring: Includes patients who lost to follow-up, transferred out, died or completed the follow-up period before clinical recovery. Time to event or censoring: time between admission to the Center up to clinical improvement or censoring (in days).Data was collected from patients and their medical charts using a pretested interviewer administered questionnaire. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and data collection tool was given for fifteen data collectors (General practitioners) and four supervisors (General practitioner and public health specialist) for two days. The recommended infection prevention and control practice was implemented during the data collection. Data consistency and completeness was checked before an attempt was made to enter the code and analyze the data.The collected data was coded and entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned and stored and exported into SPSS version 23 for analysis. Data was summarized using frequency tables, Kaplan Meier (KM) plots and median survival times. Survival experience of different groups was compared using KM survival curves. Log-rank test was used to assess significant difference among survival distributions of groups for equality.To assess the presence of a statistically significant association between the independent variables and time to clinical improvement, multivariable Cox proportional hazard survival model was used. Univariate analysis was performed to calculate an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) and to screen out potentially independent variables. In the final model; Adjusted HR, P-value and 95% CI for HR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with time to clinical improvement in days. The basic assumptions of Cox Proportional Hazard model was tested using log minus log function, where parallel lines indicate proportionality, and the data fitted well.The mean age of the participants was 41.0 ± 18.2 years and 778 (58.6%) were males. The majority of the participants (92.9%) were from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Only 26 (1.9%) of the participants were health care professionals. From the 557 females, 13 (2.3%) were pregnant.Around one-third (34.2%) of the patients had a history of one or more spre-existing co-morbid illness. The major co-morbid illness among the participants was hypertension (19.9%), diabetes (13.7%), cardiac disease (4.2%) and asthma (4.1%). Chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, neurologic disorder and chronic pulmonary diseases constitute only 2.6 % altogether.Based on the vital sign recorded on triage, majority had SBP of < 140 (54.7%), DBP of < 90 (72.4%), temperature of > 37.5 o C (52.3%) and oxygen saturation of 93% and above (80.4%).In all of the variable categories, the number of those who achieved clinical improvement was greater than the censored observations. The proportion of censored observations was relatively larger as age increases, for males, for patients with one or more pre-existing comorbid illness and Khat chewers. On the other, those with a history of drug use had a relatively less censored observation than those with no drug use history.Crude analysis of each independent variable with the time to clinical improvement was run at 25% level of significance. From univariate analysis; age group, SPO2, temperature, COVID-19 severity, cough, chest pain, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath,hypertension and diabeteswere significantly associated with time to clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients.Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the rate of achieving clinical improvement among patients with temperature of 37.5 o C and above was 1.135 times than patients with a temperature range of37.5 o C and lower (AHR= 1.135, 95% CI= 1.011, 1.274, p-value=0.032). This shows that hyperthermic patients improve from COVID-19 in a significantly shorter duration.COVID-19 disease severity at admission was also found to be a significant determinant of time to clinical improvement. The rate of achieving clinical improvement among patients with severe COVID-19 disease at presentation was 34% lower than patients who presented with mild disease (AHR= 0.660, 95% CI= 0.501, 0.869, p-value=0.003). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between moderate and mild cases in the time to clinical improvement. That means, having severe disease is associated with delayed clinical improvement.On the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model; temperature, COVID-19 severity and cough were found to be significant determinants of time to clinical improvement.COVID-19 disease severity at admission was also found to be a significant determinant of time to clinical improvement. The rate of achieving clinical improvement among patients with severe COVID-19 disease at presentation was 34% lower than patients who presented with mild disease. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between moderate and mild cases in the time to clinical improvement. Severe patients are those patients with symptoms and signs that could lead to intensive care admission and that were also found to be significant predictors of unfavorable disease outcome in this study as well.Presenting with a complaint of cough at admission was associated with a 24.1% lower rate of achieving clinical improvement compared to those patients with no such complaint on admission. This could be because those patients with cough were in a more severe disease category, which was also found to be a significant determinant of time to clinical improvement. Another study conducted in the Center on determinants of time to convalescence also showed that having symptomatic disease in general is associated with a delayed biochemical recovery 25 .On the binary logistic regression at 5% level of significance, the following factors were found to be significantly associated with disease outcome;SPO2, shortness of breath, and diabetes mellitus.Having diabetes mellitus was associated with a 45.1% lower odds of achieving clinical improvement compared to those with no such comorbid illness. The effect of concomitant comorbid illness on disease progression is also reported to be the same in other studies [27] [28] [29] [30] . Patients with diabetes mellitus were also found to increased likelihood of having death outcome, developing symptomatic disease and more severe disease category in studies conducted in our center 23, 24, 31 .On the other hand, age which was found to be a significant determinant in other studies didn't show any significant difference in this study 2, 20 .The average duration of time to clinical improvement was 14 days. The mortality rate of the studied population was 5.3%, this is lower than reports from other countries including Africa.Having severe COVID-19 disease severity and presenting with cough were found to be associated with delayed clinical improvement from the disease. On the other hand, being hyperthermic is associated with shorter disease duration (faster time to clinical improvement). In addition, lower oxygen saturation and subjective complaint of shortness of breath and being diabetic were associated with unfavorable disease outcome.Therefore, cautious management of these patients is mandatory for a better management outcome.The study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants. The study had no risk/negative consequence on those who participated in the study. Medical record numbers were used for data collection and personal identifiers were not used in the research report.

By 30 January 2020, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced COVID-19 as the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern, it had spread to over 20 countries worldwide (including the United States of America) [2] . The WHO declared the disease a pandemic on 11 March 2020, having affected over 100 countries, with more than 100,000 recorded infections [3, 4] . To date, over 23 million cases and more than 800,000 deaths have been reported in 215 countries worldwide [5] . All African countries are affected, with a total case count of over 1 million and more than 27,000 deaths, representing 5% of all cases reported globally [5] . Since the first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa was reported in Nigeria on 27 February 2020, the country has recorded 53,477 cases and 1011 deaths in all her 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), as at 28 August 2020 [6, 7] . Over 850 Nigerian health workers have been infected with the virus [8] . More than 300 of these are resident doctors, sadly, 14 have died from the infection [8] . The foregoing gives a peek into the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.In line with international measures, the Nigerian government declared a total lockdown on 30 March 2020 [9] . Although the total lockdown was eased on 27 April 2020 to allow for minimal essential activities, containment measures such as curfews, restricted work hours and restriction of physical/social gatherings continued until 3 September 2020, when the second phase of the relaxed lockdown was reviewed, and the third phase which began on 4 September 2020, was declared [10, 11] . These measures have impacted negatively on patient care, especially so with the suspension of outpatient clinics and postponement of elective operations across most surgical specialties [10] . Patients are also generally reluctant to visit hospitals due to fear of contracting the virus [12] . Studies evaluating the implications of these on patient outcomes during the pandemic have shown a significant rise in mortality and morbidity [13, 14] .The pandemic and its containment measures also have important ramifications on the training of medical doctors [15] . The surgical specialties, being largely dependent on patient flow for hands-on experience, stand the greatest risk of being negatively affected. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the training of residents in surgical specialties in Nigeria was therefore evaluated in this study.A cross-sectional survey of resident doctors in surgical specialties (including general surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, ear, nose and throat surgery, maxillofacial surgery, urology, cardiothoracic surgery, ophthalmology, plastic surgery and paediatric surgery) in Nigeria was conducted between 27 July 2020 and 14 August 2020, during the partial lockdown. A 42-item study-specific electronic questionnaire designed using the free software Google Forms Ò was utilised for the study. The questionnaire gathered information on demographic characteristics, impact of the pandemic on training activities, research and service delivery, mode of training activities during the ongoing pandemic, impact of the pandemic on emigration of doctors, career progression, as well as psychological impact of the pandemic on surgical residents. The majority of the items were multiple-choice questions while few, such as those requesting for the number of cases done were open-ended.The questionnaire was randomly distributed electronically to 250 surgical residents via emails (15) , WhatsApp (198) and Telegram (37). Reminders were sent to nonresponders a week after. To optimize survey integrity, the online survey platform was structured to permit only one response per time. Clicking on the agree button and submitting the survey responses implied consent to participate in the study. Participation was voluntary, and no incentives were offered. Collected data were analysed using Google Forms Ò .Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ethics and research unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. hospitals and medical centre) across the six geopolitical zones of the country completed and submitted the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 82.8%. Of the 207 respondents, the majority were males, 181 (87.4%), in the fourth decade of life, 160 (77.3%). The respondents were spread across 11 surgical subspecialties. General surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology residents constituted the highest number, 50 (24.2%), each. A significant number of respondents were senior registrars, 114 (55.1%), in their fifth year of residency training, 44 (21.3%), as shown in Table 1 .The majority of respondents reported a reduction (164, 79.2%) or cancellation (11, 5 .3%) of postgraduate programmes in their institutions. Of those who had academic programmes (183, 88.4%), meetings were virtual in all instances, with Zoom Ò being the platform used in the overwhelming majority of cases (189, 91.3%). Academic seminars (172, 83.1%) and journal club meetings (66, 31.9%) were the most common virtual academic programmes reported, while few had virtual surgical simulations (6, 2.9%) and telesurgery (3, 1.4%). The majority of respondents (119, 57.5%) preferred the online platform to physical meetings, and wanted training/academic programmes to continue virtually beyond the pandemic. These findings are depicted in Table 2 . The majority of respondents, 173 (83.6%), reported seeing fewer patients in the outpatient clinics since the pandemic began. More than two-thirds, 146 (70.5%), attended to less emergency cases, and more than one-half, 121 (58.5%), reported a reduction in the number of emergency operations in their units. 188 (90.8%) respondents concluded their units were doing fewer elective operations in the COVID-19 era. These findings are illustrated in Table 3 .Overall, 170 (82.1%) residents believed the pandemic had a negative impact on their training and professional growth. The pandemic had elongated the duration of training/time of completion of residency training of more than one-half, 123 (59.4%), of the respondents. The pandemic had also disrupted the progress of the dissertations, a requirement for the fellowship examinations of the postgraduate surgical colleges, of 73 (64.0%) senior registrars. Only 12 (10.5%) senior registrars had completed and submitted their dissertations to the postgraduate surgical colleges. The majority of respondents reported they had more time for personal study 138 (66.7%) during the pandemic. More than one-half, 118 (57%), had not missed any conference or update course during the pandemic. These findings are shown in Table 4 .The majority of the respondents, 173 (83.6%), reported they did not have appropriate/adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) to work with. Increased stress and anxiety levels were reported by more than one-half of the respondents, 121 (58.5%). More than three-fourths of the respondents, 183 (88.4%), feared they may contract the coronavirus at work, while 187 (90.3%) feared they could transmit the virus to their family members. The fear of contracting Table 5 .About a third of the respondents, 70 (33.8%), had considered migrating out of the country during the pandemic. Of these, 11 (15.7%), believed it was easier to do so now, as many foreign countries are currently in need of more medical personnel to cope with the pandemic.The direct public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is known to all, but the more subtle ramifications of this unprecedented global disaster are yet to be fully unraveled. One of such is the impact on postgraduate training, particularly in the surgical specialties which currently lack adequate number of personnel across virtually all specialties [16, 17] . Our survey showed that all aspects of surgical training were affected by the pandemic with increasing delays in training periods, increased psychosocial stress and a potential to worsen the already existing challenge of brain drain. Disease containment measures like lockdowns and social distancing have necessitated the postponement/cancellation of outpatient clinics and elective operations [10] . Limiting elective clinical activities protects patients from in-hospital viral transmission, preserves PPE to be prioritized for the care of patients with COVID-19, and makes ward and critical care beds available for upsurges in the numbers of COVID-19 cases [18] . The American College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons of England both recommend that non-emergency procedures be postponed or delayed, except cancer-related operations [19, 20] . Local and regional bodies such as the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON) also recommend telephone consultations for non-emergency cases, and reorganization of duty rosters to prevent patients visiting the hospital unnecessarily and to limit hospital contact of medical personnel [21] . Expectedly therefore, the majority of respondents in our study reported a reduction or cancellation of postgraduate programmes in their institutions. Most of them also reported seeing fewer patients in the outpatient clinics, as well as a reduction in the number of and attendance at emergency and elective operations. These findings are similar to the findings of other authors [15, [22] [23] [24] . These findings have potential significant negative impact on surgical training vis-à-vis acquisition of surgical skills and expertise, which are greatly dependent on hands-on experience.The postponement of clinical activities would also affect the career progression of surgical residents. This fact was alluded to by more than three quarters (170, 82.1%) of the respondents in our study. It is evident that for the 2019/2020 training year, most surgical residents will not be able to complete their clinical rotations, operative log books, or have the prerequisite exposures required for programme accreditation [23] and qualification for the membership and fellowship examinations of the postgraduate surgical colleges. Our study revealed that the pandemic had elongated the duration of training/time of completion of residency training of more than one-half (123, 59.4%) of the respondents. Only 12, 10.5%, senior registrars in our study had completed and submitted their dissertations, a prerequisite for the fellowship examinations, to the postgraduate surgical colleges.The health and well-being of surgical residents in the country have also been negatively affected by the pandemic. Over 900 Nigerian doctors (including surgical residents) have been quarantined following exposure to the virus, with more than 300 of them testing positive for COVID-19 [8, 10] . Sadly, 14 Nigerian doctors have died of COVID-19, the first, an obstetrician, following a Caesarean section [25] . Shortage of PPE is a major contributing factor to these infections and deaths [15] . Most (173, 83.6%) of the respondents in our study did not have appropriate/adequate PPE to work with. Though the Nigerian government has recently ramped up efforts in increasing the supply of PPE to public hospitals across the country, these are still grossly inadequate [10] . The mental health/psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to various stressors including but not limited to the paucity of testing and treatment resources, protective equipment for healthcare providers, disease containment measures (like compulsory use of face masks, lockdowns and social distancing) that tend to infringe on personal freedoms and economic losses resulting from the pandemic [26] . Our study found increased stress and anxiety levels in more than one-half (121, 58.5%) of the respondents. The fear of contracting the virus at work and transmitting same to family members, as well as the non-availability of appropriate/adequate PPE were the implicated stressors.On a positive note, most of the respondents reported that they had more time for personal study (138, 66.7%) during pandemic. This is not unexpected following the downscaling of clinical and surgical activities. Also, more than one-half (118, 57%) of the respondents had not missed any conference or update course during the pandemic, as the postgraduate colleges are now conducting these virtually. An overwhelming majority of the respondents, 188, 88.4%, also reported that training/academic programmes in their institutions were currently being conducted virtually. It is recommended that training programmes should invest in virtual and digital platforms for the education and training of trainees [27, 28] . Simulations or hands-on technical skills training are difficult to conduct virtually though [27] . This was corroborated by findings in our study, as academic seminars and journal club meetings were the most common virtual programmes reported (172, 83.1% and 66, 31.9%, respectively). Only a few respondents reported virtual surgical simulations and telesurgery (6, 2.9% and 3, 1.4%, respectively). Zoom Ò was the predominant virtual meeting platform utilized (189, 91.3%). Archibald et al. reported that Zoom Ò , an innovative videoconferencing platform, was generally rated above alternative videoconferencing platforms [29] . It is instructive to note that the majority (119, 57.5%) of respondents preferred online to physical meetings for training programmes, and want these programmes to continue virtually beyond the pandemic. This may not be unconnected with the convenience of attending virtual meetings, as well as better attendance by both trainees and trainers. A drawback though, is the generally poor mobile network and internet connectivity, as well as expensive data subscriptions in Nigeria.It is interesting to note that despite Europe and America being worse hit by the pandemic, about one-third of respondents (70, 33.8%) contemplated migrating to these countries, defying the odds. In a country with a depleted workforce, one third of her potential workforce emigrating to other countries at a time when more workforce is required has the potential of worsening the already existing global healthcare inequalities. The massive emigration of Nigerian health professionals therefore deserves critical attention in order to avoid a looming health care crisis in the country.The high response rate (82.8%), a strength of this study, may have been the result of the use of multiple channels (emails, WhatsApp and Telegram) for administering the questionnaire. This study was conducted about four months after containment measures had been in effect. This was sufficient time for respondents to have observed the changes which were reported in the study. Furthermore, given that containment measures were still in place at the time of administering the questionnaire, the observations made by the respondents were a reflection of the true situation to a reasonable extent, and reduces the possibility of recall bias.This study, though limited by its descriptive nature, provides important data upon which interventions can be planned.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the surgery residency training programme in Nigeria. Surgical residents currently see less patients in the outpatient clinics and attend fewer emergencies and elective operations. These findings have far-reaching negative implications for training, as surgical specialties are largely dependent on patient flow for hands-on experience. The pandemic has also disrupted the career progress of residents and prolonged the duration of training for the majority. Though many academic programmes are now conducted virtually, there are other aspects of training such as ward rounds and theatre sessions for which, there is limited technology to transmit. These and other areas need to be further explored to keep pace with the demands of this period.There is need to invest in virtual and digital technologies for the education and training of surgical residents. Ward rounds/bedside didactic teachings (with few residents on ground, in line with social distancing measures), can be conducted with body cameras that would record and transmit same to external video units, allowing other residents watch/observe these sessions. Teleconsultations/ medicine/surgeries should be encouraged and developed, as these would not only reduce unnecessary hospital visits by patients, in line with the disease containment measures, but also promote international collaboration, learning and research. In this regard, the mobile phone networks and internet service providers would do well to facilitate the use of telemedicine for outpatient consultations, as well as digital platforms for education, learning and training by their subscribers. The postgraduate surgical colleges should sustain the virtual conduct of update courses, conferences and online submissions of case books and dissertations.The government should increase the supply of, and ensure the availability of appropriate PPE in public hospitals in the country. This would significantly reduce the psychological burden of the disease on healthcare personnel, worsened by the fear of contracting the virus during patient care.It will be interesting to re-evaluate in the near future, the impact of some of the recently adopted innovations occasioned by the pandemic on surgical residency training. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness in a resource limited setting, of some of the more sophisticated technological innovations earlier proposed, are also important areas that could be explored.Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Informed consent Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.","Nigeria","first author","2020-10-28",10

The virus causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) which has been recently declared as global pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 [1, 2] . Currently, COVID-19 is found to be one of the most contagious and virulent viruses that challenged the globe [3] . Thus, COVID-19 has conceived the foremost to spread to the entire globe and brought substantial health crisis and keeps to pose a global threat [4] .Community pharmacists are vital healthcare providers during the outbreak by serving as direct points of access for their patients and on the frontline of public health. Likewise, Hospital pharmacists have an expert role in providing evidence based pharmaceutical care service and managing the drug supply system which ultimately optimize the infection control as well as patient care and support [5] . The community pharmacists continue to play their role in providing information on precautions related to COVID-19 spread. Thus, community and hospital pharmacists provide essential services to patients and healthcare teams through continued provision and supply of medicines and treatment [2, 6] . The Ethiopian ministry of health has issued standard operating procedure for preparation of hand sanitizers for compounding pharmacists and manufacturers to cope with the stock outs [7] . In relation with drug supply chain, it is left vulnerable and this in turn poses burdens on healthcare providers and the entire healthcare system [8] . In Lowand Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), movement restrictions, is considered as a primary mitigation strategy to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Self-isolation, physical distancing, shielding of high-risk individuals should be extended until a treatment and vaccine options become available [9] . Pandemics cause significant morbidity and mortality impacts particularly in LMICs. As a result, the prevention strategies also result unintended social and economic disruption [10] .The role and responsibilities of pharmacists needs to be explored in the context of COVID-19 pandemic thereby reducing the health service burden. It is also important to profoundly assess pharmacists' readiness and full potential use is implemented to prevent the pandemic. Thus, the study explored the pharmacy service preparedness and response to prevent and control COVID-19.The study was carried out in Aksum city, Tigray Regional State, Northern Ethiopia. A total of sixteen private medicine retail outlets (four pharmacies, eleven drug stores and one drug vendor) are found in the city. In addition, four governmental healthcare facilities; one comprehensive specialized hospital, one general hospital and two health centers are found in the city. The study was conducted in May, 2020.A qualitative study was employed to explore pharmacy service preparedness undertaken to fight COVID-19 in hospital and community pharmacies. In-depth interview and direct observation were made using a semistructured data collection instrument developed based on literatures pertinent to our study [11, 12] to assess the preparedness of pharmacies and pharmacy staffs to combat COVID-19.Data was collected from medicine retail outlets found in Aksum city which were first listed down consulted from Aksum Town Health Office. Community pharmacies and hospital pharmacies which share major pharmacy service in the city were the targeted study areas. Indepth interview was made with pharmacy heads using a semi-structured interview guide comprised of probing questions. Study informants were selected purposively and interview was stopped in the sixth interview due to saturation of information. The interview guide was initially prepared in English language which later translated to Tigrigna (local language) and back-translated to English to ensure consistency. Pretesting was carried out in two medicine dispensaries and appropriate modification was made in the final version of the interview guide. The interview guide developed for this study is provided as Additional file 1 (Supplementary materials).The data collection instrument consisted questions about socio-demographic information, pharmacy preparedness activities against COVID-19, patient education and support given for clients and assessment tips checked on direct observation. Two trained pharmacists collected the data. The average duration of interview was 30 min, ranged from 25 to 35 min. All interviews were made in Tigrigna language which was audiorecorded. In addition, direct observation was made to assess the preparedness activities being carried out against COVID-19 which helped us in triangulating with the finding of the in-depth interview.Data were coded using single-blinded identification code. Audio-recorded interview data were transcribed which later translated to English language. This was made by bilingual authors GGK and ATA. This transcribed verbatim which later translated and the observational checklist obtained notes were carefully read and categorized in to seven major themes emerged during our thematic analysis. All co-authors of the study verified the content of the themes created. OpenCode version 4.02 software was used to facilitate the analysis of the data.A total of six pharmacists were interviewed. Majority (n = 5) of the study informants were males with an average age of 35.6 years ranged from 27 to 53 years. All study informants had bachelor's degree in pharmacy and on average 12 years of work experience ranged from 2 to 30 years. Four pharmacists were working in community pharmacies and were owners of the pharmacy. The remaining two pharmacists were working in hospitals as a case team coordinator (Table 1) .All (n = 6) pharmacists responded correctly to COVID-19 history, transmission and prevention strategies. The study showed that all respondents were aware of the disease and they had up-to-dated information about the pandemic. Different resources such internet, web pages and social-medias were mentioned as the main source of knowledge to update the recent development and progress of the disease. One of the respondents stated that:""…COVID-19 is a disease caused by to a new strain of coronavirus family that affects the respiratory system. It was firstly reported from Wuhan, China in December 2019 and it became a pandemic disease affecting populations worldwide. The main transmission mechanisms are droplets, contact and airborne. An individual who has got the disease can transmit the disease while sneezing, handshaking and through surface contact. Therefore, it can be easily prevented by isolating suspected individuals, practicing physical distancing, and hand washing using soap and water for 20-30 seconds or sanitizing our hands. Drugs and vaccines are under development. I always refer to WHO guideline and web page when I want to update my knowledge about the case."" (C19Phar002)During the study period, all informants (n = 6) mentioned their engagement to combat the pandemic. Among these, three of them had prepared standard alcohol-based hand-rub in collaboration with other bodies. Moreover, as we have checked on direct observation all of the premises had water tank with soap in the main gateway for hand wash and sanitizer, alcohol and were advising clients to keep physical distancing.""… We are applying all the prevention mechanisms WHO recommends. We have prepared alcohol-based sanitizer in collaboration with other bodies as the case is difficult to work and control alone. There is a taskforce organized from different professionals to control COVID-19, and we are actively working with the team especially in supplying sanitizers, drugs and medical supplies used as supportive treatment of the disease."" (C19Phar001)All study informants (n = 6) responded that there was some tendency of change in the management and rational use of drugs. There was shortage of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies in the market. During the beginning of the lockdown customers asked to procure antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs. This was strengthened by one informant that:""… There was a minor change in the drug supply system and rational drug use because of COVID-19. This also imposed misunderstanding in the population especially in the beginning, late February 2020. During that time, many of my customers had asked me for prescription drugs and medical supplies. However, nowadays the population seems calmed which might be after the regional health bureau and we professionals had created various awareness programs."" (C19Phar003) Another informant stated: ""…After new confirmed case was reported in our country some clients asked to get Chloroquine and Azithromycin as they heard they can be cured if they get sick. But I have clarified to them these medications are prescription only drugs and are not approved for the treatment COVID-19."" (C19Phar006)Customer wrong beliefs about COVID-19All study informants (06) mentioned customers were with false claims in the beginning of the pandemic. They further responded; this might be because of usual traditional medication practice used commonly in the community.""… some customers asked me if home remedies like garlic can prevent the disease and I have responded them these home remedies might have their own health value but there is no approved product for treatment of COVID-19. I advised them to follow the instructions given by healthcare providers, regional and national health bureaus, and WHO for reliable information."" (C19Phar004)Study informants were asked if they face problems due to COVID-19 while in practice and to rate the status the pharmaceutical care service delivered. All of them (n = 6) mentioned that their revenue has decreased due to the introduction of lockdown. Besides, they reported there is negligence in the population in applying the prevention strategies though they are informing the population to do so. However, although the economic income has decreased, they have rated the pharmacy service provided was very good.""… in this regard similar to the country economic recession my income is substantially decreased which might be because of quarantine instructed by the regional government. I hope this will be for the short period of time. The other challenging issue is peoples are not following the instructions given to prevent the disease. They are very negligent though we are counseling them to follow all the mechanisms to halt the spread of the disease. Although we are facing with these and other challenges, the pharmacy service is being delivered very well."" (C19Phar005)Collaboration with other stakeholders was considered as a must do protocol to combat COVID-19. All the interview informants (n = 6) have responded they were working with other healthcare professionals, COVID-19 prevention and control taskforce, clinics, hospitals, regional health bureau and other relevant stakeholders.""… this disease is difficult to control apart that is why I am working with the command post and clinics around, to report if I found any suspected case. I have the call number of the local government registered in my notebook which is assigned to inform and ask any of COVID-19 concern."" (C19Phar004)Our finding revealed, patient education and psychological support were being delivered. The strategies necessary outlined for the prevention and control of the pandemic were being given. Customers were counseled to stay at home, wash their hands or use hand sanitizer and maintain physical distancing.""… We are educating them to apply all the prevention mechanisms given by WHO, to exercise at home and out of home. We are instructing them to stay at home unless they have an urgent issue that necessities them to go out. If they go out of home, we recommend them to stay away from crowded areas, wash or sanitize their hand and use face mask as possible."" (C19Phar002)In addition, the case of COVID-19 has introduced some tendency of apprehension and psychological disturbance in the population. In our study, the study informants responded many of their customers have asked them what could be the fate of COVID-19.""… yes, some of my customers came and asked me what they should do and what will be the fate after the case. I have seen some degree of fear and I have tried to stabilize them… instructed them as the disease is not such a big threat… just we can control it if we stay in home, avoid crowded areas and physical contact until the pandemic is controlled and a solution is found."" (C19Phar006)To the best our knowledge this is the first study to assess and explore the preparedness of pharmacies and pharmacy professionals to prevent and control the pandemic disease COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The study found necessary preparedness measures were undertaken to control the current public health threat of COVID-19 regarding pharmacy service. In line with other studies recommendations [12, 13] , community and hospital pharmacists were working at the frontline to combat the pandemic disease. This helps in the urgent control of public health emergencies like COVID-19. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) and other studies recommend, in addition to the usual services provided, ensuring pertinent pharmacy service is required to prevent and control COVID-19. This includes ensuring adequate storage and supply of drugs and medical supplies, promoting rational drug use, point of care tests, and working in collaboration and reporting any suspected case to the responsible body [6, 8, 11, [13] [14] [15] . Similarly, the present study has revealed the pertinent pharmacy services were evidenced although supply of some drugs and medical supplies were scarce.The tendency of customers to false claims of medical products and assumptions that helps to detect, prevent and control was showed especially in the introduction of the pandemic disease. The WHO medical product alert No. 3/2020 has warned health providers, responsible bodies, and customers to work against the production of falsified medical products [16] . Later on, customers were getting informed as there was no approved drug or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of the disease. Similarly, the FIP and Sandres et al reported no cure has been found to date [17, 18] . Although the American Food and Drug Administration has authorized an emergency drug Remdesiver which showed an effect against COVID-19 [19, 20] , our finding implicates customers should adhere the counseling tips given by pharmacy professionals to keep themselves free from the pandemic disease.Similar to our finding, public health emergencies like COVID-19 need a multidisciplinary effort to control and improve patients treatment outcome [12] . Due to the more accessible nature of community pharmacies, linking patients who are suspected to COVID-19 to healthcare system is feasible and more helpful to contain the pandemic disease [21, 22] . In addition; staff shifting, backup plans, alternative pharmacy services and other intervention mechanisms should be considered to halt the spread of the disease.Patients presented with no symptoms of COVID-19 should be provided evidence based information and advice [23] . Population with different age group and disease classification might visit these pharmacies for service. All infection prevention and control measures should be considered meticulously including in healthcare settings [24, 25] . The study revealed, customers were learned to be calmed and get informed all the prevention strategies to cope with COVID-19 as some guidelines recommend [24, 26] . This eases the scrutinized and collaborative control of the pandemic disease. Similar to our finding, pharmacy professionals can found updated evidence about COVID-19 in various databases, web pages and social media outlets about COVID-19 [27] .As the present study disclosed, the population seems to be careless and loose in strictly following the instructions given to prevent and control the pandemic disease. This might be due to the country and worldwide economic recession and other factors imposed as of the lockdown. This imply the government and other responsible body to take a proactive measures to solve the problem [28, 29] .Our study has limitations. Due to the nature of the study design and as the study was conducted in one of the large cities in Ethiopia but with limited number of pharmacies, the findings may not be generalizable. However, our finding would add to the growing literature particularly in the area of pharmacy service in public health emergencies and pharmacy preparedness to prevent and control the pandemic COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and other LMICs.The study revealed necessary pharmacy services were being given. However, sufficient supplies of drugs and medical supplies were scarce which negatively affected the optimal delivery of pharmacy services. Further, the tendency of following the prevention strategies against COVID-19 has been found loose in the population. The government and other responsible bodies should work together to solve such problems and contain the pandemic.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12913-020-05763-9.

[1] [2] [3] To date, official figures released by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate over 21 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with 761,018 deaths. 4 This 2019-nCoV is the third and the most lethal pathogenic human positive sense RNA coronavirus identified following the outbreak of zoonotic transmission of CoV that has been recognized as SARS-CoV (in 2003) and MERS-CoV (in 2012), affecting birds and a wide range of animals including humans. [5] [6] [7] The hallmark of each of these infections is viral pneumonia accompanied by host inflammation, leading to pulmonary edema and a syndrome that resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 8 Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients present with exuberant activation of T cells, and Th17 cell infiltration leads to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-17A (IL-17A) (also known as and related families such as IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (also known as IL- 25) , and IL-17F. In turn, inefficient production of type 1 interferons and an impaired antiviral response are seen, while increasing activation of NF-κB contributes to the cytokine storm. [9] [10] [11] [12] Secondary to a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration and the cytokine storm, the alveolar-capillary membrane becomes congested, damaged, and leaky, allowing increased movement of water and proteins from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. 13 In turn, pulmonary edema, lung failure, and death ensue. 9 Taking this a step further, severely infected patients with ARDS have elevated serum levels of IL-1B, IL1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ (IFNγ), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferonγ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP1α), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ( Table 1) . 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] Because there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, understanding of the cytokine storm mechanisms in this disease could help to reveal possible therapeutic interventions. Therefore, among several inflammatory cells and cytokines, T-helper (Th)-17 cells are a unique subset of a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 + ) T-helper cells characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory  cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22.  Differentiation of naïve CD4 + T cells to Th-17 cells is  mediated by the activation of T-helper cells in the presence  of a combination of TGF-β, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23. 10, 11 In turn, IL-17A acts by activating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and inducing the expression of macrophages, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and several chemokines, which collaborate to potentiate the inflammatory process of ARDS. 13 Elevated Th17 (as well as Th1) responses or enhanced IL-17-related pathways are also observed in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV patients. 14,18 ARDS is not commonly due to the viral load but due to an exuberant immune response, and results in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Thus, there is an urgent need for antiinflammatory drugs for COVID-19 patients presenting with CRS. This article provides the proposed immunopathological mechanism of IL-17A/F and drugs against IL-17-IL-17R signaling, including the synergistic IL-6-IL-6R axis, as a potential therapeutic option.Th17 cells are pro-inflammatory and were introduced in 2005 as a third subset of the CD4 + T-cell lineage. 30, 31 Functionally, Th17 cells play a role in host defense against extracellular pathogens by virtue of their production of IL-17 and IL-17F, and by mediating the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to infected tissues. Moreover, it has become evident that aberrant regulation of Th17 cells may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. 31 Th-17 cells are promoted by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in mice, and by IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 in both mice and humans. 11, 14, [31] [32] [33] Most people seem to be affected less severely and either remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms during COVID-19. 34 There is limited evidence regarding Th-17 cells and the related inflammatory cell profile in asymptomatic people; rather, elevated IL-17 serves as a biomarker of disease severity. 35 Moreover, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, APCs such as alveolar macrophages release IL-6, IL-23, and many more cytokines. Taking this a step further, following the binding of IL-6 and IL-23 with their respective receptors, 36 key factors in the polarization of naïve CD4 + T cells toward differentiation, as well as the maturation of Th17 cells, are signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors gamma (RORγ) and alpha (RORα). 14, 36, 37 In the lung alveoli, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 are produced as the signature cytokines by Th17 cells in response to polarizing cytokines secondary to presentation of viral infection ( Figure 1 ). 10, 36, 38, 39 Furthermore, Xu et al showed in a patient with severe COVID-19 that the peripheral blood had a strikingly high number of CCR6 + Th17 cells, 14, 40 further supporting a Th17-type cytokine storm in this disease. Elevated Th17 responses or enhanced IL-17-related pathways are also observed in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV patients. 18, 41 Inflammatory cytokines continue to be disordered, perhaps leading to lymphocyte apoptosis. Basic research has confirmed that TNFα, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines could induce lymphocyte deficiency. 42, 43 Collectively, the Th17-type response contributes to the cytokine storm in pulmonary viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2, which results in tissue damage and likely promotes pulmonary edema; therefore, targeting the Th17 pathway may benefit patients with a Th17-dominant immune profile. 44In SARS-CoV, it is immune dysregulation, rather than viral load, which results in aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by alveolar macrophages. As a new type of highly contagious disease in humans, the pathophysiology of the unusually high pathogenicity of COVID- 19 is not yet completely understood, 45 but most likely ARDS in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections is a result of exuberant infiltration of inflammatory cells responding to the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, and the subsequent synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines. 46 Among the many cytokines involved in the storm, IL-17 is a notable and predominant DovePress mediator of pulmonary inflammation. The pro-inflammatory properties of IL-17 also make it crucial to mediators of inflammation and immunopathology. 47, 48 IL-17 activates many signaling pathways, which in turn leads to the production of many other cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and TGF-β) and chemokines (including IL-8 and MCP1) from many alveolar cell types (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and macrophages). 44, 49 Among the chemokines, profoundly elevated G-CSF and IL-8 (CXCL8) lead to the recruitment of immune cells such as neutrophils to the inflamed area of the alveoli, and hence to dysregulated activation of immune cells, which results in a cytokine storm ( Figure 2) . 44, 50, 51 During IL-17 signaling, IL-17 family cytokines (IL-17A, Il-17F, and others) bind with both IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits to transduce signaling at the target cells and generate effector molecules. 52 Both receptors are engaged in Act1 as an adaptor molecule to recruit TRAF6. In turn, upon recruitment of TRAF6 and its ubiquitination (Act1 may indeed function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase), a cascade of molecular interactions is turned on, leading to the phosphorylation and consequent proteasomal degradation of IκB, ultimately allowing the nuclear translocation of NFκB and the activation of NFκB targeted inflammatory cytokine and chemokine encoding genes. 52, 53 In turn, the gene products of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are responsible for the cytokine storm. 49 Moreover, clinical symptoms of patients presenting with COVID-19 result from a consequent significant inflammatory cell infiltrate and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 54 In particular, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-8 are synergistically responsible for pulmonary fibrosis (promoting collagen deposition) secondary to aberrant fibroblast and epithelial cell function or pleural effusion of the lung, and viral persistence results in dyspnea and provokes SARS (Figure 2 ). 55 I suggest that the presence of these cells may be a primary driver of the signature pathology observed in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, IL-17-induced dysregulated and exuberant immune responses have been shown to potentially cause stage 3 (characterized by a hyperinflammatory phase, cytokine storm) COVID-19 disease, likely through increased pulmonary pathology or lung damage and diminished survival. 25, 56 COVID-19 is a global public health problem. 4 Currently, many different treatment approaches are under investigation and clinical trials are ongoing. There are currently no known specific treatment measures except for meticulous supportive care such as mechanical ventilation when indicated. 57 Taking the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus from the experience of the first SARS-CoV, it is clear that the exuberant immune response and inflammatory cell infiltration are the pathological mechanisms most responsible for the catastrophic death toll. 58 Among the anti-cytokines, monoclonal antibodies are a potential and possible approach to the prevention of SARS, although none is yet available for clinical purposes. Anti-IL-17A humanized monoclonal antibodies such as secukinumab (AIN457) (approved fully human IL-17-specific IgG1k monoclonal antibody) and Ixekizumab (LY2439821) (under a phase III clinical trial for psoriasis) are well-known and recognized treatment options for psoriasis. 44, [59] [60] [61] These anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies are also utilized in different inflammatory diseases, including ARDS, 13 rheumatism, 61 and pulmonary fibrosis. 62 Moreover, patients presenting with COVID-19 show elevated serum IL-6, which correlates with respiratory failure. 63 As discussed earlier, IL-6 plays a key role not only in the polarization of Th17 cell from naïve CD4 + T cells but also in promoting pulmonary inflammation in synergy with IL-17A. Indirectly, tocilizumab is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (also known as CAR T cell)-induced CRS, with confirmed efficacy and minimal side effects in hundreds of patients. 63 Taking this a step further, tocilizumab against IL-6 has been shown to be efficient for patients presenting with inflammatory rheumatism ( Figure 2 ). 61, 64, 65 In addition, IL-23 and IL-6 are involved in Th17 differentiation, and they act through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. This implies that STAT3 could be a potential target, at the convergence point of different upstream activators. On the other hand, the anti-JAK tofacitinib 56, 65 (oral inhibitor, selective for JAK1 and JAK3), is under a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic disorders as well as COVID-19. 66 JAK inhibitors interfere with phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and the production of downstream inflammatory molecules. Thus, anti-IL-17 (secukinumab) DovePress combined with blockade of IL-6 (sirukumab and siltuximab), IL-6R (tocilizumab), or JAK (baricitinib, selective for JAK1 and JAK2) may be beneficial in controlling the cytokine storm while boosting antiviral IFN-I responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 2) . 57, 66 In this review, I have discussed the current understanding of IL-17A signaling and the underlying immunopathological role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine during ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Profound elevation of IL-17A and downstream synergetic effector molecules such as cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα) and chemoattractants (IL-8 and MCP1) are indicative of both pathological progression and the severity of COVID-19. The synergistic interaction of IL-17A and IL-6 (required during polarization of Th17 cell) is the central player in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and an impaired respiratory system. Regarding therapeutic strategies, specific therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections and related complications remain challenging. Although there is limited research evidence, here it is proposed that anti-IL-17A (secukinumab), anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab), or an anti-JAK-2-STAT3 drug (baricitinib) as a promising therapeutic option to terminate pulmonary inflammation, could decrease dangerous cytokines and limit lung tissue pathology, and help to save life if used judiciously in appropriate COVID-19 cases.ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRS, cytokine release syndrome; IL-17, interleukin-17; JAK, janus kinase; RORγ/ α, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors gamma and alpha; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-10-06",10

Both changing case definitions (Tsang et al., 2020) , and a lack of access to testing can bias reported cause-specific mortality counts, as repeatedly noted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis (Kiang et al., 2020) . One approach to evaluating the magnitude of the bias in such burden estimates is by estimating the deviation of total number of deaths from the expected baseline levels of mortality from previous years, a measure called ""excess deaths"". By avoiding the issue of misclassification of deaths, this approach provides an upper bound on excess mortality directly due to the infection. Since both direct and indirect mortality (e.g., resulting from individuals being denied access to routine care) are included, the true direct burden may be lower than this estimate, but the combined quantity provides important policy information as to the overall severity and impact of the health crisis. This information may help target interventions, compare between subgroups of a population, locations or periods and draw lessons for management of future public health crisis (Dowd et al., 2020; Leon et al., 2020) .In the case of COVID-19, evidence from high-income settings indicates that the excess may amount to up to 700% above the expected mortalities of a locality, primarily concentrated in older age groups (Weinberger et al., 2020) . The rapid acceleration of the infection fatality ratio of SARS-CoV-2 with age has led to the suggestion that the mortality impact of the pandemic will be lower in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) with younger age structures (Dowd et al., 2020; Salje et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, the impact of comorbidities and disruption of other aspects of the health system might still drive considerable excess mortality (Rice et al., 2020) . However, to date, analyses of excess mortality have been largely confined to high income, western countries and cities (Marcon et al., 2020; Michelozzi et al., 2020; Signorelli et al., 2020; Sinnathamby et al., 2020; Weinberger et al., 2020; Woolf et al., 2020) in part because accurate data on mortality from previous years is required: few countries in lower income settings have statistical agencies and reporting mechanisms that have the capacity and infrastructure to report the number of people that died on a weekly or on a day-to-day basis.While death registration systems are often deficient at the national level, some urban centers maintain complete and up-to-date registers. In Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, detailed mortality data maintained since 1976 have provided a unique window onto questions ranging from the drivers of the epidemiological transition in low income settings to changes in seasonality in mortality across four decades (Masquelier et al., 2019; Schlüter et al., 2020) . This unique data opens the way to detecting disease driven-anomalies in mortality data in a lower income setting as was shown during the 2009 Influenza (AH1N1) virus pandemic (Rajatonirina et al., 2013) . However, the higher incidence of infectious diseases in such settings also drives strong background fluctuations in mortality (seasonal and often age specific) that must be accounted for, and might impede detection of mortality anomalies. For instance, Schlüter (Schlüter et al., 2020) et al showed that in Antananarivo, deaths in adults >65 years old peak during the austral winter months (June-September) while that of children peak in December -January. Therefore, an unexpected increase in mortality of elder individuals, concurrent with the decrease in mortalities of children or vice-versa may be inapparent or appear to be of a lesser extent when considering the entire population.Here, we apply classical statistical tools to this unique database to quantify excess mortality during a severe measles outbreak that occurred in 2018-2019. We use this as a foundation to explore the detection limits of the system during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging what is known about the mortality profile of COVID-19 in order to delineate the degree to which excess deaths would be detectable with the existing death notification system. Because death notification records for 2020 were unavailable to us at the time of writing, our analysis only lays the foundations for a retrospective analysis of the impact of the pandemic in a LMIC setting.Antananarivo-Renivohitra, the capital district of Madagascar, has a population estimated at 1 275 207 in 2018 (RGPH-3, 2018), of which 32.16% are under 15 years old and only 5.5% are over 60 years old. All residents' death records which include the date of birth, date of death, age and cause of death ascertained by a physician, covering the period from 2010 to 2019 were transcribed from registers maintained by the Municipal Office of Hygiene (BMH) of the city of Antananarivo.In order to establish the baseline death counts in Antananarivo in the absence of the measles outbreak, we fit an autoregressive quasi poisson and an autoregressive negative binomial regression model adapted for time series analysis (Liboschik et al., 2017) to the weekly counts of deaths between January 01, 2010 and the day preceding the detection of the first detected case of measles in the city (August 31st, 2018), separating the data into epidemiologically relevant age groups (0-14,15-59 and 60+ years old) based on known features of the epidemiology of measles. Short range serial dependence is captured by regressing on the previous weeks and the seasonality is captured by regressing on the conditional mean of 52 weeks (1 year) back in time. We also include a deterministic covariate to account for a yearly trend. For each age group, we compare the fit of the Poisson model with that of the negative binomial via the proper scoring rules and marginal calibration plots. We then fit different models in which we vary the number of weeks capturing the orders of autoregressive terms and include or exclude the seasonal and trend components. The best performing model was selected by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This model was then projected forward using one-week ahead projections for the duration of the measles outbreak (39 weeks) to forecast the expected number of deaths (and 95% Confidence Interval) in the absence of the disease. Excess deaths are detected when observed mortality is above the upper bound of 95% CI. To calculate the total outbreakattributable number of excess deaths, we subtracted the weekly model-predicted values from the observed number of deaths reported and summed across the duration of the outbreak.Using published infection fatality ratio from studies in France and China 5,6 and the age-structure of the population of Antananarivo from the 2018 census, we estimate the expected number of deaths per age category at a given prevalence of infection. The expected number of deaths per age category is given by the equation: n=Prevalence*Population of Antananarivo of age y*IFR at age y Finally, we estimate the prevalence of infections that will lead to mortality rates that are significantly above the expected baseline. Statistical analyses were performed in R and using the package 'tscount' (autoregressive negative binomial and poisson models) and mgcv.Between January 1st 2010 and December 31st 2019, 68 820 deaths were reported from residents of the Antananarivo Renivohitra district. Of these, 950 were of children (0-14 years old) during the measles outbreak spanning from September 01, 2018 to May 22, 2019.Our results indicate that the observed number of deaths recorded during the measles outbreak epidemic was significantly higher than expected, particularly in children (figure 1). Death counts of all ages and from all causes were significantly above the expected values during 10 of the 39 weeks of the outbreak starting on 2018-12-16. In contrast, when considering the younger age group (0-14 years old), most vulnerable to the disease, excess mortalities were detected as early as 2018-10-28 and were significantly higher than expected during 16 weeks with 39 deaths per week on average compared to the 18 deaths expected in each of those weeks. At its peak, the mortality rate of children during the measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value (47 deaths/ week). The total excess deaths for individuals younger than 15 years old during the measles outbreak period is estimated at 319. Of those, only 122 report measles as a cause of death. In adults (between 15-59 years old), mortality exceeded the baseline for 6 weeks starting on 2018-12-16 in the course of which, we estimate the excess mortality to be at 247 deaths but only 3 adult deaths recorded during the outbreak period were attributed to measles. No excess deaths were detected in elderly residents.This unique dataset allows us to establish the baseline of death counts for the population of Antananarivo in the absence of COVID-19 which is necessary to evaluate the burden of the pandemic on the population. Based on the model fitted to the data until December 2019, we estimated that the expected weekly number of deaths in adults of more than 60 years old, is 51 deaths per week with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 79 deaths per week. Therefore, an excess of 28 deaths per week or more of the elderly residents would be significantly higher than expected and detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo, Madagascar.Given the age structure of the population of Antananarivo (figure 2) and published estimates of the IFR (Salje et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020) , we computed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections that will directly lead to a detectable excess of mortality for each age group (figure 2).During outbreaks of deadly diseases, an increase in mortality is anticipated as a consequence of the disease itself and the potential disruption of the healthcare system. Here, we demonstrate detectability of the excess mortality from a measles outbreak in the capital city of Madagascar and establish a baseline to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population. First, our results show that the current death notification system can detect outbreak-driven anomalies in mortality and illustrate how the signal may be detected earlier in age stratified time series. Our results also suggest that the measles outbreak had a higher burden on the residents of Antananarivo than previously reported. Drivers of this excess mortality could include misclassification of the cause of death, indirect impacts of measles via disruption in the health provision or immunosuppression leaving individuals vulnerable to other infections (Mina et al., 2015) .Second, this unique dataset allows us to establish the baseline of mortalities for the population of Antananarivo in the absence of COVID-19 which is necessary to evaluate the burden of the pandemic on the population, provided that there are no massive in-out-migrations flows, due to the lockdown measures, and that the death reporting systems remains functional during the pandemic. We estimate that, given what is known to date about the infection fatality rate over age, it is virtually impossible for children's mortality to rise above the expected baseline (17 deaths per week 95%CI: 6-30) as a direct consequence of infection by SARS-CoV-2. In fact, given the current IFR estimates for this age group (0.0026% CI:0.0002-0.002%- Figure 2) , even if all of the estimated 247 000 children of less than 10 years old were infected, the excess mortality would not exceed the baseline death counts. Therefore, if any excess deaths are reported in this age category for the year 2020, they are likely to result from indirect effects of the pandemic on child mortality (Roberton et al., 2020) . In contrast, only 1% of the 47 575 individuals between 60 and 70 years old, would need to be infected with SARS CoV-2 in any given week to be subsequently detectable using the current death notification system.","Madagascar","abstract","2020-10-20",10

It causes severe viral pneumonia that has been designated COVID-19. Since December 2019, it has spread rapidly, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a worldwide pandemic in February 2020 (Mahase, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020) . On August 26, 2020, the WHO announced that 23.9 million people were infected and more than 820,000 had died Huang et al., 2020) .Because of COVID-19, medical schools have suspended their function and closed for this period, and some countries have applied social distancing measures and curfews. These preventive measures may have increased stress and psychological pressure on medical students as they are unable to complete their studies and are at high risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Lai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Reger et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Addressing potential stressors during this time is important; possible disease exposure, economic privatization, and decreased social support may carry an increased risk for suicide and decreased mental and physical performance (Chandratre, 2020; Ullah and Amin, 2020) .Medical students are at higher risk of depression and anxiety for several reasons, including mentally and emotionally demanding medical school programs (Wolf, 1994) , financial pressure, high workload, and sleep deprivation. In addition, exposure to sick and dead people can have a negative impact on their mental health (Wolf et al., 1988; Guthrie et al., 1998; Williams et al., 2005; Sreeramareddy et al., 2007; Boland et al., 2016) . These demanding conditions put students in high stress positions, with anxiety being reported in one-third of medical students worldwide, especially those who reside in the Middle East and Asia (Quek et al., 2019) . Other studies have reported a prevalence of up to 65.5% for anxiety and 66.5% for depression outside of North America (Hope and Henderson, 2014) .Medical schools in Libya use the 7-year program, comprising a preparatory year of biomedical science, followed by a 5-year program of 3 years of basic science and 2 years of clinical science, and 1 year of mandatory internship training.Since 2011, Libya has suffered from several civil wars and conflicts with militias, causing increased insecurity and financial crises, as well as the kidnapping, rape, and killing of innocent people (Zeiton, 2011) . Furthermore, the lack of funds for mental health services puts Libyan people at higher risk of mental disorders (Charlson et al., 2012; Abuazza, 2013; Rhouma et al., 2016) , especially in large cities. Conflicts in the country have caused more than 217,000 people to be internally displaced, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) report (Miller and Rasmussen, 2010; Reed et al., 2012; Newnham et al., 2015; UNHCR, 2020) . In addition, they have affected the medical education system in Libya, several medical schools were temporarily closed for several periods during the war, which resulted in delays in the graduation and medical education of thousands of medical students. These stressors can have substantial negative effects on the psychological statuses of students.Since the emergence of the first case of COVID-19 in Libya on March 24, 2020 (Elhadi et al., 2020a) , the number of COVID-19 cases has substantially increased in many cities, with up to 11,834 confirmed cases and more than 210 deaths by August 26, 2020. The unpreparedness of the Libyan healthcare system toward the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be explained by the large number of cases and shortage of medical supplies, as well as the ongoing conflict, have placed an increased burden on Libyan medical students and the general population; the civil war has caused a financial crisis and reduced the ability of the healthcare system to provide adequate training opportunities for newly graduated medical students (Elhadi and Msherghi, 2020; Elhadi et al., 2020b) . This, coupled with the closure of medical schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with extended electrical blackout issues, may have resulted in substantial frustrations and increases in anxiety and depression among medical students, especially for those in high-conflict areas or who were internally displaced from their homes.Today's medical students are tomorrow's doctors; therefore, their mental wellbeing is crucial. However, few studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of medical students (Cao et al., 2020; Soled et al., 2020; Ullah and Amin, 2020) . There is an urgent need to perform highquality research and collect data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health (Holmes et al., 2020) . Therefore, we aimed to determine the psychological status of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya and determine factors associated with depression and anxiety among Libyan medical students.This is a cross-sectional study of medical students from 15 medical schools and colleges in Libya, located in the main cities. Data were collected from April 20, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Data were collected in paper and electronic forms using anonymous surveys that were sent to medical students by email and through the social media groups of medical students. The questionnaires were anonymous to ensure the reliability and correctness of the data, and were sent to more than 3,500 medical students. To avoid observer and selection bias, the survey was blinded: for the paper survey, the students completed the survey anonymously without identifiable data and left the completed paper survey at a designated collection point in each medical school to avoid any potential bias. For the online version, the students were asked to fill out the survey anonymously without identifiable data.Active medical students who were currently enrolled in medical schools were included, while those who were not currently enrolled in medical school were excluded. Those with a previous history of mental illness or missing data were excluded from the study. Students of any age and gender were included. The survey was conducted in the following cities: Tripoli, Al-Zawia, Misrata, Sebha, Gharyan, Albayda, Benghazi, Al-Khums, Tarhuna, Alzintan, Tobruk, and Sabratha.The questionnaire was divided into three parts. The first part contained demographic characteristics, including age, gender, year of study, availability of steady financial sources, living status (living alone or with family), presence of friends or family infected with COVID-19 infection that they know, and occurrence of internal displacement due to the civil war.The second part was comprised of the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. This tool includes questions regarding seven anxiety symptoms and their frequencies within the last 2 weeks. It has a specificity of 82% and a sensitivity of 89% (Spitzer et al., 2006; Toussaint et al., 2020) , and has been validated in several previous studies and has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.83-0.93). In each of the questions students were asked to rate symptoms using a 4-item Likert scale of 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half of the days), and 3 (nearly every day), with a total score of 0-21 (Ruiz et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2019) . A score of 0-4 was regarded as normal, 5-9 was regarded as mild, 10-14 was regarded as moderate, and 15-21 was regarded as severe (Kroenke et al., 2007) . A GAD-7 score of ≥15 was regarded as the cutoff score to detect anxiety symptoms (Spitzer et al., 2006) .The third part consisted of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), which is a validated 9-item questionnaire to assess depression severity in individuals. It has a specificity of 85% and a sensitivity of 88% (Levis et al., 2019) . Each of the 9-item questions rates depression using a 4-item Likert scale of 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days), and 3 (nearly every day), with a total score of 0-27 (Kroenke et al., 2001) . A score of 0-4 was regarded as minimal, 5-9 was regarded as mild, 10-14 was regarded as moderate, 15-19 was regarded as moderately severe, and 20-27 was regarded as severe (Urtasun et al., 2019) . A PHQ-9 score of ≥15 was regarded as the cutoff score to detect depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001; Levis et al., 2019) .The independent-samples t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the means of the two groups. The chi-square test for association was used to determine the association between categorical groups. Spearman's rankorder correlation was used to determine the association between continuous/ordinal variables. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 25.0).The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committee on human experimentation with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Bioethics Committee at the Biotechnology Research Center in Libya. All participants provided consent before participating in the study.A total of 2,430 out of 3,500 students completed the survey. Of these, 1,327 (54.6%) were from the University of Tripoli. The mean age of the study participants was 23.30 ± 2.61 years, and 734 (30.2%) students were in the 5th year of their medical course. The vast majority (1,919 out of 2,430 [78.97%]) were female, and 511 (21.03%) were male. Table 1 provides the demographic characteristics of the study participants.Anxiety Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the GAD-7 scale, and participants were classified into four grades, as shown in Table 2 . The GAD-7 score ranged from 0 to 21, with a median of 6 (IQR, 4-10), while the mean (+ SD) score of anxiety symptoms determined by the GAD-7 was 7.2 (5.1). A total of 268 (11%) students had a GAD-7 score of ≥15, which is indicative of PHQ-9 score (mean ± SD) 9.76 ± 6.34 9.86 ± 6.31 9.38 ± 6.44 0.913 GAD-7 score (mean ± SD) 7.22 ± 5.08 7.35 ± 5.06 6.75 ± 5.13 0.848 *Significant at P < 0.05. **Significant at P < 0.001. Table 3 demonstrates the relationship between the baseline characteristics and different degrees of anxiety. Anxiety was significantly associated with living status and internal displacement (P < 0.05). Students living alone had a higher prevalence of anxiety. In addition, students internally displaced due by the civil war were more statistically associated with anxiety symptoms than were non-displaced students. The gender, age range, year of study, having a steady financial income, and having family members or friends infected with COVID-19 were not statistically associated with anxiety symptoms (P > 0.05). Spearman's correlation was used to assess whether there was a relationship between anxiety score and study characteristics, and there was no statistically significant correlation between the anxiety score determined by the GAD-7 scale and the age (r s = -0.030, P < 0.141). However, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the anxiety score and the year of study (r s = -0.41, P = 0.042).The PHQ-9 scale assessed depression and participants were classified into five grades, as shown in Table 2 . The PHQ-9 score ranged from 0 to 21, with a median of 9 (IQR, 5-14), while the mean (+ SD) score of depressive symptoms determined by PHQ-9 was 9.7 (6.3). A total of 525 (21.6%) students had a PHQ-9 score of ≥15, which is indicative of moderate to severe depression. Additionally, 855 (35.2%) of the medical students had mild (PHQ 5-9) depressive symptoms. Suicidal ideation was present in 552 (22.7%) students, as follows: 342 (14.1%), several days; 90 (3.7%), more than half of the days, and 120 (4.9%), nearly every day. Table 2 provides the frequencies of each grade of depression according to the PHQ-9 categories. Depression was only statistically associated with year of study (P = 0.009), where medical students in higher years of study had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to those in earlier years. However, gender, age range, steady financial income, living status, internal displacement, and having a family member or friend infected with COVID-19 were not statistically associated with depressive symptoms (P > 0.05). Spearman's correlation was used to assess whether there was a relationship between the PHQ-9 depressive score and age and year of study. The results showed that there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the year of study and depression score (r s = -0.76, P < 0.001). For the age of the participants, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between age and depression score (r s = -0.054, P < 0.008). Table 4 presents the depression grades of study participants in association with COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic and civil war in Libya has likely had psychological effects on medical students, which can be demonstrated by the high level of anxiety and depression shown in this study. The study determined the psychological status of medical students during the civil war conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. The results demonstrated that 64.5% of students had different degrees of anxiety. Of these, about 11, 16, and 37.5% reported severe, moderate, and mild anxiety symptoms, respectively. In addition, 21.6% had moderate to severe depression symptoms, and suicidal ideation was present in 552 (22.7%) participants. The high level of anxiety and depression might be related to the civil war (Wells et al., 2011) , and overwhelming and exacerbating news that increases their fear of the virus (Ayittey et al., 2020) , transmission to family or friends, virus complications, and psychological pressure due to quarantine and isolation (Burtscher et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Molica et al., 2020; Xiao, 2020) .Libyan medical students are exposed to high levels of psychological stress owing to civil war conflicts, resulting in a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression. It is important to note that 294 of the medical students who answered the survey have been internally displaced owing to living in a conflict zone. These students have had to leave their homes and move to a relative's house or their families have had to find another place to live temporarily. This increases psychological stress; these students' families will be under higher financial pressure owing to them being forced to rent, and due to the fact that these students are at high risk of being kidnapped or killed and their home and belongings stolen or destroyed in the conflict. A previous study conducted on Chinese college students during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated that 0.9, 2.7, and 21.3% had severe, moderate, and mild anxiety, respectively (Cao et al., 2020) ; this is lower than our study findings. However, Cao et al. (2020) focused on undergraduate students with no emphasis on the year of study, which varies according to our study findings, as it can play a role in terms of anxiety and depression levels; medical students in higher study years display greater stress and anxiety due to the increased work and study load (Chandavarkar et al., 2007) . According to our study, having family members or friends infected with COVID-19 was not significantly associated with anxiety, which is not consistent with previous reports (Cao et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020) . A previous meta-analysis of 69 studies on anxiety among medical students found a pooled prevalence of anxiety of 33.8%, which is similar to our study; the study demonstrated a higher prevalence among Middle Eastern and Asian medical students, which might be due to cultural issues and the stigmatization of mental disorders (Quek et al., 2019) .Our study showed that depression symptoms were associated with the year of the study; those in a higher year of their studies demonstrated a higher prevalence. This is similar to previous studies in Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Thailand, which have also reported that students in higher academic years demonstrated a higher prevalence of psychological morbidities (Supe, 1998; Saipanish, 2003; Shaikh et al., 2004; Sreeramareddy et al., 2007) .Our study showed that 525 (21.6%) of the students were depressed, and suicidal ideation appeared in 552 (22.7%). A previous study in Vietnamese students, which was regarded to have a higher prevalence rate than previous reports, indicated a 15.2% prevalence of depression and 7.7% prevalence of suicidal ideation (Pham et al., 2019) . In a recent study among 2,562 Saudi medical students with a similar gender distribution, a total of 15.9% were found to have moderately severe (PHQ-9 = 15-19) depressive symptoms, while 11.6% had severe (PHQ-9 = 20-27) depressive symptoms, which is similar to our results (Alharbi et al., 2018) . In a study conducted in the United Arab Emirates, 32.1% of medical students showed evidence of psychiatric distress (Ahmadi et al., 2012) . Using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), another study on Syrian medical students found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was up to 60.6% and that of anxiety 35.1%, which were higher than those in our study. They also found a higher prevalence among those with ""insufficient"" personal income (Al Saadi et al., 2017) . In Iraq, prevalence of anxiety and depression of 62.5 and 52.1%, respectively, using the DASS-21 questionnaire, were reported (Rasheed and Hussein, 2019) . Both Iraq and Syria have similar life stressors to those in Libya, with higher prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical students.In a systemic review and meta-analysis of 167 cross-sectional studies and 16 longitudinal studies regarding medical students' depression and suicidal ideation, a prevalence of depression of between 9.3 and 55.9% was revealed across the studies. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was present in 11.1% of the students among the included studies (Rotenstein et al., 2016) which is lower than our study where we found that 22.7% of participants have suicidal ideation.The strengths of this study are in its adequate sample size and wide representation from 15 different universities and colleges around Libya. Moreover, this study focused on medical students' anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on several factors, such as internal displacement, financial, and conflict-related factors that are relevant to the students' current state, with special circumstances regarding the civil war and ongoing conflict.One of the limitations of this study is its cross-sectional design, which prevents the building of causal relationships. Another limitation is the predominance of the female gender in the study, which may affect the distribution of the results. Furthermore, there might be a selection and interview bias, as the medical students received the survey by email and social media. In addition, this study did not address other factors, such as family history of mental illness, nor other socio-demographic factors, such as emotional trauma.Our study highlights that the mental health of medical students in Libya is at risk, especially under the stressful conditions of the civil war and COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, this can be attributed to several factors, including the year of study, age, psychological stress due to the civil war, living with family members or friends with COVID-19, internal displacement due to conflict, and living either with family or alone. These stressors may have long-term effects on their future careers as doctors, which necessitates combined efforts and determined actions to support medical students and provide help for their families. The government should implement strategies aimed at providing mental health support for students to improve healthcare outcomes and decrease the risk of suicide, training attrition, and long-term mental illness during this critical time.The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the Biotechnology Research Center in Libya.ME analyzed, interpreted the data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

COVID-19 presents with a wide range of illnesses ranging from self-limiting respiratory tract illness to multi-organ failure and ultimately death, especially in individuals having comorbidities. A common pathophysiologic dynamic is the utilisation of host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) to initiate direct viral invasion and gain access into target cells [3, 4] . Mechanistically, the host serine protease TMPRSS2 activates SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein after binding to the ACE-2 receptor [4, 5] .A large number of deaths from COVID-19 pandemic have occurred in the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Italy, Iran and Spain, with relatively fewer deaths recorded in Africa. Of over 25 million confirmed cases globally, with more than 840 000 deaths across 213 countries, over 27 700/1 187 786 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 2.34%) have been recorded in 55 African countries as at 23 August 2020 [6] . The relatively lower toll of COVID-19 in Africa may be due to differences in genetic or climatic factors, or perhaps the epidemic is just beginning to burgeon on the continent. The debate around the pandemic response on the continent has mostly focused on the potential implications of standard public health measures of physical distancing, given the socio-economic peculiarities of the continent [7] . However, there has been limited exploration of the impact of differences in epidemiology of key comorbidities, and related healthcare factors, in shaping the course and parameters of the pandemic, particularly severity and prognosis of the infected cases. In this paper, we summarise what is known about (a) the pathophysiological processes underlying the interaction of coinfections and comorbidities in shaping prognosis of COVID-19 patients, (b) the epidemiology of key coinfections and comorbidities, and the state of related healthcare infrastructure that might shape the course of the pandemic on the African continent; and (c)implications of (a) and (b) for pandemic management and post-pandemic priorities on the continent (Table 1) .Evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among patients with existing infections with other pathogens is slim. While elaboration of the pathophysiological processes shaping prognosis is an ongoing endeavour, it is widely noted that patients with comorbidities and those with low immunity are more likely to have a worse prognosis and an increased risk of death when coinfection with other viral respiratory pathogens or secondary microbial pathogens occurs.Malaria is an endemic disease in the tropical regions of the world. An estimated 228 million cases and about 405 000 deaths were attributed to malaria globally in 2018 with the African region accounting for 93% (213 million) of these cases [8] . The majority of malarial morbidity and mortality are associated with Plasmodium falciparum which is predominantly found in Africa [8] . Children aged 5 years and younger are the most vulnerable age group affected by malaria although this age group has been relatively spared of COVID-19 mortality and severe morbidity so far. Of note, recent data suggest that COVID-19-infected children are often mildly symptomatic and are considered less important spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 than adults [9] .As COVID-19 cases continue to rise globally, there is increasing concern that a more severe COVID-19 course could be seen among malaria-infected individuals. However, the clinical and immunological responses of malaria-infected patients to COVID-19 are yet to be specifically investigated. The potential for the disruptive effect of COVID-19 on health systems which are most fragile in malaria-endemic countries, potentially undermining malaria treatment and prevention effort in these countries, is also of concern [10] . In addition, malaria and COVID-19 have some common symptoms such as fever, headache and body weakness and aches. Therefore, malaria endemicity may complicate clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in areas where access to testing is insufficient.The under-diagnosis of non-malarial aetiology of acute febrile illness (AFI) in sub-Saharan Africa is common [11] [12] [13] . In Nigeria, up to 83% of children <5 years of age who were managed for acute febrile illness were still treated as malaria cases despite negative microscopy for Plasmodium [14] . Other studies have shown that locales in highly endemic areas for malaria maintain a low level of parasitemia without clinical symptomatology [15] . Thus, even in the presence of malaria parasitemia, clinical symptoms might still be due to coinfections. Therefore, the possibility of a patient suffering from both malaria and COVID-19 should always be explored using valid diagnostic tests [16] .The comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza and other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses exacerbates the conditions of COVID-19 patients [17] .The host factor enhancing the initiation of the viral pathogenesis and spread is the localisation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor in several parts of the human body including the respiratory tract, small intestine epithelial cells and immune cells. Coinfection often results in pneumonia, hypoxia, dyspnoea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, shock and ultimately death [18, 19] .In a study reported by Kim et al. (2020) , the most prevalent respiratory tract viral coinfections in COVID-19 patients were enterovirus/ rhinovirus (6.9%), RSV (5.2%), non-SARS- [20, 21] . Also, Richardson et al.(2020) reported coinfection in COVID-19 patients including entero/rhinovirus (52.4%), coronavirus (non-COVID-19) (16.7%) and respiratory syncytial virus (9.5%). Furthermore, malaise exacerbation and ground glass opacity with partial filling of the lung alveoli were reported in cases of coinfection with COVID-19 and influenza [22, 23] . The pathophysiological effect of such coinfection involves SARS-CoV-2 attacking type II pneumocytes, the alveolar epithelial cells that produce surfactant which helps to reduce surface tension in the alveoli. Decreased surfactant production leads to subsequent alveolar collapse and decrease in lung compliance, which is critical to normal lung function, resulting in hypoxia and severe tachypnoea. It is noteworthy that the acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19 pneumonia is somewhat atypical with a relatively higher lung compliance compared to severity of hypoxaemia seen in typical acute respiratory distress syndrome [24] . As the inflammation from COVID-19 infection progresses, collapse of more air sacs sets in and the pneumonia worsens with accompanying hypoxia and hypoxaemia. About 20% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients progress into a secondary and deadlier stage of the lung injury with breakdown of alveolar membrane and capillary barrier, alveolar fluid infiltration or pulmonary oedema and CO 2 accumulation leading to hypercapnia with accompanying dyspnoea followed by acidosis, with ultimate acute respiratory failure [25, 26] . According to the WHO report, 20% of COVID-19 patients had severe (dyspnoea and lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field) and critical (respiratory failure and septic shock) morbidity that resulted in hospitalisation requiring oxygen and ventilation, with an average of 20 times mortality rate more than seasonal influenza mono-infection while over 80% of them died as a result of underlying disease/comorbidity [27, 28] .Other studies have also suggested that coinfection of respiratory tract viruses with SARS-CoV-2 may influence morbidity and mortality [29] [30] [31] . This may be due to immune dysregulation by the underlying viral diseases.The outcome of viral pneumonia may be complicated by coinfections with other microbial agents. Studies have shown that patients with influenza respiratory tract infections had poorer clinical outcome when bacterial agents such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) complicated the primary state [32] [33] [34] [35] .A study conducted by Golda et al. (2011) using human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), a leading cause of viral croup in children, revealed enhanced binding of S. pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in culture [34] . While the clinical significance of this study is not clear, secondary bacterial infections coexisting with viral pneumonia particularly in high-risk groups such as the elderly and young children have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality [34] .With the current COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiological data on secondary microbial agents associated with morbidity or mortality in infected patients are scarce [5] .In a recent review of 24 studies, mostly from Asian countries, UK and the United States, Langford et al analysed non-duplicate data from 3338 COVID-19 patients, which revealed that bacterial infection was more common in very ill patients [36] . Patients with bacterial coinfection represented 6.9% of their studied population [36] . The authors also noted that bacterial agents such as S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, which are frequent secondary bacterial agents of infection in viral illnesses, occur infrequently in this cohort of COVID-19 patients; the most common bacterial agents were however not stated [36] . In their conclusion, Langford et al stated that bacterial infections were not a frequent occurrence in patients with COVID-19; thus, antibiotics should be used only when indicated.In another cohort of 3834 COVID-19 patients from 30 studies from China, United States and Spain reviewed by Lansbury et al, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Chlamydia specie, Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscencens were common bacterial agents associated with coinfection [37] . Further review of their data showed fungal agents such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida glabrata were associated with secondary fungal infection, while respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus were reported as viral coinfecting agents in 14 studies [37] . The authors noted that bacterial coinfection occurred in 7% of the total studied population and concluded that bacterial coinfection is not a frequent finding with COVID-19 patients. S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were noted as less important bacterial agents of coinfection [37] .In a retrospective analysis of data of another cohort of 989 COVID-19 patients from Spain, Garcia-Vidal et al reported the predominance of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae as bacterial agents of coinfection in patients with community acquired infections, while P. aeruginosa and E. coli were predominately associated with hospital acquired bacterial superinfections [37, 38] .There is still paucity of data on microbial coinfection agents complicating the clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 patients in Africa. A recent case report from Morocco presented a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who developed infective endocarditis while being managed; the patient had pre-existing medical conditions as noted in the report. Blood culture yielded coagulase-negative staphylococcus species [39] .Zhou et al reported sepsis as the most common complication leading to death [5] . Half of the patients who died had secondary infections [5] . The microbes associated with these patients, the antibiotic treatment guidelines deployed and the susceptibility profile of the implicated agents were not indicated in the report.Data from available studies show that most coinfections occur in critically ill patients and those with preexisting medical conditions. These group of patients will require invasive medical interventions that will further pre-dispose them to nosocomial pathogens. It may thus be postulated that secondary microbial coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 may reflect the prevailing agents of nosocomial infection in the managing facility.Limited data in the literature on the guidelines steering laboratory investigation for coinfection in the various published cohort studies continue to be a recurring issue. Superimposed bacterial infection is common in viral pneumonia; however, due to our incomplete and evolving understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 and the patient population at risk of severe infections, common bacterial and fungal agents in the African context, as well as their susceptibility profiles, need to be urgently investigated. This will help in effective management of patients and judicious use of antimicrobial agents.In addition to coinfections and superimposed infections, SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms can be mistaken for other common illnesses such as gastroenteritis. Although the frequency and volume of diarrhoea reportedly associated with SARS-CoV-2 is less than in Vibrio cholerae infection, without a high index of suspicion and adequate testing, an assessment of other differential diagnoses of infectious diarrhoea may be made. Cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 also presents like sepsis and can be misdiagnosed as superimposed bacterial infection in low resource settings where acute illness care may be administered by low skilled health workers.Before the current pandemic, HIV/AIDS control was mainly hampered in the African region by coinfection with tuberculosis. It has been speculated that the immunodeficient status that influences the vulnerability of HIVinfected people to TB could also increase their susceptibility to COVID-19 [40] .In a recent study using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, the authors demonstrated an increased expression of ACE2 in specific cells of human lung tissues during HIV and TB coinfection compared to uninfected controls suggesting a potential higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among these HIV/TB coinfected individuals [41] . However, the actual response of HIV and TB coinfected individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown.There is currently no epidemiological relationship between HIV and COVID-19, even though people living with HIV have been regarded as a vulnerable group for COVID-19 [42] . The lack of an increase in COVID-19 incidence among HIV-infected individuals relative to the general population especially within the extremely high HIV endemic areas of Africa may either be a testament to a highly successful COVID-19 infection prevention protocol or may question the hypothesised vulnerability of people living with HIV to this novel virus. Nonetheless, UNAIDS has warned that older people living with HIV or those with HIV and heart or lung disease may be at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe morbidity [43] .Clinical reports from China suggest that HIV-infected individuals especially those on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can recover from COVID-19-associated pneumonia without severe complications [44] [45] [46] . As most African countries continued to restrict movement due to the pandemic, the potential impact on HIV and TB control and care delivery services, especially in African countries with the most fragile healthcare systems, will likely be damaging. Majority of people were likely unable to travel to clinics or health centres to get medical supplies such as HIV and TB medicines, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), condoms, contraceptives, sterile needles and syringes [43] . WHO has recommended dispensing of HIV medicines for three months or more, community access to HIV and TB treatment and a proper understanding of how to contact clinics by telephone as measures to prevent unnecessary exposure to COVID-19 infection while accessing necessary care and supplies [43] . Besides, people living with HIV can draw on their resilience, surviving and thriving to support their families and community to manage the potential fear, anxiety and stigma associated with COVID-19 [39] specially in sub-Saharan Africa.It is widely noted that pre-existing non-communicable conditions worsen the prognosis of COVID-19 infections particularly in patients with cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic conditions. The incidences of these conditions have been on the rise in Africa due to increasing adoption of western lifestyles. Fragility of health systems in most African countries may limit continuity of care for chronic diseases due to disruptions in routine health service provision as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.In Africa, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing [47] making it imperative to understand how obesity may influence the trajectory of COVID-19 on the continent. Early reports from Europe and China have shown higher prevalence of obesity among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 or who develop adult respiratory distress syndrome [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . These studies either had limited data to adjust for key confounders, or inadvertently blocked any plausible causal path from nutritional status to COVID-19 disease severity [53] .Our understanding of the pathology of obesity and COVID-19 suggests a plausible causal relationship between the two. First, early studies suggest that cytokine release syndrome is central to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 [54] , associated with extensive inflammation and destruction of pulmonary tissue [5, 18] . IL-6 is produced by multiple cells in the body including adipocytes, and its levels are likely elevated in obese individuals [55] . Second, adipose tissue may be a reservoir for viral replication and shedding [56] .Epidemiological phenomena may also account for the increased association of COVID-19 with worse outcomes among obese patients. First, obesity is associated with elevated risk of multiple comorbidities which are themselves associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. Second, obesity is associated with certain socio-economic disparities that have been shown or can be reasonably expected to lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes. In highincome countries, the burden of obesity is greater in the lower socio-economic strata and in neighbourhoods with poor access to healthcare infrastructure. The extent to which obesity may modify the clinical trajectory of the disease in Africa is unclear due to differences in obesity epidemiology, and population studies are warranted.The prevalence of undernutrition among Africa's children [57] and elderly is particularly high [58] [59] [60] , and could complicate COVID-19 outcomes in Africa. First, early reports suggest that elderly people are at greater risk of adverse outcomes following COVID-19 [61] , and undernutrition is likely a key mediating factor [61] [62] [63] . Undernutrition may also contribute to high mortality among patients with chronic illnesses such as malignancies. Primary studies of undernutrition in COVID-19 among the elderly have however determined nutritional status based on serum levels of albumin or prealbumin [5, 63, 64] . Concentration of both biomarkers is reduced in acute infections, requiring cautious interpretation for nutritional assessment [65] . None of these studies also adjusted for potential confounders.Undernutrition in a state of immunodeficiency [66] and a significant adverse impact on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely. Protein energy malnutrition is associated with anaemia, susceptibility to infections and immune dysfunction [67] . Production of immune cells is lowered, and response to antigens from pathogens and vaccines is weakened [67, 68] . In addition, undernutrition is often accompanied by multiple micronutrient deficiencies. Micronutrients act as cofactors for multiple enzymes in the body and may reduce viral replication and improve overall outcomes [69, 70] .Finally, there is potential for reverse causation in the relationship of COVID-19 and undernutrition. Animal studies have shown that coronavirus infections could lead to weight loss, from catabolic processes unmatched by dietary replenishment [71] [72] [73] [74] . Well-designed population studies may clarify the role of undernutrition in COVID-19.COVID-19 has been shown to have particularly worse outcomes in patients with chronic medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease [75, 76] . Preliminary data from a recent study in China [77] that evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection showed that 31% of patients had comorbid hypertension and up to 15% had cardiovascular disease (CVD).Pathophysiological pathways noted in COVID-19 patients are similar to those observed in patients with cardiovascular diseases even without COVID-19 infection. Hence, COVID-19 infection may intensify the process in patients with cardiovascular disease. The worse prognosis of COVID-19 infection seen in CVD patients might also be an epidemiological phenomenon since CVD is relatively prevalent among those who are generally pre-disposed to increased severity of infections such as the elderly, diabetics, obese and people with impaired immunity [76] .Cells with abundant and upregulated ACE-2 receptors such as cardiac cells are more susceptible to increased COVID-19 viral load with increased severity of injury from the viral infection. These receptors are upregulated in conditions with excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) like ischaemic heart disease, hypertension (HTN) and congestive heart failure (CHF) [78, 79] . Once ACE-2 receptors bind to SARS-CoV-2, they are no longer available to facilitate breakdown of angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent vasoconstrictor.Significant elevation of cytokines and chemokines has been reported in patients infected with SARS-CoV which is very similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection [77] . Cytokine release syndrome, the excessive and uncontrollable release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a result of inflammatory response triggered by stimulation of the immune system, was identified as a negative prognostic factor in hospitalised SARS patients [77] .It is estimated that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10-15% of the global population [80] , while patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection have shown varying degrees of renal involvement [81] . The uniform pathway through which SARS-CoV-2 exerts renal injury continues to be debated. A recent study reported that the human kidney, which has ACE2 expressed on the surface of its cells, is a unique target for SARS-CoV-2 [82] . Further, it has been noted that renal infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to direct tubular injury as well as glomerular damage [81] [82] [83] . However, more recent reports suggest that cytokine effect and heightened immune responses mediate the injuries noted in the kidneys of COVID-19-infected patients [84, 85] .Patients with underlying kidney disease and those undergoing dialysis were found to have increased mortality when infected with SARS-CoV-2 [86] . This should be viewed in the context of the increased risk of infection caused by a weakened immune system in patients undergoing dialysis [87] . Likewise, acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported to occur in approximately 25% of patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection [5, 88, 89] . Metabolic and fluid balance derangements arising from AKI often require optimisation with renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities, in which case continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been recommended to be a preferred RRT choice to limit healthcare personnel exposure risks to COVID-19 [90] [91] [92] [93] .Further, the RRT option utilised to manage COVID-19 patients presenting with AKI depends on the patient's clinical status, availability of suitable technology and the availability of necessary skill set which is often deficient in African settings. Data on the outcome associated with RRT provision for AKI in COVID-19 positive patients indicate a reduced risk of mortality in patients treated with CRRT [94] . Nonetheless, patients who develop AKI in the context of COVID-19 infection should be followed up for renal function monitoring after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 because a history of AKI pre-disposes to repeat AKI and CKD [95] [96] [97] .Data from countries where COVID-19 infection has been studied revealed that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of contracting the infection [98] . The CDC and other policy makers continue to make improvements to recommendations on how to safely provide dialysis to COVID-19 patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings [93, 99] . Most African countries are resource-limited and face challenges in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure, as well as renal replacement therapies essential for ESRD management [100] . The lack of necessary infrastructure to meet the needs of the chronic dialysis-dependent population in Africa makes the situation more dire in the context of the ongoing pandemic. This raises concerns about capacity to adopt the model of treatment being implemented in medical facilities providing dialysis treatment to patients in the United States during this pandemic. In such model, there is the creation of a separate shift or different unit where COVID-19 patients are dialysed. Similarly, patients classified as symptomatic persons under investigation (PUI) are dialysed in cohorts [101, 102] . This model demands additional resources and infrastructure which is quite lacking in most African countries.Liver injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is defined as any liver damage occurring during disease progression and treatment of COVID-19 in patients with or without pre-existing liver disease [103] . COVID-19 liver infection has been postulated to involve direct viral entry which is mediated by ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes [104] . Despite prior evidence of viral infection of liver cells in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [105] , recent studies have reported the absence of acute or chronic liver failure in COVID-19 patients [18, [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] . In addition, liver biopsy reports of COVID-19 patients revealed microvascular steatosis as well as lobular and portal activity which indicates that liver dysfunction could have resulted from either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury [112] . Given the equivocal explanation for liver dysfunction seen in COVID-19-positive patients [64, 103, 112] , there is paucity of specific recommendation for the management of liver impairment in COVID-19 patients. As such, management focuses on regular monitoring of liver biochemistries, general supportive care and trial of medications targeting the modulation of the ACE2 receptor [64, 103, 113, 114] .Globally, liver disease accounts for approximately 2 million deaths per year with a high prevalence of viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury [115] . In Africa, there is rampant use of herbal preparations to manage illnesses due to cultural factors and poor access to healthcare services. The use of such herbal remedies may inadvertently lead to hepatic injury. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues across the world and across Africa, there is a tendency for the African populace to manage the presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection with local remedies for which a hepatotoxicity profile has not been characterised. As such, liver impairment from hepatotoxic herbal remedy ingestion may manifest in African patients when admitted to the hospital for COVID-19.Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia due to defects in insulin secretion and/or action [116] . It is one of the fastest growing global health emergencies of the 21st century affecting 463 million people in 2019 and it is projected to reach 578 million people by the year 2030 [117] . The disease affects 19.4 million people in Africa and results in the death of about 366 200 individuals annually. Out of 100 diabetic patients in the world, four of them are Africans [117] .Diabetes is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by multiple metabolic and vascular abnormalities which affect response to pathogens. Hyperglycaemia promotes increased synthesis of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, in addition to stimulating the production of adhesion molecules that mediate tissue inflammation [118, 119] . This inflammatory process may contribute to the underlying mechanism that leads to a higher propensity for infections with worse outcomes in patients with diabetes.The first line of defence against COVID-19, innate immunity, is compromised in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia thereby allowing unhindered proliferation of the pathogen within the host. Even short-term hyperglycaemia has been shown to transiently stun the innate immune system [120] . Moreover, diabetes mellitus is characterised by exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response notably interleukin IL-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a in the absence of appropriate stimulation [121] . This may be further exaggerated in response to a stimulus as seen in patients with COVID-19 [122] .In type-2 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation favouring the development of a hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state are also part of the pathogenesis of other chronic conditions and may aggravate the condition of diabetic patients with COVID-19.Previous studies reported that diabetes mellitus worsens the prognoses for different viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [122, 123] . Individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of infections including influenza and pneumonia which makes it imperative that such people are vaccinated against these infections [123] . In addition, diabetes mellitus is a major contributor to mortality from COVID-19 ranging from 7.3 to 35.5%. Similarly, reports have shown that diabetes mellitus is an independent contributing factor to the severity of complications experienced by COVID-19 patients [63, 88, 118, [124] [125] [126] . This is an indication that diabetic patients infected by COVID-19 are pre-disposed to severe complications and mortality, just like other previous coronavirus diseases.The COVID-19 pandemic has advanced to community transmission stage in many places in Africa. The impact of comorbidities on infection-fatality rate has been widely noted in other regions that are in more advanced stages of the pandemic. As Africa learns from such regions, the response to the ongoing pandemic and planning for postpandemic programmes should take into consideration peculiarities in the epidemiology of comorbidities and coinfections, relevant pathophysiological and healthcare delivery factors with potential to impact pandemic dynamics and post-pandemic effects, as well as a critical need to generate empirical data on the predictors of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Improved diagnostic and management protocols for acute febrile illness, and access to diagnostic facilities not just for SARS-CoV-2 but also other viral infections are of importance. Chronic non-communicable diseases have been noted to have significant influence on COVID-19 prognosis although these conditions account for a relatively lighter burden in Africa. The burden is growing and the fragility of care delivery systems implies that adjustments to clinical procedures and re-organisation of care delivery that have been useful in other regions are unlikely to be feasible. Africa is a large region with local variations in factors that can shape pandemic dynamics and a one-sizefits-all response will not be optimal but there are broad lessons relating to differences in epidemiology and healthcare delivery factors that should be carefully considered as part of a regional COVID-19 response framework.","Nigeria","first author","2020-10-23",10

The other clinical manifestations also include muscle ache, myalgia, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting (3) .Based on the WHO situational report, this infection is responsible for the morbidity of more than 20,439,814 people and 744,385 deaths globally. Across national authorities, more than 916,644 cases and 17,557 deaths have been reported in the African regions. In Ethiopia, a total of 25,136 confirmed cases and an estimated 463 deaths have been reported (4) .Despite the less number of cases reported from the region and the alternative case management, the potential spread of this outbreak in less developed countries, like Africa would pose a serious challenges to control due to the shortage of health professionals, less functional health facilities, lack of diagnostic tests kits, lack of protective equipment and overall weak health service delivery system. Moreover, these less developed countries contain large populations who exercise different lifestyles and cultures. One such situation is where these communities live in over-crowded conditions with restricted implementation of physical distancing. Apart from these challenges, the operating health facilities that exist in small numbers are already overcrowded by patients with pneumonia, malaria, Tuberculosis, acute diarrhoea and malnutrition. There would be insufficient capacity to accommodate such an epidemic as COVID-19 (5) . Moreover, citizens of these countries who are mostly uneducated are less likely to follow the public health advice on prevention and control of the infection. Besides that, cultural and traditional barriers associated with controversial health myths and low health-seeking behaviors remain challenging in such trying times (6) .The pastoral communities contain people with high mobility due to their means of livelihood, which is largely dependent on rearing livestock. The livestock mainly includes camels, cattle, goats and sheep. In Africa, more than 268 million people live as pastoralists or nomads. These lifestyles remain the most feasible options of livelihood for these vulnerable and under-served communities. However, some developing countries have stepped-up to curb the spread of the infection into their countries by taking different preventive measure like closing the borders and limiting the inter-country mobility of the population. As it is a matter of livelihood which depends on the extent and magnitude of the transmission.The pastoral way of life and mode of production is extremely threatened by the newly emerging diseases and recurrent natural disasters. Having said that, these communities are vulnerable to spread of infections, malnutrition and injuries. Most of the health emergencies occur in these community due to the low utilisation of services, living in far-to-reach areas and lack of infrastructure. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Moreover, due to their high mobility and frequent movements, access to health services is challenging and disease surveillance is minimum or absent. Therefore, detection of cases and response mechanisms is often delayed leading to the rapid spread of the infection. Such public health threats could exacerbate the health conditions of these population particularly in a time of drought when these communities relocate to semi-urban areas and villages in search for better life. A large pastoral community that lives in Sub-Saharan Africa, is more likely to spread the infection to the agrarian population or city dwellers due to high crowdedness in urban areas (5) .The eastern lowland of Ethiopia is also a home for millions of a pastoral community where their main source of food security, nutrition, wellbeing and most importantly financial income depend on livestock. Due to climate change, these communities are facing serious food insecurity and frequent famines. They are also suffering from a wide range of health problems including infectious diseases, acute malnutrition, injuries and loss of life due to conflicts on scarce rangelands and water resources.Their sufferings are due to low awareness, poor health-seeking behavior, limited access to health services and lack of public infrastructures are the main challenges. Thus, to address the existing main knowledge gaps and identify research priorities, the World Health Organization (WHO) has initiated global research and innovation. WHO, thereby, proposed to conduct a feasibility study in the most needed and privileged far-to-reach areas for prevention and control of this epidemic (7). Therefore, this paper aims to highlight the possible gaps, control and practical management of COVID-19 from the pastoralist perspectives in Ethiopia, as little is known about the vulnerability of these people to this infection.The sickness and wellbeing of human and animal are inter-linked and associated with each other.Globally, some of the outbreaks that have emerged in the last few decades reflected in a rise of infections among humans contracted to in contact from animals (8) . The pastoral community are at a higher risk of contracting zoonotic diseases for various reasons. There is no recently established evidence that reveals the acquisition of SARS-CoV from dromedary animals, yet gene isolates obtained from these viruses indicate that such animals could remain a host (9) . The risk of such zoonotic infections remains very high due to the close and direct contact of animal herders with their livestock during milking, slaughtering, assisting delivery and feeding or indirectly through consumption of the animal products. In general, a study on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus has identified dromedary camels which is the primary livestock for pastoral people as the main reservoir for coronaviruses (10) . Since prior evidence suggested that camels were the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof presumed reservoir for MERS-CoV (11) , hence, possibilities of SARS-CoV evolving from animals is inevitable.Recent evidence suggested that intensive animal husbandry and uncontrolled food consumption of animal origin could be a major contributor to the spread of the infection (9) . Moreover, the direct contact with these animal husbandry like camels by the pastoral community is accounted as a major exposure and risk factor for the viral transmission to humans (10) .Although the number of predicted cases due to the exposure to infected livestock could be less in Table 1 . Table 1 : Potential challenges of prevention and control of COVID-19 in developing countriesLimited public awareness The existence of other health myths and misconceptions that are commonly practiced (6) Lacking information about treatment (5) Poor access to health services Accessibility to medical facilities (13) High mobility and remoteness to reach (14) Practice to follow alternative and traditional medicine (15) Low physical health service coverage Poor sanitation and hygiene (21) Over-crowded conditions (22) Lack of clean water Thus, this approach holds supplemental importance for the pastoralist community whose main livelihood depends on livestock which is severely threatened by climate change and impacts on the environment. Considering the seriousness of COVID-19 outbreak, its public health importance is taken into account by implementing the following the proposed prevention and control mechanisms.The emergence and development of this epidemic require effective and relevant strategic disease prevention and control measures. Recent calls have been made for the application of One HealthApproach for different justified reasons. This approach attempts to mitigate and coordinate the strategies from multi-sectorial and overlapping disciplines. Several studies have suggested the application of this approach due to its comprehensive and holistic features (24, 25) . Hence, it is substantially more applicable for the proposal of preventive measures on pastoral communities taking in to account the One Health research frame-work (26) .(1) An improved surveillance system in domestic and livestock animals through the active engagement of pastoral health extension workers and mobile health teams with a proficient orientation on One Health Approach. This was profoundly recommended in some studies that suggested the application of One Health for enhancing COVID-19 surveillance (27) .

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread very quickly and the world needs to prepare for the prevention of the pandemic. 3, 4 The COVID-19 epidemics are mainly associated with respiratory diseases and symptoms range from mild to severe illness and are mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, sore throat and rhinorrhea and sometimes hemoptysis. 5 To date, no successful treatment or vaccine has been used for COVID-19. Therefore, the only intervention is the implementation of preventive measure to control the infection of COVID-19. 6 A study in China showed that residents had a high level of awareness of the main symptoms, transmission routes, use of masks, hand washing and treatment information for COVID-19, while a low level of awareness of the atypical symptoms. Also, 92.6% of the subjects thought that the outbreak was scary and 71.9% of the residents were satisfied with the local epidemic control measures. 7 Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are reported helpful for Chinese to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. 8 The presence of COVID-19 in low-and middleincome countries raises pressing issues about the effective pandemic response and preparedness in the setting of fragile health systems. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed that basic disease prevention and control systems are insufficient in terms of human resources and laboratory testing capacity. 9 Being the most populous African nation, Ethiopia could certainly be associated with a higher risk of increased morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Thus, there is a need to examine knowledge, attitudes and practice, and associated factors towards the COVID-19 pandemic especially for religious clerics and traditional healers (THs). Because attitudes and practices shared by the religious clerics and THs could be widely adopted by large numbers of community members in Ethiopia. They have also contact with a large number of clients and followers. Therefore, targeting this population would be essential in order to develop an effective intervention plan and propose an effective policy.The study was conducted in Gondar town, located in the regional state of Amhara and approximately 741 kilometers northwest of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19 and its associated factors among religious cleric and THs from 25 May to 30 June 2020.Religious clerics and THs, who were aged 18 years and above living in Gondar town were included in the study after written informed consent was obtained. Eligible religious clerics and THs living in the selected sub-city of Gondar town at the time of data collection, who were willing to participate and willing to provide appropriate information, were included in the study. Individuals who were not willing to take part in the study, individuals with mental disabilities and those who were unable to provide adequate information were excluded.Religious clerics are religious leaders who conduct ceremonial religious services in churches and mosques, advise individuals or families in times of distress, and sanctify marriage and birth. THs, referred to as those who practice a wide range of spiritual healing, healing, surgical, and preventive practices locally. Because religious rituals are deeply rooted in healing practices in Ethiopia, a boundary demarcation between clerics and THs is difficult. Religious clerics and THs were therefore allowed to self-identify when they had both clerical and healing functions. 10 Therefore, THs with clerical function were categorized as dual Traditional healers, THs without clerical functions were categorized as sole traditional healers, and clerics without traditional healing function were categorized as sole clerics.The data collection tool for the assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19 was based on the questions adapted from published literature 9, 11, 12 and by the recommendations of WHO and Communicable Disease Control (CDC). 3, 13 Finally, 46 questions were generated to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 using a closed-ended questionnaire.The questionnaire was divided into 4 portions: the first portion deals with socio-demographic characteristics; the remaining three portions contain questions on the assessment of participants knowledge (16 questions), attitudes (14 questions) and practices (16 questions) of the religious submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 clerics and THs. Each response was scored as ""1"" for the correct/positive response and ""0"" for the incorrect/negative response. Knowledge, attitudes and practice scores of individuals were calculated to give the total knowledge, attitudes and practice score. Then negative attitudes, poor knowledge and poor practice levels were categorized based on a 60% Bloom's cutoff point. 6 A pilot study was done on 22 religious clerics and the reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α) (Cronbach's alpha (α) for knowledge, attitudes and practice were found to be 0.826, 0.744 and 0.704 respectively). 14 Face validity was performed to evaluate the comprehension towards understanding of the questionnaire and to assess how important it was to target study participants. A revised version of the questionnaire was developed based on the feedbacks from face-validation. Finally, the questionnaire was modified and re-evaluated to fit the study population based on the feedbacks of the pilot study. The data generated from the pilot study and incomplete responses were excluded from the final analysis.Four sub-cities (Jantekel sub-city, Mahal Arada subcity, Azezo Tseda sub-city and Maraki sub-city) were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Eligible religious clerics and THs living within the selected sub-cities were enrolled using simple random sampling technique.Data were collected by trained data collectors through face-to-face interviews using constructed questionnaire. The interview was completed in accordance with the WHO standard for the prevention of COVID-19. The questionnaire was first prepared in English and then translated into local Amharic language with the assistance of a language expert. The collected data were checked daily for consistency and accuracy.The cleaned data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 software. Numerical data were summarized as means and standard deviations and categorical variables were summarized in frequency and percentage and the result was presented using tables. Knowledge, attitudes and practices scores were calculated to give the overall knowledge, attitude and practice score. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with good knowledge, good attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. The variables in the bivariable analysis with p < 0.25 were entered in the multivariable logistic regression. 15, 16 Crude odds ratio (COR) and the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) were used to measure the strength of association. Besides, the Pearson correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice scores was assessed. Finally, P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.A total of 410 religious clerics and THs were included in the study with a response rate of 97.1%. Of these, 323 (78.7%) were sole religious clerics, followed by the dual traditional healers 65 (15.9%), and 22 (5.4%) were sole traditional healers. Of the total study participants, 122 (29.8%) were between 31-45 years age group with a mean age of 47 ±17 (µ± SD). Also, the majority of the study participants were male 379 (92.4%) and 294 (71.7%) were living with more than two family members (Table 1) .Out of the total study participants, 60.7% (95%: CI (56--65%)) had a good knowledge toward COVID-19 with a knowledge mean score of 10.22 ± 3.4. Almost all 404 (98.5%) of religious clerics and THs had heard about COVID-19, whereas only 148 (36.1%) knew that the disease was a viral illness and 249 (60.7%) knew it could be fatal.Besides, more than one third of participants were not aware of the importance of facemask usage 196 (47.8%), physical distancing 148 (36.1%) and quarantine or isolation 201 (49%) for COVID-19 prevention, while more than three fourths 308 (75.1%) were aware of the importance of proper hand washing for COVID-19 prevention. In addition, 321 (78.3%) of the participants were aware of the main transmission routes and 369 (90%) were also aware of at least one sign and symptomof COVID-19 ( Table 2) .The bivariate analysis showed that sex, age, educational status, marital status and presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with the knowledge score. In multivariate logistic regression: age, educational status and marital status were significantly associated with the knowledge level of participants towards 6 .57 (AOR=6.57; 95% CI: 2.00-21.52) times higher knowledge score compared with those study participants whose educational status was to unable to read and write. Moreover, married participants were 2.82 (AOR=2.82; 95% CI: 1.13-7.03) times higher knowledge score compared with separated and or widowed participants (Table 3) .Only 34.1% (95%: CI (30-39%)) of the participants had a positive attitude score towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19, and the mean attitude score was 6.5 ± 3.3. More than two thirds of 273 (66.6%) of the study participants believed that they would recover if they had acquired COVID-19 and only 155 (36.1%) of the participants perceived that they were at risk of infection. Less than half of participants believed that practicing physical distance 181 (44.1%), avoiding mass gatherings 189 (46.1%) and avoiding touching eyes, mouth and noses 175 (42.7%) with the unclean hand, was necessary for COVID-19 prevention. The majority of the respondents believed that COVID-19 was due to the punishment (Table 4 ). In the bivariate analysis; sex, age and marital status were found to be significantly associated with attitudes towardprevention and early detection of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis showed that age and married participants were significantly associated with a positive attitude towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. Participants in the 18-30 and 30-45-year However, sex, the number of family members and the presence of underlying disease were not significantly associated with the attitude level of participants towards COVID-19 pandemic (Table 5 ).Of the total participants, 15.6% (95%: CI (12-19%)) had good practice towards the prevention and early detection of COVID-19 with a mean practice score of 4.69 ± 2.9. Two thirds (65.5%) of the study participants reported proper hand washing practice. However, less than one third of the participants practiced physical distancing 115 (28%), avoided mass gatherings 105 (25.6) and 73 (17.8%) used facemasks properly in the weeks before. The majority of the study participants, 402 (92.6%) did not practice dietary balance and hygiene, 402 (98%) did not perform regular exercise and were extremely scared about COVID-19,338 (82.4%) ( Table 6 ) In the bivariate analysis; age, educational status, marital status, number of family members and presence of underlying disease were found to be significantly associated with practice score towardprevention and early detection of COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, educational status and presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19.The odds of good practice among 18-30 and 31-45 years age groups were 4.75 (AOR=4.75; 95% CI: 2.04--11.08) and 4.37 (AOR=4.37; 95% CI: 1.33-14.33) times higher compared to above 60 years age groups, respectively. Also, participants who were able to read and write, completed secondary school and university/college were had 4.03 (AOR=4.03; 95% CI: 1.35-12.04), 4.15 (AOR=4.15; 95% CI: 1.28-13.24) and 5.42 (AOR=5.42; 95% CI: 1.24-23.76) times more likely to have good practice towards COVID-19 compared to participants who were unable to read and write. Moreover, the study participants with the known underlying disease were 5.2 (AOR=5.2; 95% CI: 2.66-10.04) times higher good practice than those with without known underlying disease (Table 7) .In addition, the Pearson correlation revealed that there was a positive correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice scores towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. (between knowledge and practice (r = 0.294, p < 0.001), between knowledge and attitude (r =0.708, p < 0.001), and between attitude and practice scores (r = 0.327, p < 0.001)).The current study was conducted among religious clerics and THs respondents who are in close contact and widely accepted by a large number of community members and/or customers.Most of the participants (60.7%) had a good knowledge toward prevention and early detection of COVID-19. This finding was consistent with a community-based binational survey in Egypt and Nigeria (61.6%). 17 However, this finding was lower than studies in Ethiopia, 6,18-21 China 8 and Iran. 11 The discrepancies may be due to differences in socio-demographic factors, such as educational status, sample size and study population. In the current study, only 26.3% of the study participants had completed secondary school and higher education.Almost all, 98.5% of religious clerics and THs had heard about COVID-19, which was higher than studies in Ethiopia (91.2%), 18 Nepal (91.6%) 22 and the Philippines (94%). 9 This may be due to the difference in the time of the study and the current study was conducted late after a lot of information was disseminated to the population compared to those studies. However, about one third of the participants (36.1%) reported that virus is the cause of the COVID-19. And this finding was lower than studies in Cameroon (77.1%) 23 and Nigeria (91.9%) 12 of the participants reported that COVID-19 is caused by a virus. The possible reason for the disparity may be that half of the study participants did not have formal education and also, they have no access to newspapers and the Internet. This reflects limited COVID-19 information updates on preventive measures through government officials, social media and the Internet.Age was significantly associated with the knowledge level of participants towards COVID-19. Participants of the 18-30 years age group were three times more knowledgeable compared to the over 60 years age groups. This finding was supported by the studies done in Ethiopia, 6 Egypt 24 and China. 25 However, the current finding was submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 inconsistent with the study done in Saudi Arabia, which showed that the older age participants were significantly associated with good knowledge. 26 This may be because a significant numberof older age participants in the current study were unable to read and write. In addition, agingassociated loss of cognition, loss of hearing and visual ability might be challenging to read or understand new information updates. These conditions are considered a challenge to access to information and result in poor knowledge.In addition, participants who completed primary school, secondary school, college and above were significantly associated with higher knowledge score compared to those who were unable to read and write. This finding was supported by the study conducted in Iran in which the lower level of education was significantly associated with lower knowledge scores. 11 This may be due to the fact that individuals with higher formal education would be selfsufficient and more likely to receive different sources of information updates than those unable to read and write participants. Access to reliable information could help prevent misinformation, misconception and ignorance about the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition, married participants were significantly associated with higher knowledge and attitude score compared to widowed and separated study participants. This may be due to the fact that most married participants could share additional information with their partner. In addition, the lack of shared information, motivation and responsibility from the partner in unmarried participants may have an effect on the level of knowledge.About one third (34.1%) and one sixth (15.6%) of the participants had a positive attitude and good practice score towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19, respectively. This finding was much lower than previous studies in Ethiopia, 6, 19, 21, 27 China, 8 Iran 11 and a binational survey in Africa. 17 This may be due to difference in the level of education, age group and access to information such as newspapers and internet. In this study, significant numbers of study participants were older age and had no formal education that could affect the level of knowledge and attitude towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19.Regarding attitude, about half of participants had a positive attitude towards physical distancing (44.1%), facemask use (51%) and avoiding mass gatherings (46.1%) for COVID-19 prevention. This finding was much lower than the study in India 28 and Nigeria. 12 This may be due to differences in educational status that may have an effect on the level of attitudes. In addition, religious clerics and THs have had strict adherence and beliefs in GOD and traditional medicines, which may have an effect on the level of attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures.In the current study, only 28% and 17.8% of religious clerics and THs practiced physical distancing and facemasking, respectively. This finding was far lower than that of studies in Ethiopia, 6, 18 Malaysia, 29 Nepal 22 and the binational survey in Africa. 17 Furthermore, 47.8% practiced proper hand washing and only 25.6% avoided mass gatherings in the weeks before. This finding was much lower than studies in Ethiopia, 6,18 the Philippines 9 and Malaysia. 29 This may be due to the difference in the level of education, age group, information seeking behavior and access to information which could affect the level of practice. In this study half of the study participants did not have formal education and these participants had limited access to COVID-19 information updates on preventive measures. In addition, significant numbers of participants were old age group which have agingassociated loss of cognition and loss of hearing and visual ability which might be challenging to read or understand new information updates. These factors could result in poor knowledge and practice. This might be due to the reason that knowledge is the main modifier of attitudes and this could affect the level of practice towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. Moreover, the majority of the study population may believe that God will prevent them from contracting COVID-19 infection and fail to practice properly.In this study, the odds of good practice in the 18-30 and 31-45 age groups were 4.75 and 4.37 times higher compared to above 60 years old age group, respectively. These findings were consistent with the Iran study in which poor practices were associated with older age. 11 This may be due to the majority of the older age group participants (68%) had no formal education in the current study, which may affect the level of knowledge, attitude and practice. Since the Pearson correlation showed that knowledge, attitude and practice scores were positively correlated, the effect on the level of knowledge also had an impact on the level of practice.In addition, participants who were able to read and write, completed secondary school and university/college scored 4.03, 4.15 and 5.42 times more likely to have good practice scores, respectively, compared to those who were unable to read and write. This finding was in agreement Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress with the studies in Ethiopia 6 and Iran. 11 Moreover, the study participants with known underlying disease were 5.2 times more likely to have good practice compared with participants without known underlying disease. This may be due to the fact that individuals with higher formal education would be self-sufficient and more likely to receive different sources of information updates than those unable to read and write participants. As a result, access to reliable information could help to improve preventive practices, because knowledge is positively correlated with practice score. In addition, participants with known underlying disease had more access to health education and had more health concerns that would help to have better practice score than those without underlying disease.The positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, attitude-practice and knowledge-practice in this study reaffirm the relationship between knowledge attitude and practice towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. It is concluded that good knowledge can lead to a positive attitude, resulting in good practices. The findings are in line with the results of previous studies in Nigeria and China. 12,30 A person's intention to a specific behavior is a function of their attitude towards that behavior. 31 In the current study, the practices related to prevention and early detection of COVID-19 were dependent on the attitude of the participants. In addition, the attitude was shaped by the knowledge they possess towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. Hence, it is inferred that good knowledge leads to a positive attitude and this positive attitude brings about a good practice.The response of the participants might be affected by the interviewers' bias, and the cross-sectional nature of the study did not show the cause and effect relationship.More than half of the participants had good knowledge towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. However, less than one fourth and about one third of the participants had a good practice and attitude scores, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression: age, educational status and marital status were significantly associated with good knowledge score. In addition, age and marital status were significantly associated with a positive attitude score and age, educational status, and the presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with good practice scores.The sensitization program should be in place to fill a gap in the knowledge, attitude and practice measures of COVID-19, specifically older age groups and those unable to read and write. Since, the attitude and practices shared by religious cleric and THs could be widely adopted by a significant number of community members in Ethiopia. Therefore, targeting this population would be essential in the fight against COVID-19, which would enable the dissemination of reliable information about COVID-19 among followers and or customers. The findings of the study could contribute to the design and implementation of COVID-19 prevention strategies.

Most models predict that without intervention, the majority of the global population will become infected and tens of millions will die as a result of the pandemic [1] . There have been particular concerns for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [2] [3] [4] , as the major factors that drive high burdens of other infectious diseases, such as the environmental and socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems, are equally relevant to the threat of COVID-19. However, so far, the perceived burden of COVID-19 in SSA is low compared to expectations both from epidemiological models and from epidemic patterns in other regions of the world [5, 6] . Though SSA comprises 11% of the global population, it comprised only 3.6% of the total global COVID-19 incidence during the first 5 months of the pandemic, much of which was due to case reports from South Africa [7] . As of July 2020, most SSA countries are reporting fewer than 100 new cases daily [8] . There are three leading potential explanations for the lower observed burden of COVID-19 in SSA: 1) low case detection, 2) region-specific epidemiology (e.g. different R 0 ), and 3) early implementation of effective policy interventions. The important difference among these alternative explanations is that explanations based on low case detection and effective interventions imply that there will be a major resurgence if interventions are relaxed, while explanations based on region-specific epidemiology allow for a safe reopening.The lower-than-expected number of reported cases may be due to low detection and reporting rates. RT-PCR laboratory capacity in SSA is limited [9] and many countries have among the lowest testing rates in the world [8] . Moreover, health-care access for fever and respiratory infections is low [10] , which means that many symptomatic cases will not be detected, and the stigma associated with COVID-19 could further reduce health-seeking behaviors [11] .The epidemiology-based explanations for low COVID-19 cases are based on considerations of wellestablished factors: warmer climates, younger age distributions, and lower contact rates due to lower population density and transportation infrastructure in rural areas [12, 13] . In addition, there is considerable interest in the potential immune-mediated consequences from living in a system with greater exposure to other infectious diseases and related prophylaxis and therapeutics [14] . For example, there are major trials underway on the effects of trained immunity due to the BCG vaccine, which may increase innate immunity against a range of respiratory infections [15] . However, many of these hypotheses have recently come into doubt. The pandemic phase of COVID-19 is driven by high susceptibility, not climate [16] , suggesting that warmer, humid climates will not decrease transmission at this time. Further, past outbreaks of influenza, including the 1968 pandemic and 2009 H1N1 outbreak, spread throughout the African continent and were not limited by sparse transportation networks [17] . Explanations based in region-specific epidemiology are therefore only weakly supported.The policy response in Africa has also been a source of considerable optimism [5, 18] . African governments implemented early and strong non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies that may have effectively contained disease transmission [5, 19] . The first case of COVID-19 was reported in SSA one month later than the first cases in Europe, allowing countries to prepare and implement NPIs, particularly lockdowns, social distancing, masks, and regulated domestic travel, during the early stages of the pandemic [3, 19, 20] . Beginning in June, several SSA countries began relaxing lockdown NPIs in response to the economic and social costs of lockdown given the low reported case numbers. As partial lockdowns have been lifted, some countries' case rates have remained stable, while others have begun to increase, leading to the WHO to urge caution and emphasize the need for a gradual and conservative release of confinement measures in SSA [21] .It remains unknown whether SSA-specific conditions will result in different epidemic dynamics in SSA than elsewhere, and whether the current lower-than-expected case burdens can be explained solely by detection rates and policies. To explore these issues, we compare COVID-19 reported case data with predictions from a simple Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model for Madagascar that integrates age-structured social contact matrices and fatality rates, assuming a basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2.5 [22] [23] [24] (Appendix A). We then consider possible levels of detection or NPI effectiveness that could explain the current state of the epidemic, and whether those levels are plausible given Madagascar's policies, demographics, and environmental context. Finally, based on these explanations and the model framework, we investigate possible transmission scenarios for the first year of the epidemic. In particular, we examine the future of COVID-19 dynamics and control in Madagascar, which could be applicable to other SSA countries. Importantly, this simple model serves as a tool to further support the qualitative evidence outlined below, rather than as a predictive technique.Madagascar's demographic, economic, and health system profile is comparable to many other SSA countries [23, 25, 26] . It shares most of the major infectious diseases of mainland Africa (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases), and has recently endured among the worst epidemics of plague and measles in decades [27, 28] . Like other SSA countries, Madagascar reported its first imported case relatively late, on 20 March 2020, and the government implemented NPIs early in the epidemic (Table 1) . Madagascar instituted a national lockdown on 23 March 2020, three days before its first case attributed to local transmission. Testing practices are also similar to those in other SSA countries, initially focusing on screening for imported cases and eventually expanding to test contacts of known cases for local transmission.We illustrate that the current incidence of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be explained by the early and effective implementation of NPIs and low case detection rates, both of which are supported by strong anecdotal evidence. In contrast, arguments of regional-specific epidemiology are based on correlational observations that have yet to be proven. This suggests that the epidemic could grow in Madagascar, and similar countries in SSA, and that these populations remain at risk of an impending health crisis. Our model indicates that, if NPIs remain enforced at the level needed to explain current case burdens, nearly 50,000 lives could be saved. Even with NPIs, 30% of the Malagasy population could become infected by March 2021, making COVID-19 the leading killer in Madagascar over this epidemic period, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.By July 2020, the simple forecast for an unmitigated epidemic predicts a daily incidence of 34,322 cases, which is nearly 500 times the reported daily incidence of 71.71 (7-day rolling average) ( Figure 1(a) ). Simply accounting for detection rates between 0.1% and 1% results in predictions that closely approximate the reported daily incidence of COVID-19 cases in Madagascar (Figure 1(b) ). Are these low levels of case detection reasonable? For countries where per capita testing is over 100-fold higher than in Madagascar (79.1/100,000 population in July 2020), it is estimated that less than 10% of COVID-19 cases have been detected [29] . Though the precise case detection rates for Madagascar cannot be discerned from available data, there are a number of indicators suggesting that these are lower than the already low rates of Europe or the US. First, case definitions in Madagascar may be stricter than elsewhere. In June 2020, about 12% of suspected cases tested were confirmed by RT-PCR in Madagascar compared to a positivity rate of less than 5% in Europe and the US over the same period [30, 31] . In July 2020, this positivity rate was as high as 50% in Madagascar [32] . This suggests strict criteria for test eligibility (e.g. requiring symptoms and known positive contacts) is being used in Madagascar and many cases could potentially be missed. Further, strict diagnostic criteria may be a result of the original testing policy of Madagascar early in the epidemic, which required that suspected cases first test positive with antibody-based rapid detection tests (RDTs) before being confirmed through RT-PCR tests. The low probability of detection of antibodies early in the infectious period (i.e. the first week of symptoms) and the high rate of false-negatives with RT-PCR later in the infectious period (i.e. after 7-10 days post symptom onset) [33] create a short window for detection.Second, the Madagascar health system itself is only receiving a portion of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. The proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is estimated to be between 40% and 45% [34] . In Madagascar, surveys indicate that 40.2% of people with respiratory infection symptoms seek healthcare [35] , implying that over 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections may not even enter a public health facility. For COVID-like symptoms, this rate could be much lower given the stigma associated with the disease [11] . The combination of the high proportion of asymptomatic cases and low healthseeking behaviors suggest that, even if health centers test 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases attending a health facility, this would detect less than 25% of symptomatic cases.Finally, there is limited diagnostic testing capacity in Madagascar, with RT-PCR testing available in five laboratories across three major cities. It is unlikely that health facilities in rural areas of the country, where nearly 50% of the population lives, are testing such a high percentage of cases. We can account for all of these factors to estimate an upper bound of detection rates for Madagascar (strict case definitions (0.3) x low proportion symptomatic (0.45) x low healthcare-seeking behaviors (0.2) x limited testing infrastructure (0.25)) to reasonably explain a detection rate in Madagascar of 1% or lower.A reduction in transmission rates of 30%, relative to an unmitigated scenario, can also explain the daily case report rates of COVID-19 in Madagascar (Figure 1  (c) ). This reduction could be the result of NPI policies put in place in Madagascar or of innate characteristics affecting the epidemiology of COVID-19 (e.g. baseline contact patterns, climate, etc.). NPIs were implemented within three days after the first confirmed imported case of COVID-19 in the country (Table 1) , the majority of which focused on restricting intercity travel on roadways and included lockdowns in population centers. In contrast, the UK instituted a partial-lockdown on 23 March 2020, 52 days after the first confirmed case in the UK on 31 January 2020. The road system of Madagascar is highly fragmented, with most travel on a limited number of paved national roads that run North-South through the capital. Restricting travel on these roads has the potential to be highly effective in reducing human mobility in Madagascar, and therefore the spread of COVID-19. Further, most travel involves major population centers, particularly the capital city, Antananarivo [36] . These cities had much more stringent NPIs put in place early in the epidemic, including city-wide lockdowns and curfews (Table 1) , and the targeted lockdown of these population centers could have reduced spread to the rest of the country. While mobility data is not available for Madagascar, other SSA countries have reported reductions in mobility ranging from 1.4% in Zambia to 19% in Senegal compared to pre-NPI levels [37] . In addition, Madagascar enforced the universal use of face masks in the first month following confirmation of the first cases, an intervention that is gaining increasing international consensus in the fight against COVID-19 [38] . With a sparse road network that is well regulated in Madagascar, in combination with city-wide temporary lockdowns and universal use of masks, 30% represents an obtainable reduction in contact rates.Because NPIs were implemented early in the epidemic, their effects on transmission cannot be disentangled from baseline contact patterns in the country, which may be lower than those of Europe or the US. Nearly half (47.73%) of the Malagasy population lives in rural areas, and most of the country is over 3 hours from a population center with more than 50,000 people [39] . Therefore, baseline contact patterns in the rural areas of Madagascar may be reducing disease spread in a way that is unidentifiable from the effects of NPIs.The evidence presented here provides no indication that the epidemiology (e.g. R 0 ) of COVID-19 is fundamentally different in a fairly typical SSA country than elsewhere. We demonstrate that the current trend in reported cases in Madagascar can be explained by its early stage in the epidemic, combined with low detection rates and lower transmission rates from NPIs (Figure 2(a) ). Understanding how much of the discrepancy between predicted and reported case burdens is due to low detection rates or NPIs has enormous implications for our expectations regarding the 'true' burden of COVID-19 in Madagascar. For this, we explored different combinations of detection rates and NPI efficacy that explain the observed trend in reported cases, together with associated predictions of epidemic morbidity and mortality burdens (Figure 2 ). If the low number of reported cases is due primarily to a low detection rate, we predict over 13 million people could be infected with the virus if NPIs are not in place (Figure 2(c,d) ), imposing a huge burden on an already weakened health system. On the other hand, if the low number of cases is due to a reduction in contact patterns, the model predicts a lower total burden of approximately 8 million people infected with the virus (Figure 2(c,d) ). If NPIs are driving these contact patterns and are responsible for the lower-than-expected . High NPI effectiveness would thus require relatively high detection rates to explain the data based on these standard models. Similarly, if NPI were not effective, then the data could be explained with low detection rates. (b) Total cases after 1 year (approximating the final epidemic size) and (c) total deaths that correspond to the combination of NPI effectiveness and detection rates that explain daily cases in A. Shaded diamonds correspond to specific scenarios explored in panel D, illustrating the dynamics of detected infections, all infections, and cumulative deaths over the first year of the epidemic. case burden, the lifting of these restrictions is very likely to lead to an uncontrolled outbreak.The initial modeling exercise was finalized on July 3 2020, using case data from March 20 2020 through June 27 2020. Following the initial publication review period, we re-evaluated the three scenarios considered in Figure 2 (d) to understand whether these hypothesized explanations for low case numbers continue to explain epidemic dynamics in August 2020. While the current 7-day incidence rates do fall within the prediction bounds of the three scenarios, the epidemic curves do not align with reported case data ( Figure 3 ). The current wave of infections has a decreasing trend, having peaked in late July, while the earliest peak in our scenarios was in October 2020. This suggests that the NPIs may have been more effective than our initial exploration exercise suggested, as our model framework required an NPI efficiency of 60% to suppress, rather than delay, the epidemic. Alternatively, it could reflect a transient phase in the epidemic. By mid-August, more than 75% of cases were reported in the densely populated Analamanga Region, which includes the capital city of Antananarivo. Countries with high heterogeneity in connectivity, such as Madagascar, may experience earlierthan expected peaks in the initial wave of the epidemic, with longer tails as asynchronous outbreaks occur in lessconnected regions of the country [40] . This heterogeneity in connectivity may have similarly increased NPI effectiveness above the levels explored in our initial model, and will likely play a large role in determining epidemic dynamics as COVID-19 spreads into more rural areas of the country. Our model served as a tool to support the feasibility of proposed hypotheses in their explanation of the lower-than-expected case rates in Madagascar at the beginning of the epidemic, and its parameters are not fit to data from Madagascar. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our model to predict the immediate trajectory of the epidemic in Madagascar. Further modeling efforts are needed to incorporate human movement and regional heterogeneities in key parameters (e.g. contact and testing rates) to provide a more accurate picture of the epidemic. In addition, representative seroprevalence surveys can help fit model trajectories at particular points in time to better understand the evolution of the epidemic.Although the global epidemic began several months ago, current infectious disease models for Madagascar and other SSA countries rely on limited data, resulting in disparate predictions. Pearson et al. [25] predicted a similar epidemic size for Madagascar as our model in an unmitigated scenario, with 75% of the population and nearly 100,000 deaths. In contrast, an analysis led by the WHO [12] predicted a total case burden nearly one third of this size (26% of the population) and only a fraction of COVID-19-related deaths (1, 500) . This study assumed that the regional particularities of SSA will decrease disease transmission and fatality rates based on country-specific proxies for these factors, such as climate, transportation networks, and contact matrices. Importantly, this study only considered reductions in transmission via reduced risks of exposure, with a maximum of 2.6% of the population of Madagascar at risk of exposure at any one time. While socio-ecological context is necessary to understand disease transmission, our exercise suggests that the difference between reported and predicted case burdens in SSA can be just as easily explained by accounting for low detection rates and NPIs that reduce interpersonal contact.We do not currently have enough evidence to suggest that the epidemiology of COVID-19 is different in Madagascar than elsewhere. The low number of reported cases can be explained by low detection rates, late introduction, and early and effective implementation of NPIs. In contrast to the theory of a salutary epidemiology, each of these explanations is supported by strong anecdotal evidence ( Table 2) . As lockdowns are gradually lifted, other NPIs, such as handwashing, social distancing, and face mask wearing, should be implemented to avoid a rapid growth in cases. The public health system should remain prepared for an outbreak, with a peak of infections expected between August and December depending on the transmission scenario (Figure 2(d) ). The COVID-19 epidemic could become the leading public health problem in Madagascar, causing nearly twice as many deaths as are attributable to the current leading cause of death due to infectious disease, diarrheal disease [41] . It is important, therefore, to conduct clinical trials and continually improve access to health care. If NPIs remain in place at levels seen during the first months of the epidemic, the model suggests that this could prevent over 50,000 COVID-19 related deaths in Madagascar. Table 2 . Summary of evidence supporting or opposing three possible explanations for the low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar.Opposing Low detection rates• High proportion of asymptomatic cases [34] • Strict testing criteria • Low healthcare seeking rates for acute respiratory infections [35] • Diagnostic practices that limit the window of detection• Recent evaluation of health system preparedness via the International Health Regulations meant health systems were on high alert for an outbreak [20] Epidemiological differences• Trained-immunity due to vaccinations or high prevalence of endemic disease could increase population's resistance to infection [14] • Transmission rate may be lower in sparsely populated areas [13] • Virus survival is lower in humid, warm environments• Limited role for climate during pandemic phase of the outbreak [16] • Past influenza outbreaks were not limited by sparse transport networks in SSA [17] Early and effective NPIs• Lockdown in population centers implemented three days after first imported case• Limiting travel on fragmented paved road network can easily disrupt within-country movement","Madagascar","abstract","2020-10-05",10

WHO works carefully with leading experts, governments, and associates to develop a scientific understanding of this novel virus and provide a useful guidance on regulations to conserve human health and inhibit this outbreak from spreading. From the business side, companies' procedure considerations should be focused on both the readiness to protect the safety of your staff and clients and the extent of community-based spread of disease. In a survey released on 21February 2020, Fortune (2020) reported that 94% of the businesses included on the Fortune 1000 list experienced supply chain disturbances owing to COVID-19 [2] . The economic consequences of the pandemic are not insignificant in comparison to the human losses and fatalities caused by COVID-19 [3] . One of the most important and apparent obstacles is the reduction in market demand for goods and services in most countries due to absolute or partial lockdown. This lockdown has also disrupted both domestic and foreign supply chains.As a result of that, this pandemic causes significant job losses which will drive down demand, going to lead to a serious comprehensive economic crisis [4] .One of the first precautions taken at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is the dumping of international air traffic to and from the Chinese city of Wuhan. The procedures persisted with increased cases of infection such as disruption of schools and colleges, disruption of work in certain governmental and private institutions, closure of stores, restaurants and cafés, and other actions to reduce the interaction between people and observe the spread of the virus. Such measures have unintended effects of interrupting the multinational supply chains, halting companies' activities, and declining revenues.Supply chains may be influenced by multi-way policies to avoid the spread of the disease, either in supply, demand, or logistics. This study will evaluate the influence of the safety policies on the supply chain aspects under the uncertainty environment. A questionnaire was conducted for four different industries, namely the food industry, the electrical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and the textile industry, to assess the effect of the measures on the supply chains in different fields. The problem was formulated as a multicriteria decision-making problem using the Best-Worst method (BWM) and Technique in Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on the plithogenic set.The main contribution of the proposed framework is the combination of the two methods under plithogenic environment. The integration of these methods provide a more consistent and accurate framework. The BWM weight the policies that prevent the spread of the virus, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f while TOPSIS ranks the supply chain aspects (supply, demand, and logistic) according to the four industries. The evaluation of the impact of the policies on the supply chain will be applied under plithogenic environment in order to ensure more accurate results. The problem that have been solved in this research is considering the uncertainty of the evaluation process.The results that gained by this article is highly accurate evaluation of the supply chain aspects according to COVID-19 prevention policies effect.This article is structured as follows: Section 2 represents a literature review on COVID-19 and its impact on supply chain performance. Section 3 shows the definitions and methods that build the proposed framework. Section 4 is the application of the proposed framework to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain aspects. Section 5 is the managerial implications of the study. The conclusion of the work is present in section 6.The COVID-19 pandemic that rocked supply and business significantly in the last period, which obviously affects the global economy in general, is characterized by long-term disruption and high uncertainty. The supply chain risks to which you are exposed as a result of a pandemic similar to the COVID-19 pandemic are characterized as a long-term disruption that cannot be estimated, a supply chain disruption occurs in conjunction with the spread of the epidemic among the population, and concurrent disruptions occur between supply, demand, and logistics [5] . As a result of Lynton's study, it has been proven that the world's largest 1,000 supply chains are possessed most of their facilities in quarantine areas. As a result of Linton & Vakil study, it has been proven that the world's largest 1,000 supply chains possess most of their facilities in quarantine areas, and with the extension of the affected areas all affected countries are quarantined, further exacerbating the problem [6] .The attention of researchers in the field of supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic period has focused on studying the negative effects of policies imposed around the world to reduce the consequences of this crisis. In particular, the industries that serve the needs of the medical field need to be studied closely to ensure the continuity of the stability of these supply chains in light of this pandemic. Shokrani et al. (2020) studied the prominence of discovering alternative supply chains to manufacture some medical equipment, such as the face shields, which are among the most important protective equipment [7] . While Cappelli & Cini are proven through their study of food supply chains and local productions that they are the least affected by the international policies that have been imposed to limit the spread J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the epidemic, as it is the closest to the consumer [8] . One of the most prominent risks faced by supply chains in the COVID-19 pandemic period in various areas is to make ideal decisions in determining the amount of demand for services and goods. This is what Govindan et al. (2020) presented in their research, which contributed to the process of demand management through a decision-making system based on fuzzy inference system (FIS) [9] . [12, 13] . In the field of fresh food supply chain, Mitchell et al. (2020) investigated the reaction and resistance to COVID19 of the UK fruit and vegetable food supply chain, and to evaluate this empirical evidence in the sense of an adaptive cycle-based resistance system [14] . Attaran's (2020) study explored the vital roles that technology plays in bridging the essential void in healthcare supply chains during the latest outbreak [15] . Although supply chains throughout the world have always been disrupted by pandemics, they have lately been significantly impaired by an unforeseen, much-reaching devastating COVID-19 outbreak, with catastrophic consequences [16] .This study contributes to the process of assessing aspects of the supply chain and the impact of the policies imposed to reduce the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic facing the world. The motivation of the proposed study lies on the huge impact of this pandemic that leads to disturbances in the performance of supply chains in various fields after J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f imposing preventive policies, the most prominent of which is the quarantine which the world has witnessed recently. Most decision-making problems are characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity in the problem information. This often increases the problems related to new crises and pandemics, which are difficult to measure the extent of its spread and recognize all its facets. Hence, an integrated framework has been proposed to measure the impact of policies deployed around the world to reduce the COVID-19 pandemic on supply, demand, and logistics of supply chains in an environment of uncertainty.The proposed framework integrates the Best-Worst method (BWM) and Technique in Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on the plithogenic set.The evaluation of the impact of the policies on the supply chain will be applied under plithogenic environment which is useful for dealing with uncertainty in decision-making problems. The BWM weight the policies that prevent the spread of the virus, while TOPSIS ranks the supply chain aspects (supply, demand, and logistic).The BWM is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, which is an appropriate methodology to construct complex problems so that decision-makers would be able to better understand the problem as a whole [17] . This method allows decision-makers to quantitatively determine the value of the variables that form the system's total outputs [18] .The BMW is based on pairwise comparison, whether a value is more or less worthy than the other, and how significant it is compared to another. Decision-makers define the most important value, then the least important value of the set of defined values. Based on these two reference values, the remaining values are then compared.TOPSIS is a simple MCDM technique which assist to choose the best solution between the wide ranges of alternatives based on the closeness to the ideal solution [19] . The TOPSIS approach considers all positive and negative potential solutions, utilizing a measurement procedure that is fairly straightforward and quick to understand. Additionally, there is no restriction on the number of parameters and attributes it will handle and differentiates between the beneficial and non-beneficial parameters in its algorithm [20] .In reality, decision-makers (DMs) tend to use linguistic terms instead of using the exact numbers due to complexity and the vagueness of human cognition. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the disruptions confronting supply chains in an unexpected way, which increases ambiguity in the information that may contribute to find solutions to maintain the stability of supply chain performance. The policies decided by countries to limit the effects of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f this pandemic differ from one country to another and from one region to another in the same country, and also these policies are changed in response to the extent of the epidemic in the region, thus this problem is considered one of the most ambiguous problems for decisionmaking in the field of a supply chain. Accordingly, the proposed framework for this study is applied in an environment of uncertainty based on plithogenic set. Plithogenic is a generalization of crisp, fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, and neutrosophic set introduced by Smarandache (2017). A plithogenic set (P, A, V, d, c) is a set that comprises elements characterized by attributes' value V = {v 1 , v 2 , …, v n }, for n ≥ 1, each attribute value has an appurtenance degree concerning some given criteria. The set attributes denoted as A = {α 1 , α 2 ,… , α m }, m ≥ 1 [21, 22] .In this research, we construct a framework based on BWM and TOPSIS under plithogenic set to improve the consistency of the assessment process. This framework includes the merits of the plithogenic set with BWM and TOPSIS. Plithogenic set focuses in considering uncertainty, BWM evaluates the optimal weights of the policies, and TOPSIS determine the ranking of the SC aspects. This framework consists of three main phases. The first phase is to weight the policies using BWM. The second phase is to evaluate the policies according to the decision-makers and aggregate them based on plithogenic set operation. Finally, the last phase is to evaluate the supply, demand, and logistics of the supply chain using the TOPSIS method based on the results of the first and the second phases. As all decision-making problems, a set of criteria = { 1 , 2 , … , }, and alternatives = { 1 , 2 , … , }must be defined. In our study, the set of criteria are the prevention policies, while the alternatives are the three supply chain aspects. The steps of this proposed framework in details as follows (Table 1 ) and aggregate them based on plithogenic set aggregation operation in order to build an evaluation matrix ̃. The plithogenic intersection is [23, 24] :The plithogenic union is: where, t norm= ∧ = , t conorm ∨ = + −  Phase 3: Rank the alternatives (supply chain aspects) using TOPSIS method:- wherewhere i is the alternative and j is the criteria where is a set of beneficial criteria, and nb is a set of non-beneficial criteria. In this study, we proposed a framework based on the uncertainty in evaluating alternatives to obtain the optimal decision. The steps of this framework applied to rank the supply, demand, and logistics according to their influence by the COVID-19 prevention policies. By applying the BWM model according to the best-to-others vector and others-toworst vector the weights of the prevention policies are shown in Table 4 Table 5 .The contribution of the study is to use the plithogenic aggregation operation to aggregate the four business owner's assessments and to build a single evaluation matrix.According to Equations 3, 4, and 5, the aggregated evaluation matrix as Table 6 shows. One of the main contributions of the plithogenic aggregation operation is the contradiction degree that describes the relationship between attribute values and the dominant attribute value.Therefore, this framework is considered to be better at observing uncertainty compared to other models.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 7 S (a) =Then, normalize the evaluation matrix and calculate the weighted normalized matrix based on the results of the BWM as Table 8 and 9 shows. The weight of the policies is based on the BWM which provide more accurate evaluation rather than using the traditional TOPSIS. This step enhances the efficiency of TOPSIS by combining the results of the BWM in its steps. The TOPSIS ranking is based on the distance of the alternatives to the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution. Thus, the ranking of the supply chain aspects based on TOPSIS as Table 10 shows, the demand is the most influenced aspect by the COVID-19prevention policies with closeness coefficient 0.76641. Then, the supply and the logistics are in the second and third rank as TOPSIS result shows in Figure 3 with closeness coefficient 0.28803 and 0.23359, respectively. It is evident that the demand of the four fields that have been examined by the business owners' opinions on the impact of prevention policies on their performance, have been clearly influenced by 60%. Moreover, the supply and logistics of the supply chain influence by 22% and 18%, respectively. The drawback of this research is that not all sectors impacted by the pandemic are included in the review, since this research discusses four of the more relevant industries.The managerial implications of this study is to recognize the presence of strategies that restrict the effects of this pandemic on supply chains demand to ensure the continuity of their effective performance. That means that the performance of the supply chain is affected by demand, supply, and logistics consecutively. This is the time where supply chains pass involve effective strategies and approaches that maintain the continuity of their performance as required until this pandemic is safely passed. Administrative and business owners should consider the reasons for the large impact of demand due to the policies imposed by countries to reduce the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 pandemic is deemed one of the most important problems to be tackled, which presents a significant challenge to the supply chains in all fields. All countries are seeking from all directions to confront this pandemic to reduce its side effects by imposing strict policies and laws that work on the safety and security of countries. This study is concerned with the impact of these policies on the supply chain in terms of supply, demand, and logistics. Like all evaluation and decision-making problems, data are not available with complete certainty, and decision-makers opinions vary according to their beliefs and opinions. Therefore, this study considered the uncertainties in the evaluation process, based on the plithogenic set.Through this study, a framework was proposed to assess the effect of the protective policies of the Corona pandemic on supply chain aspects, based on BWM and TOPSIS under plithogenic environment. The contributions of this study focus on the consideration of the uncertainty in the evaluation process by applying the plithogenic aggregation operation. The plithogenic aggregation operation is considering the contradiction degree among the elements which ensure more accurate results. Moreover, the integration of the BWM and TOPSIS provides high consistency of the evaluation by combining the strength of the two methods. It is obvious in the results that the market for the four areas explored by the perceptions of business owners on the effect on their efficiency of prevention policies was strongly affected by 60 percent followed by supply and logistics.In brief, the proposed framework composed of three main phases. The first phase is to find the weights of the COVID-19 prevention policies using the BWM. The second phase is to build the evaluation matrix of the decision-makers based on plithogenic set. It is worth noting that this evaluation is applied in four industries they are food, electronics, pharmaceutical, and textile industries. The last phase is the ranking of the supply, demand, and logistics by the TOPSIS method. The results show that demand is the most affected J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f aspect of the supply chain by the COVID-19 prevention policies. The limitation in this study is that the evaluation does not include all industries affected by the pandemic, as this study address four of the most important industries.","Egypt","first author","2020-10-19",10

We report the baseline screening results and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors among 4040 HCWs between 22 April and 14 May 2020 in 12 public hospitals and medical centres at Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.• The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was 4.2% (170/4040) (8.8% versus 3.4% among symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs, respectively). More than two-thirds of the infected HCWs (116/170, 68.2%) were asymptomatic at the time of screening. More than a half of the infected HCWs did not report any contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Working as a nurse, in the operation room, and having the following symptoms: fever, dry cough, change/loss of smell, were independently associated with infection.• The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate of infections detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.• The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission among HCWs and unprotected patients. This screening approach is particularly important as countries are lifting their lockdown measures. Given the various success factors required for sustained implementation and regular testing, further evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing such programmes is required in different resource-limited settings. augment ongoing transmission, challenge the already strained health care systems and hinder the mitigation measures. 8 Asymptomatic infections varied in different settings, representing 17.9-87.9% of non-HCW cases. 9, 10 Among asymptomatic HCWs in the UK, 7.1% (1.1% at week 5 follow-up) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 11 Asymptomatic cases can shed the virus for up to 26 days, 12 symptoms develop after 2 weeks in some cases 13 and transmission can occur during the pre-symptomatic phase. 14 Also, HCWs short of personal protective equipment (PPE) may reuse or use them extendedly. 15 These factors may amplify nosocomial transmission, especially in resourcelimited settings.In Egypt, the first COVID-19 case was reported on 14 February 2020. 16 The doubling rate in the early phase of the epidemic was slow; by mid-March, there were 126 casesand the government took several containment measures( Figure 1 ). 16, 17 The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) adopted a symptom-based testing approach (using polymerase chain reaction) and active contact tracing. Reports on increasing COVID-19 cases among HCWs urged the MoHP to start testing HCWs in quarantine hospitals (19 April) . 18 However, testing of HCWs in non-quarantine hospitals is still lacking.Universal screening of HCWs can minimize unnecessary isolation and staff shortages, reduce nosocomial transmission from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic cases, and protect HCWs and vulnerable patients. 8 However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs and the associated risk factors, specifically in resource-limited settings, are unknown. To address this, we set up a prospective investigation consisting of baseline and follow-up screening and risk assessment of HCWs (SARAH: NCT04348214). In this article, we describe the baseline screening procedures in Ain Shams University (ASU) medical campus, including 12 university hospitals and medical centres in Cairo, Egypt. We present the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs-symptomatic and asymptomatic-using rapid serological tests and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors.Baseline screening at ASU hospitals was piloted between 22 April and 14 May 2020. It consisted of a cross-sectional study that included an online survey to identify HCWs' epidemiological and clinical characteristics, plus laboratory sampling and testing to assess HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 infection status.ASU hospitals are part of a large governmental public health care facility in Cairo, Egypt, receiving approximately 50 000 outpatients, 15 000 emergencies and 2000 inpatients per month. ASU serves patients through 10 hospitals (Geriatrics, Surgery, Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Surgery, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Emergency, Figure 1 Number of infected health care workers (HCWs) in Ain Shams University (ASU) hospitals or medical centres by date of onset of symptoms (bar chart, left y-axis) and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases detected through symptom-based testing in Egypt (line graph, right y-axis). The mitigation measures and remarkable events are shown at the national level (non-italic) and at ASU level (italic) Student, Specialized and El-Obour); the latter three hospitals are located outside the main ASU medical campus. Each hospital has several outpatient clinics, except Internal Medicine and Surgery hospitals, which have one separate large outpatient clinics building. ASU also includes four medical centres (Oncology, Psychiatry, Toxicology and Endoscopy). Till 14 May, none of the ASU hospitals were dedicated for quarantine and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 patients, except for the El-Obour hospital. In addition, due to replacement of on-site university teaching activities with distant online learning, the student hostel was adapted for isolation of mild confirmed COVID-19 HCWs or patients, whose house conditions were not suitable for proper home isolation. The Faculty of Medicine Research Institute and the accredited Central Laboratories are centrally located within ASU hospitals.Workstations were set up within hospitals or medical centres where it was logistically possible to conduct screening procedures without interrupting the workflow and where spaces allowed adequate social distancing precautions.There were no exclusion criteria, i.e. screening targeted all hospital staff on the job (approximately 6000), who provided clinical or non-clinical care to patients-including asymptomatic HCWs-and in all hospital areas (no units/wards were prioritized for screening). This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee, Faculty of Medicine, ASU (FMASUP18b/2020).Participation was voluntary and all HCWs on the job were informed and scheduled for screening through formal announcements by their hospital administration. At each hospital or centre, three workstations were set up for HCWs' screening, and dedicated teams consisting of the hospital management, infection control focal points, nurses, technicians and administrative staff coordinated the screening activities. Participants had to go through the three workstations on the same day.The screening purpose and procedures were explained. HCWs were assured about data confidentiality and anonymity, and freedom to withdraw without affecting the needed health care. HCWs who agreed to participate in the study were assigned study identification numbers (ID) and they provided a written informed consent before proceeding to the next workstation.HCWs completed the survey through available personal computers (PCs) with internet connection or their cellphones, to reduce the screening time and unnecessary contact with shared surfaces. Staff were available to interview HCWs who needed assistance in filling the survey. Data were entered using the assigned study ID to facilitate anonymous linkage with laboratory results.At the same setting from each HCW: (i) combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected in a single tube containing viral transport medium for the detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, 19 swabs being transported to the laboratory in an ice box at 4 C; and (ii) a 5-ml venous blood sample was collected by venepuncture into a plain vacutainer for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies.Baseline online survey Questions were adapted from relevant World Health Organization protocols and interim guidance. 20, 21 The questionnaire was originally developed in English, then translated into Arabic and back-translated for validation. It was pre-tested to ensure clarity of the questions and the answer categories. The survey was created on a secured online platform of the Faculty of Medicine via a dedicated e-mail that is available only to the research staff. The survey consisted of five main sections: demographic characteristics; symptoms; pre-existing medical conditions; community and nosocomial exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case; and adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Measures included in this analysis are described in the Supplementary material, available as Supplementary data at IJE online.Detection of viral RNA was done using the CerTest Viasure V R SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit (CerTest, Biotec, Spain) according to manufacturer's instructions. The detection was done in one step real-time reverse-transcription format where the reverse transcription and the subsequent amplification of specific target sequence occur in the same reaction well. The isolated RNA target was transcribed generating complementary DNA by reverse transcriptase, which was then followed by the amplification of a conserved region of the ORF1 ab and N genes for SARS-CoV-2 using specific primers and a fluorescent-labelled probe. The assay has 97.5% sensitivity and >99.9% specificity. The average estimated limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 was 18 copies/ml. 22 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies was done using the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay Artron V R OneStep COVID-19 IgM/IgG Antibody Test (Artron Laboratories Inc., Canada). The assay has 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. 23 Case definition For the purpose of this analysis, the HCW was considered 'recently or previously infected' with SARS-CoV-2 if either the PCR or IgM (indicating recent infection) or IgG (indicating past infection) tests results were positive. Stratification of different conditions and combinations of test results are detailed in the Supplementary material. The detailed testing algorithm, its clinical implication, subsequent management and HCWs' protocol for isolation and return to work are described in the Supplementary material.For the descriptive analysis, we report measures of central tendency and distribution for continuous variables or counts and proportions for categorical variables. We tested for associations between exposure, clinical and demographic characteristics and the HCWs' infection status, using bivariate logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent factors associated with HCWs' infection status. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Effect estimates with confidence intervals and exact P-values are provided. SPSS version 25 was used for all analyses.Between 22 April 22 and 14 May, 4040 HCWs participated in the baseline screening. Of those, 170 (4.2%; 95% CI 3.6-4.9) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . Overall, 1598 (39.6%) HCWs were nurses, 1577 (39.0%) were physicians and 865 (21.4%) were involved in nonclinical care. Most HCW participants were females (n ¼ 2486, 61.5%). More than half of the infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.1%). Infected HCWs' median age was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 27.0-41.3]. The proportion of infection was highest in the outpatient clinics building (7.4; 95% CI 3.0-14.6) and the Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital (7.1; 95% CI 5.2-9.5) ( Table 2 ). In the bivariate analysis, working in the delivery or operation rooms or the radiology unit was associated with higher odds of infection than working in other hospital units (Supplementary Table S1 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). A total of 33 (19.4%) infected HCWs self-reported having one or more pre-existing medical conditions (Table 1) ; the most common were hypertension (n ¼ 14, 8.2%), diabetes (n ¼ 5, 2.9%) and obesity (n ¼ 5, 2.9%) (Supplementary Table S2 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online).Of the 170 infected HCWs, 117 (68.8%) tested positive only for PCR, 34 (20.0%) tested positive only for IgM and 11 (6.5%) tested positive only for IgG. Four (2.4%) tested positive for both PCR and IgM, three (1.8%) tested positive for both PCR and IgG, one (0.6%) had all three tests positive and none of the infected HCWs tested PCRnegative, IgM-and IgG-positive (Table 3) . Overall, approximately three-quarters of the 170 infected HCWs tested positive for PCR (n ¼ 125, 73.5%).In all, 68 (40.0%) infected HCWs reported contact with a confirmed case vs 1030 (26.6%) non-infected HCWs ( Table 4) Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (n ¼ 116, 68.2%) ( Table 4 ). Asymptomatic infection varied by hospital ( Table 2 ). The proportion of infection was 3.4 (95% CI 2.8-4.0) among asymptomatic HCWs (116/3424) and 8.8 (95% CI 6.7-11.3) among symptomatic HCWs (54/ 616) ( Table 4 ). Among infected symptomatic HCWs, only six (11.1%) had fever !38 C and only seven (13.0%) had severe symptoms. Infected HCWs were more likely to report fever, dry cough, loss of appetite and change/loss of taste or smell than non-infected HCWs (Supplementary  Table S4 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The onset of symptoms ranged between 1 and 31 days, with a median of 4.0 days, after contact with a suspected (IQR 3.0-8.0) or confirmed (IQR 3.0-7.0) case ( Figure 2 ). In some symptomatic HCWs, the onset of symptoms was on the same day or before their last contact with a case.In the multivariable analysis, being a nurse was independently associated with infection [adjusted odds ratio Among 4040 HCWs screened at baseline, 170 (4.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (3.4% in asymptomatic and 8.8% in symptomatic HCWs) by PCR, IgM or IgG, indicating recent or past infection. Throughout March, ASU adopted many proactive mitigation measures aiming to reduce nosocomial transmission risk (Figure 1 ). Early in April, a few suspected cases among patients and HCWs Odds ratio (95% CI) were calculated using binary logistic regression.initiated localized SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening for their close contacts. This prompted universal screening of all HCWs for early detection and isolation of COVID-19 cases. The baseline screening took place in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic; there were 3659 total cases in Egypt at screening launch (22 April). By the end of baseline screening (14 May), the cumulative infections through the nationally adopted symptom-based screening were 10 829 cases/135 000 PCR tests 24 (8.0%; 95% CI 7.9-8.2), comparable to the proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs in the current study (8.8%). The onset of symptoms in infected ASU-HCWs during baseline screening follows the epidemic curve in the community, suggesting that infections may have been acquired through community rather than nosocomial transmission. This finding is consistent with observations in high-and upper-middle-income settings, such as the UK, 25 The Netherlands 5 and China. 2 In the early epidemic phase, 6% (86/1353) in two Dutch hospitals 5 and 5% (2/38) in the UK 25 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 among symptomatic HCWs, compared with 8.8% in this study. In the UK study, the infection rate increased to 20% at a later epidemic stage. 25 Evidence of asymptomatic carriage in HCWs was documented; two studies reported infection rates close to the 3.4% in this study: 3.9% of 2872 and 2.9% of 1032 asymptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the USA 26 and the UK, 27 respectively. Another UK study reported an initial rate of 7.1% (28/396) falling after 5 weeks to 1.1 (3/269). 11 More than two-thirds of the infected HCWs (116/170, 68.2%) in this study were asymptomatic at the time of screening. Others also documented asymptomatic carriage in HCWs (57%) 27 and non-HCWs (51.7%-87.9%). 9, 10, 28 This finding underscores the importance of relaxing the strategy of testing individuals, particularly HCWs, based on a strict clinical case definition, to accommodate asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals.Our findings suggest that adopting a symptom-basedonly self-isolation approach may result in unnecessary isolation of approximately nine out of 10 HCWs. Implementing universal screening, however, is cost-saving and keeps the much-needed workforce active. The negotiated volume purchase price of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and rapid serological tests used in this study was 50 USD per 22 it can yield high false-negative results. 29 Therefore, a risk stratification protocol for HCWs who tested negative with scheduled re-testing is recommended. 30 Serological tests were performed in this study to evaluate baseline seroprevalence and identify seroconversion at follow-up-not as a confirmatory test of HCWs' infection at baseline. Only 11/4040 (0.3%) HCWs in this study tested IgG-positive, indicating that infection was not yet widespread in ASU-HCWs in this early epidemic phase. The first identified COVID-19 HCW case was in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital (4 April) only complaining of general malaise, and may have resulted in a cluster of infection among other HCWs, being paucisymptomatic. This might explain why the proportion of infection was higher in this hospital (7.1%) compared with Odds ratio (95% CI) were calculated using binary logistic regression. HCWs who were adherent to gown use in this study were more likely to be infected than those who were nonadherent. Occasional breaching of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures and relaxed HCWs' attitudes towards the prohibited social gathering cannot be dismissed. Consistent use of PPEs can reduce the risk of infection among HCWs. 31 However, adequate PPE availability did not completely eliminate that risk in HCWs who were adherent to PPE use in the UK and the USA 32 ; adherence to proper use should be investigated. More mistakes were detected among nurses during donning or doffing PPEs in a Chinese hospital. 33 In this study, working as a nurse compared with a physician was independently associated with infection, which is consistent with previous findings. 34 Nurses are in contact with many colleagues and patients' relatives at the nurses' stations. Also, in ASU hospitals, many tasks still involve paperwork, mainly handled by nurses and exposing them to a higher possibility of infection. The time between infected HCWs' last contact with a confirmed case to the onset of symptoms ranged between 1 and 31 days, conforming with recent work estimating 5% of cases may take 2 weeks or more to develop symptoms. 13 HCWs' direct face-to-face interaction within 2 m with a confirmed COVID-19 case, but not the duration, was associated with a greater proportion of infection only in the bivariate analysis. Interestingly, more than half the infected HCWs did not report any contact with a COVID-19 case either in the workplace or at home, a proportion double that reported in previous studies. 5 Moreover, some infected HCWs reported contact with cases after several days from the onset of their symptoms, suggesting exposure to an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic case, as infectivity peaks in the pre-symptomatic stage. 14 Several factors support that in-hospital transmission at this early epidemic stage was unlikely. Infection that could not be traced to a specific exposure may signal the stage of community transmission. 35 We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was independently associated with fever, dry cough and change/loss of smell. Another study reported these symptoms as predictors of a positive COVID-19 test with high specificity. 32 In this study, loss of smell was reported by only five HCWs, four of whom were infected. Also, six reported fever !38 C (11.1%) and most symptomatic cases showed only mild to moderate symptoms, a finding consistent with previous reports. 5, 28 Klutymans et al. suggested modifying the case definition for suspected HCWs by including fever as a possible-not as a requiredsymptom. 5 Pre-existing medical conditions among HCWs in this study were not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Approximately three-quarters of enrolled HCWs were younger than 40 years of age. Also, the data may have not have revealed independent associations, due to the small number of infected HCWs with comorbidities. A recent UK study reported that, apart from chronic kidney disease and obesity, none of the chronic conditions among 587 primary care patients were associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. 36 Infected participants' relatively young age (median 31.5 years) may have also contributed to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections in the current study. Recent modelling work suggests an age-dependent effect in COVID-19 transmission 37 ; asymptomatic infections occur mostly in younger ages, which might partly explain why clinically apparent cases are lower in countries with predominantly young population structures, such as Egypt.Implementing similar universal COVID-19 screening in other resource-limited settings may be challenging. The centrally located accredited laboratories in ASU expedited transfer of samples with a testing capacity of 500 samples per day. There were also dedicated trained teams responsible for screening. Notably, screening of HCWs should be periodic for early detection of infections-especially asymptomatic infections-and to assist decision makers in prompt management of the health care workforce. The preparations for baseline screening, including capacity building and training of hospital teams, may positively reflect on future hospital policies for communicable diseases and the preparedness for other epidemics. Costs, availability of tests, testing capacity and suitable laboratory facilities with skilled personnel are among many barriers to universal screening of HCWs in resource-limited settings. Therefore, developing accurate affordable rapid point-ofcare diagnostic tests is vital to the success and sustainability of this approach. Moreover, universal screening should be coupled with vigilant IPC measures to protect HCWs and hospitalized patients. Conversely, there is a unique opportunity in universal screening of HCWs; discovering asymptomatic infections will be critical in flattening the curve and preventing second waves which could result in staff shortages and the overwhelming of health care facilities, particularly in countries experiencing COVID-19 epidemic exponential growth.As testing of HCWs was voluntary there was a possibility of self-selection bias. HCWs who thought they were at a higher risk of COVID-19 were more likely to participate for reassurance. The association between infected and symptomatic/asymptomatic status would most likely not be biased, though; if biased, the direction of bias would be underestimation of asymptomatic infections. Second, symptoms may have been over-reported, but the recall period was short and HCWs filled the online survey first and did not know the results of the tests, except later on. Third, comparison of HCWs' demographic and clinical characteristics with the nationwide confirmed cases was not possible because MoHP data were not publicly available. Since Egypt is currently experiencing exponential growth in the epidemic, changes in the proportion of infection among HCWs is expected to occur rapidly and this will be examined in the follow-up phase of this study. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of the baseline screening does not allow drawing causal inferences. We were unable to validate whether asymptomatic HCWs were truly asymptomatic or were in the pre-symptomatic phase. This could be further investigated in longitudinal study designs. Also, evaluation of impact of the many interventions ASU adopted to mitigate nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 was not possible. Fifth, the online survey collected several data within the HCWs' limited time; the collection of behavioural risk factors and elaborate evaluation of IPCs was not feasible. Investigating temporal and spatial nosocomial transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in hospitals with a higher proportion of infections, was not possible. Sixth, the test sensitivity for lateral flow immunochromatographic antibody assay was poor (83%); therefore, the frequency of recovery from infection may have been under-reported. We faced some logistical challenges during implementation. Internet disruption caused delay in completing the online survey for 1 day, but this was overcome by using cellphone internet packages. There was HCW and consequently sample overflow into baseline screening on 2 days, exceeding the capacity of both the local screening and the laboratory teams, which was overcome by assigning additional shifts, teams and workstations.The overall proportion of infection among 4040 HCWs assessed in the baseline screening in the early phase of the epidemic in Egypt was 4.2%. The majority were asymptomatic, and nurses were more likely to be infected. The rate of symptomatic infection in this study is comparable with the national rate in the early epidemic phase in Egypt, suggesting community-acquired rather than nosocomial infection. Universal screening-including symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs-informed ASU policies for evidence-based management and updated local guidance for HCWs. Given the various success factors required for sustained implementation and regular testing, further evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing such programmes is required in different resource-limited settings.All data are available in the article and its online Supplementary material.Supplementary data are available at IJE online.","Egypt","abstract","2020-10-23",10

Also, their structure has a characteristic RNA genome. However, CoV are more familiar with animals; seven of them can induce the human respiratory system. [1] From December 2019, a new coronavirus called COVID-19 that was first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and now, is spreading rapidly across China and other parts of the world. COVID-19 has become a serious threat to the world public health, causing 244,792 deaths from 3,484,640 cases as of 3 May 2020 from the entire world. The current COVID-19 outbreak is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has been known as the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses. [1] SARS-CoV-2 was established to have higher sequence homology toward SARS-CoV than that of MERS-CoV according to the whole genome sequence alignment analysis in different studies. [2] There are four structural proteins characterize coronaviruse genome, spike glycoprotein (S), matrix glycoprotein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), and small envelope protein (E) were reported. [3] Additionally, 3CLpro is also known as Nsp5 of SARS-Cov-2 required for the maturation of coronaviruses. 3CLpro is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then, further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp1631. 3CLpro directly mediates the maturation of Nsps. So, 3CLpro is critical for the viral life cycle, making it an attractive target of anti-coronavirus drug evolution. [4, 5] There are different studies that had been performed on the main proteases of SARS-Coronavirus (2GTB) to develop antiviral treatments of COVID-19 virus because it shares 96% similarity with 3CLpro of COVID-19. [6] The utilization of natural compounds alternatives or complementary therapies has received growing attention due to their low toxicity, fewer side effects and in some cases as the only effective treatment. Chemical drugs are shown different side effects and ineffectiveness in some cases for longterm use. The World Health Organization (WHO) evaluated that about 80% of people use natural compounds in the treatment field. [7] Actually, natural compounds have various and effective biological activities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. [8] Medicinal plants are an important source of molecules with various pharmacological properties and effective biological activities like antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antidiabetic. So, bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants have attracted significant attention because there are safe and effective against different pathogens since ancient times. [9, 10] Caulerpin, the low toxic bisindole alkaloid is a more common compound of the genus Caulerpa of green macroalgae and it was isolated from Caulerpa racemosa, [11] red alga Chondria armata, [12] and brown alga Sargassum platycarpum. [13] Caulerpin has various pharmacological properties and effective biological activities such as antitumor, anti-diabetic, anticancer, anti-larvicidal, anticorrosion, antitubercular, antimicrobial, spasmolytic, antinociceptive, plant growth regulatorory activity, and anti-inflammatory. [13, 14] Caulerpin exhibited antiviral activities against Chikungunya virus [15] and herpes simplex virus type 1. [16] Also, caulerpin showed good inhibition activity against Alzheimer's disease. [17] Due to the low-toxicity and biological activity of all studied compounds especially caulerpin in different biological applications as summarized in Table 1 . We expected that they could be used to develop formal inhibitors against COVID-19.In this study, our homology modeling and sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV main protease show that SARS-CoV main protease (PDB ID: 3TNT) shares 96% similarity with 3CLpro of COVID-19. Also, homology modeling and sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV main protease show that SARS-CoV main protease (PDB ID: 2GTB) shares 96.76% similarity with 3CLpro of COVID-19 as described in this study. [6] So, we study the inhibitory effect of some bioactive compounds obtained from natural sources against SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro and SARS-CoV main proteases (PDB IDs: 2GTB and 3TNT). Due to their high similarity of 2GTB and 3TNT with 3CLpro, inhibition of these receptors could be effective in 3CLpro treatment. Based on molecular docking analysis, we found that caulerpin has the highest binding affinity against 6LU7, 3TNT, and 2GTB receptors compared to other bioactive compounds and the proposed drugs. The pharmacogenic and toxicity properties of all studied compounds also are computed and confirmed that most of all studied bioactive compounds especially, caulerpin obey Zaleya decandra [8] Ceramium virgatum [18] Ulva intestinalis [18] Fucus sp.

Finally, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation confirmed that the complex formed between caulerpin and 6LU7 is stable in water explicit and had no major effect on the flexibility of the protein throughout the simulations and provided a suitable basis for our study. Based on this work, we believe that caulerpin could be used to develop an antiviral molecule against COVID-19. Thus, this compound could be a potential candidate for in vitro and in vivo antiviral studies followed by clinical COVID-19 treatment. It is worth mentioning that there is not any work in literature discusses the inhibition effect of all studied compounds against COVID-19. Also, most of all related work in this field studied the inhibition effect against only COVID-19 receptors, but in this work we study the inhibition activity of all studied compounds against COVID-19 main protease and two SARS-CoV main proteases receptors. Finally, we also build homology modeling and sequence alignment on SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease to show its similarity with other SARS-CoV receptors.While, most of all related work in this field did not study it.In our study, we choose ten public bioactive compounds that already are abundant and isolated from different species of plants or marine algae to study the inhibitory effect of them against main proteases of CoV-2 (3CLpro) with (PDB ID: 6LU7) and main proteases of SARS-CoV (Mpro) (PDB IDs: 2GTB and 3TNT). According to literature survey, these compounds showed a broad spectrum of biological activities like antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory that making them an attractive target to evaluate their potential to become potential candidate inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro. All studied bioactive compounds in this work are shown in Figure 1 . Also, their sources, species names and biological activities of all studied compounds are illustrated in Table 1 .The crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro (PDB code: 6LU7) and main proteases of SARS-Coronavirus (Mpro) with (PDB IDs: 2GTB and 3TNT) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org), and any heteroatoms and water molecules were removed before molecular docking studies. The 3-dimensional (3D) structures of all studied compounds and some proposed antiviral drugs (bioactive compounds, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir) were obtained from PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), in .sdf format. PubChem is a chemical substance and biological activities repository consisting of three databases, including substance, compound, and bioassay databases. Determination of the amino acids in the active site of a protein was determined using the Biovia Discovery Studio software [52] to analyze the Grid box and docking evaluation results.Homology modeling is performed for the 2019-nCoV main protease. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro was used as a template (PDB ID: 6LU7). Therefore, sequence similarity searches were performed by using BLASTp analysis which showed suitable templates for the homology modeling. Target sequences of the SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro were created according to the build homology models implicit in the Discovery Studio software as described in this study. [53] Molecular dockingAll Ligands in this study (bioactive compounds, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir) were optimized before docking by Avogadro version 1.2 with Force Field type MMFF94 and saved in .pdb format. Discovery Studio used for protein optimization, by removing water and other atoms to prepare protein for the docking process. Molecular docking between ligands and 6LU7 was carried out using Auto Dock Tools (ADT) graphical user interface supported by MGL tools.Polar hydrogen was added and atomic charges were computed by Kollman and Gasteiger method. We defined a grid size with 60 Å Â 60 Å Â 60 Å for two receptors and the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) was assigned to carry out the molecular docking process, as described in this study. [54] The output of the Auto Dock was further analyzed with discovery studio program and Pymol version 1.7.4.5 software package.The drug likeness prediction of all studied bioactive compounds was carried out by Lipinski filter (http://www.scfbio- iitd.res.in/software/drugdesign/lipinski.jsp), according to which an orally active drug should comply with a minimum of four of the five laid down criteria for drug likeness namely: molecular mass, cLogP, hydrogen donor and acceptor, and molar refractive index. [55] Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties like absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and the toxicity of all studied compounds were predicted utilizing admetSAR database (http:// lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar1/predict). [56] MD simulationThe structure of the highest binding complex obtained from molecular docking study between compound 10 (caulerpin) and 6LU7 was prepared for MD simulation using slandered dynamic cascade implicit in discovery studio. The MD simulation of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro-inhibitor complex was carried out at 30 ns using CHARMm force field for all atoms in the complex. The simulation started by solvating the complex in triclinic box using TIP3P water model. The counter ions were added to the neutralized the system. In which caulerpin-6LU7 complex with solvated in 6506 water molecules and neutralized by 20 sodium and 17 chlorides as counter ions. Periodic boundary conditions were used. Throughout the simulation, the studied system is maintained at a temperature of 300 K with constant pressure. Energy minimization was done for 50,000 steps. The trajectories were collected for every nanosecond to get insights into the interactions at the atomistic level. All MD protocol was carried out according to this study. [3] The complexes result from MD simulation was analyzed for root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) and hydrogen bonds analysis.The binding free energy of protein and ligand complexes can be calculated by combining the molecular Mechanic/ Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) with MD. The MD scripts were extracted to perform MM-PBSA calculations. The binding free energy provides an overview of the biomolecular interactions between protein and ligand. The binding energy constitutes of potential energy, polar and non-polar solvation energies. The MM-PBSA binding free energies were calculated by utilizing nanoscale molecular dynamics (NAMD) and visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software programs according to this study. [57] Results and discussionsHomology modeling and sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV main proteaseIt is noticed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro share remarkable 96.00% sequence alignment among all other human coronaviruses as shown in Figure 2 , based on our homology modeling and sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV main protease. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) is highly similar to its SARS-CoV sister (PDB ID: 3TNT) at high resolution with 1.59 Å. multiple additional sequencing studies have been performed for SARS-CoV-2, including a landmark preprint, which suggested renaming 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2 on based on results similar to ours. [58] The highly conserved region of the structural elements was found, the least PDF total energy of 6LU7 and 3TNT are 2728.98 and 2881.43, respectively, that is, a reliable statistical potential to assess the quality of homology models in protein structure prediction. Also, DOPE score of 6LU7 and 3TNT are 70754.34 and 70644.22, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov-3CLpro have nine a-helices and 13 b-strands which make up three distinct domains, i.e., domain I, domain II, and domain III. All CoV proteases family consist of three domain, in which Domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) have one antiparallel b-barrel, that resemble the trypsin-like serine proteases structure. Domain III (residues 201-306) consists of 5 a-helices (a5-a9), that are connected by a long loop (resi-dues185-200) with domain II as reported in this study. [6] There are only four mutated residues (Phe 13, Asn 65, Ala 94, and Val 35) between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro as shown in Figure 3 . The Ramachandran plot built also, by discovery studio shows that 100% of the residues in the allowed regions, 97.0% in the most favored region as shown in Figure 4 . Additionally, 88.2% of the residues have averaged 3D-1D score 0.3 based on the Verify 3D software, while the overall quality factor of ERRAT is 96.0%. Our homology modeling and sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV main protease is the best agreement with this study, [58, 59] which confirmed that the structure of SARS-CoV (PDB Code 3TNT) and SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro (PDB Code 6LU7) share remarkable 96.75% sequence alignment. Due to the high sequence alignment between 3TNT and 2GTB with 6LU7, 3TNT, and 2GTB could be a potential drug target for 2019-nCoV and the inhibition of 3TNT and 2GTB protease would help to restrict the viral maturation thereby decreasing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.The amino acids found in the active site pockets of 6LU7, 3TNT, and 2GTB and SARS-CoV-2, were elucidated from PDB files by discovery studio and summarized in Table 2 . Table 3 displays the molecular docking analysis of all studied bioactive compounds and some proposed antiviral drugs against 6LU7, including binding energy, ligand efficiency, inhibition constant, intermolecular energy, and van der Waals (VDW)-H Bond desolvation energy. Figure 5 is shown the best docking poses of the studied bioactive compounds (1-10) inside 6LU7. Also, Figure 6 displays docking analysis visualization of 6LU7 binding with all studied compounds in which the yellow dots show H-bonds formed between bioactive compounds and 6LU7 residues. The Number of H-bonds, H-bonding Residues and H-bonding distance produced from docking for all studied bioactive compounds against 6LU7 shown in Table 4 . Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir also docked inside 6LU7 using the same protocol applied on all studied compounds. An in silico analysis study showed that only compound 10 can inhibit 6LU7 which have the higher binding energies and inhibition constants and higher Number of H-bonds with 6LU7 amino acid residues with compared to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir inhibitors as shown in Tables 3 and 4 . Compound 10 exhibits the highest binding energy (-9.28 k.cal/mol) with compared to other compounds and formed three hydrogen bond interactions with LYS 137, GLU 288, and LYS 5 of 6LU7 amino acid residues with distance 2.25, 2.27, and 2.38 Å, respectively. Also, all studied bioactive compounds are docked inside 3TNT and 2GTB and the obtained binding energy are summarized in Table 5 . Also, compound 10 shows the highest binding energy compared to all studied bioactive compounds and antiviral drugs. So, compound 10 may act as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2.Lipinski's rule of five is commonly utilized in development and drug design to expect oral bioavailability of drug molecules. Lipinski's rule was established based on five rules to compute the ability of the compound to act as an orally active drug was calculated and shown in Table 6 . So, orally active drugs must have no more than one violation of the following standards: (i) octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) which measured the lipophilicity of a molecule must be not greater than five. (ii) A molecular weight (MW) less than 500 Da. (iii) not more than five hydrogen bond donors (nON). (iv) not more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (nOHN). The topological polar surface area (TPSA) is measured the bioavailability of the drug molecule. TPSA is closely related to the hydrogen bonding potential of a compound. TPSA of studied compounds was noticed in the range of 25.87-153.50 Å and is well below the limit of 160 Å. It can be predicted that all studied bioactive compounds obeyed Lipinski's rule of five and are likely to be orally active except compounds 5 and 9 as shown in Table  6 . The database supports ADMET profiles which involve some features to study the ability of the studied compounds to act as drug leads such as Blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, human intestinal absorption (HIA), Caco-2 cell permeability, CYP inhibitory promiscuity, AMES toxicity, carcinogenicity, and rat acute toxicity LD50 are calculated and displayed in Table 7 . As shown in Table 6 , all studied compounds may cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and absorb in the human intestine (HIA) along are permeable for Cacoe2 cells, whereas, compound 5 showed a negative result for BBB, HIA, and Cacoe2 cell permeability. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a group of isozymes containing the metabolism of drugs, steroids, fatty acids, bile acids, and carcinogens. The results indicate that these studied compounds are non-substrate and non-inhibitor of CYP enzymes. [13, 60] In terms of AMES toxicity, all studied compounds were observed to be non-toxic. Carcinogenicity model indicated non-Carcinogenic nature of all studied compounds. Rat Acute Toxicity LD50 of all studied compounds was found between 1.95 and 2.75 mol/kg. The finding strongly provides the ability of most of all studied compounds to act as a drug, except compound 5 as shown in Table 7 .To confirm the docking results and get more insight into the stability of the ligand-protein complex, MD simulations were carried out for the compound which has the highest binding affinity (compound 10) inside 6LU7 complex in the solvated states at 30 ns as shown in Figure 7 . The results of MD simulations have been examined based on RMSD, RMSF, and the number of hydrogen bonds as a function of time.To examine the change in the protein dynamics and the conformational stability of the protein-ligand complexes, the protein complexed with compound 10 was subjected to 30 ns MD simulations. Standard dynamics cascade module implicit in DS software was employed to measure the RMSD and RMSF. The RMSD measures the direct changes in the protein from the initial coordinates. The RMSD values of the protein backbone in complex with the potential inhibitors were computed concerning the initial structure as a frame reference (0 to 10 ns). The RMSD values steadily increased from 0 to 5 ns, and reached equilibration after that throughout the simulation period. The RMSD values for the studied complex showed oscillations between 3 to 5 ns indicating that the studied compound was adapting another conformation within the binding pocket as shown in Figure 8 . The average RMSD values for the last 1 ns for the 6LU7 and caulerpin þ 6LU7 complex, were 1.13 ± 0.07 and 1. 22 ± 0.05, respectively. Lower RMSD value of the caulerpin in the complex with 6LU7 indicates its stability and provided a suitable basis for our study.Root mean square fluctuation RMSF was measured based on the backbone atom of each amino acid residues and the plot of RMSF was used to depict the fluctuations at the residue level. RMSF plot as shown in Figure 9 of solvated 6LU7 and 6LU7 in complex with caulerpin during 30 ns MDs simulations exhibited a similar trend of residue fluctuation profile for both free receptors (6LU7) and the complexes with a low average RMSF. This trend in the RMSF plot for the complex indicates that binding caulerpin to the receptor was stable and had no major effect on the flexibility of the protein throughout the simulations. To explore more insights on the local protein flexibility, the time average of RMSF values of the 300 amino acids of 6LU7 in the absence and presence of the caulerpin over simulation period were calculated. The RMSF values for the three complexes suggested that the following residues (ALA206, VAL204, and LEU205) showed less fluctuation in the presence and presence of the caulerpin. The average RMSF values of these residues were 0.33 ± 0.06, 0.40 ± 0.07, and 0.43 ± 0.08 Å for 6LU7, and 0.37 ± 0.07, 0.48 ± 0.08, and 0.52 ± 0.09 Å for caulerpin-6LU7 complex.Hydrogen bonds are one of the essential elements answerable for the molecular interactions in biological systems. Hydrogen bonds provide the basis for molecular recognition and selectivity by imparting directionality and explicitness to molecular interactions. The protein-ligand interactions were guided by the changes in the secondary structures, which in turn were regulated by the hydrogen bonds. MD simulation provided different conformations in which a protein could be found in actual biological conditions. Each conformation of a protein is supposed to have its interaction pattern with the ligand. We calculated the number of hydrogen bonds formed during the complete run of MD simulations for selected complexes, as presented in Figure 10 . As shown in Figure 10 , in the caulerpin-6LU7 complex, the most number of conformations formed up to 10 hydrogen bonds during the simulation. A very few conformations showed less than 5 and greater than 10 hydrogen bonds. The bioactive caulerpin molecule was able to maintain strong interaction with the binding pocket of 6LU7 throughout the simulation period. We measured binding free energy at last 10 ns from MD simulation. The final binding energy is a cumulative sum of van der Wall, electrostatic, polar solvation, and SASA energy. Except for the polar solvation energy, all other forms of energy contributed favorably to the interaction between caulerpin molecule and 6LU7. The caulerpin molecule showed the binding free energy equal to À256.44 ± 27.55 kJ/mol, SASA equal to À28.58 ± 4.32 kJ/mol, DE polar solvation equal to À283.58 ± 44.53 kJ/mol, DE Electrostatic equal to À127.76 ± 40.50 kJ/mol, and DE Van der Waal equal to À384.44 ± 34.40 kJ/mol inside 6LU7. This confirmed the efficacy of the caulerpin molecule against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.Recently, the rapidly spreading outbreak of COVID-19 has challenged the healthcare sector of the world. Numerous antiviral or other conventional drugs are being examined against COVID-19, but not yet positive results have come. To contribute to this fight against COVID-19, virtual screening-based molecular docking and MD simulation were investigated to identify novel and potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro main protease. Based on our molecular docking analysis we found that among all studied compounds, caulerpin has the highest binding affinity against all studied receptors 6LU7, 3TNT, and 2GTB with compared to some proposed antiviral drug currently used in COVID-19 treatment. The ADMET and molecular descriptors properties strongly provide that most of all studied compounds obey Lipinski's rule of five and exhibit significant biological activities especially, caulerpin compound. MD simulation confirmed the stability of caulerpin-6LU7 receptor in the presence of explicit water solvent. RMSD of the receptor-ligands complex has maintained the stability at around 1.8 Å and RMSD of caulerpin complexed with the protein are in the favorable range of within 1.2 Å and has remained stable during the simulations. The backbone atoms of the complex and free receptor show similar RMSF, indicating the stability of the caulerpin inside 6LU7 receptor. Also, the most number of conformations formed up to 10 hydrogen bonds during the simulation in caulerpin-6LU7 complex. A very few conformations showed less than 5 and greater than 10 hydrogen bonds. The bioactive caulerpin molecule was able to maintain strong interaction with the binding pocket of 6LU7 throughout the simulation period. Finally, the caulerpin molecule showed the binding free energy inside 6LU7 equal to À256.44 ± 27.55 kJ/mol which confirmed the efficacy of this molecule against SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Hence, caulerpin is highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and can be explored further for drug repurposing against the successful inhibition of COVID-19.Hussein S.

Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain.The first case of COVID-19 was reported on December 31 st , 2019, in Wuhan, China. Since then, the infection has spread, causing a worldwide pandemic [1] . The World Health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March, 2020 [2] . Zambia recorded its first case in March 2020 and the cases have since risen to 13,539 with 312 deaths recorded as at September 13 th , 2020 [1, 3] .While less visible on the front lines of public health, forensic pathology plays a vital role in safeguarding public health by investigating and identifying unusual infectious disease deaths such as those caused by COVID-19. Given that forensic pathology investigates deaths that are sudden, unexplained, or unattended by a physician, its participation in mortality and disease surveillance contributes data useful to physicians and public health specialists [4] . This data provides accurate demographic details, extent of disease, and causes of death and that is useful in informing public health policy [4, 6, 7] .Forensic pathology uses the autopsy as a tool in refining the body of knowledge in diseases by utilizing its findings to provide a wealth of information about diseases such as COVID-19 [4, 5] .This paper aims to describe the role of forensic pathology in the COVID-19 pandemic era in Zambia.When the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Zambia [3] , the forensic pathology service developed a screening tool to detect cases that were suspicious for COVID-19 for infection prevention as little was known about the infection at the time [6, 8] . The screening tool was a questionnaire that was administered to the next of kin among the Brought-In-Dead (BID) cases undergoing forensic autopsies at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH).Information about flu-like symptoms before death was obtained. A history of headache, cough, sore throat, fever, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, contact with other people with flu-like symptoms, travel to high-risk areas, contact with known COVID-19 infected persons, and occupation was obtained to categorise BIDs for COVID-19 infection [9] . BID cases were categorised into deaths with a high index of and record the data obtained on a laboratory form submitted together with the testing sample.Notably, most of the COVID-19 deaths recorded in Zambia are from the BID cases that were swabbed as a result of the screening [10] . This demonstrates the significance of BID cases in mortality and disease surveillance as pertains to COVID-19 infection. Thus mortality surveillance and disease is an essential response to the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic fight [11] .During the COVID-19 pandemic, the forensic pathology service opened its doors to allow comprehensive autopsies in COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases to be conducted in the BIDs and hospital cases. This was to contribute accurate data to physicians and public health specialists to better manage the pandemic [6, 12] . Autopsies were conducted using forensic pathology principles to determine the cause of death and document the extent of disease.Thus, forensic pathology practice was modified to cater for the COVID-19 pandemic instead of focusing only on the criminal justice system [13] .Working with the IDU at the UTH, a continuous feedback loop between been IDU physicians and forensic pathologists on clinical and autopsy findings was maintained. The autopsy findings were discussed, and an autopsy report was produced. This informed the physicians about the extent of the disease and allowed the formulation clinicopathological correlation to better manage patients [5] . We note that comprehensive autopsies offer tremendous insight into deaths due to COVID-19 infections by allowing better evaluations of the extent of disease [6, 7] than PCR testing alone. Autopsy reports also detailed COVID-19 deaths and identified comorbidities that may have been missed at the clinical level and from the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f circumstances surrounding the death [5] . Some of the comorbidities included advanced HIV disease, disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma, congestive heart failure, disseminated tuberculosis, and severe atherosclerotic heart disease. Notable also were three cases of decedents in their twenties who died of COVID-19 infection without comorbidities [14] . Thrombosis in various organs was a very common finding in our cases with COVID-19 [15] . This finding has strengthened the evidence from a local perspective on physicians' need to administer anticoagulants in managing their COVID-19 patients [15] .Forensic pathology has contributed to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic through mortality and disease surveillance. Working with IDU provided forensic pathology an opportunity to input data into case management of COVID-19 patients.The authors have no conflict of interest to report.

An oral swab sample is collected by brushing a swab on a surface within the mouth, such as the tongue dorsum or buccal mucosa (inner cheek). Oral swabs have been employed in experimental or clinical contexts to detect Ebola virus, human papillomavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leishmania, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and other infectious diseases in both humans and animals [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Compared to more traditional specimens such as sputum, urine, blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs, oral swabbing is faster, less invasive, and requires no accommodations for privacy or aerosol control. In the case of TB, recent studies showed that qPCR analysis of oral swabs can detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in up to 93% of sputum qPCR-positive adult pulmonary TB patients [1, 2, 7] . One of these studies showed that tongue swabs yield significantly better M. tuberculosis signal than cheek or gum swabs [1] . In another recent study, self-collected tongue swabs detected 47/50 patients with confirmed COVID-19, for a sensitivity of 90% relative to the more invasive nasopharyngeal swabbing method [11] . Such results illustrate the expanding potential for simple swabbing methods in the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases, and the need for additional research in this area.One hindrance to the evaluation and implementation of oral swab methods is the potential for false negative results due to inadequate sampling (insufficient contact with oral mucosa). This problem is especially acute in the context of self-sampling as envisioned for scaled-up COVID-19 screening [11, 12] . In contrast to samples such as sputum and blood, which can be inspected visually to assure collection, samples collected within the mouth are most often visually indistinguishable from those which have never been inside a mouth. This challenge can be met by using a sample adequacy control (SAC), defined in this study and elsewhere [13] as a molecular target which differs from the diagnostic target and should consistently be present in definable amounts in properly collected specimens.Though standards for evaluating diagnostic tests frequently include quality assurance (QA) strategies [14] [15] [16] components and levels of QA are differentially adopted. Often, reference materials are added to samples as positive controls, for example purified DNA [17] . These are good practices to validate laboratory processes but they do not address the upstream issue of sampling adequacy. Even among approved molecular diagnostic assays, use of sample adequacy controls is not uniform [18] . In some cases, SACs are successfully utilized without preliminary validation. For example, in recent reports on the successful use of oral swabbing and virus nucleic acid testing for Ebola virus, endogenous controls targeting human nucleic acids were used as SACs. However, no determination of the amount of such nucleic acids that constitutes a swab collected within the oral cavity were presented [3, 4] .The present study evaluated two qPCR assays for their potential use in verifying whether a swab has sampled material within the mouth. One candidate SAC exploited the expanding understanding of the human oral microbiome in order to design a qPCR test specific for some of these microbes. The oral cavity has a diverse microbiota, with over 700 species identified [19] , yet among human microbiomes it has one of the lowest levels of beta diversity [20] . Streptococcus is a core genus of human oral microbiomes [21] and one of our candidate SAC tests targeted species of this genus.The second candidate SAC test targeted a ubiquitous human mitochondrial gene, under the assumption that swabs with sufficient contact with the oral epithelium will consistently contain more human cells than swabs which had been handled but not had contact with the oral cavity. Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is comprised of the 37 genes encoded within the cellular organelle. MtDNA is suitable for use as SACs in infectious disease diagnostic tests as they are always present in detectable quantities, and polymorphisms within these genes are rare and mitigated by the heteroplasmy of mtDNA [22, 23] . Most often, housekeeping genes have been employed to ensure that inhibition is not occurring in the qPCR amplification, rather than for the purpose of ascertaining sampling adequacy [17, 24, 25] . MtDNA was selected over other housekeeping genes because it was used previously in studies on non-human primates [9] .To validate the candidate SACs, a study was undertaken that was paired in two ways. First, hand and mouth swabs were tested from each individual. Second, two qPCR assays (for Streptococcus species and for human mtDNA) were performed on each sample. Hand swabs were used as simulated mishandled swabs that incidentally contacted human skin outside of the mouth. Such swabs were expected to contain both human and streptococcal DNA, but in smaller amounts than mouth swabs. We tested the hypothesis that mouth swab Cq values are sufficiently different from hand swab Cq values to enable the establishment of a threshold value separating the two groups. After optimization, a method utilizing human mtDNA was then applied to oral swabs collected by diverse methods from a cohort in Worcester, South Africa, as part of a recently completed analysis of oral swab testing for testing for TB [1] .Subjects in Seattle, WA, USA were recruited via flyers and emails that were posted and sent throughout the University of Washington campus. Samples were collected from subjects in their workplaces. Samples were stored at -80˚C within 8 hours of collection, and subsequently tested by qPCR as described below.Samples archived as part of a previous study on the use of oral swabs in the diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB patients in South Africa [1] were also used for the current study. South African participants had been recruited in clinics in Worcester, Western Cape (population 350,000). As described previously, these samples were collected from subjects in clinics or homes, stored at -80˚C within 8 hours of collection, and shipped frozen to Seattle where they were assayed by qPCR for M. tuberculosis DNA [1] . For the current study these archived samples were screened for human mtDNA.Protocols for collecting samples from U.S. subjects were approved by the University of Washington's Human Subjects Division. Archived South African samples collected for the previous study focusing on TB diagnosis [1] were used in the current study under ""future use"" provisions in consent forms, as approved by the University of Washington and the University of Cape Town.In Seattle, samples were collected by brushing Whatman OmniSwabs TM along the inside of each subject's cheek (oral swabs) or the surfaces of the palm and fingers (hand swabs) 7-8 times, or about 5 seconds.In South Africa, OmniSwabs TM and Puritan PurFlock TM swabs were previously collected by brushing the inner surface of the tongue dorsum, gums, or cheeks for 10 seconds [1] . OmniSwabs TM are a more expensive paper swab with a serrated head as compared to PurFlock TM swabs whose heads are composed of Polyester Flock and are rounded. These two swab types were being compared as a part of a previous study [1] . ""Air controls"" were collected at both study sites by exposing a swab to air for 10 seconds (PurFlock TM in South Africa, OmniSwab TM in Seattle). Immediately following sampling, all swab heads were deposited into, individual 500 mL tubes containing a lysis/preservation buffer (pH 8.0) consisting of 50 mM EDTA and sucrose, 100 mM sodium chloride, 65 mM tris, and 0.3% SDS. Samples were stored frozen at -80˚C until use.For the present study a total of 292 South African swabs were tested. They were selected based on the availability of partially processed samples, at a time point in the previous study [1] when TB status was blinded to us. The 292 swabs came from 71 South African subjects, each of whom provided up to 5 swabs (4 oral and 1 air). Some subjects had fewer than 5 swabs tested for this study. Only subjects for whom all 4 oral swabs were tested (N = 32) were included in comparisons between swabbing sites and swab brands. After unblinding, this cohort was found to include 7 TB-positive subjects and 25 TB-negative subjects.Samples collected from U.S. volunteers were extracted using the QIAGEN 96 DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit protocol. To begin extraction samples were boiled in lysis/preservation buffer at 100˚C for 10 min, followed by addition of proteinase K and QIAGEN lysis buffer AL and a 10-min incubation at 56˚C. Ethanol was then added to the samples and they were transferred to a plate column well for binding, two washes and elution. Nucleic acid was extracted from swab samples collected in South Africa using a modified spin column protocol of the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA mini kit (catalog #51306), described previously [1] .Each U.S. sample was tested twice, once for streptococcal DNA and once for human mtDNA ( Table 1 ). The Streptococcus species qPCR was comprised of primers from Picard et al [26] with the addition of a hydrolysis probe falling within the amplicon of the two primers, and designed for this study to be specific for four species of Streptococcus, namely S. gordonii, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, and S. sanguinis. These species were selected because of their established presence in the oral microbiome, combined with a limited known presence on the skin or in the environment, as reported by the Human Microbiome Project (hmpdacc.org/HMRGD). Design of the primer was accomplished using NCBI Blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and Primer 3 (http:// bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). The buffer and primer concentrations were identical to the published protocol [26] , with the modifications of probe concentration at 0.5 μM in the final reaction mixture and 2 μL of template instead of 1 μL. The human mtDNA qPCR was adapted from Caldwell et al. [27] qPCR primer and probe sequences as well as thermocycling conditions are summarized in Table 1 . For the samples from South Africa, 5 μL of archived extracted DNA from the previous study [1] was tested only by the assay targeting human mtDNA.Calculations were carried out using R, version 3.1.3. The package OptimalCutpoints was used to calculate Cq cutoffs with Youden's index. T-tests for both Seattle and South African studies were performed on paired samples because they evaluated within-subject differences.We first compared streptococcal DNA and human mtDNA as markers for oral swab SAC. While both markers were assumed to be ubiquitous on human skin and in the environment, we hypothesized that swabs with sufficient contact with the oral cavity would consistently have more of these materials than swabs that had not been inside human mouths. To test this, 51 healthy U.S. subjects were enrolled and 5 OmniSwabs TM were collected per participant: One from each hand, one from each inner cheek, and one ""air control"" swab, which constitutes a swab exposed to air for 10 seconds to serve as a negative control. Cq values (inversely proportional to target quantity) from streptococcal and human mtDNA qPCR tests conducted on all 255 samples (n = 510) were compared.Results from qPCR analyses of mouth and hand swabs are summarized in Fig 1. A Cq cutoff value that maximized Youden's index ([sensitivity + specificity] -1) was established for each assay. The qPCR assay for streptococcal DNA had an optimal Cq cutoff at 34.9. Cq values below this cutoff corresponded with oral swabbing with a sensitivity of 99.0% and a specificity of 99.0%. Thus, the streptococcal assay was imperfect as a SAC. In contrast, human mtDNA as a classifier was able to perfectly distinguish between hand and mouth samples with a threshold Cq value of 31.3 (Fig 1) . Air swabs yielded no detectable qPCR signal for either human mtDNA or streptococcal DNA in 94% of cases (48/51). When qPCR signals were observed in air swabs, their Cq values were always above the optimal cutoff value.Next, the human mtDNA sample adequacy control was applied to samples previously collected in a blinded study from South African TB patients and controls [1] . In Phase 1 of the previous study, South Africans with possible TB sampled by oral swabbing. Swabs were collected from each subject on three different days. For the present study, a total of 292 swabs from 71 South African subjects were tested for human mtDNA. The oral site and swab brand comparisons focused on oral swabs collected from 32 participants during their second swabbing session (Day 2). The swabs were collected from three different oral sites using two different swab brands, specifically: Tongue dorsum (OmniSwabs TM ), gum (OmniSwabs TM ), right buccal surface (OmniSwabs TM ), and left buccal surface (PurFlock TM ) [1] . Cq values from buccal OmniSwab TM samples collected from U.S. and South African donors (Figs 1 and 2 , respectively) were compared in a T-test for differences in human mtDNA. Buccal OmniSwab TM Cq values from the South African cohort were significantly lower (H A = two-sided) than those from the initial evaluation done on the U.S. cohort (p = 0.0016).Comparing mouth regions, in a paired analysis Cq values for gum or tongue OmniSwabs TM were not significantly different from buccal OmniSwabs TM (Fig 2) . Comparing swab types, Purflock TM buccal swabs yielded lower Cq values (indicating more human mtDNA) than OmniSwab TM buccal swabs (p = 0.019) (Fig 2) . Thus, it appears that PurFlock TM swabs collect slightly more human biological material than OmniSwabs TM in the same mouth region.The South African sample did not include hand swabs, however it did include PurFlock TM ""air swabs"" that were collected in South African homes and clinics at the same time that oral swabs were collected. The human mtDNA test was applied to a sample of 64 of these swabs, 20 of which were collected at the same time and location as the oral swabs in Fig 2. Human mtDNA was detected in many of these swabs. However, Cq values always fell above the threshold value of 31.3, indicative of orally collected swabs (Fig 2) .Oral swabs are emerging as non-invasive samples for diagnosing infectious diseases. In the most sensitive protocol identified to date for oral swab diagnosis of TB [1] , (the dorsum of the tongue is gently scraped and the swab head with collected material, consisting of bacterial biofilm and host cells, is deposited into a sample buffer; the sample is a semi-clear, non-viscous suspension suitable for testing by qPCR targeting M. tuberculosis DNA. Tongue swabbing is fast, painless, and does not require accommodations for privacy or aerosol control. Sputumscarce patients such as children and HIV-positive adults are easily swabbed. In recent studies the method approached the sensitivity and specificity of sputum testing in adults [1] . In a separate study, the method approached the sensitivity and specificity of gold-standard nasopharyngeal swabbing for the detection of COVID-19 [3] .Despite these advantages, additional work is needed to bring the method into parity with traditional methods. For example, in one study buccal swabs collected from TB patients exhibited only 45% sensitivity relative to sputum testing [7] . In that study swabs were tested using the Cepheid GeneXpert Ultra using a protocol designed for sputum (not swab) sample processing and testing. Moreover, it used buccal swabs [2] , not the more optimal tongue swabs [1] . Such results support the feasibility of oral swabbing for TB, but highlight the need for more research to yield fully optimized methods. As such work proceeds, it is essential to control for possible false negative results that arise from inadequate sampling. In contrast to visually distinctive specimens such as sputum and blood, a swab collected in the oral cavity can resemble a swab that has never been inside a mouth. Therefore, the current study identified and evaluated SACs for use in evaluating and implementing oral swab-based diagnostic methods.While tests targeting human mtDNA and streptococcal DNA both appeared able to distinguish mouth swabs from hand swabs, the human mtDNA test was more sensitive and specific at a calculated Cq cutoff. This was largely due to the more variable and higher overall Cq values observed when mouth swabs were tested by the streptococcal assay. This observation is consistent with the beta diversity that has been reported for human oral microbiomes [22] [23] [24] .Human mtDNA signals in buccal swabs from the South African cohort were significantly lower than those from the U.S. cohort. This difference may reflect disparities in sampling or DNA extraction methods. Swabbing duration for South African participants was 10 seconds, longer than for the participants in the Seattle phase of this study (5 seconds). Different QIA-GEN extraction kits were utilized for samples deriving from the different sites.It is noteworthy that a significant number of air swabs had positive signals for human DNA, albeit well outside the threshold Cq value. The number was larger in the South African sample than in the U.S. sample, possibly because samples were collected in more diverse environments in South Africa, including clinics and patient homes. Human DNA is ubiquitous in built environments [28] . This underscores the need to use quantitative methods combined with a well-validated threshold value when human DNA is used as a SAC.All U.S. oral swab samples fell below the human mtDNA Cq threshold for orally collected swabs. In the South African sample, 5/292 oral swabs (1.71%) fell above the Cq threshold established in this study. This included 3 buccal swabs, one gum swab, and one tongue swab. These samples were excluded from the previous study [1] .The human mtDNA qPCR appears to be robust and useful as a SAC for determining whether a swab has been collected in several mouth regions using 2 swab brands. Nonetheless, some quantitative variations were observed. The South African samples had lower Cq values (more human mtDNA) than the U.S. samples. This might reflect differences in sampling methods, prevalence of TB, and/or comorbidities, diet, socioeconomic factors, and/or microbiomes.PurFlock TM buccal swabs yielded lower Cq values (indicating more human mtDNA) than OmniSwab TM (p = 0.035). This finding is consistent with improved performance of that swab type in detecting TB [1] . This may reflect a higher capacity for human biological material.This study had several limitations. The sample size was limited and restricted to two geographical locations in the U.S. and South Africa. The South African sample was a convenience sample consisting of people visiting a clinic for TB-like symptoms. Although it included air swabs, it did not include hand swabs. The current analysis was non-blinded. Neither human mtDNA nor Streptococcal DNA were found to be useful for distinguishing swabs collected from different sites within the mouth.Despite these limitations, the results indicate that PCR for human mtDNA can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally. This feature makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis. The human mtDNA SAC may prove useful in the evaluation and implementation of oral swabs as non-invasive tools for infectious disease diagnosis.","South Africa","abstract","2020-10-30",10

Accordingly, new antimicrobial agents acting on novel targets have to be developed to overwhelm the increased incidence of microbial resistance to antibiotic remedy. From the best validated antimicrobial targets are the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes which are key enzymes in the protein translation, producing the charged tRNAs required for proper assembly of peptide chains. From these enzymes, LeuRS have been considered as a drug target in fungi and bacteria, it is reported to be inhibited in the editing site by the potent antifungal 5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole (AN2690) which is in clinical phases [2] [3] [4] .Recently, the outbreak of COVID-19, a new coronavirus pneumonia, caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic according to WHO in March 2020 [5] . To date, millions of infections and thousands of deaths have been recorded all over the world. In this scenario, there is a crucial need for developing antiviral agents interfering with the life cycle of the virus or with the virus replication or membrane fusion [6] . Many researchers have considered the SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro), in addition called chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpr-2) as a potential target to anti-COVID-19 drugs [7] [8] [9] .Literature survey demonstrates that a lot of formazans have been described to possess broad spectrum of biological activities and pharmacological applications [10] such as antimicrobial [11] [12] [13] [14] , antiviral [15] [16] [17] , anticancer [18] , and anti-inflammatory [19] [20] .As for instance, the formazan derivative I was reported to display 100% inhibition of the Ranikhet diseases virus [21] . Additionally, the two formazans II and III synthesized by Misra and Dhar [22] showed 87% and 83% protections against the Ranikhet disease virus, respectively. Furthermore, many formazans IV were reported by Lakshmi et al. [23] to have significant antibacterial and antifungal activities. Also, Uraz et al. [24] synthesized some formazan derivatives V, VI with different substituents and evaluated their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some selected microorganism species. The results revealed high activity against C. tropicalis, C. kefir, S. cerevisiae and C. neofarmans (Figure 1) . Recently, the synthesized drugs in the nanoscale have demonstrated a superior ability to penetrate the DNA of various diseases, which have increased their biological activity and their ability to inhibit the diseases [25, 26] . Inspired by the promising previously reported antimicrobial and antiviral activities of formazans and the urgent need of new effective antimicrobial agent and antiviral drugs to act mainly against COVID-19 and in continuation of our research work in synthesis of bioactive compounds [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , we synthesized herein a new series of nano-sized formazan analogues to study their potential as antibacterial and antifungal agents in vitro.Additionally, molecular docking simulations were done to propose their mode of binding in the editing domain of LeuRS and to show the possibility of these compounds to act against SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme.The first series of formazan analogues 3a-f were synthesized in sodium ethoxide solution at The XRD diffraction is a good tool to predict the size of the solid sample and the degree crystal regularity. Five sample 3d, 3f, 5g, 5h and 7b of the synthesized formazan analogues were screened over 10˚<2θ <80˚ range to determined their crystallographic features (Figures 6a-e). All investigated formazan analogues revealed sharp peaks which indicated the crystalline feature of them. The size of the crystals of the five samples was calculated according to the reported Debye-Scherrer equation [33] and the calculated size was tabulated in Table 1 . The results referred to the formazan analogues moieties synthesized in the nanometer-scale. In addition, SEM is another tool useful to give excellent insight about the crystallinity as well as surface topography for the tested solid samples. Figure 7 contains two SEM images for two formazan analogues 5h and 7b as examples for the prepared series. The two images indicated that the crystals of the two derivatives are found in the nanometer-scale. Antimicrobial activities were carried out at the Regional Center for Mycology and biotechnology (RCMB), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt. Target compounds 3a-e, 5a-h, 7b were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial, and antifungal activities, by inhibition zone method against two gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (RCMB 010010) andBacillus subtilis (RCMB 015), two gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (RCMB 010052) and Proteus vulgaris (RCMB 004) and two fungi: Aspergillus flavus (RCMB 002002) and Candida albicans (RCMB 005003) using gentamycin and ketoconazole as reference antibacterial and antifungal drugs, respectively (Table 2&3 ).Concerning the antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, most compounds showed mild to moderate activities. The best activities were seen for the acetyl derivatives 5a, 5b, 5c, 5g and 5h with inhibition zones values ranging from 15 to 18 mm, compared to gentamycin with IZ = 24 and 26 mm for S. aureus and B. subtilis, respectively.Regarding gram-negative bacteria, they were resistant to 3a and 3b, while 3d having 4-Br group revealed moderate activity against P. vulgaris (IZ=17 mm) compared to gentamycin (IZ=25 mm). On the other hand, compounds 5a, 5b, 5g and 5h displayed reasonable antibacterial activities against P. vulgaris with IZ values 16, 18, 17 and 18, respectively.Additionally, most compounds revealed mild antibacterial activities against the gram negative E. coli.Most of the tested formazan analogues exhibited promising antifungal activities with the exception of 3e, 5f and 7b that were inactive against used fungal strains.Focusing on the antifungal activities of compounds 3a-e, compound 3a elicited comparable antifungal activity (IZ= 17 and 18 mm against A. flavus and C. Albicans, respectively) to ketoconazole (IZ= 16 and 20 mm against A. flavus and C. Albicans, respectively). Also, significant activities were observed for compounds 3b and 3c (IZ=13-16 mm). In addition, compound 3d demonstrated superior antifungal activity against A. flavus (Z= 20 mm) that was more potent than ketoconazole.Furthermore, by studying the antifungal activities of 5a-h, moderate to potent activities were displayed. Among these compounds, compound 5g with 3-Cl group showed IZ= 20 mm against A. flavus and 18 mm against C. Albicans that were higher than those of ketoconazole. Additionally, compound 5a showed comparble activity (IZ= 16 and 19 mm) to ketoconazole.These antifungal activities results were highly appreciated since A. fumigatus is the second main cause of invasive aspergillosis and is the first leading cause of cutaneous aspergillosis [34] . In addition to the increased incidence of infections by C. albicans, the most common cause of candidiasis, and the increased resistance of C. albicans to antifungal drugs [35, 36] . Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) belongs to the family aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), group of central enzymes that play a crucial role in protein synthesis, which is vital for survival of micro-organism and hence its inhibition presented a novel and attractive target for developing antimicrobials [37] . Many recent reviews have discussed the importance of aaRSs in the discovery and development of antibacterial and antifungal agents [38] [39] [40] [41] .In this study, molecular docking study of the newly synthesized formazan analogues 3a-f, 5a-h and 7a,b have been performed onto the active site of Candida albicans editing domain of cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase to demonstrate their binding affinity and orientation. Results of the docking simulation were displayed in Table 4 showing the docking scores and the different formed interactions such as hydrogen bond, pi-H and non-polar pi-cation interactions.For majority of compounds, Ala315, Lys407, and Lys483 were recognized as key amino acid residues responsible for hydrogen bonds generation and Thr316, Leu317, Arg318, Asp421and Tyr487 were identified for minor interaction. Whereas, for pi-H and pi-cation interactions, Lys407, Ser419, Lys483 and Tyr487 were the only observed residues.Focusing on the binding mode of the most active analogues as antifungals, 3a, 3d, 5a and 5g (Figure 8) , it was observed that they are well stabilized into the active site through strong it an attractive target for developing anti-coronavirus drug [42] .The protein structure of 3CLpro-2 consists of 9 α-helices and 13 β-strands making together three distinctive domains: Domain I (residues 8-101), Domain II (residues 102-184) andDomain III (residues 201-306) connected to Domain II by an extended loop (residues 185-200). 3CLpro-2 contains a catalytic dyad that is composed of conserved residues His41 and Cys145 and the key substrate-binding site is formed as a split between Domain I and Domain II [43] .To estimate the binding affinity of derivatives 3a-f, 5a-h and 7a,b with COVID-19 3CLpro (PDB code: 6LU7), molecular docking study was done. As shown in Table 5 and Gln189 indicating the importance of these hydrophobic moieties. Molecular modeling study revealed that these compounds could bind properly to C. albicans leucyl-tRNA synthetase editing domain. Additionally, docking simulation into the active site of COVID-19 3CL protease showed superior fitting into the active site with binding scores from -5.6064 to -8.0555 Kcal/mol.The melting points of all new formazan analogues were recorded using a SMP3 melting All the microbial strains that used in the current study have been supplied from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt from the culture collection of the Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology (RCMB). The method used for recording the antimicrobial activity according to the literature method [44] .Molecular docking was analyzed through using MOE-Dock 2014 software [45] . Chemical structures of 3a-f, 5a-h and 7a,b were drawn by the MOE builder followed by minimization using the force field MMFF94x in this program. Hydrogen atoms were then added and unwanted water molecules were cancelled. Docking was then performed using London dG for rescoring 1 and GBVI/WSA dG for rescoring 2. At the same time, refinement was done through forcefield. ""Ligand Interactions"" was utilized for the 2D visualization o the proteinligand interactions. The best pose was then selected depending on the binding energy and the interactions found in the active site.","Egypt","first author","2020-10-07",10

The rise in urbanization and the closer integration of the world economy has facilitated global interconnectedness. 2 Yet trade and travel, essential components of globalization, are significant contributors to the spread of infectious diseases. Historically, pandemics have been observed throughout the history of human movement and communication. 3 The bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis was transmitted from China to Europe through trade routes. 4 Similarly, following the movement of armies in the first world war, the influenza pandemic of 1918 led to over 50 million deaths worldwide. 5 More recently, the Asian flu of 1957 (influenza A H2N2) was reported in 20 countries and primarily spread via land and sea travel. 6, 7 The Hong Kong flu pandemic (influenza A H3N2) reported extensive spread through air travel. 8, 9 Over the years, globalization has amplified global disease transmission and resulted in significant economic implications. The close integration of the economy in modern times has, therefore, emerged as an essential mechanism of disease transmission. 10 The consequences of a pandemic are not only defined in terms of mortality but also impacts on our daily livelihood and economy, with globalization accelerating this loss and costing billions (US dollars) in expenditures. Pandemics affect the economy in terms of demand and supply. First, consumers and investors tend to lose confidence in marketplaces affected by the pandemic, depreciating the demand side of the market. 11 Second, absenteeism and reduction in the workforce negate the supply side. 11 Lastly, public health and international response to pandemics affect economics and development policies in trade, travel, and health response. 11 A pandemic can also affect the economy in terms of decelerating economic growth of affected countries, leading to reduction in trade and increase poverty. 11, 12 For example, the 1918 influenza pandemic presented financial loss in the form of decreased education, increased disabilities, and lower socioeconomic status. 13 Another significant impact of pandemics emerges in the form of workforce reduction. Absenteeism in schools and the workforce were considered a direct economic impact of Hong Kong flu in the 70s. 13 Likewise, flu pandemics have led to a notable reduction of human and economic capital, as illustrated by the SARS pandemic, which had an estimated economic impact of $18 billion in East Asia. 14 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe end of 2019 challenged the world with an epidemic of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first observed in Wuhan, China. 15 COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV 2, presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe, with asymptomatic presentation also described. 16 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic 15 and as of 28 May 2020, over 5.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 0.35 million deaths have been reported worldwide. 17 This unprecedented time of COVID-19 and the implemented lockdown measures have influenced uncertainty regarding economic growth. The uncertainty on the global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2020 is expected to decline by 3%, and by 6.1% for advanced economies. 18 Additionally, the second-largest economy of China reported a reduction of 6.8% in the first quarter. 19 The lockdown measures have also increased telework and telecommuting, cancelled operations, as well as restricted supply and demand.The impact that COVID-19 can exert on health systems of the world varies. Low-and middle-income countries with less developed health systems are likely to face more significant challenges and remain vulnerable in controlling COVID-19 compared to high-income countries. 20 Thus, determining the vulnerability indices at the national level is crucial in helping the policymakers and the World Health Organization (WHO) to better control and mitigate the impact of the pandemic more efficiently.The purpose of the current study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on globalization in terms of mobility, economy and Healthcare systems utilizing data obtained for 1) mobility and travel resources, 2) economy and workforce, 3) Healthcare capacity, and 4) country-level health vulnerability. Health vulnerability was examined through the calculation of a Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proofThe mobility of individuals and the respective magnitude was assessed using airlines and seaport trade and travel information. Major airlines were selected based on the number of countries traveled to and from by each airline throughout Asia, the Americas, and Europe. To understand the situation before the introduction of COVID-19 in January 2020, 21-26 detailed information related to travel history was obtained from the airlines' 2018-2019 annual reports.Similarly, major cruise companies were selected and 2018-2019 yearly reports studied. [27] [28] [29] Furthermore, significant seaports and trade volumes in areas with major shipping routes were examined by investigating the world shipping council website. 30 Current responses to COVID-19 was studied by following the official notices and websites of the travel companies. 31-37The economic impact was explored through trade volumes, event cancellation, and workforce impact based on 2018-2019 database. Additional information was collected by examining the changes in the workforce, stock market, and major industries since the introduction of COVID-19 in January 2020 compared to 2019. Stocks were studied to investigate the stock value difference through the course of the pandemic.The impact on food and agriculture was examined in terms of supply, agricultural contribution to GDP, food expenditures, agricultural imports, global food chains, business closures, food insecurity, supply disruptions, and response to COVID-19. 60-67The impact on academic institutions was explored by studying the measures taken by universities to handle COVID-19. Furthermore, university reopening plans and future enrollment impact particularly among international students were also examined. [68] [69] [70] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proofHealthcare capacity (diagnosis, ICU, hospital beds, etc.) was examined by studying the healthcare systems and preparedness of countries. Additional information regarding healthcare responses and workforce impact were analyzed by following news articles, health department websites, WHO situation report, and published peer-reviewed articles. Search engines such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and the websites of the Ministry of Health, and WHO's country office were used. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Detailed information regarding healthcare responses was collected by corresponding to the WHO country representative. The reported cases were studied from multiple sources, namely, WHO situation reports, John Hopkins University interactive dashboard, and the Worldometers website. 17, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] The health indicators were reviewed and extracted from the global health security index website. 86 Furthermore, the COVID-19 disease prevalence, the impacted population, and other country-specific information were studied and derived from World Bank open data websites and Index Mundi. 87-89We focused on multiple criteria decisions making approach for COVID-19 vulnerability assessment as different countries adopt different strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic according to their means and resources. We used the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which takes into consideration uncertainty as well as positivity or negativity of various criteria and their related weights in ranking one country compared with others. 90 The TOPSIS method reduces the difference in the rankings which uses a crisp or fuzzy data set. 91 We used nationally data reported on September 4, 2020 regarding COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, tests per million population, number of active cases, and the total number of those who recovered from COVID-19, from the Worldometers website (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). We also considered population density per sq.km, global health index, diabetes prevalence, and date of the first case (COVID 19) reported for each country. More details are provided in the supplement.Further, this technique also considers the reduction of the difference of rankings inherent in ranking data sets (see Supplement). We used coefficients from a generalized linear model (GLM) for the weights of the ranking criteria and the explanatory factors such as population J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof density, days since the first case was reported, the global health index (GHI), diabetic prevalence index, number of active cases, total cases reported, total tests conducted, and total tests per million. 86 This technique results in a ranking criterion computed from how far apart or close a country is from the highest as well as lowest vulnerable position considering its weight. A high score indicates high vulnerability to widespread transmission of COVID-19.Ten significant airlines covering over 50 countries presented large coverage in terms of passengers carried. Table 1 (appendix) includes relevant information regarding airlines. As the table shows, airlines such as Turkish, Delta, and Lufthansa Group each carried more than 5 million passengers per month in 2018-2019. Most airliner countries have responded to COVID-19 by implementing international travel bans from affected countries. On average about 30% reduction in stock prices has been observed among major airlines. Table 2 (appendix) outlines the three major cruise lines and their status during the pandemic. The Carnival Corporation is one of the largest cruise line company with over 100 vessels carried about one million passengers monthly across its multiple cruise lines. The corporation responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending cruises from March 13-April 9, 2020. This cruise line has observed over a 60% reduction in stock prices. Social distancing has been implemented since the pandemic broke out, which led to the cancellations of numerous events across the world. For instance, the 2020 Summer Olympics to be held in Japan was rescheduled for 2021. Sports events such as athletics, cycling, soccer, golf, auto racing, tennis, cricket, badminton, rugby, and basketball have been canceled or postponed (Table 5 , appendix).With lockdowns and travel restrictions, the workforce has been affected universally. About 62% of global employment constitutes of informal economy characterized by lack of social security, benefits, healthcare access, income security and possibility of remote work presenting the most vulnerable group. Among the most vulnerable in the labor market, almost 1.6 billion informal economy workers are significantly impacted by lockdown measures. 59 The most affected industries such as manufacturing, accommodation, food services, and retail present about 54% employers worldwide and account for 30% of average GDP. It is estimated that considerable amount of time and effort is needed for these sectors to recover. 59 Working hours are expected to decline by 10.5% compared to the quarter prior to the pandemic, which accounts to 305 million fulltime jobs. Americas, Europe, and Central Asia are expected to observe significant loss in working hours. The highest loss in working hours are expected in low-and middle-income countries. 59The unforeseen pandemic has challenged the healthcare systems worldwide. Some nations are impacted less than others, as demonstrated by fatality rates. The impact of COVID-19 on the food and agriculture industries are presented in Tables 8 (appendix). As shown in Table 9 (appendix), the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have reported high impact from production and supply disruptions. 65 Interestingly, these countries have low impact on the demand shock due to Countries with higher GDP from agriculture, such as India and Bangladesh, have presented low exposure to supply but high exposure to demand shocks (Table 9 , appendix). 65 In addition, an initial slump in services and consumption at leading food chains contributed greatly to the disruptions in the food industry. This has been attributed to the many closures due to lockdowns. Although, limited disruptions in supply has been reported, numerous franchises have been closed in European markets.Academic institutions have observed major disruptions similar to disruptions in other major industries. Most institutions have resorted to moving classes online and cancelling in-person classes. 95 Transitioning to online classes brought many logistical problems. Results from a survey showed that almost 10% of institutions do not have the facilities and infrastructures in place to conduct online classes, and most of these institutions are in Africa. 69 Furthermore, the majority of the institutions have indicated a significant impact on enrollment of both new international and local students, with negative financial consequences. 69 Additionally, 80% of the institutions in the survey reported negative impact on research at higher institutions owing to travel bans, cancellation of research events, and incomplete projects. 69 Moreover, limited J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f flexibility has been observed in the United States from restricted use of grant funding to alleviate the impact of COVID- 19. 96 In an attempt to deal with the ongoing pandemic, many universities have been considering or adopting the following methods of reopening the new academic year: adopting online-only instructions, in-person with social distancing, or creating a hybrid model with components of both in-person and online elements. 95 Nevertheless, the economic impact of the pandemic on academic institutions is devastating. For example, the US institutions of higher education will lose an estimated one billion dollars due to cancellation of study abroad programs, as well as new student enrollments are likely to suffer. Further, an estimated loss of three billion dollars would happen if future international students cannot be enrolled. 68 In Australia, major universities are estimated to lose a cumulative five billion AUD by 2024. According to a recent report, 38 universities would collectively lose 3.3 billion AUD due to loss of international students alone. 70 In the UK, where most universities have moved online, 13 universities can potentially face bankruptcy due to With an approximate decrease in enrollment by 50% among incoming international and 10% among local students, an estimated loss of 11 billion pounds have been reported, including revenue from non-academic venues such as accommodation and services. 97Based on results calculated for the PVI (the higher the score, the more vulnerable), the top ten 99 Cruise ships have been recognized as an epicenter for outbreaks. More than 800 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to have originated in a cruise ship settings. 100 The stocks of cruise line companies have been declining, resulting in layoffs and affecting the livelihood of the employees.Restrictive lockdowns implemented as a response to the pandemic have led to a decrease in production, consumption, employment, and supply chain affecting the world economy at large. 101 It is estimated that the global economy and value chains are likely to create an economic depression more severe than the 2008 financial crisis. 102 Furthermore, only 34% of employment in the US can be performed from home, which accounts for 44% of all wages. 48 Individuals working in industries such as transportation, construction, retail, service, and hospitality may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof find it implausible to work remotely. 48 In the USA alone, the unemployment rate has risen to 14.7% in April from 10.3% in March, indicating the highest monthly increase in unemployment in history.Travel and tourism account for over 10% of global GDP and one of the industries affected directly by COVID-19. 39 Numerous international and national sports, conferences, and concerts have been canceled due to the pandemic causing massive losses in the host nation. 103 Tourism is expected to be immensely affected by this pandemic. Asia-pacific region of destinations such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are expected to be significantly affected. Furthermore, unemployment is a major problem with an estimated 14% decline in jobs related to this industry. 38 Additionally, academic research and higher education have also been affected by the loss of international students and scholars, as well as research conduct in basic, clinical, and population-based studies due to lockdowns and physical distancing requirements.The pandemic has also impacted the food and agriculture industry greatly. Developed countries are facing disruptions in production and supply chains due to the needs of advanced and capital-intensive agricultural system, disruptions in local and international mobility, delays in customs, and disruptions in credit markets. 65 In addition, there have been major shortages in developed countries with high-demand supplies such as face masks, sanitizers, and paper products due to hoarding and lack of adequate supplies. 104 Nevertheless, the looming risk of food insecurity in developed nations lies in the impact of COVID-19 in people's employment, as demonstrated by the current economic recession, which stands at 6% on average in 2020. 105, 106 This situation is even worse for LMICs. LMICs have shown a high risk to the demand-side of food insecurity due to low socio-economic status, access issues, and dependence on the importation of food. 65 Developing countries are estimated to observe at least a 3.6% decrease in GDP and affecting Africa, South Asia, and South America the most. Globally, over 140 million people are estimated to face extreme poverty, which would increase food insecurity severely. 106 Subsequently, the journey from farm to fork has been somewhat concerning in the service delivery of restaurants. While many global food chains have reported bankruptcy and closures in selected markets, delivery services by third-party vendors have been thriving. 67, [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] The concerns regarding food and agriculture industry have escalated all over the world with the progression of the pandemic, and with no end in sight.Academic institutions also have been affected by the pandemic and emerged as a key concern due to mobility and socializing of students. While many universities have shifted to online, hybrid, or in-person classes with social distancing, 95 universities have emerged as a new hotspot of COVID-19 after reopening. 114, 115 Therefore, the implications of reopening universities have proven to be severe for public health. Moreover, universities are predicting steep decline in new enrollments of both international and local students; the serious financial impact will have major economic consequences . 69, 97 Healthcare systems across the world are exhausting themselves in the control of COVID-19. This study also calculated a country level PVI and assigned rankings. We identified that countries with high numbers of active cases are more vulnerable like Ireland, UK, and Italy despite having good healthcare facilities. This again illustrates the globalization that may have precipitated the amplification of pandemic in these regions. In Asia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India presented as being more vulnerable. A plausible explanation may be high population density in these areas. The US has the highest burden of COVID-19 and the health system is struggling to meet the demands of this pandemic. However, the USA is identified as a moderately vulnerable country to COVID-19. The reason might be lower population density, higher diagnosis, and higher ranking in GHI. Most of the countries in Africa have a poor healthcare system and most of them fall to the bottom of GHI. although they have a low number of cases. But a poor healthcare system and low GHI score 86 makes them more vulnerable. 86 On the other hand, some countries are testing very low and some have high active cases now. This illustrates multiple facets of handling the control and containment of COVID-19. Therefore, the control strategies taken by different countries to handle the pandemic can ease the vulnerability of countries to COVID-19. However, every control action has consequential effects in the economy and global health at large.Although this study utilized multiple elements to characterize the effects of the pandemic on globalization and implemented an innovative technique not previously applied to assess a country's vulnerability to the pandemic, some limitations exist. Some information was extracted taken from non-traditional sources such as news articles due to a lack of information from official sources. In addition, for the calculation of the PVI and rank, the selection of variables was influenced by the availability of country-level data. For example, only the diabetic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prevalence was available for all countries; no other risk factors such as hypertension prevalence was available. Moreover, country-level data do not consider subject-level risk factors; thus, within the same country, people with different levels of the same risk factors may have different vulnerabilities to the transmission COVID-19. Nevertheless, knowing which countries are at high vulnerability for the spread of COVID-19 will allow the governments and policymakers to respond faster putting control measures in place to limit the spread.The pandemic has exposed the urgent need to revisit disaster preparedness and public health response to a health crisis such as COVID-19. Though much progress has been made in the nations' and world's ability to respond to a public health emergency, the healthcare capacity of various powerful nations has been tested during this pandemic. Even developed countries with sophisticated infrastructure, sanitation, and hygiene that have undergone epidemiological transitions are facing difficulties controlling the epidemic. Less developed countries, however, has been overwhelmed, with many nations unable to adequately respond to and control the pandemic due to the lack of infrastructure, resources, fragile governments, and impoverished communities. The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated disparities between low-to middleincome countries and high-income and developed nations, and between the poor and the rich.The pandemic has also exposed inadequate surveillance systems worldwide unable to detect and control the pandemic. This paper assessed the vulnerability of countries to COVID-19. This information will allow the governments and policymakers to respond faster putting control measures in place to limit the spread and alleviate the consequences to economy at large.

The virus spread worldwide by March 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it has become a pandemic disease. By 30 June 2020, the confirmed infected cases worldwide reached 10,193,278 cases, and there were 503,913 registered deaths; though on the national level, Egypt has confirmed nearly 66,754 cases and 2872 death cases globally (WHO, 2020) .Coronavirus is an acute respiratory disorder that causes pneumonia with symptoms like fever, cough, and dyspnea and has a mortality rate of about 2-3% (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) . A nationwide lockdown is enforced in Egypt from 15 th March till the end of June 2020 due to COVID-19 contagion. With this national shutdown, at night time almost all industrial, commercial activities and transportation were banned. For weeks, throughout the country, a majority of factories and businesses stopped their activities; except that were required for citizens to provide basic and daily needs and city operations. At the start of this pandemic, the Egyptian government and authorities have taken several measures, and recommendations have been made to restrict the rapid spread of Coronavirus. Airports, schools, other manufacturing, commercial, and travel operations were forced to shut down till further reports and other industries are operating with low productivity to reduce contact between workers. People were also required to remain at home except for vital and urgent problems and take the government measures seriously into consideration.Globally there was matching between many countries in the decision of lockdown, which was observed by the real changes in the global air quality, as a consequence of reducing local pollutant emissions. The rapidly rising economy, civilization, socio-economic development, together with the growth of motorized vehicles have a massive impact on air quality, particularly in the highly developed and populated cities. The impacts resulted from this lockdown on air quality have been investigated globally (Wafdy and Abdallah, 2020) and over different regions of the world such as Morocco (Otmani et al., 2020) , Delhi, India (Mahato et al., 2020) , China (Dutheil et al., 2020; . Several studies have indicated that the reduction of anthropogenic activity during the COVID-19 contagion plays an important role in the formation of air pollution and could affect the ambient air quality (He et al., 2020; Isaifan, 2020) .Air pollution is a complex mixture of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants released into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and natural sources . PM 10 , NO 2 , and SO 2 are considered popular air pollutants in urban surroundings. Multiple studies have elucidated the severe health issues associated with these pollutants, which involve respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure, and lung cancer (Koken et al., 2003; Le Tertre et al., 2002) . These pollutants are produced from anthropogenic sources like transportation and industrial activities (Thorpe and Harrison, 2008; He et al., 2020) , as well as the long-range transport of pollutants from other nations. NO 2 produced in the atmosphere from anthropogenic processes (mostly from vehicles and power plants combustion of fossil fuel) and natural processes (e.g. soil processes and lightning) (Ogen, 2020) . WHO reported that 4.6 million people die each year from illnesses related to air pollution (Cohen et al., 2017) . Deaths associated with poor air quality involve but are not limited to lung and heart disorders, respiratory sensitivity, asthma, and bronchitis (Brauer, 2010) .The most important ambient pollutant in the monitoring of air quality is fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) gaseous emissions are usually estimated to track pollution rates for fossil fuel combustion and exhaust from vehicles. Ozone (O 3 ) is produced from the photochemical reaction among nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which occur under high-temperature and extreme sunshine conditions. Epidemic studies proved that there is a strong correlation between the level of exposure to air pollution and high morbidity and mortality rates from respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (Pope III et al., 2002) .In Egypt, the rising economy, urbanization, socio-economic development, and associated increasing motorized vehicles along with overpopulation have a major impact on air quality, particularly in highly developed and populated regions such as Greater Cairo and the Nile Delta (Abou El-Magd, et al., 2020) . The present research aimed to investigate the degree of improvement of air quality over Egypt during the high peak duration of COVID-19 from January to June 2020. The spatial and temporal variations in aerosols and trace gases (NO 2 , CO, and O 3 ) will be comprehensively studied. This duration will be contrasted with the same months from the previous 2 years (2018 and 2019), to obtain a full picture of the real effect of the COVID-19 short-term lockdown measures on air quality over Egypt.Egypt occupies the northeastern corner of the African continent surrounded from the North by the Mediterranean Sea, from the east by the Red Sea, from the west by Libya, and from the south by Sudan. Fig. 1 shows Egypt's location, highlighting its main cities. Because of Egypt's geographical location, together with industrialization and overpopulation change, there are several contributing factors to the pollution created in Egypt. This includes its geomorphological characteristics, the rapid population growth, transportation, biomass burning, and industrialization. During the spring season, high wind accelerates the dust movement from the desert and contribute to increased pollution levels throughout the country (Zakey et al., 2008; Shokr et al., 2017; Abou El-Magd et al., 2020) . Egypt's population is counted 98101011 in 2019 as declared by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS, 2019). In this research, a study site around Egypt at 24.5654E, 21.4613N, and 37.0459E, 32.0082N was used for data analysis. Nile Delta region and Cairo are the most densely populated region in Egypt and also the highly polluted. In this research, various satellite sensors have been used to examine the variations in air quality over Egypt during the period between January and June 2020 in comparison with the same months in previous years (2018 and 2019). Aerosol and gaseous air pollutants were analyzed including Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), Carbon monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O 3 ).Almost regular global observations of aerosol and cloud properties can be obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard Terra and Aqua satellites since 2000 and 2002, respectively, with a broad range of 0.4-14 μm and a spatial resolution of 250m-1km. Aerosol retrieval over land from MODIS can be achieved using the dart target (DT) algorithm (Kaufman et al., 1997) , while the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm has been developed to recover aerosols over bright surfaces like deserts and urban areas (Hsu et al., 2013) . In this research, MODIS Level-3 Terra DT&DB AOD data with a spatial resolution of 1° were analyzed. The analysis was carried out on a daily and weekly basis for the 6 months from January to June, in three consecutive years 2018, 2019, and, 2020 to detect and map the changes in AOD loading in 2020 influenced by the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 spreading. MODIS data were acquired freely from https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/. Table 1 shows the properties of the products analyzed in this research.The hyperspectral instrument of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the Aura satellite since 2004 (https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html) with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 nm (Torres et al., 2007) . OMI passes the equator with a swath of 2600 km around the local time of 13:30, as a sun-synchronous satellite instrument. The sensor has a daily global coverage at nadir with a pixel size of 13×24 km. OMI measures sunlight backscattered from the Earth over a wide spectrum of Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) range (270 nm to 500 nm) to obtain abundances of trace gases including ozone which are critical for monitoring air quality and climate (Krotkov et al., 2016) . NO 2 is the output from the fossil fuels combustion in urban regions, which can be emitted from vehicles and by thermal power plants.. In this study, daily level-3 NO 2 measurements were acquired from OMI data at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° that cover Cairo and the Nile Delta of Egypt.Throughout this analysis, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument (https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/mission_and_instrument/overview), which was launched in 2002 on-board NASA's Aqua Satellite, was used to analyze both Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O 3 ) concentrations. Tropospheric CO measurements can be acquired twice daily with near-global coverage from AIRS (Warner et al., 2013) . It is a graticule spectrometer measuring the TIR emission from the Earth within a spectral range of 650-2665 cm −1 (Aumann et al., 2003) . AIRS is a crosstrack scanning instrument that provides regular global coverage of measurements. AIRS (Warner et al., 2007) has a high sensitivity for estimating atmospheric Ozone and CO. In this research, AIRS version 6 is used to generate daily CO and O 3 measurements at 1°×1° that cover Egypt. Satellite data of trace gases and aerosols were presented and discussed for the period before and after the implementation of the complete lockdown in the country and compared with other similar time frames of the previous 2 years. A daily time series analysis of trace gases' emissions including NO 2 , CO, and O 3 , and aerosol optical depth (AOD) is shown in Figs. 2 (a, b, c, and d) which presents the impacts of the containment measures implemented by the Egyptian government during the period of COVID-19 spreading in Spring (March-June) 2020. Investigation of data during the period from January to June in the years of 2018, 2019, and 2020 showed the variability in the emissions and concentrations in the three years. Since applying the national lockdown in Egypt on the 15 th of March 2020, there was an observed reduction in NO 2 , CO, O 3 , and AOD concentration compared to the previous 2 years. This reduction may return to the partial lockdown applied at day time as well as the complete lockdown at night time. The analysis of CO distribution and variability does not show drastic changes after the implementation of the lockdown. The trend of CO ( fig. 2b ) started to decrease from May in each year, this may be related to changes in meteorology and climatic conditions. This period coincided with the spring season, which has unstable conditions with a slightly higher temperature and wind speed than the winter season (January-February). Fig. 3 shows the monthly temperature curvature from January to June, which shows a general normal increasing trend in this time of the year as a transitional period from spring to summer, together with days of heat waves and heat islands (Abou El-Magd et al., 2016) .Further analysis performed on atmospheric ozone showed slightly lower values in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019, particularly after the implementation of control measures due to COVID-19 spreading ( fig. 2c) . The same status is observed in the ozone curve, which shows a higher reduction in 2020 than in previous years, which in return is the function of the lockdown.The lockdown implementation does not only affect trace gasses emissions in Egypt but also influences aerosol loading. Aerosols are the prevalent pollution type in Egypt, especially during this 2020 Spring season, because of the frequent wind that influences the migration of desert dust to the urban region of Cairo and Nile Delta. In addition, the sea-spray from the Mediterranean Sea is influencing the aerosols loading at this time of the year. Besides these common natural sources of aerosols, the anthropogenic aerosols from various daily human activities play a great role in the formation of aerosol loading. Fig. 2d shows the aerosols status due to the lockdown, which reflects the reduction in concentration and spatial distribution as a direct impact of lockdown and low emissions, however, the effects of natural sources, meteorology, and/or long-range transport continued to affect the emissions. This is aligned with the findings by (Li et al., (2019), and Abou El-Magd et al., (2020) . Fig. 2 clearly presents the low concentration of trace gases and aerosol loading during the period of complete quarantine (day and night) for 2 weeks that was obligatory implemented by the Egyptian government during late April 2020 on 20 th -30 th , which coincided with the long holiday of the Easter holiday ""Sham El-Naseem"" on 20 th April, ""Sinai Liberation Day"" on 25 th April and ""Labor Day"" on the first of May 2020. Furthermore, the reduction observed in late May from 23 rd -31 st , as this period coincided with the end of the Holy Month of Ramadan and Feast of ""Eid Al-Fitr"" holiday together with a weekend. Figs. 4 (a, b, c, and d) show the spatial variability of the NO 2 , CO, O 3 , and AOD for the period of late May between averaging concentrations in 2018-2019 and 2020. For NO 2 (figure 4a), we can observe the reduction in the Nile Delta region and Greater Cairo, which is the highly populated metropolitan region in Egypt. This region has huge daily emissions of pollutants due to industrial activities and transportation together with other background pollution sources. During the long holiday time (complete lockdown), it is noticed that household and urban emissions are reduced due to the fact that a large population from Greater Cairo take this opportunity and migrated to their origin outer cities and rural areas outside Cairo. This resulted in a reduction of social and economic activities in the area and consequently reduced the emissions of pollutants. Moreover, the spatial differences in CO concentration distribution is noticed in different regions covering North Egypt. Ozone showed high spatial variations all over the country. For aerosol loading, changes are observed in the Nile delta and Western desert. There were daily differences in concentrations of the analyzed trace gases and aerosol loading between 2020 and the previous 2 years, starting from 15 th March. In some days there was no higher change, and sometimes the values in 2020 are higher, this may return to the partially implemented lockdown during the daytime. Although people were asked to stay home and the lockdown was declared, some industries continued to work with low or medium efficiency, maybe 50% of its capacity to apply the containment measures as declared by the government in some cases. Transportation during the day time was active except for the days of full quarantine. Consequently, we noticed the changes up and down as after lockdown presented in figs. 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), and 5(d).The positive values (more than 0) represent the reduction occurred in concentrations and emissions, which means that the concentration during 2018-2019 was higher than in 2020. In contrast, the negative values (less than 0) means that concentrations in 2020 were higher and there were no reduction in the pollutant emissions. This reveals that the air quality was improved throughout the country due to reducing the emissions of pollutants. Thus, NO 2 reduced by 45.5%, CO emissions reduced by 46.23%, ozone concentration decreased by about 61.1%, and AOD reduced by 68.5% compared to the previous 2 years. Table 2 shows the statistics of the gases and AOD and the reduction level for each parameter during the period of analysis. To quantitatively present the variations that occurred in 2020 as well as their spatial distributions, a map representing the pixel-by-pixel ratio of the trace gases and aerosols in the 3-years was produced. Fig. 6 presents the change after the lockdown in spring (March-June) 2020 comparing to spring 2018-2019. The map in Figure 6 confirms that the largest reductions (positive values) exist in the highly populated metropolitan areas with intensive daily human activities such as Cairo and the Nile Delta. For NO 2 , the orange and yellow represent the reduction, while the blue colors in the CO map show the decline in CO, the blue and purple colors in the ozone map represent the reduction occurred, as well as the reduction in AOD represented by yellow, orange and red. In conclusion, the impact of the short-term controlled measures implemented by the Egyptian government due to the COVID-19 had a direct impact on the improvement of the air quality over the country. Satellite data proofed gaseous and particle air pollution emissions reduction during this period of lockdown. Hence, it was not a complete reduction in pollution, because the lockdown was partial during the daytime and some industrial estates were working with medium to low efficiency (~50% of its capacity). The geographical location and the time of the year let the natural sources of pollution, meteorological parameters, and/or long-range transport influence the concentration and spatial dispersion of pollutants. We concluded that the concentrations of pollutants significantly reduced by 45.5%, 46.23%, 61.1%, and 68.5% for NO 2 , CO, O 3 , and AOD, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the 1:1 scatter plot of the pixel values of NO 2 in 2020 and both in 2018 and 2019 confirming the reduction of NO 2 concentration and spatial distribution by 46%. The lesson learned from this COVID-19 pandemic is to find an alternative mitigation measure to improve the quality of the air for human health. The lockdown is supposed to be an effective alternative mitigation measure to reduce air pollution over the country and improve air quality. Although, we know that this way of mitigation is not applicable, as it has social and economic impacts; it influences the entire economy of the country and the income of inhabitants. We recommend for national or global complete lockdown for 2-3 days every 2-3 months that will enhance our air quality and improve the health environment of the planet.

In 2019, nearly 25 million people were living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the region with the highest number of HIV cases [1] . Rwanda faces a generalized HIV epidemic, and as of 2019, 230,000 people were living with HIV (PLWH) in Rwanda [2] . In the midst of a global and local effort to control the HIV epidemic, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has emerged. The diseases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2) has over 32 million cases and 980,000 deaths globally as of 25th September 2020 [3] . As of 25th September 2020, 4798 cases and 29 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported in Rwanda [4] .To control the spread of COVID-19, Rwanda instituted a raft of COVID-19 containment and mitigatory measures that ranged from enhanced hygiene by establishing handwashing stations in public places and increasing awareness through community mobilization. A countrywide lockdown was introduced after recording 17 cases only [5] . The country has managed to scale up the laboratory capacity for testing COVID-19, employing the pooling strategy [6] .Forewarning to take extra deterrents against COVID-19 has been emphasized for persons with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, severe cardiovascular conditions, obesity, chronic diseases, and immune-compromised persons, including PLWH [7] [8] [9] [10] . In addition, PLWH have higher rates of certain underlying health conditions [11] . Those conditions can increase their risk for more severe illness if people with HIV get COVID-19, especially people with advanced HIV disease. The pressure over the increased severity of COVID-19 among PLWH are based on their vulnerability to a predisposition to numerous opportunistic infections [12] . A recent systematic review of COVID-19 revealed that the disease does not pose a high risk to the adequately followed PLWH who suppressed their viral load compared to HIV-uninfected patients despite considering PLWH as a population whom precautions are needed to prevent the COVID-19 [13] . It is also worth noting that restrictions imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 have had unintended disruptions to HIV care and treatment services [14] .Lack of effective antiretroviral treatment against SARS-COV 2 and vaccination impede the current measures to fight the disease threatening immuno-compromised individuals' lives [15] . To the best of our knowledge, there are limited studies to understand the behavior of PLWH towards COVID-19. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PLWH towards COVID-19.A cross-sectional survey was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020, at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK), ART clinic located in Kigali, Rwanda. We employed a simple random sampling technique for participants' recruitment.The data collection tool was adapted from two previous COVID-19 KAP studies and WHO recommendations. The questionnaire was initially developed in English, then translated into Kinyarwanda by GP (a public health scientist) and then translated back into English by PGI (a public health scientist) to ensure translation accuracy. The questionnaire was validated in a pilot of 15 participants before the actual survey data collection. Minor changes were made to the questionnaire at this stage. The questionnaire addressed collected information on participant's demographics (including age, gender, employment status, place of residence), assessed knowledge (15 questions), attitude (10 questions), and practice (10 questions). More details on the specific questions are available on the questionnaire (Supplementary File 1).Data was captured electronically on an excel sheet. Frequency and percentage were used to analyze categorical variables, while the mean and standard deviation summarize continuous data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practice levels. The quality score is calculated by summing up all the individual items' scores in the three sections and scaling the total as a percentage of the maximum possible score. The scaled quality score = (obtained score -minimum possible score)/(maximum possible score -minimum possible score) × 100%. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (<65%) and high (≥65%) KAP scores. The Chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All tests were statistically measured at 5% level of significance using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA).This study was ethically reviewed and approved by the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali Ethics Committee (approval number: EC/CHUK/070/2020). Study participants were provided with an information sheet explaining the study's objectives, and all participants signed paper informed consent forms before participation.Of the 376 participants enrolled in the survey, 212 (56%) were female. The mean age was 38. The majority (51%) were unemployed, 14% reported to be professionally employed, and 35% were self-employed. All participants were currently taking ART with only 4% having been on ART for less than a year, while 27% had between 1 and 5 years duration on ART, and 69% had been on ART for more than 5 years. Additional information is in Table 1 .Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score. More than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score. The majority (90%) of the participants had a high practice score. More details are presented in Table 2 .There was no association between gender, age, residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score (p > 0.05). Employment status was significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004). 84% of self-employed individuals had higher attitude scores than 65% and 70% of professional and unemployed individuals respectively. The duration of ART was significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.013). 97% of participants who reported to be on ART for less than a year had high attitude scores compared with 65% and 77% of 1-5 and >5 years duration on ART respectively. Gender (p = 0.02) was significantly associated with practice scores, with 93% female having high practice scores compared to 86% male. Also, the duration of ART was significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.012). 100% of participants who reported to be on ART for less than a year had high attitude scores compared with 82% and 92% of 1-5 and >5 years duration on ART, respectively. More details are presented in Table 3 .There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores (p < 0.001); attitude scores increase as knowledge scores are increasing. There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.55) between knowledge and practice scores (p < 0.001); practice scores increase as knowledge scores are increasing. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between was observed between attitude scores and practice scores (p < 0.001) ( Table 4 ).Knowledge, attitude, and practice are critical factors in controlling the transmission of an infectious disease. COVID-19, an emerging infectious burden, especially in aged and immunocompromised individuals, calls for special care for PLWH as usual. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 and associated factors among PLWH in Kigali, Rwanda.The current study involved 376 HIV patients (212 females and 164 males) on ART showed a high knowledge and practice score towards COVID-29 prevention measures and a high poor attitude score (1/4). There was no association between knowledge score and gender, age, residence, employment, or duration on ART. Duration on ART significantly affected both attitude and practice scores while also, employment was associated with attitude and gender was associated with practice scores. The correlational study showed that attitude scores increase as knowledge scores increase, practice scores increase as knowledge scores increase, and attitude scores increase as practice scores increase. The findings of the current study revealed a high prevalence of poor attitude among the participants (26%), unlike other studies in Saudi Arabia [16] and China [17] , which reported low prevalence. Although Rwanda's government put strict measures against preventive measures against COVID-19, this might be due to theories that people tend to develop negative emotions like panic and anxiety during a pandemic, which significantly affects their attitude [18] . The study revealed high knowledge and practice scores, and these findings are consistent with other KAP studies done in Ethiopia [19] , China [17] , Kenya [20] , and Iran [21, 22] . This may be explained by the easy availability and accessibility of health information online, improving patient knowledge and practice [23] . The study was also conducted in an urban setting with limitless access to COVID-19-associated updates and preventive actions posted online by the Rwandan MOH and various media platforms that have been positively associated with improving knowledge and practices. These findings differ from those of a study done in rural setting Ethiopia with limited COVID-19 access due to lack of electricity and the internet, where the prevalence of poor knowledge was 33.9% [24] . The current study showed that participants knowledgeable about COVID-19 were more likely to have good practices. This finding is similar to a study in China [17] . This can be justified by the reason that knowledge is a key modifier of positive attitudes for preventive practices of COVID-19, and these practices are executed after acquiring awareness and information of practices to be implemented. Knowledge of COVID-19 reduces the possibility of infection by improving patient's practices [25] . The current study reported that gender is considerably associated with practice score, and these findings corroborate studies done in other settings, which reported that females are more likely to take preventive and protective measures than males [26] [27] [28] . The study found no association between gender, age, residence, employment, and duration on ART, contrary to Nepal's studies conducted during the peak of COVID-19 [29] . This could be due to the fact that this study was conducted at a later stage of the pandemic than in Nepal when information about COVID-19 was found everywhere and accessible to all age groups. Also, the government of Rwanda deployed drones to raise COVID-19 awareness in communities [30] . The current study reported an association between ART duration and attitude and knowledge scores, with those on ART for less than one year recording high attitude and knowledge scores. This might be because those on ART for less than a year were enrolled during the pandemic and benefited from opportunistic health promotion [31, 32] .The study outcomes could be valuable in informing authorities and MOH with its partners on other awareness campaigns, policies, public health interventions, and health promotion programs. Targeted health promotion and prevention interventions must be directed to this particularly vulnerable population at high risk of contracting COVID-19, especially males. For instance, COVID-19 attitudes and practices may increase considerably if health promotion programs are especially directed to men. Health information can be sent to females living with males, which can sway their practices, as suggested by Leung et al. [26] . Opportunistic health promotion should be advocated in all health settings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate KAP toward COVID-19 in PLWH in Kigali, Rwanda. A random sampling technique was used to eliminate participant bias, and data collection took place after relaxed COVID-19 restrictions using a WHO-recommended tool.However, the study was conducted in only a few locations in Kigali, Rwanda, and this might not allow generalizability of the results to other locations and cities towns. Furthermore, the measurement of KAP may be inaccurate due to different grading systems. The other limitation is that the participants could give socially acceptable answers. Small sample size was used to make conclusions. In addition, this study was carried out among PLWH, mostly females, and their knowledge, attitude, and practice are not comparable to people without HIV/AIDS.In conclusion, the current study was able to give a comprehensive assessment of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PLWHI in Kigali towards COVID-19. The outcomes suggest that PLWH in Kigali have a satisfactory level of knowledge on COVID-19 and are mostly positive in their practice and attitude on overcoming the pandemic, although females are more cautious than males. Regardless, regular messaging from the MOH and other authorities are important to increase public knowledge, practices, and attitude towards COVID-19. The results found no association between knowledge score and gender, age, residence, employment, and duration on ART. Moreover, some groups of PLWH may benefit from targeted health education interventions to raise COVID-19 awareness and improve practices. Improving the KAP of vulnerable populations is essential during pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19. Consequently, the development of effective health education systems incorporating considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.This study showed a high knowledge and practice score despite a poor attitude score. Health education programs tailored for PLWH and aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practice should be prioritized in the Rwandan COVID-19 response.Author contributions All authors contributed equally.Data availability If needed, the raw data used for this article are available upon reasonable request in writing to the corresponding author.

It is the causative agent for human coronavirus disease 2019 . Common symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may develop including production of sputum, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, loss of taste and abdominal pain [1] . According to the World Health Organization's situation report number 182 (July 20, 2020), more than 14 million cases were reported and more than 600,000 died while most of the detected cases have mild symptoms [2] . The highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in older people and case fatality rate increases with age [3, 4] . The rates of infection and mortality were the lowest among patients aged 0-20 years. Also, the symptoms among younger a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 infected patients are mild compared to older patients [5] . This phenomenon has been globally observed. Contrary to this evidence, researches indicate that young people do not have immune systems as efficient as adults. One assumption for the lower SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in children is the cross-reactive antibodies that are provoked in children as a response to one or more of their childhood vaccines. Another concept for children sparing by infection with SARS-CoV-2 might be the low immunity in childhood that does not inflate host immunity defense against the virus as in adults [6] . Similar to the current pandemic, children were less affected and had lower mortality during the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks [7] .In 2015, about 85% of children worldwide were subjected to vaccination for tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, and measles [8] . Since 2010, about 235 million children were immunized for meningitis A in an area that covers 26 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the CDC, children from 1-2 months should receive Hepatitis B (HepB), Diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis) (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Polio (IPV), Pneumococcal (PCV), and Rotavirus (RV). At 4 months of age, children should receive DTaP, Hib, IPV, PCV, RV, and HepB. At 6 months of age, children should receive the previous vaccines except HepB. By following the recommended schedule of CDC, child during 1 to 2 years of age should be immunized against 14 vaccine-preventable diseases including Chickenpox (Varicella), DTaP, Hib, MMR, IPV, PCV, Hepatitis A (HepA) and HepB. Between 4 through 6 years of age, children should be vaccinated against DTaP, IPV, MMR, Chickenpox (varicella) and influenza. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a common vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. This vaccine is not widely used in the developed countries, but it is often given to children in some of developing countries where TB is common. Most of routine vaccines are either inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines elicit strong cellular and humoral immune response contrary to inactivated vaccines that stimulate humoral immunity. Cross reactivity between vaccination and heterologous virus strains has been observed when serum antibodies against HIV emerged after measles vaccination [9] .Several hypotheses emerged on the potential of childhood immunization and BCG vaccination to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 through trained immunity [10] . One hypothesis is that humoral immunity initiated by MMR vaccination may protect against COVID-19 [11] . Observational studies concluded that countries with BCG vaccination programs had significantly improved COVID-19 outcomes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Here, we investigated whether common childhood vaccines and BCG played a role in antibody mediated immune response against COVID-19 by testing whether those vaccines produced cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain (GISAID accession number: EPI_ISL_430820) was isolated in VeroE6 cells. The virus-infected culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4˚C twice. Formalin inactivation was done at a concentration of 0.1% and kept for 2 days at 32˚C. Formalin-treated virus was tested for its infectivity in cells. Inactivated virus was concentrated using ultracentrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and total protein content was measured using nanodrop spectrophotometer. A volume of 3 ml of antigen was mixed with 3 ml of alum adjuvant. To assess the immunogenicity of the inactivated vaccine as a positive control, 6 BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected at day 0 and 21 (15 μg/dose).Female BALB/c mice (6-8-week-old) were obtained from Animal House at National Research Centre (NRC), Egypt. Mice were divided into nine groups (5 mice/group). Two groups of mice were orally and intradermally vaccinated with 200 μl of live rotavirus and BCG vaccines, respectively. The other remaining groups were intramuscularly injected with 200 μl of each type of tested vaccines. A negative control group was injected with sterile PBS. All vaccinated animals received booster immunization doses after 3 weeks of the first dose. Serum samples were weekly collected till the 7 th week of immunization (Fig 1) .The MN was conducted as previously described using Vero-E6 cell with minor modifications [17] . Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples starting with a dilution of 1:10 in infection medium were mixed with equal volumes of 100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50/mL) of an hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. After an hour post incubation at 37˚C, 35 μl of the virus-serum mixture were added in duplicate to Vero-E6 cells in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 1 h of infection, the inoculums were removed and 150 μl of infection medium was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for three days at 37˚C in a humidified CO 2 incubator. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded for each plate. The highest serum dilution that prevented virus to develop CPE was recorded as the neutralizing antibody titer.One hundred and forty serum samples previously collected during 2019 of our ongoing cohort study to determine household transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses were categorized by Common childhood vaccines do not elicit a cross-reactive antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 age (2-10 years old, 10-20 years old, 20-30 years old, 30-40 years old., 40-50 years old, 50-60 years old, >60 years old) (20 serum samples/category). Serum samples were processed for serological testing against SARS-CoV2 using MN assay.The animal experiment was conducted at NRC based on national and international animal welfare guidelines. The Research Ethics Committee of the NRC approved the animal experiment in mice under approval number 20074.The results are shown in Fig 2. None of the childhood vaccines tested in this study elicited an antibody response in vaccinated mice throughout the duration of the experiment. In contrast, the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provided a detectable neutralizing antibody titer as of week 2 post vaccination reaching an average of 6 log2 (Wilcoxon's Sum Rank Test pvalue < 0.05). This titer began to decline at weeks 3 and 4 post vaccination but reached an average of 10 log2, 2 weeks after the mice received the booster dose. An average titer of around 8 log2 continued to be observed during weeks 6 and 7 post vaccination.None of the tested human serum samples collected during 2019 of different ages showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2.Here we aimed to study whether BCG and other common childhood vaccines can elicit crossreactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. None of the tested vaccines elicited such a response while the positive control inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provided relatively high neutralizing antibody titers.Several reports correlated lower incidence of COVID-19 to using BCG vaccine [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Previous research has shown that BCG may induce trained immunity providing a better immune response to heterologous pathogens through various mechanisms affecting cellular immunity [18] [19] [20] . The vaccine enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 [21] . However, the role of BCG against COVID-19 remains unclear and requires further experiments and clinical trials [22] . A cohort study found no difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among BCG-vaccinated versus unvaccinated adults [23] . Our data showed that BCG vaccination does not provide cross-reactive antibodies but does not negate a potential role in cellular immunity.The role of childhood vaccination in COVID-19 is even less clear than that of BCG. It is hypothesized that frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated infections might result in trained immunity, better immune fitness of adaptive immune cells, or cross-protection of antibodies in the children [6] . Our data show that Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae, Hepatitis B, Meningococcal, and MMR vaccines do not provide cross-protective neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19.Whether childhood vaccines have a role in protection against COVID-19 through other immune mechanisms remains unclear. Correlation among those vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection could be investigated further to identify potential cellular and cytokine responses.In summary, BCG and common pediatric vaccines do not provide neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and whether they play a role through other immune response pathways requires further investigations.

It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations can differ from very mild to highly severe with the mean affection of the respiratory system which can lead to pneumonia as well as respiratory distress syndrome 2,3 . Moreover, the associated involvement of other systems such as the cardiovascular system cannot be overlooked as it carries a great influence on the outcomes 2-6 .In a recent published report, cardiac involvement was showed to occur in COVID-19 even without manifestations of respiratory tract involvement 7 . Several studies asserted upon the incidence of cardiac injury in COVID-19 5,8 . Among those reported cardiac manifestations, cardiac arrhythmias were observed with variable estimates among studies and according to severity levels 2,6 .We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane's handbook of systematic reviews to conduct this study 13, 14 .We combined the following keywords and conducted our search: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""cardiovascular"" and ""Arrhythmia"". We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles to be included. An additional online and manual search was performed on Google Scholar and Preprint Servers to ensure adequate inclusion of all studies.Results were imported into Endnote X8 (Thompson Reuter, CA, USA) for duplicates deletion.We included valid case series (>10 patients) and cohort studies including adults with COVID-19 with incidence of arrhythmia. Review articles, editorial, commentaries were excluded.The first author (O.H) divided other authors into two teams; each team independently performed title and abstract screening. Then, each team obtained the full-text of the included papers and performed full-text screening. Any disagreement between the two teams was resolved through consultation with the study senior (A.E).The two teams extracted the data; one team performed extraction of selected outcomes and the other team extracted baseline data, then, data were revised in a cross-revision manner. Extracted data include author, country, year, study design, age, sex, total number of patients, and number of patients with arrhythmia.We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) which is available at (https://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp) for assessing the risk of bias for our included studies. The possible scores of this scale range from 0 to 9. Studies with a score of seven to nine, four to six, and zero to three were classified as studies with low, moderate, and high risk of bias, respectively.We searched the aforementioned search engines/databases and found 955 studies after duplicate removal. We excluded 946 studies as they were not eligible for inclusion according to eligibility criteria, and a total of nine studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1445 patients 2,5,6, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Figure (1) shows a summary of our search and table (1) shows the summary of the included studies.Baseline characteristics are displayed in table 1. Eight of the included studies were conducted in China while only one study reported from USA. Among the included studies, the highest mean age was 71 years while the lowest was 55 years. Most of the included studies have a male predominance reaching 75% of the total included patients.Among our nine studies evaluated for the risk of bias, all of our studies had a low risk of bias with score of seven or higher (Table 1) .The results of meta-analysis including the nine studies showed that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 was 19.7% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 11.7 to 27.6%.There was significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 94.67%) which can be attributed to the variability of reported incidences among the different included studies (Figure 2 ).Previous studies has showed that compared to different systems, the cardiovascular system is considered the second most commonly affected organ by COVID-19 after the respiratory system 2,5-8, 23 . The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that cardiac arrhythmia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 with incidence exceeding 19% of the total cases with covid-19. This is consistent with other individual studies reported firstly from china such as Wang et al 2 who reported that cardiac arrhythmia occurred in 23 patients out of 138 patients included in their study. In our study, the cumulative number of patients with both arrhythmia and COVID-19 was 269 out of 1445 patients with COVID-19 which is slightly of higher percentage than Wang et al 2 . It is known from previous meta-analyses that baseline characteristics such as sex, hypertension, and diabetes can affect the outcomes of the pooled studies 23-27 but the metaregression option was not available to assess the exact effect of those factors given that the number of the included studies was less than 10.This study can be considered the most updated and comprehensive study to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in a suitable number of patients. However, this study suffered from several limitations. Although the number of patients from our pooled studies was 1445 patients, the number of studies was only nine which lead us to avoid testing for publication bias and performing meta-regression according to the reported recommendations for those tests that need at least 10 studies to be well performed. Moreover, the types of cardiac arrhythmias were not specified so we could not provide more specific subgroup analysis based upon the included studies. The studies were all observational retrospective and this type of studies has its own known limitations. Further studies that can explore cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients with more details on determinants are highly recommended.To recapitulate, cardiac arrhythmias were highly frequent in patients with COVID-19 and observed in 19.7% of them. Appropriate monitoring by electrocardiogram with accurate and early identification of arrhythmias is important for better management and outcomes.","Egypt","first author","2020-10-13",10

The information on presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous environment was addressed. The knowledge of the detection and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and hospital wastewater were described to understand the different routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which is also useful to avoid the outbreak of CoV-19. Furthermore, the inactivation of coronavirus in hospital wastewater using disinfectants and disinfection technologies are discussed. The efficiency, advantages and limitations of these disinfectants were highlighted.The wastewater amount produced by hospitals reached 200 to 1200 L/bed of hospitalized people/day (Verlicchi et al. 2010a ). The increase of wastewater charge depends on various parameters as medical specialty, bed capacity, climate, geographical factors, cultural and nature of services offered by the healthcare institution (e.g., kitchen, bathroom and laundry).The pollutant substances in hospital wastewater are divided into two main categories as macro-pollutants and micro-pollutants. As shown in Table 1 , micro-pollutants included absorbable organic halogens (AOX), analgesics, cytostatics, hormones, detergents, antiseptics, contrast substances, phenols, antibiotics such as paracetamol, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, and heavy metals such as cadmium, chrome, iron, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc. While macro-pollutants substances are physic-chemical parameters as pH, chemical demand of oxygen (COD), biological demand of oxygen (BOD), total demand of oxygen (TOC), suspended solids (SS), ammonium ions and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof chloride, microbiological taminants as coliforms, bacteria (enterococcus, lococcus, shigella, salmonella) and viruses.

It constitutes a source of transmission of infections and epidemic diseases (Sanaa et al. 2019) , which may present a potential danger to humans and their environment. Table 2 presented the analysis of the physical-chemical and microbiological characteristics of different hospitals in various countries. Management of this effluent varies from country to country.Generally, it was discharged in municipal sewage network without pre-treatment. Data indicated in Table 2 can be a route to identify potential technology to reduce the impact of hospital contaminants before evacuation. Moreover, according to several studies, the physical-chemical and microbiological characterization of hospital wastewater and urban wastewater showed that the charge pollutant in hospital effluent is in general higher than in urban wastewater (Tsakona et al. 2007; Mesdaghinia et al. 2009; Verlicchi et al. 2010b; Verlicchi et al. 2012 ).Referring to comprehensive review of the literature, Table 3 can compiled the main characterization of hospital wastewater and urban wastewater (Verlicchi et al. 2012) . As showed, COD, BOD and SS in hospital wastewater are 2-3 times higher than urban wastewater. This observation indicates that the collection of hospital wastewater together with urban wastewater increases more pollutant concentration and a dedicated pre-treatment of hospital wastewater before discharge was recommended (Verlicchi et al. 2010a ).

These viruses are some of the principal human pathogens viruses transmissible via water media, notably hospital wastewater. As known, enteric viruses cause waterborne diseases such as diarrhea (Pietruchinski et al. 2006 ) and are associated with other disease outbreaks (Thongprachum et al. 2018 Based on recent and previous published studies, many pathways of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were discussed. As shown in Figure 3 , SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets, when any individual is in close contact with an infected person, a high risk of contamination is possible mainly when this person coughs, sneezes, talks, or exhales (Morawska and Cao, 2020) . Some droplets (0.5-20.0 μm) lingering in the air are more likely to be retained in the respiratory tract and produce the infection (McCluskey et al. 1996) . Indeed, some other droplets are too heavy to remain in the air, and fall on floors; consequently, all surfaces become contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, touching by a susceptible person would be infected.The viability of SARS-CoV-2 in droplets form is more stable than aerosols on plastic and stainless steel, copper, cardboard, and glass with durations detected up to 72, 4, 24, and 84 h, respectively. For this reason, maintaining social distance and cleaning hands regularly are the main measure recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a). Based on a study carried out by Morawska (2006) , it was estimated that some droplets ejected from an infected individual, convert to aerosol particles (small aerodynamic diameters), and then become airborne. For that, the presence of droplets in the air for longer period is limited; evaporation process transforms droplets to bioaerosol residues, which could linger in the air for extended periods.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Wang and Du, 2020) . Read (2020) reported that there was cases of COVID-19 reported positive in cruise ship, when many of the infections occurred after the imposition of isolation that confined passengers for the majority of time to their cabins, and limited direct contact, and with hand hygiene carefully obeyed, giving evidence of the airborne transmission.Based on the above studies, experiences, and understanding the basic science of viral infection spread, it is strongly plausible that SARS-CoV-2 virus spread through the air. If this is the case, according to Morawska and Cao (2020) , it will take at least several months for this to be confirmed by science, especially it is difficult to directly detect the viruses traveling in the air. This is valuable time lost that could be used to properly control the epidemic and prevent more infections and loss of life.Contact transmission route is caused by close contact, this type of transmission located when viral particles, emitted from infected person, are in contact with object, then another individual touches that object, then touches one of his senses (noise, mouth, eyes). The virus immediately enters to respiratory tract (Chin et al. 2020 ).Contact transmission also caused when people is in face-to-face contact with a confirmed or probable case for more than 15 minutes in total over the course of a week, or people shares an enclosed space with a confirmed or probable case for more than two hours. During the spread of COVID-19, many reports confirmed that the primary route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is face-to-face contact transmission, can occur by direct and indirect contact via respiratory droplets such as talking, breathing, sneezing, coughing and close contact with infected people or with surfaces and fomites in the immediate environment or with objects used by the infected person (Morawska, 2006) . Agency (EPA), is classified as PM 10 (diameter <10 μm) and PM 2.5 (diameter <10 μm).In this trend, the long-term exposure to air pollution may represent a favorable context for the spread of the virus, while the combination of SARS-CoV-2 and particulate matter may produce a loaded airborne (Fattorini and Regoli 2020; Conticini et al. 2020 ).Based on various researchers, Table 4 summarized the correlation between environment factors and SARS-CoV-2 survival. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fBased on previous studies (Xu et al. 2005; Radin, 2014; Graaf et al. 2017 As mentioned in Table 2 Table 5 summarized concentration methods and main RT-qPCR and nested RT-PCR assays available for SARS-CoV-2.As reported in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f N_Sarbeco assay produced positive signals for two wastewater samples (12 copies/100mL) with 22% positive rate, while the same samples were negative when tested using NIID_2019-nCOV_N. N_Sarbeco assay is more sensitive than the NIID_2019-nCOV_N assay.Number of COVID-19 cases should have a linear relationship with viral RNA copies in wastewater. 98.5% SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from the wastewater Presence of SARS-CoV-2 at high titers (>2 10 5 copies/L) in the period from March 18 -25. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases as of March 25.Increase of genome units in raw wastewater accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 concentration exceeds 3.16 10 6 and less 10 5 with 100% and 75% of positive rate for untreated and tread wastewater respectively. The results indicated that COVID-19 viral RNA was detected in two samples and a correlation of confirmed cases was also established in the locations from where samples were lifted (Lakshmi, 20020) . Study carried out by Wurtzer et al. (2020) in Paris (France) demonstrated the detection of viral genome before the exponential phase of the epidemic. A similar study conducted in Murcia (Spain) by Randazzo et al. (2020) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected weeks before the first confirmed case. La Rosa et al. (2020) revealed that 6 out of 12 influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from wastewater treatment plants in Milan and Rome (Italy) were positive. A published study by Wu et al. (2020b) announced the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at high titers in the period from March 18 -25 using RT-qPCR in tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts (United States).On the other hand, Gormley et al. (2020) and Carducci et al. (2020) reported that aerosols generated from wastewater system are considered as a potential transmission route of COVID-19. According to Casanova et al. (2009) According to previous studies, the exposure to UV light can also decrease the activity of coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV, in aquatic environment (Darnell et al. 2004 ). It was demonstrated that UV-B (315-280 nm) and UV-C (190-290 nm) cause a significant and rapid decrease in infectious SARS-CoV (Pratelli, 2008) . The effectiveness of UV light in the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet explored to date.However, if this behavior occurs, it is evident to take into account the variation of season and geography in UV light availability (Grigalavicius et al. 2016 ).On the other hand, the presence of suspended organic matter in wastewater can also affect coronavirus survive. As reported by Murray and Jackson (1992) , suspended solids can provide shielding from light and affect settling behavior. Although, it may also influence the viral diffusion coefficient and potentially result in clusters of viruses.Evaluation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in septic tanks of Wuchang Cabin Hospital by Zhang et al. 2020d indicated a high level of (0.5-18.7) × 10 3 copies/L after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite. This result set evidence to release of virus embedded in patient's stool, protected by organic matters, in septic tanks.The detection of coronavirus and then its survival in wastewater can be influenced by pathway used for quantification of RNA viruses. Literature reviews showed that several qRT-PCR assays have been designed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which are efficient for wastewater surveillance (Vogels et al. 2020; Corman et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2020) . However, despite the fact that qPCR method is rapid, sensitive and accurate, it remains limited due to the presence of high load of organic contaminants in wastewater, especially in hospital wastewater, which often interfere with downstream virus detection.Nonetheless, many other emerging technologies were tested for SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater samples, including digital PCR, isothermal amplification and biosensors (Farkas et al. 2020 ). However, these methods are more expensive and less sensitive (Ishii et al. 2014 ).Knowledge of the presence of the coronavirus (and more specifically of SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater, along with its survival generates a great debate since the outbreak of COVID-19. and Sun et al. (2020) reported that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has not been assessed, even though culturable viral particles have been detected in the feces of infected individuals. Venugopal et al.(2020) indicated that the survival of the viruses decreased drastically when the parameters such temperature, UV-light and organic matter were unfavorable. In addition, the presence of solvents and detergents in wastewater can compromise the viral envelope (Gundy et al. 2009 ). However, according to World Health Organization (WHO, 2020c) , there is no evidence on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater. Along these same lines, Naddeo and Liu (2020) showed that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment could be short, although little is known concerning survival of this virus in wastewater.Although the presence, survival of SARS-CoV-2 and its transfer from wastewater systems, especially infectious disease units such hospitals, accommodate many sources of uncertainty, it is recommended to be treated and disinfected in order to limit its outbreak in the population, and its effect on public health.In many countries such as Australia, Iran, Egypt, India, Japan, South Africa, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coagulation-flocculation and Fenton-oxidation studies (Kühn et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Fan et al. 2017; Christensen and Myrmel, 2018) . Recently, other promising technologies were developed such as constructed wetland (Khan et al. 2020) and supercritical water oxidation (Top et al. 2020) .Methodical researches regarding the disinfection of SARS-CoV in wastewater and hospital wastewaters, particularly distinct disinfection propositions throughout the coronavirus pandemic, were targeted by various studies (Kühn et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Fan et al. 2017; Christensen and Myrmel, 2018) . The complete deactivation of SARS-CoV can be achieved by combination of three steps of water processing.The first stage, known as primary treatment, concerning the remove of material that will either float or readily settle out by gravity by sedimentation or flotation processes.The second stage, known as secondary treatment, concerning remove of the soluble organic matter that escapes primary treatment and the suspended solids, which protect virus from disinfection, by free chlorine. Removal is usually accomplished by biological processes (trickling filter, activated sludge process, and oxidation pond) in which microbes consume the organic impurities as food, converting them into carbon dioxide, water, and energy for their own growth and reproduction. This stage is generally considered a practical and available hospital wastewater treatment technology that is particularly well suited to destroying pathogens, as relatively long retention times, (Table 6 ). In case of COVID-19, few numbers of studies were developed the disinfection of wastewater and hospital wastewater spiked with SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity of information can be caused by the lack of environmental research on COVID-19, insufficient of laboratory equipment and/or the risk to workers handling wastewater.The review reported by Wang et al. (2020d) represented the disinfection technologies commonly used for hospital wastewater such as ultraviolet light (UV), ozone, Chlorinecontaining disinfectants, and provided just suggestions for hospital wastewater disinfection during COVID-19 pandemic in China. To determine the sustainable technology to inactive SARS-Cov-2, Wang et al. (2020d) indicated that the disinfection technologies adopted during SARS epidemic could be used as good reference to inactivation of SARS-Cov-2 in hospital wastewater, due to the similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The disinfection with free chlorine for effective centralized disinfection was also suggested by World Health Organization (WHO, 2020d) under optimal conditions (pH<8.0, contact time least 30 minutes and concentration dosage ≥ 0.5 mg/L).According to previous study (Wang et al. 2020d; How et al. 2017) , chlorine-based disinfectants are widely used for their broad sterilization spectrum, high inactivation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f efficiency and easy decomposition with little residue, as well as represents the best economic solution. However, excess use of chlorine-based disinfectants can generate more than 600 kinds of disinfection by-products, which are harmful to ecosystems and human health (Table 6) (Richardson, 2011; Wang et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2020b ). On the other hand, chlorine reacts with ammonia contains in wastewater and forms a new product (chloramine), which behaves differently to free chlorine during disinfection (Wang et al. 2005b) . As part of an emergency treatment of hospital wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2, China has launched a guideline requiring free chlorine ≥ 6.5 mg/L at 1.5 hour of contact time and without condition of pH. and sedimentation tank (not detected-2208 copies/L). In the third hospital treatment unit (Wuchang Fangcang Hospital), there was two disinfection units (preliminary disinfection tank followed by septic tank). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater from the septic tanks disinfected by 800 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite, ranging from 557 to 18,744 copies/L, and it declined to non-detected after the dosage of sodium hypochlorite increased to 6,700 mg/L. Absence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the effluent of septic tanks after disinfection with 800 g/m3of sodium hypochlorite. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the influent of septic tanks with the increase of sodium hypochlorite (6700 g/m3), suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might be embedded in patient's stools, protected by organic matters from disinfection, and slowly release when free chlorine declines.255 copies/L of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA were detected only in adjusting tank of Jinyintan Hospital. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was found in first adjusting tank (633 copies/L), MBBR (not Wang et al. 2005 Ciejka et al. 2017 Zhang et al. 2020d J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f detected-505 copies/L), and sedimentation tank (not detected-2208 copies/L). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater from the septic tanks disinfected by 800 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite, ranging from 557 to 18,744 copies/L, and it declined to non-detected after the dosage of sodium hypochlorite increased to 6,700 mg/L.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThis review highlighted the detection, survival and route transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital wastewater during outbreak of CoV-19. The disinfection technologies of this virus were also discussed, with special emphasis on efficiency of disinfection technologies used commonly for deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 from hospital wastewater.Physical-chemical and biological characterization of hospital wastewater presents a wide range of hazardous pollutants, such as pharmaceutical residues, chemical substances, radioisotopes, and microbial pathogens and viruses as SARS-CoV-2. The discharge of this effluent into the municipal collector or directly onto surface water without any treatment represents a chemical, biological, and physical risk for public and environmental health, and allows a rapid outbreak of CoV-19.There are many pathways of SARS-CoV-2 transmission; it can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets, aerosol, close contact and fomites. Fecal-oral transmission is considered also as a potential route of transmission since several scientists confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of infected patients.The survival of SARS-CoV-2 could be influenced by different parameters such as temperature, pH, retention time, organic matter, light exposure and aerobic organisms, as well as by pathways used for quantification of RNA viruses.Many techniques were developed to removal of organic pollutants and microbial pathogens and viruses from hospital wastewater. According to few studies investigating the deactivation of SARS-Co V-2 showed that chlorine-based disinfectants are widely used for their broad sterilization spectrum, high inactivation efficiency and easy decomposition with little residue, as well as represents the best economic solution. The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f complete deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by combination of other technologies (biological and/or physical-chemical processes).In the meantime, we should to develop more secure, efficient, economical disinfection technologies in order to limit the transmission of COVID-19 and to avoid other waves of the pandemic of COVID-19 infections.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Morocco","first author","2020-10-24",10

[9] [10] [11] Additionally, the COVID-19 disease is one of the global burdens affecting 99% of chronic disease patients, which have a preexisting condition (heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, advanced age, and kidney disease) have been dying due to the current pandemic. 12 World Health Organization (WHO) announced in March 2020 to minimize community transmission of COVID-19 through practicing social distance, frequent hand washing, and reduce population density in a healthcare setting as a means of COVID-19 prevention. 13 Ethiopia is at high risk of transmitting the pandemic; our communities are densely populated with informal dwellings, lack of access to clean water, shared sanitation facilities, high social mixing levels, and transient residents. 14 The poor healthcare systems may aggravate the outbreak's impact and limit the capacity to conduct adequate surveillance and control. 15 Evaluating the extent to which patients are satisfied with healthcare services is clinically significant, as satisfied patients are more likely to comply with treatment. 16 In contrast, the effect of COVID-19 has been reducing procedure and treatment adherence, increase treatment dissatisfaction, and discontinue their treatment follow-up. 17, 18 The outcome of unmet client needs can be problematic since it causes a lack of confidence in the healthcare system and healthcare providers. 19, 20 In resourced countries, patient needs during COVID-19 can be managed by telemedicine, which is vital to deliver methods of infection control and compliance to social distancing, appropriate use of mask and hand hygiene, or sanitizer. 21, 22 Telemedicine also increases healthcare coverage through emails, telephone, and video calls to minimize patient travel to healthcare facilities, time-saving, and cost-effective with increased patient satisfaction. [23] [24] [25] The Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health implemented Compassionate Respectful Care (CRC) as one of the healthcare sector transformation plan to increase client satisfaction and health service quality. 26 However, the satisfaction of chronic patients and quality of service is currently affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, imposing a shortage of medical supplies and uncertainness of being infected due to limited global movement from one country to another.As COVID-19 continues to spread, health professionals and the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Committee may become busy and regular service can be forgotten. These circumstances can extremely affect the quality of health service and client satisfaction exceptionally from the previous one. Patient satisfaction is considered one of the anticipated outcomes of healthcare, and it is directly related to the utilization of health services. Nevertheless, there is no adequate information on users' perception of the healthcare facilities' services after the emergence of COVID-19, especially in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess patient satisfaction and associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic among chronic patients who had follow-up at public health facilities in the North Shoa Zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2020, in North Shoa public health facilities. The North Shoa zone is one of 20 zones found in the Oromia regional state. It has 13 woredas and two towns' administration, with a total of 1.6 million populations. The zone has five public hospitals and 57 health centers that give services for the catchment area population.All patients with chronic disease who had follow-up at North Shoa public health facilities in the North Shoa Zone were the source population. All randomly selected patients with chronic disease who had follow-up at North Shoa public health facilities in the North Shoa Zone were the study population.All patients whose ages greater than 15 years and who have a chronic disease (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic musculoskeletal diseases) follow-up for more than six months at North Shoa public submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comPatient Preference and Adherence 2020:14 health facilities were included in the study. Those patients with chronic diseases who were seriously sick (unable to speak) and suspected COVID-19 (who had come for chronic disease follow-up and have signs and symptoms' of COVID-19 during the screening) were excluded from the study.The sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula, taking a proportion of 58.3% of the study conducted in Bahirdar city. 27 Considering a 95% confidence interval and a 5% marginal error with a 10% non-response rate, the final sample size was 412. The study was conducted in three hospitals and four health centers selected purposely because they have a high number of patients with chronic diseases in the North Shoa zone. The total estimated number of patients for one month obtained from chronic disease patients' department registration books was 10,800 (2500 from Fitche General Hospital, 2000 from Kuyu General Hospital, 2100 from Chancho Primary Hospital, 1000 from Debire Tsige Health Center, 1200 from Muke Turi Health Center, 1200 from Wara Jarso Health Center and 800 Hambiso Health Center). The proportional allocation was done by multiplying the number of chronic disease patients from all hospitals and health centers (10,800) with a total sample size (n=412), divided by the total number of chronic patients attending each health facility. The study participants were selected at each public health facility using a systematic random sampling technique every obtained interval for each health facility using patient registration as a sampling frame. The first participant was selected by the lottery method, depending on the obtained interval.Data was collected through direct face to face interviews by semi-structured questionnaires, which were developed from earlier similar articles. [27] [28] [29] The questionnaire was prepared in English and translated to Afan Oromo and Amharic language for better understanding for both data collectors and respondents, and translated back to the English version to check the consistency. The questionnaire has socio-demographic characteristics, servicerelated inquiries, the relationship between the service providers and patients, the physical environment, COVID-19 prevention, and control related variables questions. Seven BSC nurses and four public heaths were recruited for data collection and supervision, respectively. Four days of training were given to data collectors and supervisors on the study's objective, the questionnaire's contents, confidentiality, respondents' right, and how to collect data. The pretest was done among 21 (5%) of the sample at Kuyu Health Center. Data collectors and supervisors were discussed with principle investigators on the questionnaire and modified for any inconsistencies and ambiguity before actual data collection.We collected data from non-communicable and communicable chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic musculoskeletal diseases.The outcome of patient satisfaction was measured using satisfaction measurement tools. It contains 34 items on a five-point Likert scale scored from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree), which together yield a minimum of 34 and a maximum of 170. A response to 34 measuring items was added and converted to give an individual level of satisfaction score from 1% to 100% for each item. Patients who scored 75% and above on 34 satisfaction measuring items were satisfied, and those who scored less than 75% were unsatisfied. 28, 29 Data Processing and Analysis After data collection, data were checked for completeness and coded, cleaned, and entered into Epi Info version-7 and transported to SPSS version 23 for data cleaning and analysis. Descriptive statistics such as tables, graphs, pie charts, and proportions were used to present the data. Patients who have satisfied were scored as ""1"" whiles those who have dissatisfied were scored as ""0"". Bivariable and multivariable in binary logistic regression analyses were done to see the association between dependent and independent variables. The test's model goodness was checked by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness fit, and the p-value for the model fitness test was 0.850.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Salale University approved the ethical clearance of verbal informed consent and assent. A support letter was granted from the North Shoa zone health office, and oral informed consent was obtained from the study participants whose age ≥18 years. The assent was obtained from parents/guardians for 15 to18 years old Patient Preference and Adherence 2020:14 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress after clearing-up about the study's objective and purpose for each study participant. The privacy and confidentiality of study participants were also be maintained strictly. Data collectors were informed about coding the questionnaire and not writing the study participants' names.A total of 410 chronic disease patients participated in a response rate of 99.5%. Out of total study participants, 215 (52.4%) were male, and 175 (42.8%) of the respondents were aged more than 45 years old. More than half of the study respondents were not attended formal education, and 349 (85.1%) of study participants were orthodox by religion. Oromo ethnic groups were the majority (87.1%). Nearly two-thirds of the respondents earned ≤2000 Ethiopian Birr monthly [ Table 1 ].Of the total study participants, one-third of the participants 139 (33.9%) have a follow-up of HIV/AIDS cases, followed by hypertension 76 (18.5%), tuberculosis 72 (17.6%), and diabetes mellitus 60 (14.6%) [ Figure 1 ].More than two-thirds of study participants were ordered for laboratory tests, and 43.8% of study participants wait for an average of 15 to 29 minutes to get the laboratory results [ Figure 2 ].Nearly half 190 (46.3%) of the respondents have free healthcare access covered by their woreda. More than twothirds of the study participants had educated to maintain their healthy life modification. More than half of the study participants 154 (53.1%) had purchased drugs/supplies from the health facilities. X-rays or ultra-sounds were ordered for 161 (39.3%) participants, but only 65 (40.4%) of the study participants had obtained the ordered x-rays or ultrasounds at public health facilities. Threefourth of clients reported as the health facilities they are attending had no sign and direction indicators [ Table 2 ].Of the total respondents, 365 (89%) of study participants have noticed the availability of water at the health facility Table 3 ].The overall patient with chronic illness satisfaction was 44.6% with a confidence interval (95% CI: 1.40-1.49). On the other hand, 55.4% of study participants had dissatisfaction [ Figure 3 ]. Regarding patient satisfaction by chronic disease category, 74 (40.4) of HIV/AIDS patients who had follow-up visits were satisfied with healthcare services. More than half of patients 98 (53.5) who had no formal education were satisfied with healthcare services. More than two-fifth of the study participants (44.8%) who came from urban were satisfied [ Table 4 ].Bivariable logistic regression was done for each independent variable, and the variables that had a statistically significant association with patient satisfaction at p-value <0.20 were entered into multiple logistic regressions. The presence of sign and direction indicators, obtaining some ordered drugs, getting alcohol for hand cleaning, obtaining DovePress sanitizer for hand cleaning, and maintaining social distancing were variables significantly associated with patient satisfaction in multivariable logistic regressions at p-value <0.05 [ Table 5 ]. The result from multiple logistic regression analyses showed that patients who obtained the sign and direction indicators in the health facility were 3.26 times more likely to be satisfied than their counterparts (AOR=3.26, 95% CI=1.1, 9.92). Patients who got some parts of ordered drugs from the health facility were 3.7 times more likely satisfied than those who did not get all ordered drugs (AOR=3.7, 95% CI=1.1, 12.54). Patients who got alcohol for hand cleaning at the health facilities entrance were 2.66 times more likely satisfied than those who did not get it (AOR=2.66, 95% CI=1.1,6.65). Patients who obtained sanitizer for hand cleaning at the health facilities entrance were 4.45 times more likely satisfied than their counterparts (AOR=4.45, 95% CI=1.72,11.52). Those patients who maintain social distancing in the health facility were 2.63 times more likely satisfied than their counterparts (AOR=2.63, 95% CI=1.21, 5.70) [ Table 5 ].Overall, 44.6% of patients with chronic disease were satisfied with the service they received from health facilities. This finding is similar to the study done in the Tigray region, Ethiopia (43.6%). 30 It is lower than the studies conducted at Jima university specialized hospital (77%), 31 Ilu Ababor primary health facilities (57.9%), 32 Nekemte referral hospital (58.16%), 33 Hawassa University teaching hospital (80.1%), 34 Bahirdar Felege Hiwot referral hospital (58.3%), 27 Debraberhan referral hospital (57.7%), 35 Wolayita Sodo teaching hospital (54.2%), 36 Nigeria University Calabar teaching hospital (59.3%), 37 Nepal Chitwan medical teaching college (75.9%). 38 It is higher than the study conducted at Kilimanjaro hospital, Tanzania (20%). 39 This is because the health system in developing countries like Ethiopia is not ready to deliver care to chronic illness patients such as hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. It is prepared to provide better care to acute infectious and parasitic diseases. 27 Moreover, this variation might be due to the study setting and time difference, 40 differences in socioeconomic status, the difference in patient management strategy across the health facilities, and the use of different cutoff points to determine patient satisfaction might be other reasons of satisfaction disagreement. 41 Patients who got some ordered drugs from the health facility were 3.7 times more likely satisfied than those who did not get any ordered drugs from the health facilities. It is in agreement with the studies done in Addis Abeba public hospitals, 41 Yekatit 12 medical college, 42 Jimma University specialized hospital, 31 Iluababor zone, 32 Wolayita-Sodo, 36 Dabraberhan, 35 and Bahardir, Ethiopia 43 where patients who did not get drugs were less satisfied than those who had ordered drugs.The study found that unable to get ordered drugs is the main cause of patient dissatisfaction, making the poor people bypass the closest public health facilities to go to more costly private facilities or choose better quality public health facilities present at more distances. 32 Traveling the long distances to get quality healthcare to the far health facilities may expose the patient to COVID-19 due to contact with many people on-road or public transportation. This may be solved by applying telemedicine in low-and middle-income countries to save time and resources, and control and prevent COVID-19 pandemic. 21, 22 In this study, the presence or absence of a sign and direction indicators were significantly associated with patient satisfaction. It is consistent with the studies conducted in Addis Abeba, Yekatit 12 hospital, 42 where the availability of sign and diction indicator increases patient satisfaction by 98% and in Bahirdar, Ethiopia, 43 in which 74% of patients dissatisfied due to the absence of sign and direction indicators. The provision of sign and direction indicators in the healthcare facilities may provide a good image for customers to access easily the room they need for healthcare services. 44 Patients who obtained sanitizer and alcohol for hand cleaning at the health facilities entrance were significantly associated with patient satisfaction inquiry. This may be due to COVID-19 infection prevention, and the control strategy is cleaning hands with chemicals like alcohol and sanitizer. As patients become aware of this prevention strategy and unable to get at least one of them in the healthcare facilities may lead to dissatisfaction. 3 Hence, this condition may be challenged for patients with chronic disease from their follow-up visits and exacerbate chronic illness.Patients who maintained and observed better social distancing at the registration place, waiting for the outpatient department, laboratory, and pharmacy services as a means of the COVID-19 prevention in the healthcare facilities were significantly associated with patient satisfaction. The reason behind this fact is that because WHO and CDC identified as maintaining physical distancing are one of the COVID-19 prevention and control strategies. 45, 46 Therefore, patients who realized and maintained social distancing may increase patient satisfaction. In contrast, a lack of maintaining social distance (overcrowding) induces fear of being infected by COVID-19 at the health facilities may enhance dissatisfaction. 14 This indicates that social/physical distancing measures are one of the mechanisms to minimize the fear of exposure to the COVID-19 in public health facilities.The level of satisfaction for patients with chronic diseases is very low in the study area. Availability of sign and direction indicators, availability of ordering drugs, social distancing status in the healthcare facility, availability of alcohol, and sanitizer for hand cleaning at the healthcare facility entrance to prevent and control COVID-19 were factors associated with the satisfaction of patients with chronic diseases. Healthcare facilities need to work on the COVID-19 prevention and control The data for this study are cannot be made publically available at present.

The discrepancies in study selection were resolved through adjudication by a third author (KM). To avoid including data on the same patient populations more than once in the meta-analysis, we matched studies based on the location of the study (hospital, town) and the period over which data was collected. For two or more studies conducted at the same location over the same or overlapping periods, we included only the largest study, unless one of the smaller studies presented relevant information not included in the larger study.Two authors (JM and PP) independently extracted, verified and summarized data from each study included in the meta-analysis. The information extracted from the selected studies included: study author(s), study sponsors, date of publication, study period, study location, study design, sample size, sample characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), exposure characteristics (study definition of severity of COVID-19, timing of classification of disease severity [on admission or otherwise], number of cases with non-severe COVID-19, number of cases with severe or critical COVID- 19) , timing of blood sample collection (on admission or otherwise), clinical laboratory parameters stratified by COVID-19 severity, mean (standard deviation [SD] ) and/or median (interquartile range [IQR] or minimum-maximum [total] range) of clinical laboratory parameters when reported on continuous scales, and numbers (percentages) of cases above and below cut-off values when reported on categorical scales. Discrepancies in collected data were resolved by re-checking the primary studies until consensus was reached. For the studies which had unclear severity classification, the authors were contacted to seek additional clarification. Studies in the Chinese language were translated into English language by a Chinese native speaker. The extracted data were exported into R programming software.Where clinical laboratory parameters were measured on a continuous scale, we pooled median differences from each study using the quantile estimation method [26] . The result of this analysis was expressed as a meta-median difference (MMD) accompanied by a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We preferred median differences over mean differences because clinical laboratory indices are usually skewed, and mean values could be influenced by outlier values, particularly in small samples. We performed a sensitivity analysis by pooling mean differences from each study using inverse variance weighting. Where the studies reported only median (IQR or total range) values, we computed mean (SD) using methods previously described [27, 28] .Where clinical laboratory parameters were measured on a categorical scale, we computed prevalence ratios for each study using counts of events in the exposure and comparator group and calculated meta-prevalence ratios (MPR) and the 95% CIs using the Mantel-Haenszel method.Meta-analysis was conducted using random effect models. We assessed clinical heterogeneity (age distribution, comorbidities criteria of severity) and study methodological heterogeneity (timing of blood sample collection) and considered the potential impact of these factors on the meta-analysis results. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and calculated the I 2 statistic, which was interpreted using cut-offs of 25%, 50%, and 75% for low, moderate, and substantial heterogeneity, respectively. We performed influence analysis using the Leave-One-Out-method to identify studies that have a high influence on our results [25] . Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding 'outlier' studies. A study-specific estimate was considered an outlier if its confidence interval did not overlap with the confidence interval of the meta-estimate [25] .To detect possible publication bias, funnel plots were constructed for the 4 laboratory parameters with the highest number of individual studies. Egger's test was carried out to assess statistical symmetry of the plots.Statistical analyses were done using R programming software and in the 'meta', 'metafor', 'dmetar' and 'metadian' packages [29] .We identified 3,779 studies through database searching and from other sources (Fig 1) . After removing duplicates, 1722 unique records were screened, and of those, 1398 were removed after title and abstract review. Additional 257 records were excluded due to lack of COVID-19 severity classification, lack of laboratory parameter records or ineligible study design. Of the 67 remaining studies, another 22 were excluded because they used data from the same locations or covered overlapping periods (see S2 Text in S1 File). A total of 45 studies were retained for meta-analyses.The characteristics of included studies are detailed in Table 1 and S3 Table in S1 File. All studies included in the meta-analyses were observational and hospital based. The majority of 45 studies (87%) were from China; and of those, 14 were from Wuhan and 25 from other locations in China. Two studies were from the USA, and the remaining 4 studies were from France, Germany, Japan and Singapore. All studies were published in 2020 and the data collection covered the period from December 25 th , 2019 to April 2 nd , 2020. The median population size of the included studies was 97 (IQR: 49-221). Data were collected retrospectively in all but one study [30] . COVID-19 severity was classified using China National Health Commission guidelines (20 studies), WHO guidelines (4 studies), American Thoracic Society guidelines (2 studies), Berlin criteria (1 study), Complementary and Natural Healthcare council (1 study), or unspecified guidelines (17 studies). Studies classified severity on admission (22 studies, 49%), on the ward (11 studies, 24%), or during unspecified periods (12 studies, 27%). Clinical laboratory tests were done on admission (33 studies, 73%), post-admission (5 studies, 11%) and at unspecified periods (7 studies, 16%). The highest number of laboratory parameters Qu et al. [64] Hospital ( reported in a single study was 30 [31] and the lowest number of laboratory parameters reported in a single study was 2 [32] . The median (or mean) age of patients in the included studies ranged from 35 years to 67 years, and the proportion of male patients ranged from 30% to 81%. Patients in the included studies had varying proportions of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer as detailed in Table 1 (and S3 Table in S1 File).Results of meta-analyses are reported in Table 2 , and Forest plots and Leave-One-Out analysis are displayed in S4 Fig in S1 File.As pertains to haematological parameters, the majority of studies reported higher white cell count and higher neutrophil count in severe or critical COVID-19 patients relative to nonsevere COVID-19 patients. Median difference in individual studies ranged from -1.6 to 7.3 (×10 9 cells/L) for white cell count and from -1.0 to 5.2 (×10 9 cells/L) for neutrophil count. The MMD estimates (10 9 cells/L) were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.35 to 1.40; I 2 : 80.5%) for white cell count and 1.23 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.88; I 2 : 90%) for neutrophil count. When the results were expressed in terms of ratio measures, patients with severe or critical COVID-19 had significantly higher Clinical laboratory parameters associated with severe or critical novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The threats to validity in this meta-analysis fall into two broad categories: risk of bias in individual studies, and publication bias across the body of literature. Assessments of these two categories of threat to validity are presented below.Using the NIH study quality assessment tools, 28 studies (62.2%) were rated as having a low risk of bias, 14 studies (31.1%) were rated as having a medium risk of bias, and 3 studies (6.7%) were rated as having a high risk of bias. The majority of studies had a clearly defined study objective (97.8%), a well-defined study population (100%), and had comparable subjects (100%). In contrast, no study provided a sample size calculation or power description. All the studies were rated as having a high risk of bias for the element assessing a temporal sequence between the laboratory measure and disease severity, and none of the reported results was adjusted for potential confounding (Fig 2 and S5 Table in S1 File). Our results did not markedly differ in sensitivity analyses after excluding studies with a high risk of bias.The symmetry of funnel plots obtained from the 4 laboratory parameters with the highest number of individual studies was assessed using Egger's test. The symmetrical funnel plots for C-reactive protein (p: 0.155) and creatinine (p: 0.415) suggested no evidence of publication bias whereas asymmetrical funnel plot for white cell count (p: 0.004) and lymphocyte count (p: 0.005) indicated significant influence of smaller studies, which may be indicative of publication bias (Fig 3) . Important to note that Egger's test may not be robust for C-reactive protein, white cell count and lymphocyte parameters due to substantial heterogeneity (I 2 >75%).In sensitivity analyses excluding outlier studies, statistical heterogeneity was reduced, and the meta-estimate of most laboratory parameters were not markedly altered. In sensitivity analysis using mean differences (S6 Table in S1 File), there was substantial heterogeneity for most laboratory parameters, and the associations observed from using median differences persisted.COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with significant global morbidity and mortality. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate which clinical laboratory parameters may be associated with severe or critical COVID-19 disease. Out of the 39 clinical laboratory parameters evaluated, we found that derangements in 36 clinical laboratory parameters were Clinical laboratory parameters associated with severe or critical novel coronavirus disease 2019 significantly associated with severe or critical COVID-19. Whilst some of the observed associations may not be clinically relevant, certain, more pronounced laboratory abnormalities may have important clinical implications. Markers of an overactive innate immune system such as markedly elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), IL-6, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein, and markers of a deficient adaptive immune system such as lymphocytes and CD4 count could help recognise potential severe infections during triage, while markers of organ failure could be helpful in monitoring evolution of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.Following infection with a virus, the innate immune system in activated. This early response is nonspecific and serves to limit virus multiplication during the acute phase [33] . The adaptive immune system is activated a few days later and is responsible for a more specific response, which is immunomodulatory (via engagement of helper T cells and regulatory T cells) and produces 'immunological memory' [33] . Elevated lymphocyte count is commonly found in most viral infections, and the magnitude and quality of T cell responses may determine the fate of these infections [34, 35] . Failure to mount an appropriate adaptive immune response means the innate immune response remains continuously stimulated with deleterious effects on the lungs and other organs. We found that severe or critical COVID-19 patients had increased markers of innate immune system activity compared to patients with non-severe disease. This is evidenced in the significantly higher levels of neutrophils, IL-6, and acute phase reaction markers such as CRP, ESR and serum ferritin, as well as decreased concentrations of albumin and prealbumin. Severe or critical COVID-19 patients also exhibited defective adaptive immune response evidenced by significantly lower levels of lymphocytes and their subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8). CD4 count is currently being used to define severe cases of HIV infection [36] . In the case of HIV, the virus directly infects CD4 cells using the envelope Clinical laboratory parameters associated with severe or critical novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) glycoprotein gp120. Various authors have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could deplete lymphocytes directly by infecting T lymphocytes, or indirectly through lymphocyte apoptosis induced by persistent elevated inflammatory cytokines [15, 37, 38] . Since severe COVID-19 patients display reduced lymphocyte count, it is likely that the cytokine release syndrome observed in some patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is mediated by interferons, TNFs, and cytokines secreted by non-T cell leucocytes such as macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells which are all key elements of innate immunity to viruses [39] .These findings could be applied clinically to identify severe or critical COVID-19 patients. For example, routine monitoring of NLR may provide insight into the functioning of both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help predict the clinical course of COVID-19. Despite the 45 studies included in this review, only five reported results for NLR; all these five studies found a significant association between increased NLR and severe or critical COVID-19 disease.We also found that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 had significantly higher biomarkers of tissue and organ damage such as LDH, liver enzymes, kidney function parameters and markers of myocardial function. These observed associations could be explained by 3 mechanisms. First, the virus may cause direct organ damage by attaching to the ACE2 receptors, which are commonly expressed in the lungs, heart, arteries, kidneys and intestines [40] . The second, more indirect mechanism is systemic hyperinflammation caused by the cytokine release syndrome mediated by the innate immune system [40] . Systemic hyperinflammation affects all organs and could also explain the significantly increased expression of markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (high D-dimer and depleted platelet count) in severely or critically ill patients [41, 42] . The third, also indirect, mechanism by which severe or critical COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage is hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure.Once the mechanisms of COVID-19 induced organ damage are better understood, markers reflecting the pathophysiological changes caused by these mechanisms may find their way into clinical practice. Based on the results of our meta-analysis especially promising may be markers of immune function such as NLR, IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, lymphocytes, CD4 count, and markers of coagulation and organ damage such as D-dimer, LDH, troponin I and liver enzymes.The strengths and limitations of this review and meta-analysis need to be considered in the context of rapidly evolving literature. On the one hand, our study identified some associations that deserve further consideration and may lead to improvements in the risk stratification, monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, it is important to emphasize that our analyses need to be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Due to the large number of associations examined simultaneously there is a considerable likelihood of false-positive findings. This limitation can be addressed in future, more focused, studies that will take into consideration prior knowledge and reduce the likelihood of false-positive results through application of Bayesian and empirical-Bayes methods [43] . Our review is also affected by the limitations of the underlying literature. Of those, perhaps the most important is the cross-sectional nature of the analyses used in most publications. Although it is plausible that markers of immune function can be used to predict disease severity, the evidence would have been stronger if the studies were able to perform laboratory testing of COVID-19 patients before their disease severity was known. In addition, many studies from China reported on overlapping patient populations. While we tried to exclude studies that relied on the same data, it is possible that some of the associations examined in this metaanalysis were based on non-independent observations.In conclusion, compared to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is associated with increased markers of innate immune response such as neutrophil count, NLR, IL-6, CRP and serum ferritin; decreased markers of adaptive immune response such as lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 counts; and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure including D-dimer LDH, Troponin I, CK-MB, AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine. Based on the results of our meta-analysis, especially promising markers are NLR, IL-6, serum ferritin, lymphocyte and CD4 counts, D-dimer and troponin I. The clinical value of these markers should be explored further to assess the risk of severe or critical disease and to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19.
