(2) Brazil was the second leading country in number of COVID-19 total cases and total deaths in June. São Paulo State accounted for more than 20 per cent of total confirmed cases in Brazil and the city of São Paulo for almost 50 per cent of total confirmed cases in São Paulo State. (3) Understanding the incidence of COVID-19 is critical for effectively controlling the transmission. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a GIS-based spatial modelling analysis of COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo, considering both environmental and social factors.Spatial regression models have been recently reported as a useful approach for the assessment of the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2.

Worldometer (2020) (1997), ""Urban equity and urban health: using existing data to understand inequalities in health and environment While local models represent the spatial relationship among the variables, global models offer the advantage of a simple application for scenario assessment.In the global models, the relationships between explanatory variables and dependent variables are assumed not to produce spatial variation. (5) Ordinary least squares (OLS) is a regression model that evaluates the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables and does not consider the spatial dependency among observations. The spatial lag model (SLM) incorporates spatial dependency into the OLS. The spatial error model (SEM) assumes spatial dependency in the error term. (6) In the local models, the geographical context is considered, with estimates of specific parameters for each location. (7) The geographically weighted regression (GWR) considers the spatial heterogeneity of data. A multiscale GWR considers variations in the studied relationships at different spatial scales. (8)As of 22 June 2020, there were 1,106,470 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil, which was at that point in time still the second leading country in the number of both total cases and total deaths (51,271). (9) São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil, and also the largest city in Latin America, with a population of 12.3 million people. (10) It plays an important role in the industrial and service sectors. (11) There are important socioeconomic and demographic differences among the 96 districts of this mega-city (Map S1 and Table S1 in the online supplementary information). The central-western region is home to an elderly population with higher incomes per capita, while a younger population with a higher unemployment rate lives in the peripheral areas. (12) The urban inequalities between the centre and the peripheral areas of São Paulo have been documented for over 20 years, (13) and still constitute a problem to overcome. Budds and Teixeira indicated in 2005 that one-third of the inhabitants in the city of São Paulo lived in substandard settlements. (14) Recently, Wilkinson has suggested that the population living in these types of settlements is more susceptible to COVID-19, because social isolation cannot be practised easily in the living environments that tend to accompany poor economic conditions. (15) There are different types of informal settlements in São Paulo, with distinct features. (16) A considerable number of informal settlements still present conditions of extreme deprivation, although there have been improvements in infrastructure during the 1990s and 2000s. (17) It is important to note that a centre-periphery model is not capable of explaining the complexity of peripheral areas as there are spatial discontinuities caused by sub-centres, i.e. heterogeneous urban spaces constituting a sort of patchwork. (18) This demonstrates the need for models to identify the relationship between socioeconomic spatial differences and the spread of diseases.The socio-spatial differences in São Paulo are a concern for the city government, as undiagnosed cases occur mainly in the peripheral areas, and COVID-19 is expected to be underreported there.

Budds, J and P Teixeira (2005) , ""Ensuring the right to the city: pro-poor housing, urban development and tenure legalization in São of the city of São Paulo has been publishing fortnightly bulletins reporting the number of COVID-19 cases by district, as well as the number of deaths -both confirmed and suspected -to be due to At first glance, data show that the number of cases is higher in the central area, while the number of deaths is higher in the peripheral area, indicating the underreporting of COVID-19 cases in this area.In general, in São Paulo, as in Brazil more generally, COVID-19 testing has been conducted primarily among hospitalized people, (21) although wealthy people may also pay for precautionary testing. (22) Therefore the numbers of confirmed and suspected deaths from COVID-19 seem a better representation of the situation in the city of São Paulo.Drawing on data made available by São Paulo State (23) and on a digital map of the city of São Paulo, (24) a list was composed of 18 demographic and socio-environmental explanatory variables. The following variables were considered: population (people); population density (people per square kilometre); population 60 years and older (people); population density of those 60 years and older (people per square kilometre); number of households per district; average number of people per household; number of informal urban settlements per district; illiteracy (%); graduates of higher education (%); average monthly income (R$ per capita); access to potable water (%); access to both a toilet and potable water (%); population living in a household with two or more people per bedroom (%); population living in an urban household with solid waste collection (%); population living in a household with access to electricity (%); population living in a household with inadequate sanitation (%); population living in substandard settlements (walls not made of brick or wood) (%); and the Municipal Human Development Index score. (25) Test results for COVID-19 incidence fail to accurately represent the actual distribution in peripheral areas because access to diagnostic tests is more challenging there. (26) This makes it difficult to compare rates in different parts of the city. Therefore, in an attempt to reduce this discrepancy, this study focused instead on the numbers of both confirmed and suspected deaths by COVID-19, which were analysed from 8 March to 18 June 2020. (27) The Spearman correlation test at the 95 per cent significance level (α = 0.05) was used to assess the correlation between cumulative deaths (confirmed and suspected) and socio-environmental variables.Seeking to understand the socio-spatial behaviour related to COVID-19 in the most impacted area in Brazil, five spatial regression (28) models were analysed in order to assess the disease distribution in the affected territory. These included three global models -namely, the ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial error model (SEM) and spatial lag model (SLM) -and two local models -namely, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). (29) The stepwise forward procedure (30) and the Spearman correlation test were used to determine the most relevant explanatory variables for the regression models. The software programs GeoDa 1.14 and MGRW 2.2 were used to run the models, and the software program Figueiredo, P (2020) , ""Bairros com maior número de mortes por coronavirus em SP concentram favelas e conjuntos habitacionais"", QGIS 3.10.4 was used for spatial analysis of the variables. The adjusted R² and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) were used to analyse the performance of the models to explain death incidence in São Paulo. (31) Using the Spearman correlation test, significant positive correlations were found between deaths (confirmed and suspected as being due to COVID-19) and population (total and 60 years and older), population density (people per square kilometre), number of households, average people per household and informal urban settlements (Table 1) .Using both the stepwise forward procedure and the Spearman correlation test, the following explanatory variables were selected as the most relevant for the regression models: 60 years and older (people), population density (people per square kilometre), average people per household (people), and Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), all at the district level. R$: reais, Brazilian currency. US$ 1 = R$ 5.32, as of 10 September 2020.In bold: significant correlation at α = 0.05.*Less than 10 -6 . In the OLS, SLM and SEM regression models, selected explanatory variables were positively associated with COVID-19 deaths (confirmed and suspected) (p-value < 0.01), except for the MHDI, indicating a weak relation of this index with the dependent variable. Because spatial dependence is incorporated into the SLM and SEM models, these regression models have shown slightly better performance than the OLS model (Table 2 ). Summary statistics of the three global models are presented in Tables S2 and S3 in the online supplement. The (M)GWR models have shown superior performance for data adjustment, as the AICc values were significantly lower than the values obtained for the global models (Table 2) .Overall, the adjusted R² values indicate that selected explanatory variables explain between 85.7 per cent and 90.0 per cent of the COVID-19 death incidence (confirmed and suspected).Considering the global models, and analysing both the R² and the AICc, the SEM model has presented best adherence to analysed data (Table 2) . A map of reported COVID-19 cases, SEM-predicted COVID-19 cases, and residuals (real -prediction) is presented in Maps 1A-1C. The highest residuals were found: i) to be positive values in the districts with more reported deaths and in districts in the historic centre; and ii) to be negative values in districts with low death incidence compared to their neighbours. Moreover, using the overlay procedure to show the locations of informal urban settlements, we have observed that the districts with the most deaths are those with higher numbers of informal urban settlements.The models based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) provide a spatial evaluation of distinct variables, as the process spatial heterogeneity is considered, (32) unlike the global models. Although the multiscale variation (M) of the GWR model is expected to display better outputs, (33) our results show comparable performances of the GWR and MGWR models. Because the GWR is more suitable for a detailed assessment at the district scale, the GWR model was used to analyse the selected variables influencing the spread of COVID-19 in São Paulo. Spatial variations of the selected variables can be detected by analysis of their coefficients using the GWR model (Maps 2A-2D) .In the northwestern region of São Paulo, the population density, average people per household and MDHI variables represent well the number of deaths, while in the southwestern region of the city, the number of people aged 60 years and older proved to influence the number of deaths in densely populated districts with numerous informal urban settlements. In the central area of the city the MHDI is inversely related to the number of deaths. Our results have demonstrated that the GWR model best explained the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo, highlighting the spatial aspects of the data. Mollalo et al. selected the MGWR as the best M A P 1São Paulo using the Gwr model (2012), ""Unraveling the mystery of Brazilian jeitinho: a model for data from the United States (R² = 0.68). (34) Because the spatial heterogeneity is considered in the local models in order to evaluate the influence of each variable in the final output, a more detailed analysis is possible. Hence, we suggest a preliminary analysis of the models when feasible, or the conjunction of global and local models to better understand the spread of the COVID-19 and also other infectious diseases in large cities. Analysing the number of deaths (confirmed and suspected) is imperative to understand the spread of COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo. In Brazil, even in wealthier cities, the lack of testing for COVID-19 has been an issue, (35) and diagnosis may be especially difficult among disadvantaged people. (36) For example, the district with the highest number of confirmed cases on 30 April 2020 had 200 cases and 11 deaths, while the district with the highest number of deaths had 103 deaths and 130 confirmed cases. This discrepancy probably occurs due to access to paid tests for the population with high incomes, indicating the underreporting in peripheral areas. Furthermore, in Brazil, the vulnerability of the health system is also a reason for concern. Hospital beds, for example, are inefficiently distributed, (37) and support measures for vulnerable populations are inadequate. It is also important to emphasize the effectiveness of social isolation measures in the metropolitan area of São Paulo as a means of controlling the load of COVID-19 in the healthcare system, especially the public system. One recent study reported that the social isolation rate (38) was found to be negatively correlated with cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. (39) The studied models fit very well (R² greater than 0.85) real data on confirmed and suspected deaths due to COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo. However, death incidence per 1,000 people is high in some districts in the historic centre (Table S1 in the online supplement), although the number of deaths is lower than in other districts. The GWR model explicitly shows this discrepancy, which is also evidenced by the MDHI's influence (Map 2). Households known as cortiços (40) in the historic centre of the city of São Paulo present significant differences compared to nearby districts because of their precarious conditions and high social vulnerability. (41) Results obtained using the Spearman correlation test have made evident the correlation between COVID-19 death incidence and social aspects such as population density, average people per household, and informal urban settlements. Spatial analysis has shown the spread of COVID-19 in areas with highly vulnerable populations (Map 1). Recently, Corburn et al. and Wilkinson have reported that social distancing and self-quarantine may be impractical for vulnerable populations, because of the following factors: i) high numbers of informal workers, leading to financial vulnerability; ii) space constraints; iii) inadequate access to water and sanitation; and iv) a lack of secure and adequate housing. (42) Furthermore, it is worth mentioning a cultural feature that may also influence the adherence to social distancing: the Brazilian jeitinho, described as a social mechanism of breaking rules to deal with unexpected situations. (43) Therefore, governmental (44) and social (45) initiatives (46) have sought to communicate better with the population in São Paulo as a means of improving the awareness of the importance of the social isolation measures and thus increase the adherence to social distancing. Our results are consistent with vulnerability aspects reported by Wilkinson, notably population density and household conditions. (47) People aged 60 years and older have proven to be a determining variable influencing the spread of COVID-19, corroborating data presented by Even though informal settlements in São Paulo present a variety of conditions, the average number of people per household is similar to the number of people in formal households, while the population density in areas of informal settlements is two-five times higher than in areas of formal households. (49) In this study, we have used spatial modelling to assess the spread of COVID-19 in a metropolitan area in the global South. All analysed spatial regression models, using four selected explanatory variables, have proven to represent at least 85 per cent of reported deaths at the district level. Overall, the local model GWR has shown the best adjustment to the analysed data (R² = 0.900, AICc = 78.76). More importantly, our study has revealed a significant correlation between COVID-19 death incidence and social aspects such as population density, people aged 60 years and older, and informal urban settlements. Our findings have shown that the high population density found in informal settlements in the city of São Paulo is a determining factor influencing the spread of COVID-19, possibly because people living in socioeconomic vulnerability may not be able to adhere to social distancing measures. Our study corroborates reports from the recent literature, pointing to the need for special attention in peripheral areas and informal settlements.Rodrigo Custodio Urban https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8753-6910 Liane Yuri Kondo Nakada https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9733-4805Supplemental material for this article is available online.

Wegen der ausgeprägten akuten Lymphozytendepletion nach der Infusion haben viele Neurologen in der Pandemie aufgehört, Alemtuzumab zu verordnen. Wir präsentieren den Fall eines Patienten mit MS und leichter COVID-19-Erkrankung, bei dem infolge einer Behandlung mit Alemtuzumab eine schwere Depletion der wesentlichen zirkulierenden T-Lymphozyten (CD3+, CD4+ und CD8+) vorliegt. Bei dem 35 Jahre alten Mann wurde im November 2018 auf Grundlage der McDonald-Kriterien eine schubförmig remittierende MS (RRMS, für engl. relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis) diagnostiziert. Der Mann hatte keine Begleiterkrankungen. Er entwickelte eine fortschreitende Taubheit in beiden Beinen und eine leichte motorische Beeinträchtigung sowie später eine Diplopie. Die Magnetresonanztomografie (MRT) zeigte zum Zeitpunkt der Diagnosestellung multiple demyelinisierende Läsionen in Gehirn und Rückenmark, die mit einer MS vereinbar waren. Im Dezember 2018 erhielt der Mann seine erste Behandlungsphase mit Alemtuzumab (12 mg pro Tag intravenös (i.v.) an 5 Tagen). Die zweite Behandlungsphase (12 mg pro Tag i.v. an 3 Tagen) wurde Ende Februar 2020 verabreicht. Zwischen den Behandlungen kam es zu keiner klinischen Verschlechterung. Die neurologische Untersuchung zeigte eine Verminderung der Muskelkraft (4/5) im rechten Bein (Wert von 1 auf der Expanded Disability Status-Skala). Der letzte MRT-Scan, der im März 2020 angefertigt wurde, zeigte, dass die Läsionslast im Vergleich zu den vorhergehenden Untersuchungen von Gehirn und Rückenmark stabil war. Es wurden keine konstrastmittelanreichernden Läsionen festgestellt (Abb. 1). Die absolute Lymphozytenzahl (ALC) des Patienten be-trug vor der zweiten Infusion 960/mm 3 . 1 Monat nach der Infusion war sie auf 210/mm 3 abgefallen. Dem Patienten wurde empfohlen, sich freiwillig in Quarantäne zu begeben. Allerdings hatte er 2,5 Monate nach der Infusion Kontakt zu seiner COVID-19-positiven Frau. Der Patient bildete einen trockenen Husten aus und die Untersuchung eines Nasen-Rachen-Abstrichs mittels Real-Time-PCR (PCR = Polymerase-Kettenreaktion) auf SARS-CoV-2 ergab ein positives Testergebnis. Bei dem Patienten trat leichtes Fieber auf, wohingegen Atemfrequenz, Atemgeräusche und Sauerstoffsättigung normal waren. Eine Blutuntersuchung ergab eine ALC von 680/mm 3 mit ausgeprägter Reduktion wesentlicher zirkulierender T-Lymphozyten-Subsets (CD3+, CD4+ und CD8+). Die mittlere CD3+ T-Lymphozyten-Zahl war gegenüber der Untergrenze des Normbereichs (LLN, für engl. lower limit of normal) um 88% reduziert, und die Zahlen für die CD4+und CD8+-Subsets lagen 82% bzw. 85% unterhalb der LLN (Abb. 2). Die B-Lymphozyten und natürliche Killerzellen (NK-Zellen) waren im Normbereich. Die leichte Erkältungssymptomatik verschlechterte sich nicht. Der Mann blieb zu Hause. 2 Wochen nach dem ersten Abstrich hatte der Patient keine Symptome mehr und ein zweiter Abstrich fiel negativ aus.Wir beschreiben hier einen Patienten mit MS und ausgeprägter Reduktion wesentlicher zirkulierender T-Lymphozyten-Subsets (CD3+, CD4+ und CD8+) infolge von Alemtuzumab, der eine COVID-19-Erkrankung ohne Komplikationen durchlebte. Carandini et al. (2020) berichten über eine 25 Jahre alte Frau, die 7 Tage nach ihrem zweiten Alemtuzumab-Zyklus eine leichte Infektion ohne Komplikationen hatte [3] . Die Patientin hatte keine Begleiterkrankungen und ihre ALC betrug 99/mm 3 . Wir mutmaßen, dass sich der Lymphozytenmangel während der COVID-19-Erkrankung positiv ausgewirkt haben könnte, indem er bei diesen beiden Patienten eine überaktive Immunreaktion verhinderte. Es besteht Einvernehmen darüber, dass DMT der ersten Generation das Infektionsrisiko nicht erhöhen. Interferon-β könnte aufgrund seiner antiviralen Eigenschaften sogar günstige Auswirkungen haben. Dagegen wurde gezeigt, dass DMT der zweiten Generation das Risiko der Patienten für Viruserkrankungen erhöhen. Aktuell gibt es in der Literatur Berichte über 2 mit Fingolimod behandelte Patienten mit MS, bei denen eine schwere COVID-19-Erkrankung mit interstitieller Pneumonie diagnostiziert wurde.

Throughout the first half of 2020, millions of people are or have been quarantined due to the pandemic and suffered negative psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma (Brooks et al., 2020) . The Internet is the easiest and fastest source to obtain health information in this context (Starbird et al., 2020) . A public health crisis that involves numerous uncertainties requires precise information and answers for the adoption of appropriate behaviours and intelligent decision making (Jang & Baek, 2019) .One of the challenges posed by this new coronavirus is the infodemic risk, that is, a tsunami of information about the topic that can also bring rumours and misinformation; with social media, this phenomenon is amplified, and it goes faster and further (Zarocostas, 2020) . For this reason, it is important that the population is not only informed in real time but that information needs to be correct and updated, so as many people as possible can act properly to avoid spreading the disease.The novel coronavirus in Brazil arrived in a scenario of a conservative, far-right government led by President Jair Bolsonaro, which systematically denies the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Ajzenman et al., 2020) . Because of this, the country's image in facing the pandemic was pointed out as deplorable (Craig, 2020) . The attitude of the president and his ministers drew severe criticism from the international press (BBC News, 2020; Financial Times, 2020; The Economist, 2020). Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) (Lovelace Jr, 2020) also criticised Brazil's stance in controlling the pandemic, and for that reason the president threatened to pull Brazil out of the institution (Paraguaçu & Brito, blackout in the official data on morbidity and mortality (Leite et al., 2020 , BBC News, 2020 . Such omission caused a consortium of several broadcasting companies and volunteers to monitor the data daily (Bellini, 2020) in a country with 211 million inhabitants and 5,570 municipalities (IBGE, 2020) . In addition to hiding pandemic data in the country, Bolsonaro has encouraged people to go out and even make appearances in stores, markets and public demonstrations on the streets (Ajzenman et al., 2020) . As of October, 2020, Brazil had registered more than 5 million cases of the novel coronavirus (Worldometer, 2020a) , being the country with the third highest number of cases in the world -the first is the United States and the second is India (Worldometer, 2020b) .In Brazil, about 100 million people are users of social networks (Statista, 2019) . This number corresponds to almost half of the country's total population (IBGE, 2020) . Online access to health information has been growing exponentially in the last few years. However, most of the information on the Internet is unregulated, and its quality remains questionable (Cuan-Baltazar et al., 2020) .Misinformation on the Internet started to attract the attention of the media and academics during the U.S. elections in 2016; at that time, the expression ""fake news"" became increasingly popularised (Vos et al., 2019) . Despite the extensive use of this term in the media and in scientific articles, it is considered inadequate to capture the complexity of the information disorder phenomenon (Lazer et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Wardle, 2017) .Fake news overlaps with other information disorders, such as misinformation (false, mistaken or misleading information) and disinformation (false information that is purposely spread to deceive or confuse people) (Fetzer, 2004; Lazer et al., 2018) .Even considering these differences, it is not always easy to fit a news item into one of the two categories, because we do not always know if the author of the news had the deliberate intention to deceive, or if he/she really believes in what is being written. For this reason, we follow the same classification as Wang (2019), which uses misinformation as an umbrella term that encompasses all types of false health information, unless the intention to deceive is evident.The original agenda-setting theory (McCombs & Shaw, 1972) was born from a fascinating idea that tries to explain how media plays an important part in shaping political reality. This theory resulted in a significant number of international studies on elections in different parts of the world, such as Argentina, United States, Taiwan, Singapore and Spain, just to name a few (Du, 2013) . Over the years, the study of the agenda-setting over time went beyond the political spectrum and sought to understand how the media influences the public debate and the population's bias in relation to various themes. For example, if the media dedicates a lot of space in their coverage to talk about health, then the population will consider this issue to be of greater relevance. More recently, there are studies that focus on the fake news agendasetting: even if some audience members are aware that fake news is fake, the rise in coverage can generate an agenda-setting effect; there is also an interplay between different types of media outlets (traditional media, independent media, partisan media, social media users/influencers) in setting each other's news agenda (Vargo et al., 2018) .About 20 years after the first studies of the agenda-setting, the idea of the media frame was developed by Entman (1993) . This term refers to the highlighted selection of certain aspects of reality by the media and, with this, establishes the problematic framing caused by the forms of interpretation, inducing collective thoughts (Entman, 1993) . Thus, in addition to the agenda-setting, the media also somehow impose the bias of the news.According to Entman (1993) , there are four actors in this process: the communicator, who chooses what to say, consciously or unconsciously, according to his own experiences; the text, which presents an approach that is determined by keywords, stereotypes, sources of information and phrases that reinforce or not certain aspects of facts or judgments; the receiver, whose interpretations and conclusions are mixed with his experiences; and the culture, defined as the set of frames shared by a given social group.This is a quali-quantitative exploratory study. We analysed all pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service ""Agência Lupa"" (Lupa agency, in English) in the first 27 weeks (six months) of 2020 (from January 1, 2020 to July 4, 2020). Lupa agency was created in 2015 and is the first company specialised in fact-checking in Brazil;the checking is carried out by specialised journalists, based on successful processes implemented by fact-checking platforms such as the Argentine Chequeado and the North American Politifact (Equipe Lupa, 2015) .All news related to the novel coronavirus in the period was organised in an Excel table. For a news item to be considered as related to the topic, the fact-checking text should have at least once the terms ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID-19"". The following aspects of each news item were analysed: a) In what social media has it circulated?; b) What is the content classification and type of misinformation?; c) What is the type of media frame of the false information?; d) Are there recurrent themes in the sample studied?The content analysis of the texts was based on the methodology proposed by Laurence Bardin (1977) , which is an inductive process. Firstly, two researchers read in depth (and independently) a sample of 20 news stories. Then, based on the readings, each researcher created a list of categories to describe them. Categorisation followed a semantic criterion:the news was separated according to the theme, and they could not be classified in more than one category. At the same time, the sentiment analysis of each text was also made. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying positive and negative opinions, emotions, and evaluations (Wilson et al., 2005) . Two researchers read all texts and identified the predominant sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) through document-level analysis (Shirsat et al., 2017) . The task at this level is to determine the overall opinion of the document. Sentiment analysis at document level assumes that each document expresses opinions on a single entity (Behdenna et al., 2016) .Inter-coder reliability for content and sentiment analysis was 85%. The same process and sample were used to classify the types of misinformation. In this case, inter-coder reliability was 80%. Before classifying the full sample, the authors discussed their experiences and achieved consensus regarding inconsistencies. Then, one author coded the remaining messages.The second most frequent category is ""politics"". Here are the stories that focus on politicians, governments, parties, political decisions, aid from governments, laws, decrees, or messages of adulation/adoration aimed at a politician, and they represent 23% of the total amount of registered news. In third place is information on advances in ""science and epidemiological data"" (14%). Pieces of misinformation related to virtual scams, conspiracy theories and warnings (any kind of warning about what to do or not to do during the pandemic) account for 10% of the total, followed by ""health tips"" (6%).between January 1, 2020 and July 4, 2020.We also observed that the most prominent type of rumour was ""fabricated content"" (53%), followed by ""false content"" (34%). It is important to note that all misinformation published on news websites and blogs was also posted on Facebook. When the news appears simultaneously on Facebook and a blog or on Facebook and a news website, it means that there is a link in the Facebook post leading to an external page. In such cases, Facebook serves as a call for the reader to see the full story at the indicated link. In this way, we conclude that 100% of the fact-checked content was published on at least one social network.Although YouTube is the most popular social media by Internet users in Brazil, only three pieces of misinformation about COVID-19 were found there during this period. Moreover, Instagram and Telegram do not seem to be popular social networks for the spread of misinformation, as only 1% of the total sample was found there.Regarding RQ3, we noticed that until week 11, the fact-checked content was mostly unrelated to the novel coronavirus. From week 12 onwards, there is a turning point, and in subsequent weeks this issue becomes central to the misinformation agenda-setting.This study explored the spread of misinformation on COVID-19 in Brazil through social media, analysing the stories published by the fact-checking service Lupa agency from January 1, 2020 to July 4, 2020. Although at the end of our sample the pandemic has not yet ended, this study aims to understand the flow of misinformation produced in the first half of 2020 and the agenda-setting, the topics addressed in the country and how the media framing may reflect the positions of social actors and politicians that are relevant in Brazilian society at this time. Brazil is one of the countries that had an exponential increase in the disease case curve during the first half of 2020, and there is not enough literature to try to explain the influence of misinformation on social networks as one of the factors for this problem.We can see that 100% of the pieces of misinformation in our sample were published on social networks. Even those on blogs and news websites were also posted (via hyperlink) on Week 4Week 5Week 6Week 7Week 8Week 9Week 10Week 11Week 12Week 13Week 14Week 15Week 16Week 17Week 18 Week 19Week 20Week 21Week 22Week 23Week 24Week 25Week 26Week 27Social media play a vital role during crises, serving as both a first-hand information channel on the scene as well as a supplementary channel offering specific information demanded by people directly involved in the crisis (Jang & Baek, 2019) .To continue answering RQ3, we can observe that most news detected as misinformation in Brazil (n=232) had COVID-19 or novel coronavirus as its main theme, in comparison to news related to other topics (n=143). During a pandemic, this type of misinformation can have serious consequences for the population. Mistaken health tips or false scientific and epidemiological data can make people believe that the disease is not so serious, or that a few simple actions (such as drinking tea or gargling) are enough to prevent COVID-19. A study conducted in Northeastern Brazil with 2,259 respondents (Lima et al., 2020) showed that some beliefs of the interviewees are similar to the government speeches denying the seriousness of the pandemic. For the group aged 80 and over, the pandemic in Brazil would be less severe than in many countries; Brazilians would have superior virus protection to people in other countries; and the warm climate of the Northeast of the country would favor the reduction of the pandemic in the region. As this disease is extremely contagious (Kooraki et al., 2020) , a less concerned behaviour of the population in relation to it can cause a loosening in measures of social distancing, which contributes to the faster spread of the virus (CDC, 2020) and the overwhelming of hospitals (Powell, 2020) .When we analyse the misinformation agenda-setting in our sample, we observe the attempt to establish some specific themes within society. The themes classified as ""real-life stories"" and ""politics"" were the most prevalent in the period. Within these topics, three subjects drew attention: a) Field hospitals supposedly being empty, which proves that the disease is not real (n=14); b) People cured by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (n=13); c) Burial of empty coffins as if they were patients killed by the virus (n=7).Regarding the news involving coffins, one of the pieces of misinformation that most caught the public's attention was one that said that ""coffins of victims of COVID-19 in Belo Horizonte were full of stones"". Another report states that ""pits were opened to bury empty coffins in Marabá"". Such misinformation gained prominence on social networks and became a subject in society. For this reason, families began to gather to open sealed coffins with victims of COVID-19, to check if the body they were about to bury was really their family member (Boechat, 2020). In one case, five people were infected due to this action (Pitombo, 2020 ).Misinformation propagated in Brazil during the coronavirus pandemic seems to help to establish the agenda-setting in the country, shaping public debates and society's behaviour (even after fact-checking). The simple fact that journalists dedicate part of their time to address and correct false information, not only at Lupa agency but also in other media, already makes the subject more widespread and, therefore, more debated. A network analysis has found that the sites targeted with the most inbound hyperlinks from fake news networks were mainstream media, social networking sites, and Wikipedia. Few of the targeted sites linked back to the fake news sites (Vargo et al., 2018) .Bolsonaro's speeches, encouraging disrespectful, dangerous and even bizarre behaviour by part of the population. The very fact that the president ignores health recommendations for the pandemic sets a dangerous precedent, causing part of the population to do the same and thus increasing the contagion curve and the number of preventable deaths (Reeves, 2020) .Although in the beginning of the pandemic, in March, Brazilians largely adhered to the rules of social isolation and quarantine, over time many people ignored the danger posed by the disease and returned to live their lives normally -even with a growing number of cases and deaths throughout the country (BBC News, 2020c). In June 2020, commerce in the main Brazilian cities reopened; shopping, restaurants and stores started to function normally, and crowds of thousands of unconcerned people in bars were reported by the media Weir, 2020) The actions of a political leader are essential to coordinate, organise and ensure that the rules are obeyed by citizens. In a pandemic, the need for a leader who recognises the seriousness of the problem and takes quick action is even greater. A study conducted during the pandemic (Ajzenman et al., 2020) showed that the social distancing measures taken by citizens in pro-government localities weakened compared to places where political support of the president is less strong; they also found evidence that this is stronger in municipalities with a larger proportion of Evangelical parishioners, a key group in terms of support for the president.The guidelines of WHO leaders emphasise the importance of a broad and coherent response from Brazil, especially from governments (at the federal, state or municipal level), to control the pandemic (Ponce, 2020) . The lack of a unified response makes the population confused, facilitating denialist attitudes, and neglecting individual actions to protect against the disease.This study shows that misinformation about COVID-19 in Brazil seem to help establish an agenda-setting in the country, and the media frame is aligned with President Bolsonaro's political position.In face of all the challenges discussed in this article, the Brazilian media and science communicators must understand the main characteristics of misinformation in social media about COVID-19, so that they can develop evidence-based content that helps to increase health literacy and modulate the perception of risk. Health educators must have a massive presence in the most popular social media sites with attractive and up-to-date content, as an effort to counteract the spread of misinformation.As a limitation of our study, we were unable to measure the public engagement of factchecked stories, to get a more accurate idea of how many people were directly affected by the misinformation. In addition, we have no way of controlling how many people had access to or shared the pieces of misinformation circulating on WhatsApp, due to the private nature of their groups and the lack of data on engagement in this social network. Another limitation is the fact that we used the news verified by Lupa agency only as the basis for this research.As the amount of news circulating about the pandemic is enormous, we have no way of knowing whether the news verified in this period represents the entire sample of misinformation shared in Brazil. Despite these limitations, we believe that this work can offer help so that scientists, journalists and health educators understand the characteristics of the misinformation health agenda-setting during the pandemic and are better able to counter this problem.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-21",10

Due to its high infection rate, the virus SARS-CoV-2 is not only causing mortality, but it is also stressing national health systems due to the large number of infected people that need hospitalization, also causing a profound economic impact [3] [4] [5] . In the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment for COVID-19, the role of public health measures mostly comprehends the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [6] , including social distancing and isolation, reducing economic activities, enforcing home office, moving to remote classes and closing social venues where people tend to agglomerate in close proximity. Initially, sanitary authorities opted for strict NPIs. As the pandemic evolved, other factors emerged and started an interplay with the health crisis. Therefore, measures were revisited and, oftentimes, relaxed. However, a critical question is still unresolved: What is the impact of reopening the school system for in-person classes [7, 8] ?When to start reopening schools and the reopening policy are particularly important questions for multiple reasons: i) education is a basic human necessity; ii) in-person classes enable other economic activities because parents can go to work while their children are at school [9] , besides other markets associated with schools, such as transportation, food, clothing, among others; iii) in-person classes are often hard to replace with online learning, especially in developing countries and for impoverished families, due to lower availability of broadband Internet and fast laptop computers with cameras; iv) due to the relatively long time children spend in proximity to each other in schools, the potential for exposure is much higher, requiring several workarounds to reduce the transmission rate [10] , especially because young people tend to be asymptomatic while carrying high viral loads [11] , which increases the chances of an exponen-tial transmission growth, thereby requiring additional quarantines to prevent a health system collapse; and v) a well-crafted policy for returning to school may help preventing new waves of the pandemic, save lives, and reduce the amount of psychological stress due to the health crisis [12] . To understand the impact of the pandemic on schools and develop policies to deal with it, mathematical and computer simulation modeling is crucial [13] .In this work, we set out to evaluate a range of strategies for opening the school system of the São Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) using computer simulation. We chose this region as a case study because Brazil is one of the current epicenters of the pandemic [14, 15] , and the SPMA is the most relevant of the country due its huge population and economical importance.The region contains 39 cities and 21.7 million inhabitants, representing about 10% of Brazil's population [16] . We analyze 3 different strategies of school reopening: (i) reopen schools with all students at once; (ii) reopen schools following a strategy based on the official plan of the São Paulo government [17] , which consists of 3 stages, carefully increasing the amount of students in each stage; and (iii) reopen schools only when a vaccine becomes available. We show results regarding the total amount of COVID-19 cases, critical cases and number of deaths.Most models to analyze pandemics employ compartmental models, such as SIS, SIR, SEIR or SEIHR [18] . However, the assumptions of homogeneous random mixing in those models can lead to wrong projections. Also, the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [6] are difficult to implement in those models. To overcome these issues, we developed a heterogeneous and dynamic network stochastic model [19] [20] [21] . The model was implemented as a simulator written in the C++ language, which was chosen due its high performance, low overhead and powerful object-oriented features. The network was modeled as an undirected graph G = (V, E), in which the vertices V represent the people and the edges E the relations between people, which have an infection rate. Given two people v 1 and v 2 , such that v 1 ∈ V and v 2 ∈ V , if we have an edge e ∈ E such that e = (v 1 , v 2 ), the person v 1 can infect the person v 2 . To support heterogeneous infection rates, we color the edges of the graph, such that we can attribute different infection rates for each color. The color represents the type of relation. Although it is possible to have any kind of relations modeled, for this work we modeled the following relation types: home, community, workplace, schools and Inter-city.Since our model supports heterogeneous networks, it can provide a better representation of the population [22] . Each person can have an arbitrary number of edges in the graph, and the relation type (color) of each edge is also arbitrary. Therefore, as in real life, each person can have different infection rates depending on the number of relations they have, as well as the type of each relation. Since each person has a different infection rate, each person also has a different basic reproduction rate (R 0 ). Therefore, to set the overall R 0 , we calibrate the infection rates over the entire network such that the average R 0 among all people is equal to the target value. As our model supports dynamic networks, we can change relations at any time during the simulation. We are able to modify the infection rates, as well as add and remove edges from the graph. This is useful to implement sanitary interventions. We based our model in the SEIR compartmental model [18] , but extended it to support more compartments. Each person can be in one of the following states:Susceptible The person can be infected.Infected The person is currently infected. An infected person can have different sub-states, as we will explain later.Immune The person is immune, either from recovering from the disease or from taking a vaccine. The person will not contract the disease anymore.Dead The person died.As for infected people, each one can be in the following sub-states:Incubation The person was infected but has not developed any symptoms yet and is not contagious.Unreported The person is contagious but either is asymptomatic or has such light symptoms that it does not receive any health care. This person, in real life, would not be part of any official statistics, hence a sub-notified case.Pre-symptomatic The person is contagious, but did not develop any symptoms yet.Mild The person has mild symptoms and can recover at home.Severe The person has severe symptoms and requires health care in a hospital.Critical The person has critical symptoms and requires health care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). After recovering from critical symptoms, the state is set to severe.The disease spreads from infected people to susceptible people according to the infection rate of each edge in the graph, which is evaluated using a Monte Carlo based approach. The probability of a susceptible person p to get infected in a simulation cycle is given by Equations 1 to 4. Equation 3 defines the number of neighbors of each vertex (person) that are infected -N (p). In Equation 4, the function Inf ectRate(p, n) returns the infection rate between p and n in the network.In the simulation, we consider all the cities and population that comprehend the SPMA, including the demographic distribution. Data used to set the simulation parameters were ex- In the first strategy, we evaluate what could happen if all students went back to school at once, but following sanitary measures, such as wearing masks and frequently washing their hands. Figure 10 , following the same organization of the previous strategy ( Figure 9 ). For this experiment, we consider an isolation level of 50%. Compared to when all students go to school, we can observe that the total number of reported infected people, in the worst case, reduces by 96,216. This translates to 4,437 fewer deaths, as well as reduction of the critical patients peak to 4,890 (after schools opened), which represents an ICU occupancy of only 97.8%. In the best case, the maximum ICU occupancy is 48.8% after schools open.Results only considering the school sub-population follow the same trend of the general results. Considering the worst case, we can reduce the number of reported cases by 29,200people and the number of deaths by 54 people compared to when all students go to school.Regarding the deaths expected for the worst case, there would be a total of 541 deaths inside the school sub-population, in which 356 deaths correspond to teachers, representing 65.8% of school-related deaths. Although there are many more students than teachers, teachers are older than the students, and hence have a higher mortality rate. If students strictly follow the sanitary measures, as considered by the best case, the difference between opening the schools with all students or with São Paulo's plan is lower, but still very significant. Overall, results show that, although the difference in the number of cases is low compared to when all students come back at once, using an opening strategy with several phases avoids the health system collapse, which would have a big impact in the actual number of deaths.In Figure 11 , we analyze several isolation levels for the São Paulo strategy. An isolation level of 100% means that students inside the same classroom have no interaction between each other, while an isolation level of 0% means that each student is able to infect any other student inside the same classroom. As in previous experiments, we evaluate two different rates. If students follow the social distancing and sanitary measures very strictly, with a 100% isolation, there would be up to 678,729 less reported cases than students have a 0% of isolation, reflecting in 32,817 fewer deaths. Although 0% and 100% isolation levels may be infeasible, there is no way to predict which isolation level would be achieved. If we compare an 80% isolation to a 20% isolation, we reduce the number of deaths by up to 16,844. While comparing a range from 60% isolation to a 40% isolation, we still reduce the number of deaths significantly, by up to 4,748. Even with a 0% isolation, although the amount of deaths is higher, the maximum number of required ICUs was 5,212 after schools opened, only a little higher than the capacity of SPMA. As expected, results show that student behavior is a key factor for the success of this strategy. The major problem is that there is no way to predict how students are going to behave.The last strategy we evaluate, shown in Figure This research was partially supported by a machine allocation on the Kabré supercomputer at the Costa Rica National High Technology Center. We would like to thank Marco A. Amato for reviewing an earlier version of this manuscript.This work received no direct funding.Conflicts of Interest: None.In case the paper gets accepted for publication, we will fully disclose all data underlying the study in a public repository. The supplementary Material includes:Figs. 5 to 11 Tables 1 to 4 References Other Supplementary Materials for this manuscript include the following:Repository address of the simulator source code and input data: Will be disclosed upon paper approval.The initial network was created in 5 stages. Note that the initial network considers a normal scenario with no pandemic and interventions. We explain how we handle the interventions in Section 1.2. The initial network was created as follows:Home relations The number of people in the same home follows a distribution described in Table 1 and Figure 5a , which was derived from the microdata of the last official census from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) [24] . Inside the same home, every person is connected to all other people within the same home.Community relations The number of relations of each person follows a distribution described in Table 1 and Figure 5b .Workplace relations The number of people per company follows a distribution described in Table 1 and Figure 5c . We only model as workplace relations jobs that involve agglomeration of people, such as people that work in the commerce, offices, industry and public sectors. Other jobs, such as people that are autonomous workers or people that work with agriculture, are indirectly modeled in the community relations. The data regarding the number of employed people and per job type was extracted from IBGE [24] [25] [26] . In summary, 64% of people with 18 years old or above work. Among people that work, 45%were modeled using workplace relations. Also, inside the same workplace, we consider that the probability of two people to be connected in the network as 50%.School relations The number of students inside the same class and the number of students within each school follow the distributions described in Table 1 , Figure 5d and Figure 5e .For the relations between students from different classrooms, two students have a 0.5% of probability of having a relation in the network. For the relations between students within the same classroom, two students have a 50% of probability of having relation in the network. We add one teacher for each classroom, in which the teacher has a relation to all the students of the same class in the network. According to the census [24], 77.8%of people with 18 years old or below frequent the school.Inter-city relations The number of people that routinely travel between the different cities relations was gathered from the census [24], which indicates a 17.8% of mobility between cities in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. However, the data does not show the cities, only if the person goes to a different city. To overcome this issue, we assume that 90% of the traffic from satellite cities go to the capital, and the rest is divided between the other cities in proportion to their population size. Regarding the traffic from the capital to satellite cities, the traffic is divided proportionally to their population size.To handle interventions, we can modify the infection rates, as well as add and remove edges from the graph. Different types of intervention require different modifications. We handled the interventions evaluated in the paper as follows:Quarantine To implement the quarantine, we first reduce the infection rates inside schools to zero. Afterwards, we remove the workplace relations corresponding to 50% of the workplaces. The 50% of the relations that are left correspond to essential services that can not be interrupted. Finally, we reduce the infection rate of community, workplace and inter-city relations to match the reduced reproduction rate, which also simulates other sanitary measures such as wearing masks. Home relations are not affected by quarantines. Re-opening schools with all students We only increase the infection rate of school relations, which was zeroed by the quarantine.Re-opening schools with the São Paulo government strategy We first remove all school relations from the graph, backing up the data regarding which students and teachers belonged to the same classroom. We create 3 more relation types to represent each group of students. Afterwards, we divide each classroom in 3 and re-create the edges using the newly created relation types. To select which students go to school in a day, we just need to adjust the infection rates of the new relations, zeroing the relations corresponding to the students that will not go to school that day.Vaccine To simulate the vaccines, we only need to change the state of the person being vaccinated to the immune state, carefully considering that it takes some time to the vaccine to make effect, and that not everyone that gets vaccinated will be immunized.Several simulation parameters can be found in Table 2 [4, 16, 24-28]. The frequency distributions found in the table can be seen in Figure 6 .In Table 3 , we present the probabilities of an infected person to develop symptoms per-age.The biggest challenge to generate this information is that there is no official data regarding the number of unreported cases per age, as expected by the own definition of unreported. Therefore, we need to make several transformations with the reported data to take into account the unreported cases in the simulation. We now describe how we generated these information of Table 3 .We first define some functions and variables that return the input data of the algorithm:• Function people(age) returns the number of people of age age in the entire population, which we extracted from the census [16].• Functions reportedM ild(age), reportedSevere(age) and reportedCritical(age) should return the number of people with mild, severe and critical symptoms per age, respectively.We extracted this information from the microdata published by the Health Ministry [28].• Variable globalRatioU nreported is the ratio of unreported cases in the entire population. We set it to 0.85 in this paper, since the vast majority of COVID infections are unreported [29].Next, we define some variable and functions to be used later.reportedM ild(age)reportedSevere(age)reportedCritical(age)reported(age) = reportedM ild(age) + reportedSevere(age) + reportedCritical(age)reported(age)To calculate the probability of a person to be unreported, we first calculate the ratio of reported cases:ratioReportedM ild(age) = reportedM ild(age) reported(age)ratioReportedSevere(age) = reportedSevere(age) reported(age)ratioReportedCritical(age) = reportedCritical(age) reported(age)Then, we use Equation 14, which finds a value u that forces the mean number of unreported people to the desired value. In the equation, weight(age) returns the proportion of people of age age that should be unreported. Since there is no data for unreported (as expected by the own definition of unreported), we assume that weight has the same ratio of mild cases per age, as it is the softer symptom recorded by official data.Find u, such that:u · 9 age=0 weight(age) · people(age) 9 age=0 people(age)After finding u, we calculate a temporary ratio of unreported cases by age, just used to calculate the symptomatic ratios:tmpRatioU nreported(age) = weight(age) · uNow that we know the ratio of unreported cases by age, we can calculate the relative proportion (weight) of symptomatic people:weightM ild(age) = ratioReportedM ild(age) · (1 − tmpRatioU nreported(age)) (16)weightSevere(age) = ratioReportedSevere(age) · (1 − tmpRatioU nreported(age)) (17) weightCritical(age) = ratioCriticalM ild(age) · (1 − tmpRatioU nreported(age)) (18)Now we define our target averages for the ratio of mild, severe and critical cases relative to the entire population (not only relative to reported cases).Then, we use Equations 22, 23 and 24, which find values m, s and c that force the mean ratio of people to the target value.Find m, such that:age=0 weightM ild(age) · people(age) 9 age=0 people(age)Find s, such that:s · 9 age=0 weightSevere(age) · people(age) 9 age=0 people(age)Find c, such that:age=0 weightCritical(age) · people(age) we zero the infection rates to home relations. Table 4 shows the death probability of each person depending on the symptoms and age.As we can observe, the age of each person has a deep impact on the symptoms and death rate. Due to that, we use real demographic data from the census Vaccine -time to be effective 14 days. Vaccine -number of people vaccinated per day 300,000 people per day. Vaccine -immunity rate 90%.Infection rate -home ×3.0 the community rate considering the beginning of the pandemic (not changed by any intervention). Infection rate -workplace ×1.5 the community rate. Infection rate -schoolWe evaluated both ×2 and ×4 the community rate. Infection rate -inter-city Equal to the community rate.

These models have been used extensively in biological, ecological, and chemical applications [15, 16, 17] . They allow for an understanding of the processes at work and for predicting the dynamics of the epidemic.The large majority of the compartmental models are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in time. Though compartmentalized models are simple to formulate, analyze, and solve numerically, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. Different approaches have been used to introduce spatial variation into such ODE models [18, 19, 20, 11] . The strategies consist of defining regional compartments corresponding to different geographic units and adding coupling terms to the model equations to account for species' movement from unit to unit.In this work, we use a partial differential equation (PDE) model to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. PDE models incorporate spatial information more naturally and allow for capture the dynamics across several scales of interest. They have a significant advantage over ODE models, whose ability to describe spatial information is limited by the number of geographic compartments. Indeed, recent research indicates that COVID-19 spreading presents multi-scale features that go from the virus and individual immune system scale to the collective behavior of a whole population [21] . We study a compartmental SEIRD model (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased) that incorporates spatial spread through diffusion terms [16, 22, 8, 9, 23] . Adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening [24] can resolve population dynamics from local (street, city) to regional (district, state), providing an accurate spatio-temporal description of the infection spreading. Moreover, diffusion may be properly tuned to account for local natural or social inhomogeneities (e.g., mountains, lakes, highways) describing populations' movements.However, the main limitation of the diffusion-reaction PDE approach is the definition of the diffusion operator and transmission coefficients, which depend on the population's behavior. Another issue is that the virus spread is not only through diffusion, since people, who may be infected, travel long distances in a short period. Some models relate the mobile geolocation data with the spread of the disease [25, 26] . These issues make the model a highly complex system, which may completely change as the population's behavior changes. Therefore, this work contributes to improving the knowledge of compartmental diffusion-reaction PDE models.All implementations are done using the libMesh library. As other freely available open-source libraries (deal.II [27] , FEniCS [28] , GRINS [29] , MOOSE [30] , etc), libmesh provides a finite element framework that can be used for numerical simulation of partial differential equations in various applied fields in science and engineering. It has already been used in more than 1,000 publications with applications in many different areas. See, for example, recent applications in sediment transport [31] and bubble dynamics [32] . This library is an excellent tool for programming the finite element method and can be used for one-, two-, and three-dimensional steady and transient simulations on serial and parallel platforms. The libmesh library provides native support for adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening, thus providing a natural environment for the present study. The main advantage of this library is the possibility of focusing on implementing the specifics features of the modeling without worrying about adaptivity and code parallelization. Consequently, the effort to build a high performance computing code tends to be minimized. about adaptivity and code parallelization.The remainder of this work is organized as follows: In section 2, we present the governing equations that describe the dynamics of a virus infection. First, we present a generic spatio-temporal SEIRD model, based on the EPIDEMIC software [33] , used to verify our implementation. We then present a model that better represents the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread, based on [9, 8] . In section 3, we introduce the Galerkin finite element formulation, the time discretization, and the libMesh implementation. Then, we present the numerical verification of the generic spatio-temporal SEIRD model implementation. We verify our algorithm's capacity to represent a compartmental model [33] and show how the diffusion influences the dynamics. Section 5 presents the numerical results of the spatio-temporal model of COVID-19 infection spread. We perform simulations similar to the ones presented in [8] and show tests to highlight the new modeling capabilities introduced in this work. Finally, the paper ends with a summary of our main findings and the perspectives for the next steps of this research.The presentation of the governing equations follows the continuum mechanics framework in [8] instead of the more traditional approach found in mathematical and biological references. Consider a system which may be decomposed into N distinct populations: u 1 (x, t), u 2 (x, t), ..., u N (x, t). Let Ω ∈ R 2 be a simply connected domain of interest with boundary ∂Ω = Γ D ∩ Γ N , and [0, T ] a generic time interval. The vector compact representation of the governing equations as a transient nonlinear diffusion-reaction system of equations reads,We denote the densities of the susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and deceased populations as s(x, t), e(x, t), i(x, t), r(x, t), and d(x, t). Also, let c(x, t) denote the cumulative number of infected and n(x, t) the sum of the living population; i.e., n(x, t) = s(x, t) + e(x, t) + i(x, t) + r(x, t). We consider u = [s, e, i, r, d] T . The matrices A, B and ν, and the vector f depend on a particular form of the system dynamics. Furthermore, in general, ν = ν(x), that is, diffusion is heterogeneous and anisotropic. Besides the boundary conditions (2), (3), we specify the initial conditionfor i = 1, 2, · · · , N .We first consider a SEIRD model [14] given by the following system of coupled PDEs over Ω × [0, T ]:where β is transmission rate (days −1 ), α the latent rate (days −1 ), γ the recovery rate (days −1 ), δ the death rate (days −1 ), and ν s , ν e , ν i , ν r are diffusion parameters respectively corresponding to the different population groups (km 2 persons −1 days −1 ). We append to the system of equations homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, that is, (ν · ∇u) · n = 0.We can reframe this model in the general form given by equation (1) . Thus, the matrices A, B, ν and the vector f reads, This model is based on the EPIDEMIC software 1 , and it is employed to verify our implementation. The system of equations represents that the susceptible population decreases as the exposed population increases. This variation depends on the transmission rate between infected and susceptible. The number of exposed increases because of the transmission rate and decreases when the exposed individuals become infected (after the incubation period). The number of infected increases after the incubation period and decreases depending on the recovery and death rate. The number of deaths depends only on the death rate as the number of recovered depends only on the recovery rate. Finally, the cumulative number of infected depends only on the exposed and the incubation period. The diffusion parameters are included in the model to spread the disease spatially.Summarizing, this model assumes:• Movement is proportional to population size; i.e., more movement occurs within heavily populated regions;• No movement occurs among the deceased population;• There is a latency period between exposure and the development of symptoms;• The probability of contagion is inversely proportional to the population size; • The exposed persons will ever develop symptoms;• Only infected persons are capable of spreading the disease;• The non-virus mortality rate is not considered in this model;• New births are not considered in this model.Note that the EPIDEMIC model's dynamics does not represent the actual COVID19 dynamics since, in the case of COVID19, the exposed population may be asymptomatic and recover without becoming infected and still spread the virus. Thus, a better model would be the one based on [9, 8] .We begin by making several model assumptions to represent the COVID-19 infection spread adequately [8] :• Only mortality due the COVID-19 is considered;• New births are not considered in this model.• Some portion of exposed persons never develop symptoms, and move directly from the exposed compartment to the recovered compartment (asymptomatic cases);• Both asymptomatic (exposed) and symptomatic (infected) patients are capable of spreading the disease;• There is a latency period between exposure and the development of symptoms;• It is possible that new cases of exposed people appear randomly in the system (exposed people who return from a travel);• The probability of contagion increases with population size (Allee effect [9] );• Movement is proportional to population size; i.e., more movement occurs within heavily populated regions;• No movement occurs among the deceased population; 1 https://americocunhajr.github.io/EPIDEMIC/ [33] Then, the system of equations becomes:where A characterizes the Allee effect (persons), that takes into account the tendency of outbreaks to cluster around large populations, β i is the transmission rate between symptomatic and susceptible (persons −1 days −1 ), β e is the transmission rate between asymptomatic and susceptible (persons −1 days −1 ), f is a source function that depends on space and time (persons), α is the latent rate (days −1 ), γ e is the recovery rate of the asymptomatic (days −1 ), γ i is the recovery rate of the symptomatic (days −1 ), δ is the death rate (days −1 ), and ν s , ν e , ν i , ν r are the diffusion parameters respectively corresponding to the different population groups (km 2 persons −1 days −1 ). Now, we call exposed who has contact with the virus but remains asymptomatic. However, since the virus is highly transmissible, the exposed population also may transmit the virus. The exposed may recover without any symptoms or may become infected. The infected follow the same logic of the previous SEIRD system (they may recover or die). The main difference in the new SEIRD system is in the exposed population and whom it interacts. The source function f may be defined to represent exposed people who return from travel. Note that β has units (days −1 ) while β i and β e have units (person −1 days −1 ). While equations (5) and (6) divide β by the living population, equations (15), (16) and (17) keep β i and β e constant independent of that.Therefore, to express this model in the general form given by equation (1), the matrices A, B, ν and the vector f reads,If we assume that the region of interest is isolated, we prescribe the following homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions,or simply (ν · ∇u) · n = 0.The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is defined as the average number of additional infections produced by an infected individual in a wholly susceptible population over the full course of the disease outbreak. In an epidemic situation, the threshold R 0 = 1 is the dividing line between the infection dying out and the onset of an epidemic. R 0 > 1 implies growth of the epidemic, whereas R 0 < 1 implies decay in infectious spread [14] .The concept of R 0 is well-defined for ODE models. However, its extension to a PDE model is unclear, owing to the influence of diffusion. Viguerie et al. [8] found that a R 0 derived for the ODE version of the PDE model is not consistently reliable to represent the epidemic's dynamic growth adequately. If we do not consider the diffusion, R 0 may be calculated as:For further details about the R 0 calculation, refer to [34, 8] .In this section we briefly introduce the Galerkin finite element formulation, the time discretization, and the the libMesh implementation, supporting adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Appendices A and B give respectively the resulting finite element matrices for the generic spatio-temporal SEIRD and COVID-19 models.We introduce a Galerkin finite element variational formulation for space discretization. Without loss of generality, we consider the case of homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Let V u h be a finite dimensional space such that,in which u h (·, t) is the discrete counterpart of u and w h the weight function. The weak formulation is then: findHere we define the operation (·, ·) as the standard scalar product in L 2 (Ω).The SEIRD and COVID-19 models yield stiff systems of equations, making explicit time-marching methods unfeasible. The Backward Euler method is widely applied because of its unconditional numerical stability characteristics. However, it has the disadvantage of being only first-order accurate, which introduces a significant amount of numerical diffusion. Then, we use the second-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2), which, compared to the prevailing Backward Euler method, has significantly better accuracy while retaining unconditional linear stability. The model becomes,The subscript n + 1 is associated to t = t n+1 and n, and n − 1 to the previous time-steps.We implement the compartmental epidemiological models in libMesh, a C++ FEM open-source software library for parallel adaptive finite element applications [35] . libMesh also interfaces with external solver packages like PETSc [36] and Trilinos [37] . Recently, libMesh was also coupled with in-situ visualization and data-analysis tools [38, 39] . It provides a finite element framework that can be used for the numerical simulation of partial differential equations on serial and parallel platforms. This library is an excellent tool for programming the finite element method and can be used for one-, two-, and three-dimensional steady and transient simulations. The libMesh library also has native support for adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR/C).Multiple scales can be resolved by AMR/C. libMesh supports AMR/C by h-refinement (element subdivision), prefinement (increasing the polynomial approximation order), and hp-refinement, that is, a combination of both [24] . In libMesh, coarsening is supported in the h, p, and hp AMR/C options. In the present work, we restrict ourselves to h-refinement with hanging nodes. The AMR/C procedure uses a local error estimator to drive the refinement and coarsening procedure, considering the error of an element relative to its neighbor elements in the mesh. This error may come from any variable of the system. As it is standard in libMesh, Kelly s error indicator is employed, which uses the H 1 seminorm to estimate the error [40] . Apart from the element interior residual, the flux jumps across the inter-element edges influence the element error. The flux jump of each edge is computed and added to the element error contribution. For both the element residual and flux jump, the values of the desired variables at each node are necessary. Therefore, the error e 2 can be stated as,where e 2 i is the error of each variable. In this study, we use all population types as variables for the error estimator. After computing the error values, the elements are ""flagged"" for refining and coarsening regarding their relative error. This is done by a statistical element flagging strategy. It is assumed that the element error e is distributed approximately in a normal probability function. Here, the statistical mean µ s and standard deviation σ s of all errors are calculated. Whether an element is flagged is depending on a refining (r f ) and a coarsening (c f ) fraction. For all errors e < µ s − σ s c f the elements are flagged for coarsening and for all e > µ s + σ s r f the elements are marked for refinement (see Figure 1 ). The refinement level is limited by a maximum h-level (h max ), (see Figure 2) , and the coarsening is done by h-restitution of sub-elements [24] , [41] .To verify the implementation of the generic spatio-temporal SEIRD model, we have done several tests. For this, we consider a square domain of 1km × 1km centered at (0, 0) for all tests in this section.In the first test, we do not consider diffusion. We consider a population of 1000 people/km 2 with 1 person/km 2 initially infected in all area of the domain. Then, the initial conditions are: s 0 = 999, e 0 = 0, i 0 = 1, r 0 = 0 and d 0 = 0. This test aims to reproduce a compartmental simulation of the EPIDEMIC software by using the same initial parameters. The results have to be the same in each point of the domain and the same as the EPIDEMIC software. We set α = 0.14286 days −1 , β = 0.25 days −1 , δ = 0.06666 days −1 , γ = 0.1 days −1 and ∆t = 1 day. The mesh has 50 × 50 bilinear quadrilateral elements. Figure 3 shows the comparison of the results, where we can see a very good agreement between both solutions. Figure 4 shows the results over a centralized horizontal line crossing the domain at t=365 days. It is possible to see that the results are the same in all the domain, as expected.Now, we consider the same parameters of the previous example, but different initial conditions. We consider a population of 1000 people/km 2 in all area of the domain with 1 person/km 2 initially infected only in a circle centered at (0, 0) and radius R = 0.5 km, We assume that ν s = ν e = ν i = ν r = 10 −8 km 2 persons −1 days −1 . Then, the initial conditions are: s 0 = 999, e 0 = 0, i 0 = 1 for R <= 0.5 and i 0 = 0 for R > 0 with R = x 2 + y 2 , r 0 = 0 and d 0 = 0 (see Figure 5 ). We consider adaptive mesh refinement in this example. The original mesh has 50 × 50 bilinear quadrilateral elements, and after the refinement, the smallest element has size 0.005 km. We initially refine the domain in two levels. For the AMR/C procedure, we set h max = 2,r f = 0.95, c f = 0.05. We apply the adaptive mesh refinement every 5 time-steps. Figure 6 shows the results over a centralized horizontal line crossing the domain at t=365 days. Figure 7 shows the infected people at different time-steps. Note that the infected remains actives in other parts of the domain because of the diffusion. It is possible to see the wave effect of the disease spreading. Note that the AMR/C procedure improves spatial resolution on the regions where the infected people are higher. In this test, we change the initial population. Instead of a constant value in all domain, we set 1000 people/km 2 at the left/top quadrant, 500 people/km 2 at the right/top quadrant, 250 people/km 2 at the left/bottom quadrant and 750 people/km 2 at the right/bottom quadrant ( Figure 8) . Then, the initial conditions are: s 0 = 999 for x ≤ 0 and y > 0, s 0 = 499 for x > 0 and y > 0, s 0 = 249 for x ≤ 0 and y <=, s 0 = 749 for x > 0 and y > 0, e 0 = 0, i 0 = 1 for R ≤ 0.5 and i 0 = 0 for R > 0 with R = x 2 + y 2 , r 0 = 0 and d 0 = 0. The initial population infected is 1 person/km 2 at the same circled region of the previous test. All other parameters are the same of the previous simulation. Figure 9 shows the infected people ate different time-steps. It is possible to see that the regions with denser populations (more people/km 2 ) are more affected by the disease. Figure 10 shows the total number of deaths after 365 days, and the regions with more people/km 2 have more deaths than the less dense regions. Note also that the AMR/C procedure generates meshes following the model dynamics. In this section, we perform some simulations to validate the spatio-temporal model of COVID-19 infection spread.In this test, we do not consider diffusion. We consider a square domain of 1km × 1km centered at (0, 0) with a population of 1000 people/km 2 , with 1 person/km 2 initially infected and 5 people/km 2 exposed in all area of the domain. Then, the initial conditions are: s 0 = 994, e 0 = 5, i 0 = 1, r 0 = 0 and d 0 = 0. The aim of this test is to reproduce a compartmental simulation presented in [8] by using the same initial parameters. The results has to be the same in each point of the domain and also the same of the ones given in [8] . We set α = 0.125 days −1 , β i = β e = 0.005 days −1 persons −1 , δ = 0.0625 days −1 , γ i = 0.041666667 days −1 and γ e = 0.1666667 days −1 . The mesh has 50 × 50 bilinear quadrilateral elements. Figure 11 shows the comparison of the results, where we can see an excellent agreement. To reproduce a 1D simulation with quadrilateral elements, we fix the element width to 0.0005 and vary its length to find the proper refinement for this case. Therefore, we run a mesh convergence study as well as a time-step convergence study.For the initial conditions, we set s = s 0 and e = e 0 as follows, (36) Figure 12 shows the initial conditions. We further set i 0 = 0, r 0 = 0, and d 0 = 0. Qualitatively, the initial conditions represent a large population centered around x = 0.35 with no exposed persons and a small population centered around x = 0.75 with some exposed individuals. We also enforce homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions at x = 0 and a zero-population Dirichlet boundary condition at x = 1 for all model compartments. The latter represents a non-populated area at x = 1. We compare numerical solutions computed on successively refined uniform grids with mesh size ∆x = 1/50, 1/100, 1/250, 1/500, and 1/1000. The time step is ∆t = 0.25 days. Figure 15 shows the difference in the total population of each compartment of individuals for the different meshes.A good resolution is found for ∆x = 1/500. It is easy to see this convergence in Figure 16 , where the number of individuals of each compartment is plotted at t = 90 days.We examine the impact of time-step size ∆t on the numerical approximation of the model solution. We consider the time step sizes ∆t = 1, ∆t = 0.5, ∆t = 0.25, ∆t = 0.125 and ∆t = 0.0625 days. As the results in Section 5.2.1 suggested ∆x = 1/500 is a sufficiently fine spatial discretization, we utilize this mesh resolution here. Figure 17 shows the difference of the total population of each compartment of individuals for the different time-steps.A good accuracy is found for ∆t = 0.25 days. It is easy to see how the accuracy improves in Figure 18 , where the number of individuals of each compartment is plotted at t = 90 days.This test is the application of the previous configuration rotated in a two dimensional square with corners at (-1,-1), (1,-1), (1,1) and (-1,1) . The initial population is: with R = x 2 + y 2 .The original mesh has 50 × 50 bilinear quadrilaterals elements and it is refined in two levels at the beginning of the simulation. For the AMR/C procedure, we set h max = 2, r f = 0.95, c f = 0.05. We apply the adaptive mesh refinement every 4 time-steps. The behavior of the transmission has to be similar to the 1D model results, but in a radial configuration. Figures 19 shows the populations at different time steps. Figure 6 shows the results over a centralized horizontal line (or vertical because the axisymmetry) crossing the domain at t=200 days. If we compare Figure 6 with Figure 14 , it is possible to see that the populations follow a similar behavior. In Figure 21 we plot the time history of the total number of individuals. There is a small gain in the total number of individuals (less than 0.1%). This test considers anisotropic diffusion in the previous configuration (only in the x direction). Therefore, the populations move spatially only in the x direction. Figure 22 shows the populations at different time-steps. Figure 23 shows the results over a centralized horizontal line crossing the domain, and Figure 24 over a centralized vertical line. By comparing these two figures, it is clear how the diffusion direction influences the behavior of the virus spread. Since there is no movement of infected or exposed people in the y direction, part of the population does not have contact with the virus because there is no chance of the virus to reach them.In Figure 25 we plot the time history of the total number of individuals. We can see a gain in the total number of individuals of less than 0.1%. The original mesh has 50 × 50 bilinear quadrilaterals elements and it is refined in two levels at the beginning of the simulation. For the AMR/C procedure, we set h max = 2, r f = 0.95, c f = 0.05. We apply the adaptive mesh refinement every 4 time-steps.The initial population is: Figure 26 shows the initial susceptible population. Note there are not infected or exposed people at the initial time.We implement a random source of the exposed population that depends on the number of susceptible people. In all time-steps random nodes of the domain receive a certain number of exposed people. It tries to simulate people who travel and suddenly appear in a region carrying the virus. The random source does not add individuals to the population, but change individuals between susceptible and exposed compartments. Of course, this model is simple. Nevertheless, it demonstrates how to handle a random source term in the equations. Figure 27 shows a example of the random exposed number of people that appears in one time-step. In Figure 31 , we plot the time history of the total number of individuals. There is a negligible increase in the total number of individuals (less than 0.1%). We developed an extended continuum SEIRD model to represent the dynamics of the COVID-19 virus spread based on the framework proposed in [9] . We validate our code by comparing our results with other simulations. We introduce new test cases to highlight new modeling capabilities. Among the new features added to the base model, there is the addition of a source term, which represents exposed people who return from travel, by changing individuals from the susceptible compartment to the exposed compartment. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. Our code is implemented through the libMesh library and supports adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, it can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics.Data is essential to define the epidemic spreading parameters, as diffusion and infection rate. We have to study how it would be the best way to represent people who return from travels, addressing questions like defining the probability of a random source appearing in the system, in which area, the population density, among others. Diffusion-reaction models, as the present one, are richer than standard compartmental models. However, they are slower, which hampers their widespread utilization in what-if scenarios, parametric studies, and time-critical situations. Therefore, the development of low-dimensional computational models will leverage the ability of continuous models to perform in real-time scenarios. Projection-based or data-driven model order reduction [42, 43] aims to lower the computational complexity of a given computational model by reducing its dimensionality (or order), can provide this leverage. They can work in conjunction with emerging machine learning methods such as physics informed neural networks [44] . We can foresee a tremendous impact in the mathematical epidemiology field of all these new methods and techniques, enlarging the predictive capabilities and computational efficiency of diffusion-reaction epidemiological models.In libMesh, we calculate directly the new solution (u n+1 ) instead of the variation (δu). Then, on the left-hand side, we gather the terms containing an unknown, whereas all the other terms are taken to the right-hand-side. The superscript k is from the previous Newton iteration.

We use the BDF2 time discretization method, Newton's method for the nonlinear terms, and we simplify the number of the living population by considering the previous linear solution. For all test cases the nonlinear tolerance for Newton's method is set to 10 −8 and the linear solver tolerance is set to 10 −10 . The linear solver is GMRES with ILU(0) preconditioner.In libMesh, we calculate directly the new solution (u n+1 ) instead of the variation (δu).

Although a huge effort in many fields of sciences is being made to mitigate its effects, the disease is continuously spreading and, in many regions, a second wave is causing great concerns. The difficulties in controlling the epidemic are in part due to a crucial combination of being highly contagious [1] , having a long incubation period [2] during which contagions are possible a few days before symptoms onset [3] , having mild or asymptomatic cases [1] and also because the diagnosis may take a few days since contacting the Health Care system. In particular, the latter yields that outbreaks spread and epidemic evolves while laboratory results are being processed. This effect being more important in low and medium income countries due to operational and logistic problems, generally caused by technological and economic inequalities [4, 5] .We present in this work a method to mitigate the epidemic effects by estimating the number of COVID-19 cases without having to wait for lab confirmations. This provides the Health Care system a tool to react in advance and evaluate current or next Public Health policies.In mass accidents or major catastrophes Early Warning Systems (EWS) play a key role for disaster mitigation [6] [7] [8] decreasing response times and improving their effectiveness. The main strategy of EWS in infectious disease surveillance is the incorporation of information produced nearly from the infection [9, 10] . In this case, the symptoms onset and their detection by the individual and community health perception is the first detectable signal of cases and, in particular, an outbreak. EWS based on syndromic surveillance have been applied in epidemiological surveillance for early outbreaks identification and confirmation [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . One of the main characteristics of EWS is the utilization of health information provided by the population in order to activate local alarms. Nowadays, with the wide use of cell phone applications and specific health-system phone lines, important databases with information about syndromic surveillance are generated each day [16] . Geo-location plays a main role is spatial and temporal definition of the outbreaks detected by EWS [17] .In Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), the COVID-19 phone line 148 is one of the first contacts between a person that believes to be infected and the Health Care System. The trained Health Care team receives and responds to people questions generating, simultaneously, a syndromic surveillance database. If the person has symptoms that could indicate a COVID19 infection, it is instructed to follow the corresponding protocol. Importantly, such syndromic database was used as input for estimation of cases and outbreak detection in Buenos Aires Province.This work is divided as follows. In Section 2 we describe the COVID-line data and present the details of the mathematical model to estimate the number of cases using the phone calls data. In Section 3 we show how the model works in Buenos Aires Province and how it can be used to track on-stream the epidemic. In Section 4 we present the Early Outbreak Alarm and show its details in Villa Azul (Quilmes) case. We discuss the limitations and current improvements of the model in Section 5, and we present our conclusions in section 6. Figure 1 : COVID-line 148 workflow. As people call the COVID-line upon their health perception, the COVID-trained operators determine whether they correspond to suspicious or close-contact case. In such a case, their record is passed to the Epidemiological Surveillance team and a COVID-19 swabbing is ordered. Some days later the swabbing lab result is added to the corresponding record. The algorithm described in this paper works with the first part of the information which is delivered on-stream as the operators determine the case passes the corresponding threshold.2 Estimating on-stream COVID-19 cases through calls to a COVID-lineWe describe the mathematical model implemented to relate phone calls to a COVID-line to lab-confirmed cases per district per day. In the following paragraphs we outline the functioning of the 148 COVID-line and then we describe the details of the model.Buenos Aires Province (PBA for its acronym in Spanish) is the most populated province of Argentina, with more than 17 million inhabitants. Around 13 million people live in the Metropolitan area surrounding the City of Buenos Aires. Importantly, the remaining 4 million live in the vast area and with low population density known as the interior of the province. This demographic heterogeneity leads to a hyper-centralized Health Care system. In order to attend the growing demand for medical assistance caused by the COVID-19, public health authorities implemented in February 2020 a specific-COVID phone that is reached by dialing 148. The objective of this COVID-line is to address all community concerns related to COVID, which includes questions, doubts, symptom reports, and reference to the Health Care system, among others.The COVID-line grew in personal as the epidemic spread in PBA. The call request grew from a few hundreds per day at March up to approximately 20k per day at the end of August. Until late June the system was not outperformed and all calls requiring assistance were taken. We therefore consider that during this regime an indicator coming from this COVID-line would be relatively unbiased. This is specially true if one compares this to other indicators as testing, or lab processing, which were changing their behavior considerably as epidemic spread during this period. We find that April 1st to June 26th is a period in which the COVID-line has been relatively stable to major changes.As people call the COVID-line 148, they enter into an automatic voice menu in which one of the options corresponds to COVID-like symptoms. As user go into this option their call is taken by a COVID-trained operator and a short questionnaire on their experience indicates whether the call does not pass the threshold to be registered or corresponds to one of the two registered categories: close-contact and suspicious case. If the call corresponds to any of these categories, then the operator registers their data and in particular the district from which they are calling. We depict in Fig. 1 the workflow of the COVID-line. At the early stage that the system was implemented, the record did not include trustful information on the exact address of the user. This crucial fact led us to develop the system we explain below by restricting our information on the user to only their district. Although future upgrades on the system are providing more accurate location of the call, the current work restricts to the caller district and only once their call is taken by a COVID-trained operator.We present the mathematical model to estimate the new infected using the phone call data, and apply it to PBA. The reasoning in this section follows the same lines as in Ref. [18] , but with different purposes and different filtering in the data set.We consider a data set of calls from many districts and during a given time range to a COVID-line. Each one of these calls can either be background: people with similar symptoms but not infected signal: people infected with COVID-19.Under reasonable assumptions of homogeneity in space and time we can model that background calls in each district and time-window are proportional to the total district population and the time-window length. Whereas signal calls are proportional to the total number of infected people in the district whose record is opened in the corresponding time-window, even though their lab-confirmation may be available in a later time. Therefore, if we divide all our data set in chunks corresponding in space to the districts in PBA, and in time to timewindows of ∆t (j) days that can be arbitrarily chosen, we can pose the following equations for all the chunks labeled by j:Where N This fit works better if all chunks correspond to periods in which the testing methods have not changed drastically, as it can be for instance if the number of daily tests is modified considerably, or if new symptoms are considered as threshold for testing, among others. The reason for requiring this is to have a coherent balance between the number of infected reported and the number of calls in all chunks all the time. With this objective, is better to re-fit the parameters every time there are major changes in the testing and reporting methods.Once the parameters θ p,I in Eq. 1 have been fitted, including their uncertainty from the fit, we can estimate the number of new infected in a given chunk as n (j)Observe that the Right Hand Side requires data that is obtained in the same day, and therefore one can estimate the number of cases n I on-stream, without need of waiting the laboratory results. Notice, that the algorithm allows to estimate the total number of new cases in each chunk, but not to determine which of the calls correspond to the new cases. The uncertainty in the estimation n (j) I is computed by applying the usual error expansion formula on Eq. 2. If variables are correlated, as for instance θ p and θ I , one should take this into account, however in our case we neglected this correlation in comparison to other terms. For the parameters θ p,I we use the uncertainty coming from the fit, for N c we use Poisson uncertainty, and for N p one should decide whether to add a systematic uncertainty or only use Poisson, as we did in this work. As discussed below, uncertainties in the estimations play a central role in the design of the Early Outbreak Alarm, and therefore should be handled with care, specially the systematic ones if present.In order to apply this algorithm in PBA we have used the data set of phone calls to the 148 COVID-line. We work with all the phone calls entering the COVID-line that reach the threshold for being close contact or suspicious case. The reason for this filtering is because the district the user is calling from is registered by the operator. Although the address is also in principle registered most of the times, in the practice many ambiguities, misspelled words, or other unintended errors yield that only about ∼ 50%-70% of the times it can be correctly reconstructed. We consider the data set of calls between April 1st and June 26th, since after this the call center was overloaded and not all phone could be taken, yielding intractable biases. Along this period we have fitted the data a few times in different data sets, obtaining fairly similar results and with coefficient of determination always satisfying R 2 > 0.85. In particular, as cases were increasing, we were obtaining more accurate estimations for θ I , as it can be expected.In order to show the robustness of the hypotheses, we show how this model works with data from May 1st to June 26th, divided in two equal length time-windows each. We consider all districts in PBA whose number of calls in these chunks is greater than 100. After this filtering we are left with 43 chunks, i.e. 43 data points. After performing the fit indicated in Eq. 1 we obtain θ p = (5.16 ± 1.59) × 10 −6 calls per inhabitant per day θ I = 0.69 ± 0.05 calls per infected people It is worth noticing that the precise values of these fitted coefficients have a strong dependence on the process of call filtering and call system architecture. In particular, these values differ from those in Ref. [18] because we are considering a different level of filtering to obtain the district of each user. The fit for this data set yields a coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.91, which indicates the robustness of the involved hypotheses. In Fig. 2 we show the comparison between data and fit for the number of phone-calls, as posed in Eq. 1.The mathematical model described in the previous section provides a framework to estimate many days in advance the number of lab-confirmed cases per day, as a function of the spatiotemporal distribution of phone calls to the COVID-line. This is a compelling achievement because the phone call information is available on-stream, whereas lab confirmation of cases may require from a few days to up to a week since patient report their first symptoms. Along this section we show how this system can be used to have an estimate of the epidemic evolution on-stream, along with real case results in PBA.As this system was developed there was no time for validation. However, obtaining a very satisfactory R 2 0.85 in the fit was a signal that the model was insofar working well. As months went by, we had the possibility of comparing in a long range time-window the model estimation against the measured lab-confirmed number of cases per day per district. In Fig. 3 we show the comparison between the estimation and the late lab-confirmed cases per day for two any districts in PBA. Similar results are obtained for other districts. Is central to observe in this figure that the number of lab-confirmed cases (red line) is an information that is available many days after the corresponding date, whereas the model estimation (blue) is available at the end of each day. As it can be seen in the figure the estimation has a good agreement with the real data. There are a few date ranges in which door-to-door swabbing through DETECTAR operatives [19] induce an expected sub-estimation in cases.This syndromic surveillance has been used to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks, to monitor disease trends, and to provide reassurance that potential outbreak has not occurred. In particular, it has also been very useful as an early outbreak detection, as we detail in next section. Syndromic surveillance systems seek to use existing health data in real time to provide immediate analysis and feedback to those in charge with investigation and follow-up of potential outbreaks. Particularly, the data collected by the COVID-line calls proved to be a valuable and reliable input to track the epidemic along the PBA.The tracking of the epidemic through this model is specially useful when the capacity overload of the diagnostic centers leads to delays in obtaining results. For this reason, having a real-time and relatively unbiased estimation of cases gives the Public Health authorities the possibility of taking actions in time [13] . Furthermore, in a disaster scenario prioritization this tool takes a main role when resources and time are limited, as it occurred at the end of June in PBA. The calls-based syndromic surveillance allowed a rapid characterization of the different PBA districts in terms of their epidemiological status and the consequent action was taken in order to mitigate the epidemic effects. Figure 3 : Comparison of real data (red) versus model estimation (blue) for two example districts of Buenos Aires Province (La Matanza and Lomas de Zamora). Recall that the red line corresponding to the real confirmed cases with their record opening in the corresponding date, is reconstructed many days later. In the dates in which the red line goes above the estimation is usually because DETECTAR operatives (door-to-door testing [19] ) were carried on. In general, the model yields a very good estimation to monitor the epidemic in all affected PBA districts.Along this section we detail a compelling by-product of the model in Section 2 to detect COVID-19 outbreaks considerably earlier than through lab confirmation. We briefly describe the working of the model and then provide its detail through the description of a real case that occurred in mid May in Villa Azul (Quilmes) and Villa Itatí (Avellaneda) in PBA.Provided the on-stream estimation of the cases per day in each district, we are interested in developing a statistical and automatic tool that can trigger an alarm when a potential outbreak is on rise. Having an early alarm on this kind of epidemiological features is a crucial tool to avoid its spread and drastic consequences.To detect a potential outbreak there are many indicators that should be simultaneously analyzed. On one hand it is important to have an estimation of the daily absolute and relative number of cases, and on the other hand is also important to have an estimation on the daily variation of these observables. To have an objective quantitative indicator of the potential of an outbreak in a given region, it is essential to have a correct assessment of the uncertainties in all the estimations of the model. Along the system implemented as an Early Outbreak Alarm, we have considered that the important indicator is the significance of all the basic indicators which signal an anomaly as they depart from zero. Here significance is defined as the distance to zero from the central value of the indicator, measured in units of its uncertainty. Or, in other words,As it can be seen in Eq. 3, the correct computation of the uncertainties (or error bars) is crucial for the functioning of the Early Outbreak Alarm.The developed algorithm computes everyday the estimation for the total number of new cases in each district in PBA. Since in the studied time-window, specially before June, the number of estimated cases per day of many districts were below ∼ 5 − 10, we considered to include the estimation of cases for the last two days. This would reduce the relative Poisson uncertainty due to small numbers. We computed the number of estimated cases in absolute value, and also relative to 100k inhabitants to be equally sensitive to all districts.A third and decisive observable that signals the level of danger of an outbreak is the daily increase of estimated cases. Given the daily estimation provided by the mathematical model, we can recognize a rapidly increasing curve in many ways. We have considered to fit a straight line to the case estimation for the last three days and use the slope of this line as an estimation of the central value of the daily increase. We also use the significance as the most relevant indicator to decide the level of danger of each district. In this case, the computation of the error bar in the slope of the line includes all the uncertainties in each day estimation included in the computation of the fit uncertainty through the least squares residuals. We use three days to fit a line because is the minimum time needed to see a two-day consecutive increase, while being still well ahead of the laboratory results. In addition, three days is also a good time-window for the specific COVID-19 characteristics.This Early Outbreak Alarm has provided to PBA Health Care administration very important tools to identify possible outbreaks during the rise of the epidemic curve. Since the granularity of the algorithm is very poor (districts), the system needs to be complemented with other independent indicators, in particular those which can help to provide a more accurate location of the outbreak. This was usually done by calling back manually the recorded cases, and then by sending DETECTAR operatives [19] to verify if in fact the in-situ conditions would be the predicted. The Early Outbreak Alarm has indicated many outbreaks that have been controlled since mid-April to mid-June. In particular, we describe in the following paragraphs the very special 1 case of Villa Azul (Quilmes) and provide the details on how the Early Outbreak Alarm indicated the Quilmes district.We report the details of one of the outbreaks indicated by the Early Outbreak Alarm in mid-May in Quilmes district. This case was the first major outbreak in a low-income neighborhood in PBA and had a great impact in the news [20] , not only for its magnitude but also because of its early detection that drove a strict lock-down and isolation of the outbreak to control its spread to the close neighborhoods. Figure 4 : Cases-per-day estimation using the model on the COVID-line phone calls for the last two days. Observe that districts are not sorted by their central value, but by their significance, which is defined as the rate between the central value and the uncertainty. This is why error bars are crucial to provide an Early Outbreak Alarm. Results are shown in absolute value (left) and relative to every 100k inhabitants (right). In the figure we show the scenario for May 20th in which Quilmes is almost as large as La Matanza in absolute value, with ∼ 1/3 of its population. Whereas Quilmes is in the top position when scaled to relative per 100k inhabitants.On May 20th the alarm was indicating a large number of estimated cases in Quilmes district (see Fig. 4 ), in particular Quilmes had the top estimation in number of cases per inhabitants of the last two days, as measured through the significance of the indicator. In addition to this, the indicator of the daily increase fit was also indicating Quilmes as the top district in significance (see Fig. 5 ). This last indicator on the daily increase fit to the Figure 5 : Slope of a linear fit to the cases per day estimation of last three days. The error bar corresponds to including the uncertainty in each per day estimation and in the slope determination in the fit. Also in this plot is crucial to sort the districts according to the significance in this variable. In the figure we see on May 20th Quilmes in the top position, indicating a potential early alarm for an outbreak, as it was consequently confirmed by other indicators a few days later. last three days can be visualized in Fig. 6a , where we plot the daily estimation for the last 7 days on Quilmes. The fit is obtained using the last three data points in red. Given all these indicators pointing to Quilmes district, the surveillance team took the duty to locate the phone calls and observed an excess coming from Villa Azul, a low-income neighborhood in Quilmes and next to Avellaneda district.These observations indicated in advance by the Early Outbreak Alarm needed to be verified by an independent complementary indicator. On the following day a DETECTAR operative [19] was sent to Villa Azul, where the acute situation was verified and door-to-door swabbing with urgent lab results started right away. As first results were confirming the outbreak in Villa Azul, the PBA Administration decided a strict lock-down and isolation for 14 days since may 24th [20] . including the lab-confirmed cases (solid red), the day that the Health Care System landed on Villa Azul to begin testing door by door, and a wider range of dates to capture the big picture of the case. The strict lock-down in Villa Azul with no entering nor leaving permission lasted from May 24th to June 8th. As it can be seen in the plot, during the door-by-door testing, the solid red line goes above and uncorrelated to the estimated cases by phone calls, as expected.Villa Azul (Quilmes) and Villa Itatí (Avellaneda) are two adjacent low-income neighborhoods. The last demographic analysis indicates that Villa Azul has a population of 3.128 and Villa Itatí 15.142. High density building and housing, and tiny streets bring the population into close contact. These characteristics make these neighborhoods susceptible to a fast spread [21] . Taking this into account, early outbreak detection implies a main challenge in these complex cases where detection and propagation block must be done when the first few cases are reported. In particular, the above described early alarm for the outbreak occurred in Villa Azul allowing a fast response of the Health Care System team to mitigate and control its propagation to Villa Itatí.Once produced the strict lock-down and isolation, water and food-supply were delivered by the social care-team. People were not allowed to leave the house during the entire isolation. Active surveillance health teams started with a door-to-door symptoms monitoring. Those cases with clinical manifestation related to COVID-19 were tested. Confirmed cases were isolated inside their houses in cases where this was possible (if there was an empty room for example) and in cases where it was not, the people were sent to an out-of-Hospital center.The development of the mathematical model to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases was done in urgency and adapting it to the available data. There was no time to request changes in data acquisition nor processing. Of course the algorithm and the system can be improved in many directions. We discuss some of these features in the following paragraphs.One of the major weakness in the algorithm is the large granularity, which corresponds to districts. Districts population in the relevant area are in average 500k people. This issue is translated in that the Early Outbreak Alarm stops working once the density of cases is such that there are more than a few outbreaks in each district. This happened in late June in PBA. In a future implementation we are carrying out a workaround for this issue by obtaining a trustful address from the COVID-trained operator that takes de call. A more stable solution would be to obtain this information from the telephone company, however regulations many times block this possibility.On the other hand, the algorithm has a very important benefit that is its unbiasedness. Given that the COVID-line works 24 hours the 7 days of the week and with a fair equal methodology all the time, the algorithm estimation does not rely on tests availability or overloaded testing facilities, among others. Of course, the system does have slight biases that may come -for instance-from different backgrounds due to different features in the districts, or seasonally social behavior as months go by. Some of these biases may be solved by re-fitting the model once in a while, others by fitting different models in different regions.Importantly, the algorithm provides information about the background calls that vary in space and time. Further studies could be done in order to understand and extract properties of the background, as it can be its seasonality, variations according to regions, to public announcements or news, etc.The crucial point in the mathematical model is that recognizes anomalies due to collective behaviors. Therefore, we find that the mathematical model and the Early Outbreak Alarm algorithms can be useful for many other epidemiological diseases -as for instance Dengue-, and other events such as natural catastrophes, among others. We are currently working in the improvement of this system in many aspects, also including Machine Learning algorithms, and these advancements will be published in a future work.We have created a syndromic surveillance algorithm based in the correlation between phone calls to a COVID-line, districts population and reported cases. This algorithm works by understanding that phone calls to a COVID-line are a part due to non-infected people having similar symptoms (background) and other part due to infected people (signal). By observing that background has to be proportional to district population, whereas signal proportional to reported cases, we have fitted our assumption. The coefficient of determination for Buenos Aires Province (PBA) is always R 2 > 0.85 for different samples, which indicates the robustness of our hypothesis. In addition, we have validated our model with real data.Along the manuscript the model, its estimations, and how we compute their error bars were described. Also, it has been shown how the estimations, which are obtained in-stream, can be used to address Public Health policies without requiring to wait for lab results, which require many more days to converge. The algorithm worked in PBA from April to June, since during this time the COVID-trained call center was not overloaded. Therefore the estimation was relatively unbiased.We have shown how this estimation can be used to create an Early Outbreak Alarm. Furthermore, we describe how the construction of indicators that have to do with daily cases, and daily increase of cases, can indicate outbreaks in advance. The relevant statistic variable in this case is the significance, since it is a real measure on how far from zero are the indicators. Importantly, this system can detect an outbreak and, in particular, we exemplify its application in the outbreak detection in Villa Azul (Quilmes).The limitations on the Early Outbreak Alarm were discussed in this paper, many of them because of the characteristics of the data available at the moment of its (urgent) development. We have pointed out many ways to improve its sensitivity and accuracy, on which we are currently working. This alarm would also be useful, not only for other epidemiological diseases, but also for events that yield changes in collective behavior, such as Dengue epidemic, natural catastrophes, or others.The presented algorithm and mathematical model have been one of the main tools in the PBA Health Care system dashboard during the epidemic, and its current and upgrade versions are still being used to track the epidemic and detect outbreaks.","Argentina","abstract","2020-10-10",10

In order to regulate how data can be collected and used, many data protection regulations emerged to set rules to organize this environment. In Brazil, just recently, a general data protection regulation was enacted in 2018, becoming effective in September of 2021 (Law n. 13 .709/2018, Lei Geral de de Proteção de Dados Pessoais -LGPD). This regulation aims to provide rights and duties for both users and companies, whenever the processing of personal data is taking place. Thus, data protection norms also applies, and are extremely important in this scenario, when the processing of sensitive health data is taking place.However, some scenarios allow the use of sensitive health data collection without the user's consent, since other legal provision can be applied; the pandemic scenario is one example 1 . Data sharing and communication among health institutions, public or private, and state entities are vital to the decision making process and the definition of public policies in order to contain further disease spread [1] . Moreover, the community engagement is also crucial to provide ""information delivery, consultation, collaboration in decision-making, empowering action in informal groups or formal partnerships, healthcare delivery and promotion, interaction with various stakeholders"" [2] . Previous pandemic outbreak experience like influenza, MERS-CoV, Zika 2 , and now COVID -19, showed that data sharing between health institutions and other stakeholders worldwide are fundamental to fight against the broad contamination. The outbreak of other regional diseases in Brazil, such as Dengue, together with COVID-19, in 2021, will make the public health situation even more tricky and complex [3] , once they present the same clinic and laboratory characteristics [4] .From the law perspective, in Brazil, the LGPD puts forward a set of rules and obligations that regulates the use of personal data by public and private entities. Thus, in the pandemic scenario, controllers and processors, must evaluate which of the legal basis foreseen in law authorizes the collection of users' data (article 7 and 11 of the LGPD). In this sense, it must be remarked that the Brazilian data protection regulation establishes that individual consent is only one of the legal basis authorizing data processing. Furthermore, data controllers must abide to the law's principles, rights, safeguards and act in good faith. Therefore, the authorization to process data does not imply in permission to use, process, and share personal data indiscriminately. There must be a purpose for processing data, that must be legitimate, specific, explicit and previous informed to the data subject (known as the purpose principle -art. 6, I, LGPD) From a technology perspective, data privacy management is challenging. Data must be processed and kept in a safe ruled-base environment, and looks forward to a transparent and secure environment [5] .In this sense, the blockchain technology emerges as a possible solution to build a unified, distributed, trusted database. Firstly, the data immutability provided by the consensus mechanisms ensures the unified storage of historical information. Secondly, the data distribution among the worldwide network participants guarantees high data availability. Last but not least, the cryptography used in most of blockchain platforms have performed satisfying results in regards to data storage and transaction security [6] .Therefore, regarding data governance, there are two main groups of blockchain platforms; the permissioned and the non-permissioned (public). The latter is broadly used for cryptocurrency applications. This model is basically full-public, i.e., anyone can read the blockchain data, and everyone can insert data since validated by the consensus protocol. The former is regarded as the best option for second layer governance for enabling data feed and access by permissioned politics. Permissioned blockchains allow personalized data sharing; the users are able to set access rules and set which data should be public, private, or accessed under case by case authorization.To do so, we propose a second layer of governance in permissioned blockchains solutions to fill this gap. We developed an architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric [7] to instantiate the proposed governance in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. We base our model on the Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) [8] principles defining the Problem (such as the purpose limitation), Actors (data subject and data controller and processor), Social Norms (regulations), Process (data processor methodologies), and Nodal Points (technology used to connect stakeholders) based on the pandemic scenario.The constant and intense collection of personal data by a myriad of services and goods, and the pan-optical vigilance exercised over our behaviour when analyzing this collected data, highlights the importance of ensuring ways to protect our personal data. Due to Brazilian lack of tradition in this subject, it is important to provide society acculturation and awareness of the importance of protecting personal data in general.In Brazil, the LGPD puts forward a set of rules and obligations that regulates the use of personal data by public and private entities. Thus, in the pandemic scenario, controllers and processors, must evaluate which of the legal basis foreseen in law authorizes the collection of users' data (article 7 and 11 of the LGPD). In this sense, it must be remarked that the Brazilian data protection regulation establishes that individual consent is only one of the legal basis authorizing data processing. In any case, data controllers must abide to the law's principles, rights, safeguards and act in good faith.In this sense, we have highlighted four fundamental ideas from the LGPD, which will be applied to the scenario that we will discuss in the next sections. Firstly, the purpose limitation principle, which imposes that data processing must be legitimate, specific and explicitly informed to the data subject. Further processing is only allowed if compatible with the initial informed purpose (art. 6, I, LGPD). Secondly, the data minimization principle, meaning that it should only be used the strictly necessary data to attend to the intended and informed purpose. Thirdly, the law strongly recommends the use of anonymization or pseudonymization techniques as a governance and good practice measure to ensure data security and to protect one's privacy (arts. 12, 13, 46 and 6, VII and VIII, LGPD). Fourth, data processing must happen in a transparent manner, with the disclosure of clear, precise and easily accessible information related to the data processing activity and the controller and processor (art. 6, VI, LGPD). Furthermore, the law establishes different legal basis, beyond consent (arts. 7 and 11, LGPD), that authorizes the legitimate processing of personal data and sensitive data (which includes health data). Regardless of the legal basis used to process data, all data controllers and processors shall comply with the law's principles and other safeguards.In the pandemic scenario, as well as COVID-19 outbreak, the compliance with data protection norms is of the utmost importance [9] . Such regulations do not forbid the use of personal data in such a context, but establishes the rules and legitimate uses that must be observed in pandemic scenarios. Such compliance provides that society as a whole can benefit from the uses of such data: it protects individual's privacy and data, at the same time as it allows for data utility. In this sense, contact tracing apps [10] [11] [12] are being implemented as a manner to allow public health institutions to track the infection movement and potential infected people. Some of the apps use smartphone bluetooth sensors to identify nearby devices of people that have been in contact with an infected person. In other cases, geolocation data are being being collected, although privacy concerns has been being raised. This implies the monitoring, storing and communication of the collected information, which includes sensitive information (i.e. health data). Therefore, the challenge is how to manage data privacy and comply with data protection regulations provisions.Blockchain technology emerged initially as separated concepts, block and chain, as pillar bases for creating the Bitcoin [13] . This technology allowed the exchange of values, assets, cryptocurrencies, and tokens between different parties without a central authority to regulate the environment. For instance, banks are not necessary anymore; people are able to do transactions peer-to-peer. Moreover, the consensus protocol delivers data immutability and empowers users to participate in the decision-making process.Furthermore, blockchain technology also enabled the development of smart contracts. Nick Szabo presented this concept in 1996 [14] proposing the creation of contracts using a computer programming language with simple if-then-else logic. In 2014, Buterin [15] developed a blockchain platform that implemented the concept presented by Szabo and explored the transparency, immutability, trust, and decentralization provided by the blockchain technology. Therefore, smart contracts are immutable contracts written in programming language code that, after deployed in a blockchain environment, could be used by anyone, according to the platform data governance model.There are two main models of first layer blockchain governance: (i) the public (permissionless), and the (ii) private, or hybrid, (permissioned) blockchain. The former presents full data transparency, and anyone can participate in the consensus protocol [16] . Moreover, anyone can do transactions since the consensus protocol validated them. There are some popular public blockchain platforms with different application domains such as: (i) Bitcoin for cryptocurrency; (ii) Ethereum for smart contracts and tokens [15] , and (iii) EOS 3 for smart contracts and games, for instance.The latter enables second layer data governance by the creation of policies for data access and write [17] . For this reason, the permissioned blockchains are usually applied for the corporative and governmental environments. The smart contracts created in such environment allow users to share their data under a pre-established agreement. In consequence, permissioned solutions are more compatible with data regulations worldwide. Many industries have exploring the permissioned blockchains and smart contracts, such as health [18] , insurance [19] , supply-chain [20] , oil and gas sector [21] and so on. It shows how the blockchain adoption has been growing in the last years in many different sectors.In general, the data governance concept is related to big companies and how they manage a high volume of data. According to Khatri and Brown [22] , governance is related to ""what decisions must be made to ensure effective management and use of IT and who makes the decisions."" Thus, data management is vital for influencing both operational and strategic decisions directly. They are crucial to the interaction and decision-making between parties that have to resolve a mutual problem.Even though the World Health Organization 4 (WHO) has publicly disclosed COVID-19 data, the transparency and traceability concepts have not been respected, since it is not possible to access who inserted the data, whether the data was properly anonymized, whether the patient has given informed consent, etc. Moreover, centralized platforms are subject to data unavailability for internet connection causes or hacker attack. In the pandemic outbreak, data unavailability is especially worrying and may present severe consequences to the control and management of disease spread.Many authors discuss the challenges and opportunities in the pandemic scenario [23] [24] [25] , highlighting the importance of data quality. They argue that information quality depends on excellent data management, and it involves data standardization and high data availability. In summary, we selected five critical factors responsible for guaranteeing good governance in the pandemic scenario. [22] :• Accountability: related to who is the data controller, how s/he evaluated the data, and what access roles were created in regards to data management. • Standards: related to data storage and access standards.• Partnership: related to sharing data between organizations.• Strategic points of control: related to data validation and data quality assurance. • Compliance monitoring: related to data auditing.Furthermore, there is a well-known approach called Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) [8] . The GAF is based on five principles: (i) problems, (ii) actors, (ii) social norms, (iv) processes, and (v) nodal points. This framework proposes deconstructing social problems by decomposing them on these five principles and reconstructing them by modeling the governance. This approach was used to model COVID-19 data governance scenario. Table 1 presents the association between the COVID-19 scenario and the GAF principles.This mapping helps people to identify the purpose of limitation accurately by verifying the Problem principle. The actors and norms involved can also be checked, so people are able to trigger, or even suite, the organization that broke any user's rights. Moreover, by checking the processes and nodal points, people can request how they were collected and processed. From the traceability perspective, the called ""contact tracing"" apps can be modeled by the GAF principles as well. This mapping should also help health institutions to not only to elaborate explanation regarding which data will be collected, in which scenarios, in which time range, but also to guarantee data anonymization. To improve the data governance models [26] , we proposed a user-centric model depicted in Figure 1 .Health data management honoring user privacy right. ActorsActors are entities that require, or manage, the data. They are (i) data subjet (citizens) and (ii) data controller and processor (health institutions) -private and public entities.Social Norms are roles that define who is able to insert, update, and request data.They are: (i) data subject, whom is able to request data anytime, explanations, corrections, and validations, and (ii) data controller and processor are able to insert data, but not exclude any information. They must provide the data subject' answers. ProcessesProcesses are related to data controller and processor mechanisms applied to collect and process data.Nodal Points are gateways that connect data subject to data controller and data processor. Table 1 . COVID-19 GAF principles. The user-centric model was based on one of the GDPR legal basis. There is six legal bases in this regulation 5 and, even though the consent is one of them, it is one of the most important related to data privacy. The model highlights the actors and the consent requirements in favor of the data subject. The Collection requirement informs that the consent must be freely given. Purpose limitation tells that the data processor and the data controller must specify how circumstances the data will be used, and the Data Minimization defines the minimum data to attend the expected purpose. Information requires the action to inform who collects and processes the data in an intelligible form, using a straightforward language. Impartial Behaviour defines that no pre-ticked box, silence, or inactivity should constitute consent. Last but not least, Revocation means that the data subject should be able to revoke his/her consent as easy as was when it was requested. This model was proposed to enable further evolution, i.e., Entities, Requirements and the Legal Basis used can be modified to represent other regulations or focus on other concerns.In this sense, blockchain technology was proposed as an enabler that can provide process transparency, data traceability, and empower people to be aware of the use of their data and to assert their rights. Furthermore, the permissioned blockchain also enables data sharing customization without compromising this trustful environment.In general, blockchain governance refers to technical specifications and management. The consensus mechanisms specification, block size and block creation time are usually discussed by the developers' community in order to create different governance models. Such models are usually applied for a particular purpose, such as cryptocurrency, tokenization, digital identity, etc. However, Panian [26] defined governance as ""the processes, policies, standards, organizations and technologies required to manage and ensure the availability, accessibility, quality, consistency, auditability, and security of data in an organization"" and this concept may surpass the technical aspects (first layer) and drives to the society discussion, in particular, data regulations (second layer).In order to present a complete solution to the pandemic outbreak scenario, we chose the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain to support the instantiation of the developed governance model based on the user-centric model. Permissioned blockchains fit with all the presented concepts because it allows the creation of governance rules to manage entities and data. Figure 2 depicts the GAF definitions applied to this technology.Blockchain technology provides transparency, traceability, data immutability, and availability. Moreover, permissioned blockchain adds a role layer that allows data management between selected entities. In this sense, such technology can be used to store and share pandemic data, not only as a transparent link between data subjects, data controllers, and processors, but also as a data tracker and data provider to people or any other interested entity. Through permissioned blockchain, data can be audited and be used as a data source for research purposes. Self-enforcement smart contracts enhance trust between the data subject and the data controller and processor.From the user-centric design perspective, the smart contracts can be used to guarantee: (i) the consent collection by requesting this information by default, (ii) purpose limitation by ensuring that such purpose will not be changed, (iii) the historical information in regards who is asking for collection and processing, (iv) the creation of standards for silence, or inactivity, data subject behavior, and (v) the timestamp 6 of revocation date.Therefore, blockchain smart contracts play a vital role in this environment; they are responsible for roles assignment and can be used as a snapshot of activated norms in a specific moment. They are also crucial for feeding data on the blockchain. Figure  2 presents the permissioned blockchain architecture based on the GAF instantiation in the pandemic scenario. We based the architecture on the Hyperledger Fabric platform concepts from the blockchain technology perspective, as did by Alketbi, Nasir, and Talib [27] . The presented governance architecture was developed based on GAF principles:Actors. Represented by red boxes, they are: HealthInstitution (data controller and processor) and Citizen (data subject), that inherit Organization properties. The HealthIn- Figure 2 .

Represented by brown boxes, they are ExternalInterface and Chain, which interacts directly, or indirectly, with HealthInstitutions and Citizens. They are data access points; the former can apply graphical analysis, and the latter presents the raw data.Social Norms. Purple boxes represent social norms; they are Smart Contracts and DataPipeline. Both boxes set up and verify the rights to access and write data. Moreover, smart contracts allow citizens to check the data collected regarding the data minimization principle presented by LGPD.Processes. They are identified by the blue boxes, and they are represented by Transaction, Block, and ConsensusProtocol entities. These boxes manage data in order to check the primary attributes, such as timestamp and id, which are used to create the link between the blocks.Problem. This principle is represented by the LegalProse orange box, which is used to describe the scenario context in high abstraction level on the smart contract. The LegalProse also represents the purpose limitation principle foreseen in the LGPD, which means that data shall only be used to a specific purpose, previously informed and abided by the data subject, being prohibited further processing that is out of the declared scope.In this sense, the permissioned blockchain technology structured under the GAF governance allows the second layer data governance to deal with data accountability and trustworthy data sharing by requirements in pandemic situations. Through the permissioned blockchain, people can access data from the source and verify data integrity. According to the access rules agreement on the permissioned blockchain, the data available to public consult allows researchers and governments to provide fast response in a pandemic outbreak and enables new solutions based on the user's consent. Furthermore, unified governance will enable institutions to share data following previously agreed rules. The data provenance is available for citizens, researchers, government, and health institutions, which may improve the identification of data inconsistency worldwide by information comparison.This section aims to present the works related to contact-tracing applications, privacy management models, and blockchain technology application in the health environment.Contact tracing apps are also useful data sources for disease contamination tracking. The DP-3T initiative uses the Bluetooth signal to identify contaminated people or people that have been in touch with someone contaminated [28] . Such solution is controversial from both privacy and medical viewpoint. First, not only the infected person would be highlighted to the authorities that he/she is sick, but also people that had been in touch with him/her. Second, from the medical perspective, at least 60% of the population would have the app installed to be effective. Therefore, to preserve the user's privacy and guarantee the necessary transparency to get people's confidence to use this kind of app, all the data should be anonymized and decentralized. In this turn, the permissioned blockchain plays a significant role in this scenario.Panian [26] argues that companies and government organizations should define standards, policies, and processes for data management. The author presents the applicationcentric and process-centric models for data governance. However, the presented models do not present the concerns related to privacy and consent management required not only by the GDPR, but usually required in many other data regulations.The authors in [18] proposed a blockchain-based application for electronic medical records management to deal with heavy regulations in the health sector. The blockchain smart contracts allow data sharing in this private peer-to-peer network. Even though this solution gives the immutable log, distributed information, and Accountability, they did no association with any data regulations.As a result, the presented works showed essential concepts and applications regarding personal data collection and management. However, the junction of privacy management, governance model concepts, and the usage of blockchain technology application to provide a safe environment for data sharing has not been explored yet. Therefore, our proposal of second layer data governance for permissioned blockchain offer a promise of an environment for data sharing and privacy management.The pandemic scenario requires collaboration between citizens and public health institutions worldwide. In this sense, people must trust in the data-sharing ecosystem and their politics. The second layer data governance for permissioned blockchains aims to deliver such confidence to people feel free to give their consent. Thus, they can share their data to contribute to define the diagnosis and evaluate methods to contain further spread.In this paper, we proposed a new data governance for privacy management in the permissioned blockchain platforms. To do so, we used the COVID-19 outbreak scenario to apply the GAF principles to identify and define actors (data subject, controller, and processor), problems (LGPD rules), social norms, processes, and nodal points. Moreover, the LGPD rules guided our development towards compliance with data protection regulations. Such definitions were used to develop the user-centric model. This model aims to detail the concerns related to the usage of personal data maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.In order to apply the developed governance model, we added it as a second layer data governance in a permission blockchain technology using the Hyperledger Fabric as a platform. This technology promise to support the data subjects giving the tool to decide about sharing their data depending on the purpose limitation. Even though the permissioned blockchain is also promising to empower data subjects enabling the full control of data sharing settings, it should be deeply explored in regards to the right of rectification. As an immutable database, the rectification aspects are a big challenge as well as the right to revoke data access. These challenges are fundamental to respond to the privacy concerns and should be addressed carefully considering the available cryptography methods.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-22",10

This is a critical question given that in pandemic times almost all academic activities require internet access and all economic activities resulted affected (presented reductions) due to the pandemic (Chetty, Friedman, Hendren & Stepner, 2020) .In Colombia, data sets like those provided by the ICFES (Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education) have long comparisons over time about the academic achievement of students in all stages. Most of the studies over these data indicate that the covariables that most affect the academic performance (have a good score), according to Chica, Galvis, and Ramirez (2011) are socioeconomic status, parents scholarship, the number of hours in the school, school type (private or public) and gender; but there is little work on how technologies affect it.The current article aims to fill this gap. Using nationally representative samples of children in their final high school year from 2014 to 2019, this article addresses two related research questions:! Which municipalities have the most difficulty in implementing the remote academic continuity program?! What should be the municipalities' prioritization (in each state) for information technology programs investment?We decide to proceed using three classification algorithms and compare them to predict academic performance. Solving these questions will help decisionmakers focus on certain geographical areas to develop specific intervention programs to improve the learning experience and results of high school and middle school students.BACKGROUND. In this era of high internet connectivity, which brings positive and negative impacts in our lives, many facets are linked to its access; and education is not an exception. Since the early 2000s, it has been noticed (Pereira, Pleguezuelos, Meri, 2007; Greenhow, Robelia, Hughes, 2009 ) that there were necessary changes to take advantage of the online resources.Parents and teachers know the importance and necessity of computer usage and internet access in all stages of academic formation (Bassok, Latham, 2017) .In kindergarten students in the United States, Bassok, and Latham (2017) , found that computer access increases academic children skills. The results of Amorim, Jeon, Abel, Felisberto, Barbosa, and Martins (2020) , in Brazil, show that technologies, specifically using games, improves reading scores.In high school students, specifically in China, the relation between internet self-efficacy, internet accessibility, behavior, academic performance between others was investigated (Zhao, Lu, Huang & Wang, 2010; Penaranda, Aragon-Muriel, Micolta, 2014) . There is strong evidence that digital inequality exists on the internet, and students with internet access at home had a better academic performance. In the United States, Rickles, Heppen, Allensworth, Sorensen, and Walters (2018) , found no statistically significant differences in longer-term outcomes between students taking online and face-to-face courses; this could indicate that online courses have the same benefits in some populations (a majority of Hispanic and African American students).In college students, Junco and Cotten (2012) , and Sazili and Khafidhah (2017) found a negative correlation between academic performance and internet usage, and a weak relationship with computer ownership.In university students, Sushma, Draus, Goreva, Leone, and Caputo (2014) pointed out that time spent on the internet could be a measure of academic achievement under certain conditions, however, some online media could have a negative effect on university students (Junco, 2012; Asemah, Okpanachi & Edegoh, 2013) . According to Paulsen and Mccormick (2020) , student engagement is necessary to have positive benefits. In countries like Malaysia and Taiwan, the use of the internet is apparently a distractor. Indeed, the results of Xu, Wang, Peng, and Wu (2019) indicate that discipline plays a vital role in the academic success of undergraduate students; in particular, the results show that the use of Internet data could differentiate and predict student academic performance.Therefore, the evidence suggests that in any stage of learning, technology strongly affects academic performance across the world (Donald, Foehr, 2008) and it is most notorious in pandemic times since all economic activities were seriously affected (Chetty, Friedman, Hendren & Stepner, 2020) and internet access became a necessity (Chiou and Tucker, 2020) . Going deeper, it looks like there is a way to predict academic performance based on some covariables (Hellas et.al, 2018) , and technologies could be one of them.In Colombia there is an academic test provided by ICFES, proctors on standardized tests, called SABER11, that scores students in their final high school year, and also has self-reported socio-demographic information.Analyzing data from 2009, Chica, Galvis, and Ramirez (2011) found that high school graduates who own a computer are more likely to obtain a high grade on SABER11, although internet possession was not statistically significant.However, analyzing more recent data, internet access became an interest covariable (see Appendix). In particular, family-related variables are the best to predict academic performance (Garcia-Gonzalez, Skryta, 2019). The dataset from ICFES also includes information of undergraduate students, and an analysis of academic efficiency about these students shows that social covariables play an important role (Rojas 2019; Delahoz-Dominguez, Zuluaga, Fontalvo-Herrera, 2020).During pandemic times it is necessary to understand how the internet or computer access affects the score of SABER11 since that can offer a way to comprehend the effect of these technologies in each municipality and which are the best improvements according to each necessity. The actual existing evidence, while limited, does support the notion that internet/computer access strongly affects the academic performance of SABER11. The findings suggest that, as we notice in literature, technologies strongly affect academic performance. However, in this scenario, there are two covariables that need to be in consideration: rurality and belonging to an ethnic group. Then upgrades in technology could improve academic performance, but it is not enough: teachers, parents, and the social environment play an important role. There are necessary policies about technologies and, like Zhao, Lu, Huang, and Wang (2010) and Sazili and Khafidhah (2017) pointed out, about increasing learning skills in remote environments.Data. SABER11 tests have been modified during the last 20 years, we have chosen the period from 2014 onwards since it has the same standardized content, taking tests on 5 different subjects: critical reading, citizenship skill, English, written communication, and quantitative reasoning; score from 0 to 100. Their sum gives a global score from 0 to 500 (ICFES, 2020) . This is the independent variable that we consider in this study. This data also has socio-demographic information such as internet accessibility, computer, family income, habitability conditions, belonging to an ethnic group, among others. There are 8 municipalities that in this period did not take the SABER11 test, which are not included in this work. This data was aggregated by municipality into numerical covariables.Given that data about internet ownership is self-reported by students, we also decided to use the data reported by the Ministry of information technologies and communications MINTIC, about the total number of internet subscribers, the type of subscription and technology, indicators of internet reach by region, information on internet providers by demand and participation statistics (MINTIC, 2020).Additionally, there is relevant information by region reported by the DANE (National Administrative Department of Statistics), including accurate population values (2018 Census). With this information it is possible to know how rural a municipality is, to compare if this rurality is correlated with scores, internet access, and other important covariables (DANE, 2020).In the Appendix, we collect descriptive statistics from a consolidated data frame aggregate by municipalities. From this exploratory data analysis and since we need covariables that allows governmental investments, we conclude that the main numerical covariables to use in this study are:• CODE: numeric code that identifies the municipality,• YEAR: year of the proctored test,• INTERNET: percentage of students with self-reported internet,• COMPUTER: percentage of students with self-reported computers,• ETHNIC: percentage of students self-reported as belonging to an ethnic group,• SCHOOL: percentage of public schools,• GLOBAL_SCORE: student global score average on SABER11,• POPULATION: censused population during the test year,• CONNECTIVITY: access to the internet per 1000 inhabitants,• RURAL_INDEX: percentage of the population that lives in rural sectors.A first finding of the exploratory data analysis, see Appendix, is that if the family owns a computer, the average score is higher but RURAL INDEX decreases, coinciding with the findings of Chica, Galvis, and Ramirez (2011) .The results showed that scores have a mainly rural composition. Comparing this with geographical location (Figure 1) , we obtain that good scores are geographically centralized, there are many families without the internet, and it looks like these two variables are correlated.In this kind of study, the variables are commonly analyzed via correlation (Sazili & Khafidhah, 2017; Sushma et.al., 2014) . In Figure 2 Classification. There are many algorithms, from linear and logistic regressions to neural networks, to help identify and classify covariables/results. However, we wanted to choose interpretative models, this is, models that classify but also give us a statistically significant set of covariables. In the literature, it is common to use linear or logistic regression (Bassok & Latham, 2017 In particular, in the work of Xu, Wang, Peng, and Wu (2019), they have covariables as online duration, Internet traffic volume, connection frequency, among others. And using decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines predict academic performance from these features. In this work, we want to do something similar using another set of covariables with logistic regression, decision forest, and regression forest.Therefore, the initial model is a logistic regression given that this model shows statistically significant covariables and how they affect (positive or negative) the independent variable. Going deeper into the list of models, we found the random forests, which is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting on the training set.We construct a classification algorithm over the municipalities considering the initial set of covariables, which gives a list of municipalities at different vulnerability levels and a few actionable features on which governments (national, state, and/or municipal) can act upon. To use these algorithms, we need a risk threshold that we define for each year as the global score average minus k times the global score standard deviation (where k can be any real number between 0 and 2; for optimal purposes we choose k=1). Also, we split the data frame into training data (from 2014 to 2018) and validation data (2019), to decide about the accuracy. The main results of the logistic regression are:• Considering the p-value for each covariable (less than 0.05), we conclude that the relevant variables are INTERNET, COMPUTER, ETHNIC, CONNECTIVITY, and RURAL INDEX.• ETHNIC and INTERNET have positive coefficients which imply these covariables have a positive impact on the global score.• COMPUTER and RURAL INDEX have negative coefficients which imply these covariables have a negative impact on the global score.With this new set of covariables, we perform a regression random forest with depth m (with m>2; we choose m=3) and a classifier random forest of depth l.We compare the three models using the AUC, see Table 1 (Area under the curve ROC): The ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problems at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents a degree or measure of separability. It tells how much a model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0's as 0's and 1's as 1's. The choice of parameters k, m, l was made looking for AUC between 0.7 and 0.87 since lower AUC implies that the model is underfitting and bigger implies that it is overfitting. Notice that logistic regression, according to AUC, is the best classificatory up to these conditions. If we increase the depth to any random forest, we get greater AUC, Table 1 .but the complexity of the algorithm increases. Each one predicts over each municipality if it will be at risk or not, that is, if the average global score of the municipality is greater or not than the risk threshold. To compare and use at the same time the results of the three algorithms, we construct a vulnerability level called TOTAL_RISK as the sum of the predicted risk of these three models. This analysis allows to define 4 levels of vulnerability: In Figure 3 , we can see a map of Colombia with all levels of TOTAL_RISK.To determine how good the estimations are, we can compute a confusion matrix, which is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of the algorithm. Each column of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted vulnerability while each row represents the instances in actual risk, and determines if the algorithm is confusing classes. In this case, the first row of the matrix is (914, 21, 5, 8) and the second row is (83, 14, 9, 58) . For example, the last column (8, 58) implies that 66 municipalities are at serious vulnerability (8 of them are false positives, that is, 8 municipalities are labeled as 'at vulnerability' but they are not). We notice that the quantity of false positives and false negatives (83) is little; therefore, the predictions are accurate.Beyond classification. In Figure 3 , we also notice some interesting municipalities in the center of the country, in high vulnerability, contradicting the commonly believed that remote locations are always vulnerable. This implies that not necessarily being surrounded by no vulnerability affects completely this covariable.One of the findings was Coyaima in Tolima, in the center of the country. In Tolima, during the last years, the percentage of the population belonging to an ethnic group is near to 5%, and the percentage of rurality is around 50%, but These zones can be a reference to improve on their neighbors. Listing states with the count of municipalities in each vulnerability we found that Vaupés, Chocó, Guainía, and Amazonas are states that need serious intervention as soon as possible since almost 67% of its municipalities are in serious vulnerability.Running a Bonferroni to understand each vulnerability level, we notice that low and no vulnerability have significant differences in self-reported internet, computer ownership, belonging to an ethnic group, and connectivity. Low and medium vulnerability in connectivity; and medium and serious vulnerability in ethnic group and connectivity. Since connectivity and belonging to an ethnic group are common variables, in Table 2 , we analyze the average number of connections per 1000 habitants and percentage of students belonging to an ethnic group, in each vulnerability level, obtaining that municipalities at serious vulnerability have a high percentage of students belonging to an ethnic group, opposite to no vulnerability municipalities. With COVID isolation measures banning students from classrooms, most learning has moved online, but even those pupils who can successfully connect are likely to fall behind if not possessed of the self-direction and motivation needed for remote education. Moreover, research has shown that poorer students perform worse in online courses (Chetty, Friedman, Hendren & Stepner, 2020) than face-to-face ones.Our analysis found that the most relevant covariables related to an increased academic vulnerability in Colombia, related to technologies, are Connectivity per 1000 inhabitants (as a measure of reliable broadband internet access) andbelonging to an ethnic group (associated with low income). Amazonas, Vaupés, Guainía, and Chocó need serious intervention, given the high values shown for the vulnerability factors measured. Geographic centralization (associated with increased urbanization, as measured by the Rural Index), is also a strong predictor of better scores for students.We found some centralized municipalities with high vulnerability as Coyaima in Tolima and Altos del Rosario in Bolívar, surrounded by municipalities of zero vulnerability. In particular, these municipalities have low access to the internet and computer and high rurality and percentage of belonging to an ethnic group, showing an interesting feature of Colombia.According to Hartley and Bendixen (2010) , improving the academic results and reducing the large gap in academic achievement requires the interventions to focus on maintaining the students' interactions (among themselves and with their teachers), also learning skills in the students are necessary as selfregulatory skills, epistemological beliefs, motivation, self-efficacy, ability, physical challenges, and learning disabilities. For this scenario to be realized, a series of factors have to line up: schools need to have the resources to implement remote learning, students need to have access to computers and reliable internet connections, and parents need to have the ability, time, energy, and patience to turn into home-school instructors.A concerted effort between the state government and parents seems to be the most effective strategy. Complementary projects might include:• Optimizing accessible solutions to mobile devices given that students have some access to them.• Offering limited data plans (access granted only to academic sites, to avoid misuse).• Focused policies on the rural ethnic minorities, the communities with higher vulnerability.• Lending computers to families.• Delivering financial stimulus to the municipalities most at vulnerability, conditional on the improvement of academic results compared with the previous year.• Support to parents so they can step up as temporary teachers.The challenges are related to providing students at vulnerability the necessary tools for success, not only laptops and reliable broadband internet access but also to motivate parents to help their children succeed academically. Cundinamarca has good scores in almost every municipality, we assume that this happens because Bogotá (the country capital) is in this State.We now analyze the levels of vulnerability predicted by our algorithm, remember that the choice of the threshold was made to detect the municipalities most at risk. We found that 90% of municipalities in the country obtain no risk. This could be an indicator that, for future works, the threshold risk could be the average in every year. At low risk is 1%, in medium risk 3%, and in high risk 6%.As mentioned before, the municipalities in high vulnerability are mainly in remote locations, the percentage of computers across time is stable, the percentage of internet access has increased since 2017, but the percentage of students belonging to an ethnic group and rurality are high (near 70% ","Colombia","abstract","2020-10-14",10

The incidence (ratio between the number of cases and the number of individuals in the population) and mortality (ratio between the number of deaths and the number of individuals in the population) rate were, respectively, 2,433.4 and 71.9 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants. Moreover, the case fatality rate (CFR; ratio between the number of deaths and the number of cases in the population) was 3 [1] . In the same period, the total deaths by natural causes expected was 529,659 and the excess mortality rate (deaths) by natural causes was 118,406, thus, an increase of 22% in deaths by natural causes was observed by official government agencies [3] . Brazil has an annual increase in deaths by natural causes ~1,000 to 2,000 new deaths, mainly related to an aging population.Brazilian regions presented a rise in the percentage of excess deaths, with the lowest rates in the South region (5%) and the highest in the North region (48%). Regarding Brazilian states and the Federal District (FD), the lowest percentage of excess deaths was 2%, observed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.Furthermore, the highest percentage of excess deaths among states occurred in the state of Amazonas, which reached 74%. Curiously, both males and individuals over 60 years old demonstrated a higher excess death percentage, compared to deaths by natural causes expected for 2020.In this context, a data analysis was performed for the COVID-19 pandemic epidemiology and for the number of deaths in Brazil. The following markers were evaluated: COVID-19 cases with diagnoses by SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); deaths by COVID-19; CFR; incidence per 100,000 inhabitants; mortality per 100,000 inhabitants; excess mortality rate (deaths) by natural causes; deaths by natural causes expected according to previous years and excess mortality rate (%). The expected deaths by natural causes in 2020 were projected according to data collected from the Brazilian The main findings included: data for confirmed COVID-19 cases; deaths by COVID-19; CFR; incidence and mortality per 100,000 inhabitants; excess mortality rate (deaths) by natural causes; deaths by natural causes expected according to previous years and its percentage (excess deaths by natural causes per expected deaths by natural causes). These data are presented according to gender and age for Brazilian States and the FD and geographic regions ( Table 1) .A significant Spearman correlation coefficient (CC) was found between the excess mortality rate by natural causes (number of cases) and (i) number of COVID-19 cases (CC=0.765; P-value≤0.001); (ii) number of deaths by COVID-19 (CC=0.862; P-value≤0.001); (iii) CFR (CC=0.664; P-value≤0.001) and(iv) incidence per 1000,000 inhabitants for COVID-19 (CC=-0.530; P-value=0.004); as well as, excess deaths by natural causes per expected deaths by natural causes with the mortality per 100,000 inhabitants due COVID-19 (CC=0.464; P-value=0.015).Currently, monitoring of death indicators is a strategy recommended by the World Health Organization to assess the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [4] . However, the excess deaths should not be associated as a direct cause of the COVID-19 pandemic; even though, they might be indirectly associated to it, due to overload in health services, interruption of chronic disease treatments and patient's resistance to seek health assistance due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection.In our data, the high number of unexpected deaths by natural causes during the COVID-19 pandemic is evident. Perhaps our data represents under reporting by the Brazilian government for severe patients affected by COVID-19 due limitations to perform the SARS-CoV-2 screen by RT-PCR [5] . The Brazilian regions with the highest percentage of unexpected deaths by natural causes had the lowest availability for RT-PCR tests and intensive care units (ICUs) during the pandemic, mainly, in the North region [6] . In brief, Brazil should improve the COVID-19 diagnosis, implement better clinical policy guidelines by the government to treat patients with COVID-19 mainly for severe cases when the ICU beds and intubation are needed, improve the adherence to social distancing, improve awareness of the severity of the disease to residents and optimize the acquisition of drugs and personal protective equipment necessary for the management of COVID-19, mainly anesthetics and muscle relaxants that are lacking in the Brazilian market as well as other drugs such as Dexamethasone, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab that showed efficacy to treat patients with COVID-19 [7, 8, 9] . So what? As discussed in the Lancet editorial, in Brazil, the authors concluded: ""The challenge is ultimately political, requiring continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole to secure the right to health for all Brazilian people.""

SARS-CoV-2 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January, 30th 2020 [3] . The case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been estimated between 1.2 and 1.6% (7-9) with substantially higher ratios in those aged above 60 years [4] . In Argentina, the fatality rate for males was 2.1% (1,233 deaths) and for females, 1.5% (884 deaths). Males aged 70-79 years concentrated the highest proportion and represented 15.3% (324) of the confirmed deceased cases. The median time between the onset of symptoms and death was 11 days [3] ).As data become publicly available in terms of description, counting of cases, date and location across Argentina questions arose on how obtaining better explaining the national evolution of the pandemics. By July, 2020 appears the first reference in terms of aggregate national epidemics description [3] location, gender, epidemiology, for instance, but many more topics remains to be explored. Currently, no effective medical interventions or vaccines are available to prevent or to treat COVID-19. For this reason, non-pharmacological public health measures such as isolation, social distancing, and quarantine are the only effective ways to respond to the outbreak. Isolation refers to the separation of symptomatic patients whereas quarantine is the restriction of asymptomatic healthy people who have had contact with confirmed or suspected cases.The most prominent health policy of Argentina has been a long standing lockdown that began from March 19 th and still remains active in most of the country. How this measure affected, if any, the rate of contagion? We will present empirical evidence relating mobility (affected by the lockdown) and the rate of contagion blending epidemiological data with geo-located information of mobility.The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing countries worldwide to make consequential policy decisions with evolving and limited information. After China publicly released the information of the virus and epidemics, in the last weeks of February Italy registered the first deaths and applied the first deaths and ordered measures to monitor people who could be infected [5] . Two weeks later epidemics was out of control in the northern part of the country (especially Lombardy) and other 11 provinces. By March 14, the Spanish government declared the state of alarm given the increasing number of contagion and deaths but avoiding to suspend nonessential economic activities initially and then revoking this last measure two weeks later [6] . The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the interventions made by China authorities, including lockdown and social distancing, have significantly contributed to the containment of COVID-19 [3] .In Argentina, by March 15 the president Alberto Fernández jointly with the heads of the two most populated districts of the country (Buenos Aires Autonomous City -BAACand Buenos Aires province -BAP-, respectively) announced the suspension of education activity throughout the country, the closure of borders for all non-residents the suspension of activities and work license for riskier population over 60 years old, the cancellation of non-essential activities and any related crowd-activity until March 31 st . On March 13, the government of the province of Jujuy ordered suspension of any educational, sports, social, cultural and religious activity. On March 16 th , the government of the province of Tierra del Fuego ordered total quarantine. One day later, football was cancelled all across the country. By March, 20 th long-distance and regional bus services were suspended and inside Buenos Aires city circulation was restricted. The province of Mendoza also entered in quarantine and the Ministry of Economy created a maximum price policy for a basic basket of foods. By this time a particular focus was granted to the territories coded as Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (BAMA or Área Metropolitan de Buenos Aires in Spanish) that comprehends BAAC and 18 of its neighbor parties (departments) that belongs to the BAP. BAMA is the most populated area of the country (approximately 16.4 million inhabitants) and it is practically an almost continuous urbanized area.By then and because of the depending on the accounts of confirmed cases, diverse provinces in the country were adopting measures for suspending circulation inside its territories and in particular cities or departments. Government establishes a scale for lockdown phases from stricter to more relaxed (Table 1) . These phases ended up being an initial strict isolation phase, some distension in diverse services in the following months and continuous extensions from the initial strict isolation up to the present day. Table 1 presents the phases of lockdown applicable by the authorities. So far two main policies has been implemented called Preventive and Mandatory Social Lockdown (PMSL or Aislamiento Social Preventivo y Obligatorio in Spanish) and Mandatory and Preventive Social Distancing (MPSD for Distanciamiento Social Obligatorio y Preventivo in Spanish).In the period May 11-24 th President Fernández suspended strict lockdown state in whole country (phase 4) with the exception of BAMA that remains in phase 3. In the period of June 8-28 th 18 the president suspended quarantine in 18 provinces and they pass to the phase of social distancing while BAMA and five other urban areas remain in phase 4.By June 8 th the president signed a decree defining rules for MPSD that prevails to that date in 19 over 24 national districts. Four provinces had urban areas under strict quarantine and MPSD in the rest of their territory while BAMA remains in strict ASPO. This situation remains up to July 17 th . At last, by August 2020 Argentina achieved the longest lockdown in the World without apparently haven't reached a contagious peak. Even more, by August 21 st , Argentina surpasses Sweden in terms of total deaths comparing to a country that did not uses mobility restriction at all. One positive outcome of the prolonged lockdown is perhaps the low registered death rate. By the end of July 2020 the country accumulates 3,200 deaths approximately and 84 deaths per million of inhabitants, far behind Latin American countries such as Peru (651 deaths per million) or Chile (437). It is alleged that the longer lockdown allowed health systems to be prepared for the increasing number of positive infection but that is also an item for national discussion.Lockdown in the very short run operates drastically reducing mobility and then contagion [7] . Evidence for effectiveness for more than 3 weeks is hard to find. As mentioned, mobility is affected by local, provincial or national restrictions [8, 9, 10] . While containment is reported successful to a local or regional level [11] it is more difficult to observe such a result a greater scale. We will try to understand its implication national-wide considering geographical effects in diverse parts of the Argentina's territory. We must remark that lockdown is still running in the two main districts of Argentina and, by the end of August, it is not foreseeable in the short run how the government will manage its exit. It is important then to obtain evidence that lockdown deserves still be an option for dealing with the spread of the virus and, in case of easiness of that measure, how this affect contagion.The logical of this policy is that lockdown decrees should reduce mobility and the slowdown of mobility will reduce contagion. So, lockdown affects directly mobility and indirectly the rate of contagion. This reduction would slow down the rate of patients being derived to intensive care and, one of the critical bottleneck of the health system, the use of the scarce mechanical ventilation supply [12] . This way the lockdown would precious time, flattening the curve of contagion and reducing the input in a health system non-prepared for this specific scale of pandemics.For mobility analysis we rely on data from [13] . A simple panel data estimation of the effect of lockdown shows that residential mobility was the only that increase (in average of 2.58%) while parks (avg. -10.33%), transit stations (-5.21%), workplace (-7.9%), grocery and pharmacies (-7.41%), and retail & recreation (-8.82%) showed sharped reductions (see Supplementary Material for the estimation). Therefore lockdown decree and its latter extensions were effective in reducing mobility just as Figure 1 presents.Once taken into account this sequence of events we implement two dynamic modeling approaches: a fixed effects and a random effects panel data model. We will try to shed light on the relationship between mobility and rate of contagion controlled by relevant covariates among provinces. Fixed model will assume omitted variables are constantly correlated with the variables of the model while random effects models will estimate the effects of time-invariant variables, but the estimates may be biased because we are not controlling for omitted variables. However, this last aspect can be properly modelled [14] . We can include regional effects, for instance, by adding geographical referenced variables in our case. A fixed effect panel data model is also implement just for checking if omitted variables may play a result in the final analysis. Fixed effects models control for the effects of time-invariant variables with timeinvariant effects. We will present both models covering all possible results and interpretations.Data from [13] represents the change on mobility for users who have a mobile phone with Google account and GPS-tracking authorization representing the relative respect to a reference day measured as average value of the 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020 (prior to pandemics). They are represented categories on movements to residential locations, parks, transit stations, workplace, grocery and pharmacies, and retail business. Data was obtained for the 26 defined regions of the country: 23 provinces and three special regions (BAAC, BAMA and BPA without BAMA, BAAC is repeated in the BAMA definition but is often study as one unit). Reported cases were classified as confirmed, suspected, and discarded on the basis of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory diagnosis. We have data updated up to July, 29 th 2020 on suspected cases, confirmed cases of contagion, admittances to hospital, intensive cares, death, and many other variables from [15] .Then we define two variables for modeling lockdown. One binary variable represents the strict lockdown present at the beginning by the presidential decree of March, 19 th (variable ). The second is another binary variable that establishes almost in all provinces social distancing policy ( ). The time lines of activation for each region are summarized in a specific entry of [18] .China put several mitigation policies in place to suppress the spread of the epidemics [3] . In particular, confirmed cases were either put under quarantine in specialized hospital or put under a form self-quarantine at home but monitored by medical services. In a similar fashion, suspected cases were confined in monitored house arrest. These measures aimed at the removal of infectious individuals from the transmission process. These extreme measures lead to a subexponential growth in contagion [23] . Another measures such a repeated testing, contact tracing, pool testing, also proved to be effective in reducing other cases (specially many Asian countries [24] )We find evidence of different topics relative to an extensive lockdown currently operative en Argentina. Firstly, lockdown effectiveness was analyzed. Adopted measures can be divided in an initial strict implementation called mandatory isolation or lockdown and a later lesser strict variant called social distancing. One must recognizes that both measures focus on reducing the mobility and through that diminishing the spreading of the Covid-19. Panel data and Granger causality identify lagged patterns in mobility jointly with time and location effects associated to the rate of contagion. Abstracting from estimations and by observing data, lockdown seems to be effective in a short period after implantation but without scaled complementary measures this measure seems to be short-ranged. On the other hand, the economic sacrifice made by the whole economy seems disproportionate to the results even while these are no final yet [25] .We must now study these effects at a more local level (city, department) to obtain more insights on the connection between mobility and contagion. As no contact-tracing information datasets are publicly available yet we may explore sequential pattern of contagion for inferring where the contagion began, where it moved, and perhaps where it going to be.","Argentina","abstract","2020-10-06",10

The then 36-year old, was a member of the country's national assembly and had been elected to lead the legislature just 18 days prior. By law, as the leader of the national assembly, Guaidó had the right to fill the presidential vacancy. To date, almost 60 governments around the world have recognized him as the legitimate president of Venezuela, including the United States and most European and Latin American countries. However, Nicolás Maduro has remained in political and military control of the country and is recognized as president by countries such as Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Cuba, and Turkey. Despite the evolving situation and long historical roots, the political and humanitarian crisis can be traced back to 6 years before Guaidó's declaration and has resulted in extended health, economic, and geopolitical ramifications.In April 2013, Nicolás Maduro was elected president with a 1.6% margin after his mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez, died in office. Tanking oil prices in 2014 hit the Venezuelan economy hard after years of mismanagement, corruption, and international sanctions. Living standards fell as Venezuelans struggled with inflation, budget deficits, food and medicine shortages, and deteriorating living conditions. Political and personal freedoms likewise suffered, as protests became illegal and press were unable to report freely. Routine human rights abuses such as torture, beatings, and arbitrary detentions were common [1, 2] . Without heeding to calls for reforms, Maduro focused instead on consolidating political power. In the 2018 presidential election, the government barred many opposition candidates from running, which resulted in Maduro's highly controversial and disputed re-election. Venezuela's opposition rejected the election results, eventually leading to Guaidó's ascension and the current political crisis. Maduro has rewarded allies, including the military, with income from state industries and other illicit activities. In 2019 alone the economy contracted by 35% and inflation rose to an astounding 9585%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that hyperinflation will continue in 2020 and an economic contraction of some 15% could occur [3] . Venezuela's poverty rate rose to levels unmatched across Latin America. The 2019-20 National Survey of Living Conditions (ENCOVI), conducted by researchers at Andres Bello Catholic University and published in July 2020, indicates 64.8% of households experienced ""multidimensional poverty"" in 2019, taking into account income and access to education and public services [4] . This number jumps to 96% when looking only at income levels. Venezuela's main source of government revenue, crude exports, fell to their lowest levels in 75 years in 2019.As the political crisis continues, a humanitarian crisis has already unfolded. According to a report by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCR), ""[s] tate authorities' ineffective measures or inaction to address the acute deterioration of health care facilities and equipment, the unavailability of medicines, in particular for patients with chronic diseases, and the outbreak of diseases that had been eradicated, led to violations of the right to an adequate standard of health of a large number of people throughout the country [2] ."" In response to the health emergency, multiple countries, the UN, and eventually even the Vatican offered humanitarian aid to Venezuela. However, Maduro's government refused to acknowledge the existence of a humanitarian crisis and accept international assistance, responding in violence in February 2019 when Maduro government forces killed seven people and prevented aid from entering the country from Colombia. The regime later only accepted limited assistance from the Red Cross and the World Health Organization (WHO).The health crisis compounded the severity of the situation. The Maduro regime refused to release information required to analyze the consequences of the health crisis, including weekly epidemiology bulletins [5] . The Venezuelan Ministry of Health did not publish official reports or release data from 2016 to 2019, making it difficult to understand and address the health issues in the country. The collapse of the Venezuelan health care system is drastic, as 14% of intensive care units are unable to operate and 79% of facilities analyzed have no water [5] . In late March, the Venezuela Government released an inventory of hospital beds, reporting 23,762 [6] ; a severe overestimation as most healthcare centers are functioning at limited or zero capacity due to inadequate infrastructure, personnel, medicines and consumable [7] . Numerous publications, including the National Survey of Venezuelan Hospitals and the Venezuelan Defence for Epidemiology Network, report an estimated 720 critical care beds for the country [8, 9] . Difficulty to acquire medicines, equipment, and supplies continues to impede the ability of Venezuela's health system to provide care. The Venezuelan Medical Federation (Federación Médica Venezolana) reports that at least 30,000 medical professionals have left the country over the last decade, contributing to a shortage of specialists [10] . All aspects of public health have been impacted by the collapse of the health system; interrupted campaigns and low coverage led to the emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria and measles while lags in testing and treatment caused an increase in HIV cases with the highest prevalence in the country's second-largest indigenous populations, the Warao [11] [12] [13] [14] . By 2018, 500,000 cases of malaria were reported in the country, even though Venezuela had previously eradicated the disease in 1961 [15] .Most of the people who have fled Venezuela have remained within Latin America. As of December 2019, 1.63 million Venezuelan migrants reside in Colombia, 864,000 in Peru, 385,00 in Ecuador, 371,000 in Chile, 224,000 in Brazil, 145,000 in Argentina, and at least 10, 000 in other countries ( Fig. 1 ) [16] . The influx of migrants from Venezuela into neighboring Latin American countries had been better received than previously witnessed with the influx of Syrian refugees into Europe.The deteriorating Venezuelan health care system and its negative repercussions for population health have become a regional issue as Venezuelans move to neighboring countries. Increased maternal mortality rates, the reemergence of infectious diseases that had previously been controlled or even eliminated, and the return of vaccine-preventable diseases are all of concern not only for migrants on the migratory path but for the healthcare systems of host countries as well [12, 17] . Neighboring countries, specifically Colombia and Brazil, have become important sources of accurate information and health data of the Venezuelans in the absence of reporting from within Venezuela. As an indicator of the added health stress neighboring countries have taken on, the number of Venezuelans seeking medical care at Colombia's North Santander border area rose from 182 in 2015 to 5094 in 2018. More than 8000 pregnant Venezuelan women were expected to give birth in Colombia [18] . These numbers provide a partial and staggering picture of the inadequate health conditions in Venezuela.Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and lack of access to timely and appropriate medical services have increased migrant vulnerabilities to infectious diseases and exacerbated transmission and spread. For example, Venezuela's malaria outbreak may have crossed international borders. According to a PAHO/WHO epidemiological report, there has been an increase in malaria cases across the Americas, with Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela all reporting increases in 2017 [19] . Of the imported malaria cases reported in 2016, 78% of the cases in Brazil and 81% of the cases in Colombia are suspected to have originated in Venezuela, with cases in Guyana also associated with the malaria outbreak in Venezuela [20] . Across these countries, the high influx of Venezuelan migrants needing treatment has led to medicine shortages and reduced both resident and migrant access to treatment [15] . It is important to note that while this is not an indication that the migrants were carrying diseases across borders, poorly managed migration has the potential to result in disease outbreaks.The breakdown in Venezuela's health system has also led to an increased incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases among migrant Venezuelans. Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador all reported cases of measles with links to Venezuelan nationals [20] . The measles outbreak in the Brazilian state of Roraima, which reported 84 cases in 2018 with 69% occurring in Venezuelan migrants, spread to the states Amazonas, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande de Sol, Rondônia, São Paulo, and Pará, each with cases having identical lineages to the cases reported in Venezuela [21] . Furthermore, Colombia reported two cases of diphtheria from unvaccinated Venezuelan children, and in 2017 Brazil reported a case of diphtheria in a Venezuelan migrant [20] . In 2018, due to the accelerated flow of Venezuelans and reports of serious violations of their rights, the Federal Government of Brazil created ""Operation Welcome"", which is a humanitarian task force supported by UN agencies and dozens of civil society entities and coordinated by the Brazilian Army [22] . The cities of Boa Vista and Pacaraima of the State of Roraima receive the largest number of Venezuelans in occupations organized by the migrants themselves or shelters managed by Operation Welcome [23] . In these two cities, the state government decreed a public health emergency in February 2019, but despite the transfers made to mitigate the abrupt increase in demand, the infrastructure and the available material and human resources were and still are deficient [24] .To further compound the crisis, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is putting additional strain on health systems worldwide and certainly in Venezuela and its neighbors. Latin America comprises less than 10% of the global population yet accounts for nearly one-third of reported COVID-19 deaths. The fallout could push an additional 16 million residents of the region into extreme poverty, according to a report from the United Nations [25] . According to a survey that interviewed 390 Venezuelans, the majority living in Colombia, Chile, Peru and Ecuador, 9 out of 10 Venezuelans lost income due to the pandemic; 2 out of 3 need some help to ensure food; 1 in 4 have no money for purchases and depend solely on donations; also 1 in 4 is on the street, causing a 20% drop in remittances from abroad to Venezuela [26] . Venezuelans in Brazil suffer together with the entire population due to the disastrous response to the pandemic, marked by denialism and political conflict [27] . On August 16, 2020, Brazil documented 3.2 million cases and 106,000 deaths [28] . It should be noted that there are no national data on cases and deaths of migrants. In the State of Roraima, on August 14, 2020, 5.7% of COVID-19 deaths were Venezuelans [29] . Poor living conditions, difficulty accessing the health service, the language barrier, and the lack of employment are some of the many factors that place refugees and other migrants in COVID-19 risk groups in Brazil [30] . With a lack of documents and a closure of public offices, migrants are unable to obtain emergency aid the federal government created during the pandemic [31] . However, field hospitals, like the one created by the Operation Welcome in Boa Vista, are in service specifically for Venezuelan migrants [32] .Public health experts warn that COVID-19 transmission rates and mortality will be higher in Venezuela compared to other countries in the Americas. Even with the government-imposed quarantine, food and water shortages force people to leave their homes. The government continues to threaten physicians and health care workers with retaliation if they speak out publicly about COVID-19 cases [33] . There are valid concerns that state-imposed quarantines and lock-downs will also stem public protests against the regime. In June, Maduro's government and the Guaidó opposition signed an agreement to coordinate COVID-19 relief efforts through PAHO. The deal, signed by Health Minister Carlos Alvarado, Dr. Julio Castro, who leads the National Assembly's commission on the coronavirus, and PAHO will use government funds frozen by the U.S. and European governments to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), medicines and medical equipment [34] . However, the situation is still very dire. As of August 10, 2020, PAHO has reported 241,811 cases and 4556 deaths in Venezuela compared to government reporting of 10,000 cases and 96 deaths [35] . Colombia closed its border with Venezuela on March 14, while Brazil did so partially on March 17 and allows only trucks carrying merchandise to cross in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. According to official data from June 15, 2020, the Brazilian government has sent 35,567 of 264,865 Venezuelans who requested migratory regularization (refuge or residence) to inland cities [36] . Given the intensity of this flow, the most serious consequence of COVID-19 for Venezuelans was the closure of Brazilian borders. Since the beginning of the pandemic, successive federal rules discriminate specifically against Venezuelan citizens and ban their entry into Brazilian territory even when they have a residence permit or a Brazilian spouse or children. The rules also establish the possibility of summary deportation, which is illegal under Brazilian law that guarantees migrants the right to a fair trial and the principle of due legal process [37] . The intention of the Brazilian government to take advantage of the health crisis to promote legislation that would limit migration is evident. The rise of the extreme right in 2018 to the presidency has brought a coarsening of policies and rhetoric toward human rights not seen since the end of the dictatorial military regime in 1985 [38] .In response to international and domestic movement restrictions put into place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the lack of job opportunities in host countries, stigmatization, xenophobia, and violence, refugees have begun to return to Venezuela. Recent reports indicate that many refugees, including a recent influx of 60,000, are causing bottlenecks at border-control points leading to illegal crossings from Colombia. Venezuelans are met by security forces and mandatory quarantines lacking proper infection prevention control, PPE, and social distancing, creating a perfect environment for virus introduction and community transmission. Maduro has placed blame on his own people, noting these refugees returning home are responsible for recent surges in cases [39] . A senior member of Maduro's party, Lisandro Cabello, was quoted saying ""Any person who violates the immigration system and enters the country [illegally] will be considered a biological weapon [39] ."" Recent reports from outlets including the Human Rights Watch indicate that Venezuelan security forces are using the pandemic as cover to wage a ""full force"" campaign against dissenters, dozens of journalists, health professionals, human rights lawyers and government opponents have been arbitrarily detained and prosecuted since the COVID-19 state of emergency. As international organizations work to assist with the voluntary return, it is clear that the Maduro government's priority is political survival and not the pandemic, creating an even stronger call for a coordinated response, accurate and timely data, and considerations for the welfare of Venezuelan migrants.The geopolitical tensions surrounding Venezuelan political affairs only exacerbate the migrant crisis. While Latin American neighboring countries have taken on the responsibility of accepting Venezuelan migrants and refugees, the international community's political strategies have deepened the core of the problem. The pandemic found regionalism at a time of decline. In the past, the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) was able to adopt rules on residency that made it possible to regularize the situation of tens of thousands of migrants in the region [40] . The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was considered a model in regional health diplomacy [41] . Currently, however, there is a total lack of coordination between the countries of the region resulting, among other factors, from the rise of conservative governments in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador not in favor of regional integration [42] . The political isolation of Venezuela also intensified as MERCOSUR suspended the country for violation of its democratic clause [43] . Countries that left UNASUR created the Forum for the Progress and Development of South America (PROSUR) [44] . These organizations have so far confined themselves to mere statements about the situation of Venezuelan migrants and have organized only modest initiatives relating to the pandemic in general [45] . PAHO is one of the few regional organizations involved as a partner in concrete initiatives related to the health of Venezuelan migrants and in Venezuela itself, which include distribution of tests, PPE, and training courses [46] .International economic sanctions placed on the Maduro regime to increase economic pressure and a decline in oil production are far outweighed by years of dismantling the private industrial sector and government corruption. Russia and China, which support the Maduro government, vetoed a resolution at the UN Security Council that called for free elections in February 2019. While the Lima Group, a 14-country bloc in the Americas, has repeatedly called for a peaceful transition of power, the Maduro government has been able to hold onto political and military control.Efforts of cooperation to foster a coordinated response to the Venezuelan humanitarian process culminated in the ""Quito Process"" in September 2018, which formulated a road map and multilateral initiative of many Latin American countries that aims to help integrate Venezuelan migrants into host countries through coordinating domestic policies. The Quito Process has so far resulted in two declarations and one action plan in which governments in the region have sought to meet the most critical needs of Venezuelan migrant populations in the different countries. In addition, the UNHCR and International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan in December 2018, which is a first of its kind operational and coordination strategy and an appeal for $738 million in funding to support over two million Venezuelans in the region and half a million people in host communities.With Venezuela's political system remaining in deadlock, her people continue to suffer. The international divide hampers decision-making at multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where divided recognition of the Venezuelan government blocks the country from receiving desperately needed loans. The international tensions politicize aid to the Venezuelan people who are in dire need of humanitarian aid due to food shortages and lack of adequate healthcare access. The lack of cooperation tempers data collection and information gathering on the ground. Disparate data only paint an incomplete picture and could miss crucial needs of Venezuelans both inside and outside of Venezuela. As the crisis continues, Venezuelans continue to migrate to neighboring Latin American countries, carrying with them the ramifications of their broken health system. Migration is a social determinant of health primarily because the conditions of the migratory path determine the health of migrants and, as discussed, the exportation of infectious diseases from Venezuelans across international borders has had serious repercussions on the health systems of the neighboring countries. The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic globally further illustrates the need for data collection and information sharing.In his seven years in power, Mr. Maduro has overseen the collapse of Venezuela's health care system, the destruction of the national economy, and a marked increase in the country's international isolation. Venezuela now ranks second, only to Syria, for countries with forcibly displaced populations. The difficulty in handling the situation does not mean that countries should close their borders to migrant populations. Rather, it is imperative that cross-border political cooperation organizes for a joint investigation and response to migrant health needs. Coordinated access to migrants could provide information to deepen international response. These mechanisms and health structures can be a combination of official and unofficial; to provide participation of public institutions for the stability of these structures for long-term solutions and to activate community-based institutions to better understand the perceived needs of the people. Furthermore, health services must adapt to become more inclusive of migrant's health needs, as well-established structures that can overcome the financial barriers to health care access. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, the existing paradigms on how to deal with crises in and around Venezuela continue to change. With cooperation and joint efforts between countries, along with support rather than conflict from the international community, migrant health and border health challenges resulting from the Venezuelan migrant crisis can be better controlled.","Venezuela","abstract","2020-10-22",10

Since then daily cases have increased rapidly worldwide, so as to be labeled as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . Currently, the COVID-19 has infected more than 24 million people and has caused 827,246 deaths (August 28 th , 2020). South America has become the new center of the pandemic, where Peru is one of the countries with the highest number of cases and deaths in the world, despite having imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus [2] .As a response measure in the health area in Peru, many hospitals have chosen to cancel outpatient appointments, but have sought ways to maintain ongoing care such as through telemedicine (remote medical service). Telemedicine has demonstrated since its application in different areas that it increases the quality of life, and decreases costs and patient visits without compromising communication between the physician and patient; but above all, in this current situation, it contributes to the decrease in transmission of COVID-19 [3] .AUNA, a network of private hospitals and medical centers located in various regions of Peru, has taken special care in the use of telemedicine in cancer patients during this pandemic because they are part of the population with more risk of getting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and having a worse prognosis since their own disease and anti-cancer therapy causes an immunosuppressive state [4, 5] .Based on our experience at AUNA, our aim in this review is to show the importance of telemedicine in cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.The first case of COVID-19 in Peru was reported on March 6 th , 2020; and on March 11 th , the country entered an emergency state. One day later, the quarantine was established and it was prolonged until June 30 th , 2020. The basic reproductive number (R0) estimated in Peru was 2.973 in the first 20 days of the pandemic [6] .Despite the early and strict measures given by the government (Peru was the first country in Latin America in declaring a general lockdown), socio-economic reality led to high contagion rates. Currently, Peru is one of the countries with more positive cases for COVID-19 with 639,435 patients and 28,607 deaths reported by the Ministry of Health of Peru (by August 29 th , 2020) [7] . Nowadays, there is a saturation of the health system complicated by high rates of contagion and mortality in the health personnel, where the Peruvian Medical College J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reports 3,602 physicians infected with COVID-19 and 153 physician deaths due to this disease [8] .The complex situation of the Peruvian health system conducted to delaying of the diagnosis and treatment of hundreds of thousands of patients with several pathologies, including cancer, due to the healthcare being limited to medical emergencies in the first months of the pandemic. On the other hand, fear of patients becoming infected led to avoiding their visit to hospitals by another reason than COVID-19, causing excess of deaths in more than 65,000Peruvians between March and August [7] .In the oncology area, services have been gradually and partially opened to prevent patients from getting SARS-CoV-2 but without affecting their care. To fulfill this objective, we are following international guidelines: We maximize remote outpatient follow-up and treatment, hypofractionate treatments whenever possible, delay possible treatments and procedures in relation to risk/benefit, switch to subcutaneous or oral therapies rather than intravenous ones when possible, and evaluate patients to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection even if suspicion is minimal. Furthermore, in the area of research, new clinical trials have been postponed, while some ongoing clinical trials have had to be discontinued or we have had to become more flexible in the protocols [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Cancer patients are more susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia than the general population, as they are immunosuppressed due to their disease itself and anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, they may also have an increased immune response to infection secondary due to immunomodulatory drugs [4, 5] .Several studies suggest that cancer patients may have an increased risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe complications, thus also having a higher mortality rate compared to the general population [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In addition, these patients have an increased risk of interactions of the drugs used to treat COVID-19 (drugs that do not have sufficient scientific support and that must be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f used with caution) with anticancer treatments, which makes their management more difficult. For example, combination checkpoint therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4) is associated with higher rate for immune-related toxicities (e.g.infection [19, 20] .In a retrospective study that included 28 patients. They reported a total of 1,023 deaths within confirmed cases, of which 6 (1.5%) of them had cancer; therefore, the crude mortality rate of these patients (5.6%) was higher than the general population (2.3%) [15] . Similarly, a WHO-China Joint Mission report on COVID-19 published on February 28, 2020, identified that there is higher mortality among cancer patients (7.6%) compared to patients without comorbidity (1.4 %) [16] .In contrast, a prospective observational study that included 800 cancer patients and positives for COVID-19 using RT-PCR during the period from March 18 to April 26, 2020, found no evidence that cancer treatment given within 4 weeks before confirmed COVID-19 has been contributed significantly to worsening the disease or increasing the risk of mortality. Mortality by COVID-19 in cancer patients seems to have been caused by their age, gender, and comorbidities [17] .Likewise, in a cohort study that included data from 928 patients with active or previous cancer and COVID-19 from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for those who were added baseline data between March 17 and April 16, 2020; reported that 121 (13%) patients died within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. Factors associated with its mortality were increasing age, male sex, former smoker, active cancer, comorbidities, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥2, and treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin versus treatment with neither. Ethnicity, obesity, cancer type, type of anti-cancer therapy, and any surgery in the 4 weeks before COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated with mortality [18] .Recent studies have shown that human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are key proteins for the entry of SARS-Cov-2 into cells [21] . Dai et al. [22] found through gene expression profiling analysis that liver hepatocellular carcinoma has a high expression of ACE2, which would increase its risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but was related to a good prognosis. Likewise, Fu et al. [23] also found a high expression of ACE2 in liver cancer as well as kidney cancer correlated with increased survival rate, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both.On the other hand, a meta-analysis that included 205 cancer patients (from 6 studies) with COVID-19 found that individuals with lung and colorectal cancer are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] . These cancers were the most frequent in the study (24.7% and 20.5%, respectively) and their expression of the mRNA of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was higher than other types of cancer. However, more studies are needed to associate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels with susceptibility, progression, and severity of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, as it depends on various factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and comorbidity [25] .Although these results are still preliminary and require validation with larger cohorts, they suggest that cancer patients are a significant at-risk population of getting SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe complications (Table 1 ). In addition, it must be taken into account that the risk of these patients of getting SARS-CoV-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 increases due to the fact that they are mostly older than 60 years, with one or more comorbidities, and they are frequently exposed through their visits to the hospital to receive their therapies, monitoring, or preventive and supportive care. The mortality rate from COVID-19 is higher in cancer patients than in the general population. Abbreviations: ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine had already proven to be an option in the care of patients with high satisfaction rates for both patients and health personnel [26, 27] . Generally, telemedicine was used to improve access J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to remote or less accessible areas for medical care, while in oncology it enabled the provision of remote clinical oncology services using interactive telecommunication tools [28] .In the context of the pandemic, telemedicine has become a viable and safe alternative that increases access to patient care, avoids delays in treatment, decreases the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients as well as healthcare providers, and at the same time reduces the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) which is limited during present times [29, 30] . In oncology, it allows monitoring of chemotherapy adverse events, palliative management, evaluation of disease symptoms, and emotional support. Some healthcare providers have implemented telehealth as part of ongoing healthcare for cancer patients. Some applications of telemedicine in oncology are teleconsultation, telepathology, tele-education, tele-tumor board (multidisciplinary case discussions). Even an important part in the beginning of treatment, such as discussion of the treatment plan with patients, has been carried out virtually and to the satisfaction of the patient and the treating physicians [9] .On the other hand, telehealth accelerates the training of oncologists. In a study carried out in two Peruvian hospitals, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation therapists were trained in stereotactic body radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery by 15 specialists from nine American institutions. The participants had an improvement in their knowledge and a significant increase in their skills [31] .Once the patients begins the active management of their disease, follow-up visits to the treatment started, management of their comorbidities, palliative consultations, resolution of questions, evaluation by subspecialties and second opinions, requesting laboratory tests or images can be made through telehealth.In-person care is reserved for cases that require a physical examination in person, or as part of the planning of continuous patient care. It is important to highlight that telemedicine also presents challenges such as limited access to telemedicine platforms, insufficient internet access, limited resolution of images, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lack of training in technological tools, difficulties for physical examination of the patient, theoretical education with little hospital training, and reimbursement agreements with the payer or managers of insurance funds [28, 29, 32, 33] .The medical services that we were able to carry out through telehealth involve clinical visits, palliative care, nurse visits, pharmacy, and multidisciplinary services ( Table 2) . We describe below the workflow for teleconsultation. In general terms, the teleconsultation workflow at AUNA is as follows:Contact patients days before their appointment to confirm it. Patients should receive instructions before the teleconsultation on how to use the virtual platform, how to handle the problems, the scope of the teleconsultation, and the standard questionnaires on the important points to ask or resolve with the doctor during the consultation. In addition, patients must consent to virtual medical care and must be informed of their rights and duties during the teleconsultation. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fAs part of our quality policies, we conducted a survey to know the satisfaction with telemedicine in patients who attended to Oncosalud-AUNA. Variables evaluated included satisfaction with the telehealth, satisfaction with the physician, the process of request new appointments, satisfaction with the information provided, satisfaction with the drug delivery, and satisfaction with the connectivity. We analyzed 273 patients surveyed between April and May 2020.In general, there was a high level of satisfaction in all evaluated variables, where higher satisfaction was obtained from the interaction with the physicians.These surveys also show to us that the drug delivery (conducted by an external provider) is an important process to improve to achieve a better experience with the service provided (Figure 1 ).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Despite the fact that the benefits of telemedicine have already been demonstrated for many years, this pandemic has forced us to adapt to it at an impressive speed, becoming it the ""front line"" of the battle against COVID -19.Telemedicine reduces the burden on hospitals, which are mainly dealing with COVID-19 cases; furthermore, it protects patients, health staff, and reduces the impact of lack of medical resources.It has been a great challenge for the health area, since they have had to rapidly develop virtual care skills, such as performing physical exams without contact, and without losing empathy towards the patient or compromising the quality of their care. Our initial results in cancer patients as well as other studies demonstrate its effectiveness, satisfaction, and value in promoting social distancing. The current circumstances have accelerated the use of telemedicine reflecting that this method is the present, especially during periods of outbreaks of infectious diseases.Unfortunately, our experience does not reflect the current situation of the public health system in Peru who attends patients with scarce or null internet connectivity, or with very limited access to electronic devices with the appropriate software. These patients are now unprotected and dealing with a collapsed health system and a falling economy. The Peruvian government should consider telemedicine a priority and make more efforts to expand its access to all patients. ","Peru","abstract","2020-10-22",10

By July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had infected over 16 million people worldwide and killed more than 645,000 individuals. A better understanding of the immunogenicity and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans is thus urgently needed as a basis for the development of new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (2).The coronaviral genome encodes a relatively small number of proteins, classified as either structural or non-structural. Among structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) are the major ones, while the envelope protein (E) and membrane protein (M) are smaller structural components (3, 4) . The spike (S) protein is arrayed on the surface of the virus particles, giving the characteristic 'crown' appearance (5) . The S protein comprises two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit consists of an amino-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (5, 6) . The RBD binds to ACE2 as its host cell target receptor, which allows virus entry (5, 7) . Various reports related to SARS-CoV-2 suggest a correlation between neutralizing antibodies and the number of specific T cells to viral particles (8) . Some vaccine candidates have been shown to protect from infection in laboratory animals models (9) . Most vaccine studies so far have focused on antibody responses generated against the S protein, the most exposed protein of SARS-CoV-2 (10, 11) . However, antibody responses are not detectable in all infected patients, especially those with less severe forms of COVID-19 (12) . Previous studies with SARS-CoV-1 have also shown that memory B cell responses tend to be short-lived after infection (13) . In contrast, memory T cell responses can persist for many years (14) , and in mice, these protect against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-1 (13) . Additionally, the spike protein has several hotspots for mutations (15) , whereas the nucleocapsid gene is more stable and has acquired fewer mutations to date (16) .In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein that is involved in viral pathogenesis (4, 17) . The nucleocapsid is the most abundant protein in coronaviruses, is highly immunogenic, and its amino acid sequence is largely conserved as previously reported (4) . Therefore, this protein has advantages as a candidate for vaccine development (4, 18) . Previous studies on SARS-CoV-1 reported N protein epitopes as capable of eliciting massive production of antibodies in infected subjects (4) . T cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 are in some cases shown to last up to 11 years thus representing a valid alternative for the design of vaccines (4, 19) . Monkeys vaccinated with an adenovirus vectored SARS-CoV-1 vaccine were shown to have consistent T cell responses to the N protein (20) . Similarly in MERS the nucleocapsid has been examined as a potential vaccine candidate (21, 22) . Recall responses of T cells reacting with peptides of SARS-COV-2 N protein have been demonstrated in both SARS-CoV-1 recovered patients, 17 years after exposure, and those with no history of SARS-CoV-1 exposure (23, 24) . Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV-2 have also demonstrated antibodies directed to the N protein (2) .Studies involving computer simulations for the identification of the epitopes recognized by antibodies and T cells are central to immunological applications such as drug design and vaccine development. Bioinformatics tools offer the advantage, in addition to speed and biosafety, of being unbiased by peptide selection. Approaches which use overlapping peptides, spaced other than single amino acid displacement, may exclude the key peptides. There have been several reports of bioinformatics analyses of SARS-CoV-2 using a variety of platforms (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . Herein, we applied bioinformatics analysis to determine the antigenic potential of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and these peptides were compared to other coronaviruses that infect humans. As other studies have suggested that prior exposure to less virulent human coronaviruses may confer some protection (24, (30) (31) (32) , we focused particularly on identifying conserved motifs which potentially could elicit cross-reacting T cell responses through shared T cell exposed peptides. The epitope mapping and comparison of potential cross-reactive epitopes presented in this study may provide an opportunity for the development of new vaccines and immunodiagnostic tools. Finally, the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 apparently from bats is an indicator that similar betacoronaviruses could emerge in the future. It is therefore of interest to determine if there are potential antigens that are conserved and could cross protect against future zoonotic coronaviruses. B cell linear epitope probability and MHC binding affinity were determined for all sequential peptides with a single amino acid displacement, using an updated version of methods previously described (33, 34) . Briefly, in lieu of representing peptides as simple alphabetic sequences, multiple physicochemical properties of each amino acid are transformed to mathematical vectors by principal component analysis. Using a training set of known MHC binding reactions, B cell epitope binding and cathepsin cleavage reactions, neural networks are used to derive predictive equations applicable to any peptide. Predictions are made for 70 MHC I alleles and 65 MHC II alleles. To estimate population behavior comprising multiple MHC alleles with varying affinities for any peptide, the LN ic50 binding data estimates were transformed and standardized to a zero mean unit variance within each protein using a Johnson Sb distribution (35) . To compute a permuted average across human alleles, the highest predicted binding affinity at each peptide position was determined for every possible haplotype pairing and averaged; this was computed using predicted binding for 31 MHC IA, 31 MHC IB, and 24 DRB alleles as previously demonstrated (36) . Predictions of the probability of cathepsin cleavage at each dimer were similarly derived by training on known cleavage reactions (34) . These predictive methods have been experimentally validated in proteins of multiple origins (34, (37) (38) (39) (40) .Several protein sequences were analyzed by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool specific for protein sequences (BLASTp) (41) . Multiple sequence alignments were prepared with Clustal Omega (multiple sequence alignment) and manually edited in pyBoxShade 3.21 (https://github.com/mdbaron42/pyBoxshade). We selected statistically significant matches to calculate a similarity tree for related coronaviruses. The epitopes were mapped based on the amino acid physical-chemical properties and location at possible areas of cross-reactivity and antigenbinding by using an in-house software (data not shown). Analysis of the protein secondary structure prediction and annotation was carried out with PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench (http:// bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) (42, 43) . The epitopes were identified, built in Chimera v.1.13.1. We also used Chimera to prepare images and calculate RMSD between sequences (44) . Distance between residues were measured by using wizard measurement tool from PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC.).All sequential T cell exposed motif patterns were extracted from each protein and ranked as previously described for each of three recognition patterns of amino acids which engage T cell receptors (33, 36, 45) . These T cell exposed recognition patterns comprise the amino acids not hidden in pocket positions. These are positions~~~4,5,6,7,8~within a MHC I binding 9-mer and~2,3,~5~7,8~or −1~~,3,~5~7,8~relative to the 9-mer core of a MHC II binding 15-mer.The nucleocapsid of SARS-Cov-2 exhibits both strong B and T cell epitopes distributed across the whole protein. Figure 1 provides an overview map of both probable linear B cell epitopes and regions of predicted high affinity MHC binding for multiple alleles. Corresponding sequences of predicted antigenicity are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Figure 1 , we predicted multiple high probability B cell linear epitopes. A 9mer peptide was scored as ""high probability"" if they were predicted to be in the top 25% of probability of being in a B cell epitope for the protein as a whole. The most dominant of these lies between 176 and 206 in the sequence SRGGSQASSRS SSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS. Additional high probability B cell epitopes are indicated in Table 1 . When analyzed by the same immunoinformatic approach alongside all structural proteins in the virion, the nucleocapsid B cell epitope at 176-206 stands out as dominant with respect to the epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (data not shown). Figure 1 , in which consideration is given to the predicted binding of multiple common human MHC I and MHC II alleles, indicates three regions of predicted high MHC II binding and four regions of high affinity MHC I binding for multiple alleles, which comprise the top 10% highest predicted affinity for the protein. These are shown in Table 1 . However, as the examples shown in Figure 2 underscore, there are differences in MHC allele-specific binding. The differences are more marked for MHC I, where binding is often restricted to one or two sequential 9-mers, whereas the broader sequences identified for MHC II, tend to span more alleles. For example, adjacent to the dominant B cell epitope we see that a DRB1_1501 has a stronger predicted MHC II binding which could indicate more T cell help than is the case for an individual of DRB1_0101. Furthermore, when consideration is given to probable cathepsin cleavage, not all peptides may actually be presented. However, we appreciate that cathepsins play a major role in generating peptides to be presented for the vacuolar pathway (endolysosomes and phagosomes) as demonstrate by Shen et al. (46) . Therefore, cathepsins are primarily involved in TAP-independent MHC class I crosspresentation. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that individuals of different immunogenetics would be expected to show differing responses. The proximity of MHC binding sequences to the B cell epitopes at 76-82 and 176-206 amino acids indicates these epitopes may also receive strong epitope specific T cell help.We next compared the epitope map of SARS-COV-2 N protein to that of other coronaviruses known to have infected humans.Here, we focused on the T cell exposed motifs, which indicate where potential T cell cross-reactivity may occur. A single T-cell receptor engages only with the few amino acids of a bound peptide MHC that are protruding from a MHC histotope, together with contact points within the histotope. We refer to this pentamer motif as the T cell exposed motif (36) . Figure 3 shows the patterns of T cell exposed motif sharing between human alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 with betacoronaviruses HKU1, OC43, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. While some of the T cell exposed motifs are conserved, the flanking regions of these peptides, comprising the groove exposed motif, differ. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 that traverses the human alpha and beta coronaviruses, except for MERS. In MERS substitution of Leu>Thr at the SARS-CoV-2 position 113 (equivalent to the MERS 103 position) removes the conservation of the T cell exposed motifs with SARS-CoV-2. The region in which the conserved motifs occur is also predicted to have high affinity binding for multiple MHC I and II alleles. Here, we used 70 human MHC I and 65 MHC II alleles for our analysis of permuted binding that represents about 85% of human population. The T cell motif sharing is further extended within the betacoronaviruses. The conserved T cell exposed motifs are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . When the N proteins of the six viruses sharing most motifs are aligned at the peptide comprising the most conserved T cell exposed MHC I motif~~F YYLG~(in SARS-CoV-2 position 107), the commonality of epitope patterns is evident (Figure 4) . FIGURE 3 | T cell exposed motifs conserved across coronaviruses. The cell plots show in gray where there are T cell exposed motifs shared between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses, as shown in the X axis. The number of shared motifs indicated in the Y axis counts. The most highly conserved motifs are also shown in Supplementary Table 1 .Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 587615The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein consists of two folded domains (NTD and CTD) linked by an unstructured region (47) . In more details the N protein includes the following domains: serine-glycine-arginine-rich domain (SGRD), N-terminal domain (NTD), serine-rich domain (SRD), C-terminal domain (CTD) as described in Figure 5A (48, 49) . Our alignment has revealed that despite the conservation of some motifs, the N protein from various different coronaviruses often exhibit different properties, due primarily to their otherwise low sequence homology (˜50%) (Supplementary Figure 1) . The structural similarity appears to be at the whole folded level with its five-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet sandwiched between loops (or short 3-10 helix) on the outside ( Figure 5B) . Several nucleocapsid NTD domains are similar in topology and surface electrostatic profiles as observed. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the structures coordinates is 0.867 Å over superimposed C atoms. The most dramatic differences can be observed in loops L1 (between b2 and b3, residues 96 to 104) and L3 (residues 119 to 128). Other authors also observed that strands b2 and b3 are connected by a long flexible loop composed of amino acid residues 96 to 104 protruding out of the core (50, 51) . We could identify and observe ( Figure 5B ) the structure of the highly conserved twelve-residue peptide corresponding to the region 107 RWYFYYLGTGPY 118 (YP_009724397.2). This peptide is located at the NTD of N protein, close to the L1 loop and has a conserved and important epitope located in an exposed beta-strand, with two exposed tyrosines ( Figure 4B1 ). Both tyrosines (Y111 and Y112) have been proposed to be involved in RNA recognition, stacking with consecutive nucleotide bases. The NTD of the N protein from the selected coronavirus was compared to assess the similarity level existing between the conserved protein sequences of the human coronaviruses (4). Structural mapping of the epitopes shown in Figure 5B1 into 3D models of the NTD N protein (6M3M, 5NK4, 4J3K, 1SSK, 4UD1 entries of PDB database) reveals a conserved epitope predicted in a highly immunogenic peptide exposed to the extracellular environment, likely, to other host immune system components. We were also able to demonstrate that the predicted B cell epitope in SARS-CoV-2 at 176 SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS 206 is inside the unstructured region inside of SGRD domain of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure 1 , sequence colored in blue). Unfortunately, this region could not be mapped in the 3D model due to the lack of a structure model for the whole protein length.COVID-19 pandemic challenged the world to speed up research for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite massive effort and many thousands of studies published within the first 8 months of the pandemic, our understanding of how humans respond to SARS-CoV-2 is still quite limited (2) . Worldwide efforts are currently underway to map the determinants of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach to map B and T cells epitopes in the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is being studied as the leading target antigen in vaccine development (52, 53) . However, a better understanding of viral entry is required to avoid further complications with the vaccine immune response, similar to those observed with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Env protein candidate vaccine (53, 54) . Additionally, the spike protein has several hotspots for mutations (15) . In contrast, the nucleocapsid gene is more conserved and stable, with fewer mutations over time (16) . Nucleocapsid proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and are expressed abundantly during infection (53, 55) . High levels of IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid have been detected in sera from SARS patients (53, 56) , and the N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in a vaccine setting (20, 53) . In this study, our bioinformatics analysis was able to identify epitopes conserved in several human coronavirus N proteins. The results show that there are several overlapping conserved peptides. When combined, our analysis could thus predict not only high binding individual 9-mer peptides, but also highly exposed structural regions of immunological peptides, which could have potential importance as candidates for vaccines. Our findings are consistent with the strong antigenicity previously noted in SARS N protein and prior reports for SARS-CoV-2 (24) . The predicted B cell epitopes we identify are consistent with the strong IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to the N protein in an acutely infected patient documented by Dahlke et al. using peptide arrays (2) and with the observations of Grifoni et al. (31) . We identified a strong immunodominant B cell epitope SRGGS QASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS between 176 and 206 amino acids in the nucleocapsid protein sequence. With appropriate T cell help this epitope may be a good target for neutralizing antibodies and long-lived immune response.Additionally, we performed an in-silico survey of the major T cell epitope sequences of the nucleocapsid protein from coronaviruses known to have infected humans (4) . The demonstration of conserved T cell exposed motifs between the N protein of multiple human coronaviruses may account for the reported recall of T cell responses over decades, even in the absence of SARS-CoV-1 exposure (23, 57) . We found a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein positions 102-110 and equivalent positions in the human alpha and beta coronaviruses, with the exception of MERS. Comparison of the individual allele predicted binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 peptides shows differences in responses based on individual genetics. The conserved T cell exposed motifs shared between coronaviruses are each contextualized in different flanking regions comprising pocket positions that will bind with differing affinities. These complexities underscore the nuanced differences in individual patient's responses. As much of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease appears linked to the immune and inflammatory response, it is important to keep in mind that individual differences in clinical response may be rooted in the patients MHC alleles as well as in presence of the preexisting cognate T cell clones, which may have been primed by different peptides. We also address the potential T cell epitopes by a complementary structural bioinformatics method, which was able to assess the conservation of these epitopes across different human coronaviruses. We explored the fact that 89.74% of amino acid sequence of the N protein of SARS-CoV-1 is similar to SARS-CoV-2, with high similar 3D structures demonstrated by homology modeling, and biophysical feature comparison (58) . The relevant amino acids are close to a highly dynamic loop, which is important for the protein primary biological function as the scaffolding agent for the viral genomic stability (59) .The role and diversity of the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was reviewed by Altmann and Boyton (60) . There have been multiple efforts to map epitopes in the viral proteome, using both bioinformatics and ex vivo approaches. While most of these have prioritized the spike protein, several epitopes in the N protein have been reported. Mateus et al. identify CD4+ T cell allelespecific epitopes encompassed in the sequences we identify from positions 213-238 to 293-320 as binding multiple MHC II alleles (30) . Most notably, our findings parallel those of Le Bert et al. (24) who demonstrated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to peptides that overlap the multiallelic binding regions we predicted. In particular, patients who were not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 had CD4+ T cells responsive to N101-120, which comprises the most conserved T cell exposed motifs (Supplementary Table 1 ).The existence of broadly conserved T cell exposed motifs in the N protein indicates that, even while peptide context is different, there may be potential to develop a vaccine which offers protection across multiple coronaviruses. This was addressed for MERS by Shi et al. (21) . Among the epitopes they identified, there are several CD8+ T cell peptides in homologous positions to those we have predicted in SARS-CoV-2, although as noted the T cell exposed motifs conserved in SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and the other human coronaviruses do differ from MERS. Yang et al. also proposed a nucleocapsid based vaccine for SARS-CoV-1 (61) .In summary, the use of available information related to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes associated with bioinformatics predictions points to specific regions of viral nucleocapsid that are targets to human immune responses (25) . We understand that lack of biological confirmation of identified peptides may limit the impact of our discovery. However, testing the antigenicity of these B and T cell epitopes will be the next step on our research program. The observation that some T cell epitopes are highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses is critical. Vaccines that target human immune responses toward these conserved epitopes could generate immunity that is cross-protective across alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses (25) . This would be an advantage given the potential of future novel coronavirus emergence.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.

Occasionally, the emergence of new respiratory viruses causes epidemics or pandemics (Sloots et al. 2008) , since several of them have neuroinvasive capacities (Desforges et al. 2019) , although rarely associated with isolated central nervous system (CNS) infection, except during outbreaks (Bookstaver et al. 2017 ).The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 , which is clinically characterized by fever, myalgia, diarrhea, and respiratory illness (Huang et al. 2020; Mao et al. 2020) , has been associated with neurological syndromes, such as meningoencephalitis, ischemic stroke, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (Helms et al. 2020; Moriguchi et al. 2020; Oxley et al. 2020; Parsons et al. 2020; Poyiadji et al. 2020; Toscano et al. 2020 ).Possible mechanisms implicated in these neurological conditions are neuronal injury associated with direct virus infection, hyperinflammation syndrome associated with cytokines storm, a para-or postinfectious inflammatory disease, an immune-mediated disease, or a secondary process due to severe effects of a systemic disorder (sepsis, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, hypercoagulability, critical illness) (Gris et al. 2020; Mehta et al. 2020b; Zubair et al. 2020) . Several biomarkers for COVID-19 severity have been identified in blood, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6, and ferritin (Ciaccio and Agnello 2020) , but less evidences are available for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.In this study, we report the analysis of the CSF of 58 consecutive patients with distinct neurological conditions associated with COVID-19, including acute inflammatory disorders, highlighting the relationship of neurological severity with inflammatory CSF patterns and the levels of biomarkers of neuronal death, total Tau protein and neurofilament light chain (NfL).This study represents a case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted between April and June 2020 in reference hospitals in the cities of Rio de Janeiro (Hospital Federal dos Servidores do Estado and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas) and Niterói (Complexo Hospitalar Niterói), Brazil, that presented with neurological manifestations (n=60). All patients included had COVID-19 confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Patients were submitted to lumbar puncture, and CSF was immediately processed for determining cell counts, total protein, and glucose levels. CSF samples were also aliquoted and stored at -80°C for further use.CSF was investigated for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Biomanguinhos (E+P1) RT-qPCR kit (FIOCRUZ, Brazil) and the XGEN Master Brazil) , and also evaluated by PCR for other neuropathogens, including arboviruses (Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses), human herpesviruses (HSV-1/2, VZV, EBV, CMV and HHV-6) and those detected by the XGEN Viral Meningitis Panel (Mobius, Brazil) or the FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel (bioMérieux, Brazil). Two patients had the CSF positive for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, one for herpes simplex virus and another for Cryptococcus sp., and therefore were excluded from the study.The detection of oligoclonal bands (OCB) in the CSF was performed by isoelectric focusing on the comparison between paired CSF and serum samples, as described elsewhere (Andersson et al. 1994) .OCB patterns were defined as: type 1, no OCB in CSF and serum; type 2, oligoclonal IgG bands only in CSF; type 3, OCB in CSF and serum with additional bands in CSF; type 4, identical OCB in CSF and serum; and type 5, monoclonal bands in CSF and serum. Types 2 and 3 indicate intrathecal IgG synthesis, type 4shows a systemic, ongoing inflammatory process, and type 5 a systemic paraproteinemia.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine the CSF concentration of total Tau protein (Human Tau Total ELISA kit, Invitrogen, Austria) and NfL (Human NEFL ELISA kit, FineTest, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions.The analysis was performed with data from 58 patients using GraphPad Prism v.5 and R software v.3.6.1. Descriptive statistics included the frequency of categorical variables and summary measures of quantitative variables: mean, median, interquartile range (IQR). Patients were distributed into four clinical groups to overcome the small number of cases: (1) headache; (2) encephalopathy; (3) inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), which included ADEM, encephalitis, meningitis, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica; and (4) GBS. Chi-square analysis was applied to estimate the differences in sex, intracranial opening pressure, pleocytosis, and increased CSF total protein levels between these groups. Differences in the frequency of qualitative variables between two groups were determined by Fisher's exact test. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normal distribution of quantitative data. Comparative analysis of data with normal distribution was performed using ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons and non-parametric variables were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis and posthoc analysis was done with Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, where indicated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated to determine associations between variables. P value was considered significant at 0.05. The contribution of qualitative and quantitative parameters, including age, sex, evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), CSF cell counts, total protein, glucose, total Tau and NfL levels in explaining neurological outcomes was evaluated by factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) using the FactoMineR package for R software.Enrolled individuals had a mean age of 51.6 ± 18.0 years, and this population was composed by 33 women (56.9%) and 25 men (43.1%) ( Table 1) . Encephalopathy was the most frequent clinical condition, representing 41.4% (n=24) of the cases, followed by refractory headache (n=14; 24.1%), GBS (n=6; 10.3%), meningoencephalitis (n=4; 6.9%), and myelitis (n=3; 5.2%). ADEM, encephalitis, and meningitis accounted for 3.5% (n=2) of the cases, and neuromyelitis optica was described in only one patient (1.7%). Seven out of 58 individuals showed CVD in brain MRI (12.1%), six with intracranial hemorrhage and one with a transient ischemic attack, and in five of them, encephalopathy was also diagnosed.Among patients who developed GBS (n=6), two had a clinical picture compatible with Miller-Fisher syndrome.Patients with encephalopathy were older than the other clinical groups, with a mean age of 61.0 ± 17.6 years ( Table 1) . Patients with COVID-19 and distinct neurological outcomes also presented differences in the distribution of cases according to sex (Table 1) . Females were more frequent among patients with headache and IND, in a proportion 3.7 times higher, while men were twice more frequent in the group with encephalopathy. In turn, no difference according to sex was observed among patients with GBS (Table 1) .Data about intracranial pressure (ICP) was available for 52 individuals. No difference was observed in ICP median values between the four groups with distinct patterns of neurological manifestations, as shown in Table 1 . In most cases, ICP ranged between normal and slightly elevated values. However, one-third of patients showed high ICP (≥ 25 mmH2O), although this characteristic was not associated with a specific neurological picture (Table 1) . Two patients with ICP ≥ 30 mmH2O, one with ADEM and another with persistent headache as the main neurological condition, had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in CSF. However, no significant changes were present in their CSF findings.Conversely, cases of IND were associated with pleocytosis, reflecting the elevated CSF cell counts compared to the other groups (Table 1) . These patients showed a median of 16 leukocytes/mm 3 (IQR: 2-57 cells/mm 3 ), predominantly constituted by mononuclear cells (> 80%), and those with meningoencephalitis (n=4) and meningitis (n=2) accounted for the highest cell counts, ranging from 8 to 396 cells/mm 3 .None of the patients presented CSF glucose levels < 40 mg/dL and no difference was seen between groups (Table 1) . Increased protein levels (> 45 mg/dL) were detected in 7.1% of the patients with headache, 29.2% and 35.7% of individuals with encephalopathy and IND, respectively, and in half of patients with GBS (Table 1) . Although a moderate difference was observed in median total protein levels in CSF (Table 1, p=0.037) , particularly between patients with IND and headache, this was ruled out after correction for multiple comparisons (Figure 1a , Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction, p=0.066).Quantification of CSF total Tau protein and NfL was used to determine the extension of neuronal injury.No difference was observed in their concentration between groups (Table 1) . However, patients with IND showed distinct degrees of neuronal damage, as illustrated by the broad variation in NfL levels, ranging from 740 to 500,000 pg/mL (Figure 1b) . Analysis of this group according to low and high NfL levels, using the median concentration in this group as a cut-off, demonstrated that no specific condition was associated with high NfL levels in the CSF. Instead, high NfL levels among these patients were associated with intracranial hypertension (Fisher's exact test, p=0.015). All patients with relatively low NfL concentration showed ICP ≤ 20 mmH2O, whereas 4 in 5 patients with high NfL levels and available ICP data presented with intracranial hypertension (ICP ≥ 25 mmH2O).Correlation analysis showed that increased CSF cell counts were associated with higher NfL levels in patients with headache (Figure 2a, r=0.647; p=0.012) . In the group with encephalopathy, increased CSF total protein levels were followed by higher levels of total Tau protein (r=0.414; p=0.044), and NfL (Figures 3b and 3c) .The local B-cell response accompanying CNS inflammation was evaluated by investigating oligoclonal bands (OCB) in 38 of 58 patients. Most patients (n=31; 81.6%) had no OCB in CSF and serum (type 1), four individuals (10.5%) showed a type 4 pattern, with identical OCB in CSF and serum, and three (7.9%) were identified with a type 2 pattern, with OCB restricted to the CSF, indicating intrathecal IgG synthesis. All six patients with GBS had no OCB in CSF or serum (type 1), and patients with OCB type 2 and 4 patterns were not restricted to a specific clinical picture. Patients with intrathecal IgG synthesis had normal CSF findings, including normal ICP, CSF cell counts, protein, and glucose levels. This group was composed by one patient with encephalopathy, who presented a cerebrovascular accident, one with refractory headache and another with myelitis. The group of four patients showing evidence of systemic immune activation (OCB type 4) was constituted by two patients with encephalopathy, one with headache and another with myelitis. They also exhibited normal CSF cell counts, protein, and glucose levels, except for a patient, who had intracranial hypertension (ICP = 26 mmH2O), increased CSF glucose levels (123 mg/dL) and high concentration of Tau (1684 pg/mL) and NfL (2889 pg/mL).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f DISCUSSION As of July 31, 2020, more than 17 million cases of COVID-19 were confirmed worldwide (Dong et al. 2020 ). Hence, the spectrum of neurological diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is expanding, including ADEM (Parsons et al. 2020; Zanin et al. 2020 Individuals with encephalopathy and those with an inflammatory nervous system syndrome had the most distinct profiles. Encephalopathy is characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction, which typically manifests with altered consciousness, and may be followed by seizures, headache, or pyramidal signs.Among patients with encephalopathy, elevated CSF total protein positively correlated with total Tau levels, a biomarker for death of cortical non-myelinated neurons (Trojanowski et al. 1989 ). This was likely associated with the increased frequency of CVD, which has been shown in COVID-19 Mao et al. 2020) , or other events leading to encephalopathy, which can originate from hypoxia, sepsis, CNS inflammation, or even from the inability of the body to maintain normal brain activity following multiple organ dysfunction. In our study, encephalopathy was more frequent among the elderly and men. In a recent review, encephalopathy in COVID-19 was shown to be more common among individuals with more than 50 years of age (Garg et al. 2020) , which corroborates our data.Patients with COVID-19 and IND comprised a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, such as encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, ADEM, myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica. The shared inflammatory origin of these manifestations and the involvement of distinct CNS structures (brain, meninges, spinal cord) leads to a great diversity in CSF profiles. Pleocytosis with predominant mononuclear cells was frequent, particularly in cases with meningeal involvement. Also, a mild increase in total protein concentration and high NfL levels, which is a biomarker for injury of myelinated axons (Khalil et al. 2018 ), were present mainly in cases with intracranial hypertension, as a sign of an active and exacerbated inflammatory process.Other aspects of ADEM associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in addition to CSF findings indicate possible dynamics of neurological disease development in COVID-19. ADEM is usually associated with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pleocytosis but OCB are infrequent (Scolding 2001) . A case of ADEM with normal CSF cell counts and protein levels, mild glucose elevation, with neurological presentation preceding mild respiratory symptoms was recently described (Abdi et al. 2020) . Here, one case of ADEM was also associated with normal CSF findings but with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, although close to the limit of detection of the RT-qPCR. Four days after COVID-19 symptoms, this patient presented with acute confusion state, dysarthria, and intracranial hypertension. Brain MRI findings disclosed diffuse, hyperintense lesions both in the deep hemispheric and periventricular white matter (Figure 4) . High Tau and NfL levels corroborated with CNS lesions. This patient was treated with hypertonic saline and methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for five days and discharged after 17 days with complete recovery.ADEM is an immune-mediated demyelinating monophasic disorder that affects the brain and occasionally the spinal cord typically arising between 2-4 weeks after viral infections or immunizations (Jacob and Weinshenker 2008; Gray and Gorelick 2016) . Thus, the temporal relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of ADEM seems to be shorter than the classical picture described for other viral infections. Another patient with ADEM in our study presented a mild increase in CSF cell counts and total protein, and elevated Tau and NfL concentration, compatible with demyelination.Although ADEM is more common among pediatric patients, especially under ten years of age, it can occur at any age (Tenembaum et al. 2007 ). However, cases of ADEM associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to date, including two in this study, have been described in adults (Abdi et al. 2020; Demirci Otluoglu et al. 2020; Parsons et al. 2020; Zanin et al. 2020 ). This discrepancy may reflect the fact that children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild-to-moderate illness (Mehta et al. 2020a; Rajapakse and Dixit 2020) .CSF studies are essential to elucidate the etiology of myelitis. The most common viral agents of acute myelitis are human herpesviruses and enteroviruses (Jacob and Weinshenker 2008) , and CSF analysis usually shows mononuclear pleocytosis and total protein elevation; OCB may be detected (Jacob and Weinshenker 2008) , although they are absent in most cases (Scolding 2001) . In our study, two of the three cases of SARS-CoV-2 associated myelitis presented OCB in CSF. In one case, identical OCB patterns were seen between CSF and serum (type 4), while the other showed intrathecal IgG production (type 2).conditions with CNS involvement, respectively, as part of a disease (Haertle et al. 2014 ). In addition to myelitis, OCB were seen in the CSF of two patients with encephalopathy, one with hemorrhagic CVD, and two cases of refractory headache. Although these CSF findings suggest the participation of immunemediated processes in the resulting neurological damage, more data are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these events.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, few cases of GBS, an acute immune-mediated neurological disorder, were associated with infection by human coronaviruses (Kim et al. 2017; Sharma et al. 2019) . In twothirds of cases, GBS is triggered by a preceding infection, frequently respiratory or gastrointestinal (Wakerley and Yuki 2013) . Cases of GBS have been described in COVID-19, with symptoms starting at a median of seven days after respiratory or systemic illness (Ellul et al. 2020 ). However, atypical cases have been reported, such as a patient with normal CSF cell counts and high protein levels, presenting with tetraplegia. However, fever and respiratory symptoms developed only seven days after GBS onset . Therefore, CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 may occur in parallel or independently of acute respiratory involvement. GBS presentation seems to overlap with infection, suggesting that GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection follows a para-infectious rather than a post-infectious syndrome, as previously described for Zika virus (Araujo et al. 2016; Brasil et al. 2016 ).Human coronaviruses have been associated with neurological complications, and their presence in brain tissue was shown for HCoV-229E and OC43 strains in autopsy samples (Arbour et al. 2000) , and more recently for SARS-CoV-2 as well (Puelles et al. 2020) . The olfactory route has been clearly shown as the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43 in susceptible mice, in which neurons infected in the periphery actively transport virus particles using the axonal transport machinery (Desforges et al. 2014; Dubé et al. 2018) , and it is the suggested equivalent pathway in humans. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages olfactory sensory neurons of hamsters (Zhang et al. 2020a) , and can also infect human neural progenitor cells and brain organoids (Zhang et al. 2020b ) strongly supports this hypothesis. In the present study, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in only two of 58 cases (3.4%). Previously, we have described that patients with COVID-19 and neurological alterations have undetectable or extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the CSF (Espíndola et al. 2020). Thus, although human coronaviruses are known for their neurological tropism, detecting their genomic RNA in CSF seems difficult. This is in line with findings showing that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in approximately one-third (8 out of 22) of brain autopsy tissue samples, with lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per cell than lungs and pharynx tissues (Puelles et al. 2020) . Expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is also distinct between human organs. ACE2 is highly expressed in airway epithelia, kidney cells, small intestine, and lung parenchyma (Zubair et al. 2020) , and not surprisingly, this correlates with high viral loads demonstrated in some of these tissues (Puelles et al. 2020 ). In the CNS, ACE2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and it is concentrated in the substantia nigra, ventricles, middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and the olfactory bulb, although at lower levels in comparison with lungs . These findings in addition to the spontaneous recovery of neurological alterations described in most of cases J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of COVID-19 in the literature support the idea of transient and/or limited SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in the CNS. Although our study presented limitations, such as the small sample size, our data indicate that rather than direct damage promoted by SARS-CoV-2 replication into the CNS, neurological injury is likely a result of misdirected immune responses either associated with autoimmunity or systemic inflammation in response to limited viral replication.Overall, patients with COVID-19 displaying neurological manifestations presented a great diversity of CSF profiles, even within the same neurological condition. Our findings are consistent with a possible contribution of viral infection on triggering the infiltration of immune cells into the CNS and the stimulation of host inflammatory responses involved in subsequent CNS injury, shown by raised levels of total Tau and NfL proteins. However, more data on this matter are pivotal to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to neurological damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection.This work was supported by the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ).This study was approved by the Brazilian National Committee of Ethics in Research (CAAE: 30611720.6.0000.5262), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The development of reliable laboratory diagnosis for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became mandatory to identify, isolate, and provide optimized care for patients early on [1] . On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared that the novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) outbreak was a global pandemic [2] and the establishment of standardized RT-qPCR protocols for respiratory secretions testing, as well as sharing of specimens, data, and information became critical [3] .Two of the most popular RT-qPCR protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 were: (a) the assay originally proposed by the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology [4] , and then endorsed by the World Health Organization [5] ; (b) the assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [6] . The Charité protocol targets RNA sequences of E, RdRP, and N genes. The E gene assay is used as a screening tool because it detects all viruses from the Sarbecovirus subgenus (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and related bat viruses) and then the RdRP gene assay is used as a confirmatory testing (specific to SARS-CoV-2). The N gene assay (also specific to SARS-CoV-2) can eventually be analyzed as an additional confirmatory assay [7] . The CDC protocol is comprised of three N gene assays (N1, N2, and N3), and all of them allow the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 [8] . An additional primer/probe set for detecting human RNase P gene (RPP30) is included to check for the presence of human nucleic acids in the specimen [7] .Validation of these protocols is considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high-throughput automated format because false positive or false negative results can negatively impact not only the individual patient but also can have a broad public health impact [9] . During a pandemic, automated solutions for molecular diagnostics can help handle large numbers of samples intrinsic to the situation and quickly clear or confirm suspected cases [10] . So, we decided to use the Flow Flex Solution (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Pleasanton, CA, USA) to perform the validation. This solution allowed us to test 93 samples and 3 controls in four hours and a half.Here, we investigate the analytical performance of these two interim RT-qPCR protocols (Charité and CDC) for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. In addition, we present the stepwise evolution of the assay as positive samples were obtained in the daily routine and the test results database was analyzed.Sixty nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from healthy volunteers using Rayon swab (n = 30) or cotton swabs (n = 30) and placed into cobas ® PCR Media tubes (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. Basel, Switzerland) containing 4.3 mL of guanidine hydrochloride (<40%). Guanidine hydrochloride virtually inactivates all pathogens that may be present in the sample, preserves all nucleic acid of the specimen and protects the operator from contamination during sample manipulation [11] [12] [13] [14] . Guanidine hydrochloride also guarantees the stability of the contrived samples, allowing us to introduce synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA into authentic nasopharyngeal specimens making the testing primary sample as real as possible. Before being processed, samples were vortexed, briefly spun, and the collection swab was removed from inside the tube and discarded by an operator protected by a laminar flow cabinet. Samples were then allocated into the Flow Flex Solution and the primary sample handling (PSH) transferred 200 µL of the primary tube content to an extraction cartridge.Nucleic acids were extracted from 200 µL of the primary sample (present in the extraction cartridge) using the Flow Flex Solution associated MagNA Pure 96 Instrument and MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (protocol Viral NA Universal version 4.0) with elution in 100 µL of elution buffer.SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay names adopted by Charité and the CDC were maintained to avoid mistakes: E, RdRP, N, N1, N2, and N3. Primers and probes sequences can be found in Table 1 (Charité) and Table 2 (CDC). Table 3 describes the primers and probes for RPP30, which check for the presence of human nucleic acid in the samples and our Artificial External ""process"" Control (AEC), an synthetic RNA that controls the entire process. All primers and probes were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA, USA. Note that probes are double quenched and contain internal quenchers (ZEN or TAO), which are not used by the original protocols. The RT-qPCR reaction (10 µL) consisted of 2 µL of LightCycler ® Multiplex RNA Virus Master (5×) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 0.75 µL (for N1, N2, N3, RdRP_Mod, and E_Mod) or 1 µL (for RdRP, E, and N) of SARS-CoV-2 primer/probe assay (FAM, 0.2 µL of RPP30 primer/probe assay (HEX), 0.33 µL of AEC primer/probe assay (CY5), 0.05 µL of reverse transcriptase (200×) (Roche), 5 µL of extracted nucleic acid, and 1.67 µL or 1.42 µL of nuclease-free water (all oligos were from Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). The stock concentration of each primer/probe in the reaction can be found in Tables 1-3. Thermocycling conditions were: reverse transcription: 10 min at 50 • C; polymerase activation: 3 min at 94 • C; followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 • C and 30 s at 55 • C. The instrument used was LightCycler 480 II controlled by the Flow Flex system. The master mix was prepared by an operator and distributed into a 384-well plate by the PCR set up unit (PSU). After master mix distribution, the PSU also distributed the samples. Each sample was processed in duplicate.A synthetic dsDNA molecule (gblock-Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA, USA), comprising of the concatenation of all six viral assay target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 3) , was in vitro transcribed into its RNA form. The nucleotide sequence can be retrieved from GenBank with the accession number MT458696. Upon arrival it was diluted, quantified using Qubit ® DNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kits (Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA) on Invitrogen Qubit ® 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA) and ten nanograms were used as a template in the in vitro transcription reaction. The in vitro transcription was performed with TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific™) in accordance with manufacturer s instructions. The in vitro transcribed RNA (2 µL) was quantified using Qubit ® RNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kits (Thermo Scientific™) on an Invitrogen Qubit ® 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific™). Nanogram to copy number conversion was performed as instructed by the synthetic dsDNA manufacturer on (https://www.idtdna.com/pages/education/decoded/article/calculations-convertingfrom-nanograms-to-copy-number).A random DNA sequence of 200 bases (NCBI GenBank accession number MF374500.1) was generated by the tool available at http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~mmaduro/random.htm. The sequence was not available in public databases according to BLAST (NCBI) and was purchased as gblock from Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA, USA. Artificial process control RNA was produced and quantified as described in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic synthetic sequence production. MagNA Pure 96 Instrument added it (10 5 copies/extraction) to each sample during the nucleic acid extraction.Amplification efficiencies of each primer/probe set were investigated by testing 10-fold dilution (1.48 × 10 8 to 1.48 × 10 2 copies/PCR) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA encompassing a copy number range, which would be considered low, medium, and high viral loads in clinical samples, followed by the evaluation of the standard curve parameters, specially the slope, from which the amplification efficiency and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) are derived. These analyses were performed using linear regression tools available in Graphpad Prism software version 6.0 (Graphpad, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).Limits of detection were calculated by the probit regression analysis of a 1:2 serial dilution (from 2.64 × 10 4 to 4.04 × 10 −1 copies/reaction) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA. Three samples corresponding to each dilution point were tested in duplicate on two different days (n = 12) and the assay response (detected or not detected) was measured. Applying the probit regression analysis to the data, a probability of detection versus concentration was returned. The target concentration at which the assay tested positive 95% of the time (Limit of detection-LOD) was estimated using Minitab version 19 (Minitab, LLC., Centre, PA, USA). Because of the repeatability and reproducibility introduced in the LOD experiment described above, (3 biological replicates tested as 2 technical replicates on 2 different days, n = 12) this experiment also evaluates these parameters.To investigate the assays cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses, pools of positive samples used in our laboratory as internal quality controls for RT-qPCR assays were tested (Influenza A, H1N1, and H3N2, parainfluenza virus 3 and 4, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229, and coronavirus HKU). As an alternative, in-silico cross-reaction studies can be performed and cross reactivity is defined as homology greater than 80% between one primer/probe and any sequence present in the target microorganism [9] .From 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020 our laboratory applied the proposed method to 30,699 Brazilian patients. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was detected on 04 March 2020. It was the central-west region of Brazil s case zero. Several positive cases were subsequently detected and the test results and Cq values were anonymously retrieved from the laboratory test results database. Positive and negative agreements between selected assays were evaluated on two occasions: a) after the detection of 23 positive samples, and b) after the detection of 75 positive samples. In addition, all of our cases (from 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020) were anonymously retrieved from the laboratory test results database and presented according to their Brazilian State of origin as absolute and relative frequency to evaluate the positivity difference between states and try to figure out systematic bias.All volunteers agreed to participate, signed informed consent, and the internal use of these samples for diagnostic workflow optimization was according to the medical ethical rules of our institution. Personal data was anonymized irreversibly for the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results database.The nasopharyngeal swabs samples from the 60 healthy volunteers were submitted to the six considered SARS-CoV-2 assays to check the generation of unspecific response. We observed consistent false-positive results for N and N2 (60 out of 60 samples for both). The N3 assay generated a false-positive signal or inconclusive results in 13 out of 60 tested samples. Because of this the N2, N3, and N assays were not considered for subsequent experiments due to the lack of analytical specificity under our conditions ( Figure 1 ). This lack of analytical specificity was not observed for N1, E, and RdRP. In addition, E and RdRP assay primer/probe concentrations were modified (termed E (modified) and RdRP (modified)), and this concentration optimization did not interfere with the specificity of the assays (20 healthy volunteers' samples tested-results not presented).Rayon (n = 30) and cotton (n = 30) swabs were used for the nasopharyngeal sample collection for this first experiment. We did not observe any RT-PCR inhibition associated with cotton or Rayon by inspecting the RPP30 (HEX) and AEC (CY5) amplification curves ( Figure 2 ). a false-positive signal or inconclusive results in 13 out of 60 tested samples. Because of this the N2, N3, and N assays were not considered for subsequent experiments due to the lack of analytical specificity under our conditions (Figure 1 ). This lack of analytical specificity was not observed for N1, E, and RdRP. In addition, E and RdRP assay primer/probe concentrations were modified (termed E (modified) and RdRP (modified)), and this concentration optimization did not interfere with the specificity of the assays (20 healthy volunteers' samples tested-results not presented).

We did not observe any RT-PCR inhibition associated with cotton or Rayon by inspecting the RPP30 (HEX) and AEC (CY5) amplification curves ( Figure 2 ). Amplification efficiencies of N1, E, RdRP, E (modified), and RdRP (modified) assays were 93.4%, 86.3%, 116.5%, 119.6%, and 110%, respectively, when applied to serial dilution of 1:10 (1.48 × 10 8 to 1.48 × 10 2 copies/PCR) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA (Figure 3) . Amplification efficiencies of N1, E, RdRP, E (modified), and RdRP (modified) assays were 93.4%, 86.3%, 116.5%, 119.6%, and 110%, respectively, when applied to serial dilution of 1:10 (1.48 × 10 8 to 1.48 × 10 2 copies/PCR) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA (Figure 3 ). Limiting dilution of 1:2 (from 2.64 × 10 4 to 4.04 × 10 −1 copies/reaction) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA was tested in order to evaluate the assays′ limit of detection. Probit Limiting dilution of 1:2 (from 2.64 × 10 4 to 4.04 × 10 −1 copies/reaction) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA was tested in order to evaluate the assays limit of detection. Probit regression analysis returned the limit of detection of 21 (95% CI 16.5-31.1) copies/reaction for N1, 141 (95% CI 109-207) copies/reaction for E, 350 (95% CI 281-508) copies/reaction for RdRP, 457 (95% CI 382-598) copies/reaction for E (modified), and 33.7 (95% CI 27.6-46.8) copies/reaction for RdRP (modified) (Figure 4 ). When applied to pools of positive samples used in our laboratory as internal quality controls for RT-qPCR assays for other respiratory viruses (influenza A, H1N1, and H3N2, parainfluenza virus 3 and 4, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229, and coronavirus HKU) N1, RdRP, RdRP (modified), E, When applied to pools of positive samples used in our laboratory as internal quality controls for RT-qPCR assays for other respiratory viruses (influenza A, H1N1, and H3N2, parainfluenza virus 3 and 4, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229, and coronavirus HKU) N1, RdRP, RdRP (modified), E, and E (modified) assays did not return false-positive results. The in-silico cross-reactivity analysis of all primers used in this study was described elsewhere [4, 15, 16] .The first version of the proposed method was based on N1, E, and RdRP (modified) because these assays showed better amplification efficiencies and consequently better limits of detection in the experiments using contrived samples. The test started to be applied to the population of Brazil's Federal District on 19 February 2020 and the first positive sample was detected on 4 March 2020 (Brazil's Federal district's case zero). After processing 968 samples (23 tested positive and 945 tested negative), it was noted that median (min-max) Cq values for N1 were 26.71 (10.61-36.72), for E were 27.44 (11.93-> 40), and for RdRP were 31.35 (10.61-> 40) (Cq > 40 meaning not detected) ( Figure 5 ). Twenty-one samples returned positive and 942 results were negative for the three assays resulting in 91.3% positive agreement and 99.6% negative agreement. One sample was positive for N1 and E, but not for RdRP (modified). Another sample was positive only for N1. These resulted in 95.6% positive agreement and 99.7% negative agreement for N1 versus E. Hence, the RdRP assay was removed from the proposed method, which thereafter was based on N1 and E. Figure 5 ).

After processing 2195 samples (75 positive and 2120 negative), it was noted that the median (min-max) Cq values for N1 were 25.20 (10.61-38.0) and for E were 27.12 (11.93-> 40) ( Figure 6 ). Seventy-two samples returned positive results for both assays. Three samples were positive for N1, but not for E resulting in 96% positive agreement and 99.8% negative agreement. Hence, the E assay was removed from the proposed method, which thereafter was based on N1 only. After processing 2195 samples (75 positive and 2120 negative), it was noted that the median (min-max) Cq values for N1 were 25.20 (10.61-38.0) and for E were 27.12 (11.93-> 40) ( Figure 6 ).

From 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020 our laboratory applied the proposed method to 30,699 Brazilian individuals (49.5% were women and 50.5% were men, and the average age was 42.5 ± 17,08 years for women and 41.7 ± 16.3 years for men) and 5596 (18.23%) tested positive. From this total of patients, 14,488 (47.1%) were from Brazil's Federal District (where our core laboratory is located) and 1031 (7.12%) tested positive. The remaining 16,211 (52.8%) patients were from other Brazilian states (Table 4 ). Positivity was different between the states. States from Northern Brazil (e.g., Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Roraima, and Rondônia) showed the highest proportions of positive results. The summary of all results obtained in this study can be found in Table 5 . Here, the following analytical performance characteristics of Charité and CDC protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection were evaluated: (a) analytical specificity, which refers to the qPCR assay detecting the appropriate target sequence rather than other nonspecific targets also present in a sample [17] ; (b) PCR amplification efficiency, which is the increase in amplicon per cycle, and is highly dependent on the primers used [17, 18] ; (c) analytical sensitivity or limit of detection, which refers to the minimum number of nucleic acid copies in a sample that can be detected with 95% probability [17] ; (d) cross-reactivity with other pathogens; (e) on-going accuracy in clinical specimens, which refers to agreement between the test method and another method during the daily routine.We observed in the analytical specificity experiment that 3 out of 6 tested assays (N2, N3, and N) presented unspecific amplification on known negative samples from healthy volunteers (SARS-CoV-2 had not arrived in Brazil at that time) and they were excluded from the validation. This result could be due to intrinsic primer non-specificity or contamination with viral templates during oligo manufacturing [19] . In addition, no amplification inhibition was observed when cotton swabs were used, so cotton can be used for sample collection during a Rayon swab contingency.Next, contrived positive samples were created by spiking synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA into known negative nasopharyngeal specimens. To avoid degradation of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the RNAses of the samples, collection tubes containing guanidine hydrochloride were used. These contrived samples were used to evaluate the E, RdRP, N1, E modified, and RdRP modified assays' amplification efficiency (modified assays have their originally proposed primer concentrations changed). N1, E, and RdRP (modified) showed the better (closer to 100%) amplification efficiencies (93.4%, 86%, and 110%, respectively), suggesting that they could have better diagnostic capability.In the limit of detection experiment, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets, 21 and 33.7 copies/reaction, respectively. The E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary assay (141 copies/reaction). Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized), and E presented appropriate analytical sensitivity and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for the COVID-19 virus. The E assay was at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others using contrived samples. The limits of detection observed in this study were slightly different than those described for RdRP (3.6 copies per reaction) and E (3.9 copies per reaction) in their original description, where the authors used the in-vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly in the RT-qPCR reaction [4] . Our results could reflect the fact that we spiked the synthetic RNA in the nasopharyngeal samples, to resemble a real clinical sample and for the limit of detection calculation we assumed that the nucleic acid purification recovered 100% of the spiked RNA sequences of the 200 µL aliquot used in the extraction.Cross-reaction was not observed for the tested organisms either in vitro or in silico (in silico data were not presented and can be found elsewhere [4, 15] ).No commercial method for SARS-CoV-2 detection was available for comparison in our territory at the time of this assessment (late January 2020). Hence, until the finding of circulating SARS-CoV-2, this validation was considered an on-going validation because of the lack of the test accuracy evaluation. Once some positive cases were detected, a retrospective head-to-head comparison of N1, E, and RdRP (modified) was anonymously performed on the test results database. It was observed that N1 gave more positive results than E, and E gave more positive results than RdRP (modified). RdRP (modified) was removed from the daily routine after the comparison of the three assays on 23 positive samples, and then the E assay was removed from the assay after its comparison with N1 on 75 positive samples.The observation that E had better diagnostic capability than RdRP (modified) contradicts the findings using contrived samples, because RdRP (modified) showed better amplification efficiency and limit of detection than E. This contradiction could reflect differences in the target abundance in the sample due to the presence of cellular content. Upon cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks~60% of the cell expression capability and its replication relies on the production of genomic RNA but also on the expression of several shorter subgenomic RNAs coding for conserved structural proteins-spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)-important for assembling progeny virions [20] . RdRP is located on ORF1b and its expression requires ribosomal frameshifting, implying that it is produced at significantly lower levels compared to ORF1a-encoded functions and subgenomic RNA. So, in the cellular content of the sample, the RdRP copy number is lower than E and N1. On the other hand, the E and N1 target is highly expressed, especially the N gene, because its sequences are present in almost all subgenomic RNA [20] [21] [22] . This fact also corroborates with the better diagnostic capability of N1 compared to E. In conclusion, N1 has better LOD, and amplification efficiency, and its target sequencing is highly abundant in infected cells present in the sample.Because the only Sarbecovirus that circulated in humans in 2020 was the SARS-CoV-2 and a false negative result can have broad public health impact we decided not to report indeterminate results. If N1, E, or RdRP (modified) returned positive amplification the sample was considered positive. This protocol was in accordance with the Pan American Health Organization guidelines [23] . In addition, decreasing the number of assays executed for each sample to reach a diagnosis did not affect the test performance and was in accordance with the resource saving priority during a pandemic to avoid the collapse of test availability.More than 30,000 individuals were tested by the proposed method in almost 3 months and 18% tested positive. States from Northern Brazil presented higher levels of positive rates. Because epidemic stages between Brazilian states were different due to the size of the country, different levels of positivity between them is an ecologic evaluation of the assay, as similar proportions of positive results would indicate a systematic bias in the assay's performance.In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before their availability to the population. Experiments to establish the assay's analytical specificity and sensitivity can be easily implemented. The proposed method detected the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in the central west region of Brazil, demonstrating that the use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate a novel assay's diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple and effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The use of spiked samples that resemble real clinical specimens exposes the artificial SARS-CoV-2 sequences to the same background of nucleic acids yields that can be found in the routine and similar amplification behavior of real SARS-CoV-2. However, differences in the E and RdRP assays' performance between contrived and real samples were observed and a retrospective on-going accuracy evaluation on our test database was necessary to make the assay reach its most reliable configuration. This observation indicates that the use of real positive samples is also essential for RT-qPCR assay validation.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, data curation, project administration, methodology, investigation, writing-original draft, supervision, writing-review and editing: G.B.B.; conceptualization, data curation formal analysis, methodology, writing-review and editing: T.H.S.R.; data curation, formal analysis, methodology, investigation, writing-original draft: P.G.M.; project administration, resources, supervision, funding acquisition, writing-review and editing: R.H.J.; Project administration, resources, supervision, funding acquisition, writing-review and editing: L.F.A.N.

By June 25, 2020, the State of São Paulo had 248,587 confirmed cases with 13, 759 deaths.An important question related to patients' immunity after recovery was raised. Differences in immunity after recovery have been reported in humans [12] , and in experiments with rhesus macaques [13] . The experiment in [12] collected plasma from 175 recovered Covid-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected from day 10 to 15, after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. Nonetheless, the NAbs levels were variable in the cohort. Among them, 52 ( ≈30%) patients developed low levels of these antibodies, in 10 ( ≈6%) the NAbs levels were undetectable, and 25 ( ≈14%) developed high levels.In [14] , data suggests an imbalance between the control of virus replication and activation of the adaptive immune responses. In some patients, lung cells remain vulnerable to infection due to immune system deficiencies. The virus continues replicating while the immune system attacks infected cells, also killing healthy cells in the vicinity, thereby severely inflaming the lung tissues. This seems to be the mechanism, which makes some patients severely ill weeks after their initial infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 probably induces immunity like other coronaviruses; however, this mechanism is not fully understood [15] .The economic crisis due to the pandemic is another important issue. According to [16] the mortality rate of Covid-19 is not necessarily correlated with the global economic crisis, since governments, companies, consumers, and media have reacted to the economic shock. However, a global recession seems to be inevitable, and its duration and intensity will depend on the success of the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease.Taking the whole scenario into account, researchers worldwide are intensively studying and developing mathematical models of the Covid-19 outbreak. The knowledge on the dynamics of this pandemic is important to estimate the duration and peaks of the outbreak.Macro-modeling of propagation of infectious diseases has been a field of research since the Kermack and McKendrick proposition [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . It is a dynamic model that classifies individuals in a population as Susceptible -Infected -Removed (SIR) [22] . Since then, several modifications of the SIR model [23, 24] such as, the Susceptible -Exposed -Infected -Removed (SEIR) model, [25, 26] have been proposed for epidemic modeling.In addition, studies considering time delay [27] and fractionalorder [28] [29] [30] dynamical systems have been applied to disease propagation and could be useful to model the Covid-19 outbreak, and other biological systems [31, 32] .In [33] a SIRD (SIR with delay) model had been adjusted to Covid-19 spread in China, Italy, and France. The results have shown that the recovery rates were similar for the three countries. In [34] , a mixed analytical-statistical inverse problem is used to predict the Covid-19 progression in Brazil. A SIRU model, Susceptible -Infected -Removed -Unreported, was used to estimate the direct problem and a Bayesian parameter was used for the inverse problem.Compartmental models considering immigration and home isolation, or quarantine, were proposed by [10] . All the situations presented an infection-endemic equilibrium with results showing that home isolation or lock down mitigates the infection probability.In this work the proposed model is a modification of the original compartmental SIR model of , which includes a sick ( S ick ) population compartment representing nodes of the networks that manifest the symptoms of the disease.Although, several relevant questions are raised about the spread of the disease, we will focus on two of them in this study. The first one is associated with the group of asymptomatic individuals, who constitute the majority of the cases of the disease, and the second is related to the possibility that the immunity acquired by an infected person may be temporary.As the mechanism of the spread of this disease is associated with the number of infected people and contact of this group to the susceptible group, it is important that the group of asymptomatic or unreported individuals be studied. Asymptomatic individuals are the group of infected people who do not manifest the symptoms, but can spread the disease by establishing effective contact with susceptible individuals.To infer the behavior of asymptomatic individuals, the infected compartment will be divided into infected people who manifest the symptoms (sick) and those who do not, based on public data.In addition, the influence of acquired immunity among individuals who have recovered from the infection is also being studied. If the acquired immunity is permanent, then the pattern of spread is described as temporal. On the other hand, if the immunity is temporary, it is important to understand the time interval after which the individual becomes susceptible again, changes in the dynamics of disease spread, and, the influence of the time interval for this reinfection on the temporal response.The proposed Susceptible -Infected -Removed -Sick (SIRSi) model also considers birth and death of individuals in the given population and introduces a feedback from those in the recovered group who did not gain immunity or lost their immunity after a period of time.The proposed SIRSi model presents both a disease free and an endemic equilibrium. The influence of the re-susceptibility feedback is investigated either analytically or numerically.The parameters of the proposed SIRSi model are numerically fit to the pandemic situation of three cities in São Paulo State, in Brazil, namely, São Paulo, the capital of the State, Santos, on the coast and approximately 80 Km away from São Paulo, and Campinas, in the interior of the state and approximately 90 Km distant from the capital São Paulo.The paper is organized as follows, Section 2 presents the SIRSi compartmental mathematical model. Section 3 presents the equilibrium points and stability conditions, showing the possible existence.The proposed SIRSi model can be seen in Fig. 1 . In this model, the susceptible population S is infected at a rate α when contacted by an infected individuals from I. The susceptible compartment also receives a population, at a rate 1 /γ , who did not gain complete immunity after recovering or who lost their immunity after a period of time.The compartment Irepresents the infectious population in the incubation stage prior the onset of symptoms. Infection transmission during this period has been reported in [35] [36] [37] [38] JID: CHAOS [m5G; October 29, 2020; 10:20 ] population can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The period between infection and onset of symptoms 1 /β 2 , ranges from 3 to 38 days with a median of 5.2 days. Once the infected individual is tested positive and the case is documented, it is moved to the S ick compartment and those who do not develop severe symptoms become asymptomatic. [39] reported that the estimate of the number of infections originating from undocumented cases is as high as 86%, including infected individuals with mild, limited and lack of symptoms. In other recent studies [40, 41] , it was found that, 20% -40% of positive tested patients were asymptomatic.In this work, and [42] , under-reporting of asymptomatic cases is considered. The size of this population could be 7 times bigger than that of the documented cases and this group recovers within the period 1 /β 1 .Some of the individuals within this population could develop symptoms. In [43] , it has been reported that the average time between infection and the onset of symptoms can be 4.6 days. Once the case is documented it should be moved to the S ick compartment, which consists of those patients with severe symptoms seeking medical attention. In [44] it was reported that this population could represent up to 19.9% of the total documented cases, of which 13.8% are severe cases and 6.1% require intensive care. The sick population recovers within the period 1 /β 3 or removed at a rate σ (see Fig. 1 ).The effect of social distancing measures in the infected patients and corresponding deaths toll are shown in Fig. 1 . The parameter θ is introduced (1) , and subject to the constraint 0 < θ < 1 . Consequently, the SIRSi model is given by (1) ,where λ and δ are the birth and death rates, respectively.The number of documented cases is a key information that should be noted from (1) because the number of confirmed cases is publicly available, and will be used to fine-tune the model. Although data on the number of new cases are added daily, it tends to be less representative of the dynamics.Here, the model given by (1) is considered, such that ˙To investigate the influence of the introduction of feedback from the recovered individuals with no immunity, the equilibrium points from (1) must be determined and their stability must be discussed.Assuming the realistic hypothesis that α = 0 , i.e., susceptible can be converted into infected, the equilibrium points are f (x * ) = 0 .Using the Hartman-Grobman Theorem [45] the local stability of the equilibrium points can be determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix computed on each equilibrium point. The Jacobianof (1) is given by (2) .The disease-free ( Section 3.1 ) and the endemic ( Section 3.2 ) equilibrium points are determined in the following section.The disease-free equilibrium is a state corresponding to the absence of infected individuals, i.e. , I * = 0 . Applying this condition tobelonging to the first octant of R 4 and given by:Considering P 1 , the corresponding Jacobian [45] By the Laplace determinant development [46] , the eigenvalues of (4) are the elements in the diagonal, that is,The eigenvalues ξ 1 ,ξ 3 and ξ 4 are real and negatives, indicating asymptotically stable directions. Consequently, ξ 2 determines the equilibrium stability. If α(1 − θ ) λ/δ < (β 1 + β 2 ) the eigenvector associated indicates an asymptotically stable direction. For α(1 − θ ) λ/δ > (β 1 + β 2 ), the equilibrium point P 1 is unstable, with the onset of a bifurcation in the parameter space.The endemic equilibrium points are characterized by the existence of infected people in the population, that is, (I * = 0 ). Therefore, there is an endemic equilibrium point P 2 = x * = (S * , I * , R * , S * ick ) T in the first octant of R 4 given byConsequently, the existence condition for the endemic equilib-Considering P 2 , the corresponding Jacobian [45] with eigenvalues ξ given bywith Any further effort to analytically obtain ξ eigenvalues becomes difficult due to the complexity of the coefficients. A possible alternative approach is to perform numerical calculations.However, some insight for the model with feedback γ can be obtained, in terms of bifurcations and stability, analyzing the eigenvalues when γ = 0 and γ = 0 .Endemic equilibrium exists even with γ = 0 . In this case, the eigenvalues areConsequently, ξ 1 and ξ 2 are real and negative, indicating asymptotically stable directions. The conclusion is the same for ξ 4 , because it is real and negative or complex with negative real part.The eigenvalue ξ 3 must be analyzed more accurately because it can be the conjugated to ξ 4 in a complex case, i.e., in situations with < 0 , indicating asymptotic stability. However, in a real case, i.e. when, then the endemic equilibrium point is unstable.However, in the case of instability due to ξ 3 , the existence condition (6) for the endemic equilibrium is not satisfied. Consequently, if the endemic equilibrium point P 2 exists, it is asymptotically stable.Analyzing how γ changes the endemic situation, in a case with γ → ∞ is described byfollowing the same existence condition given by (6) .Under the assumption γ → ∞ , the coefficients from Eq. (8) can be approximated byand, consequently, (8) is rewritten asAssuming that at least one root ξ goes to infinity as γ → ∞ :then, ξ 1 = −γ , and γ → ∞ , so, one eigenvalue goes to −∞ as γ → ∞ .To find an approximation to the other three roots, the characteristic equation is rewritten in Eq. (13) . It can be also assumed that the other three roots are finite following In this section the parameters of the proposed SIRSi model (1) (see Fig. 1 ) are numerically adjusted to fit the curve of confirmed symptomatic cases of three major cities in the state of São Paulo -Brazil, using publicly available data from the State Data Analysis System -SEADE ( Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados 2 ) [47] . The total populations in each of the cities were obtained from the same source and it is shown in Table 1 .Birth and death rates were calculated using λ and δ respectively. Linear interpolation was necessary as the data from the public repository were out of date. Results are shown in Fig. 2 .One of the first measures to contain the spread of the virus was the imposition of social distancing. This intervention, represented by θ in the model, focuses on reducing the possible contact between infected and susceptible individuals, and hence it is introduced as a factor of the transmission rate, i.e. α(1 − θ ) . The time series corresponding to the daily measures of this index along with their mean for each one city considered are shown in Fig. 3 . Although this time variation resembles a 7-day periodic function, especially on the second half of the register, the mean of this measure is used as a representative value.Information about the duration of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is limited; however, currently it is known that the immunity acquired is temporary. Recent research highlights that immune response and antibody protection after recovery may depend on the severity of the infection, in some cases this protection can last for as little as 12 weeks while in others, no antibody protection is observed [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . To assess the influence of this behavior on disease spread, we set the feedback parameter γ at constant values γ ∈ [ 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 ] in order to map possible scenarios especially those related to second waves of infection.The disease transmission rate of symptomatic individuals prior to hospitalization is estimated to be between 1.12 and 1.19, while that of asymptomatic cases is between 0.1 and 0.6. In the model (1) this parameter is represented by the product α(1 − θ ) , thus, making α ∈ [ 0 . 1 1 . 0 ] . The mean time between infection and onset-of-symptoms for confirmed cases, 1 /β 2 , is 2 days, makingThe time from onset-of-infection to full recovery, 1 /β 1 , is considered to be between a few days to two weeks (5 to 15 days). The time period for a symptomatic patient to overcome the disease, 1 /β 3 , and the time between hospitalization to death, 1 /σ, are both considered to be between 5 to 20 days [43, 44, 55, 56] .The trust-region reflective least-squares algorithm [57] [58] [59] [60] along with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator were used to fit parameters in model (1) to actual data collected from public repositories for each one of the three cities into consideration. All parameters and initial conditions computed are normalized with respect to the total population in each case. For fitting, it was set S 0 ∈ [0 , 1] ,I 0 ∈ [0 , 1] with initial guess S i 0 = 99 . 9% and I i 0 = 0 . 1% , the initial condition for S ick and R was set to zero. Results are shown in Tables 2-7 In order to assess the influence of the parameter γ in the endemic equilibrium, the eigenvalues were plotted for the set of fit parameters found, for γ ∈ [0 , 2) . In Fig. 4 the eigenvalues are shown for the endemic equilibrium of each city, and for each one of the fit sets. For γ = 0 the eigenvalues are stable for São Paulo and Santos, and as γ increases, the eigenvalues move towards the left-hand side of the complex plane, whereas for Campinas the eigenvalues are unstable for γ = 0 . In Fig. 5 a closer In this section numerical experiments conducted using the MATLAB-Simulink [61] for two different conditions are described. First, the SIRSi model is fit with the real data for the S icks population and different values of the parameter γ . Consequently, the simulation for the infected population I can be inferred from the proposed model.The numerical experiments, as in Section 4 , were conducted for three major cities in the state of São Paulo, namely, São Paulo, Campinas, and Santos.The initial condition is x 0 = (S 0 , I 0 , S ick 0 , R 0 ) T , where S 0 and I 0 are the normalized susceptible and infected populations, which are considered as free parameters as they can be modified by the fitting algorithm. 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 R 0 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 S 0 1.008e + 00 1.008e + 00 1.007e + 00 1.007e + 00 1.005e + 00 I 0 8.749e-06 9.148e-06 9.364e-06 9.614e-06 1.776e-05 S ick 0 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 R 0 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00 0.000e + 00The Fig. 6 shows that the SIRSi model gives a good adjustment for the data of confirmed cases in the infected population.Considering that the acquired immunity is permanent, i.e. , γ = 0 , and that the isolation rate is constant, the peak of the infection occurs soon after July 2020, and the disease will not persist, until the end of the year.On the other hand, assuming that immunity is not permanent and adopting a reinfection rate γ = 0 . 01 such that every 100 days a recovered individual becomes susceptible again, the model predicts a decrease in the confirmed cases and a new wave of infection in the first half of 2022. Decreasing the time interval in which a recovered person becomes susceptible ( γ = 0 . 02 ) to 50 days, the model indicates a second wave of infection in the first half of 2021. Decreasing the time interval in which a recovered person becomes susceptible ( γ = 0 . 04 ) to 25 days, the model indicates that number of confirmed infected will be reduced by almost two thirds by the end of this year and the number of infected cases with continue to reduce. In this case, the number of confirmed cases will remain higher than the others. In Fig. 7 , the infected compartment I inferred from the SIRSi model is presented, showing that the peak of infection is close to July 2020.Increasing γ reduces the time for a recovered person to become susceptible again, causing the peaks in Fig. 7 to increase, when compared to the curves for lower values of γ . This behavior, however, cannot be observed in Fig. 6 , indicating that the increase in re-susceptibility feedback gain γ possibly contributes to the increase of asymptomatic or unreported infected cases.In addition, it seems that if recovered individuals acquire permanent immunity γ = 0 , the number of infected people tends to zero by the end of 2020. For γ = 0 . 01 , there is a small increase in January 2022. For γ = 0 . 02 , a new wave of confirmed cases can be seen in Fig. 6 , and the increase in the infected population is also observed in Fig. 7 . For São Paulo, the numerical experiments show that considering any reinfection rate, there will be confirmed infected cases and unreported infected cases until 2023, indicating the need for a control strategy and study on preventive inoculation. Fig. 8 shows the SIRSi model adjusted to the data of confirmed cases in Santos. Assuming that the immunity acquired is permanent, γ = 0 , and isolation rate is constant, the peak of the confirmed cases in Santos will occur very close to July 2020, similar to that in São Paulo (see Fig. 6 ). cities, since the second wave of infection in the city of Santos occurs prior to São Paulo.When γ = 0 . 04 , after the peak of the confirmed cases, a second wave can be observed in the numerical results before the end of 2020, delaying the reduction of the confirmed cases.For Santos, the numerical experiments show that when γ = 0 and γ = 0 . 03 , the number of confirmed cases tends to zero in the beginning of 2023.The infected compartment I inferred from the SIRSi model is presented in Fig. 9 , showing that the peak of infection is close to July 2020.The increase in re-susceptibility feedback gain γ , reduces the time for an infected person to be susceptible again, causing higher peaks when compared to the curves for lower values of γ . This behavior does not occur in Fig. 8 indicating that the increase in feedback possibly contributes to the increase in asymptomatic or unreported infected cases. This situation is similar to that observed for São Paulo.In addition, when γ = 0 , the number of infected people I tends to zero before the end of the 2020 (see the curve for γ = 0 in detailed study of the dynamics, because together with the situation in which the infected individual acquires permanent immunity, these rates suggest that the number of confirmed cases (see Fig. 8 ) and asymptomatic infected individuals tends to zero more quickly.In the situation in which a recovered person becomes susceptible in 25 days, it is observed that the infection persists in the population for a longer time, as shown by the curve with γ = 0 . 04 in Fig. 9 justifying an accurate set of public strategies. For permanent acquired immunity, γ = 0 , and constant isolation rate, the peak of confirmed infection cases occur in the beginning of the second half of 2020.Considering the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ > 0 , in Fig. 10 , it seems that with the increase in γ the time necessary for the number of confirmed cases tending to zero is slightly higher, which is different from that of Santos and São Paulo. However, Campinas does not present a second wave of infection, even with the variation of γ .The general behavior of Campinas, concerning the sensitivity analysis for γ , presents different results from that of Santos and São Paulo. It can be noticed in Fig. 10 that the observed data are far from the peak of infection predicted by the SIRSi model. At this point, more data is needed for any further qualitative analysis.Observing the eigenvalues for the city of Campinas (See Figs. 4 and 5 ) it can be noticed that they are all real, indicating that there is no oscillatory behavior in the dynamics of the model. Depending on the new data this situation might change.The infected compartment of Campinas presents the peak of infection close to the beginning of the second half of 2020, Fig. 11 .Increase in the reinfection parameter causes an increase in the infection peak as shown in Fig. 10 indicating that the increase in feedback possibly contributes to the increase in either asymptomatic or unreported infected cases.The proposed SIRSi model was fit to publicly available data of the Covid-19 outbreak, providing estimates on the duration and peaks of the outbreak. In addition, the model allows us to infer information related to unreported and asymptomatic cases.The proposed model with re-susceptibility feedback adjusted to the confirmed infection data, suggests the possibility that recovered patients may have temporary immunity γ > 0 or even permanent γ = 0 .Considering the situation in which immunity is temporary, there is a second wave of infection which, depending on the time interval for a recovered person to be susceptible again, indicates a second wave with a greater or lesser number of reinfected patients.If the time interval is larger (larger γ ), the second wave of infection will have a greater number of infected people when compared to that of a shorter time interval.The qualitative behavior for São Paulo and Santos is similar in terms of the sensitivity analysis of the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ . The bigger the value of γ , the shorter the time for a recovered person to become susceptible to reinfection, increasing the number of unreported or asymptomatic cases.It is suggested to collect more data for the city of Campinas because the data of the confirmed infected cases presents a certain distance from the peak of the infection. The dynamics of the model may undergo some significant changes, given the sensitivity of the model to disturbances.It is inferred from the proposed model that if the acquired immunity is temporary, a second wave of infection is a serious possibility. In addition, the number of asymptomatic patients increases if the acquired immunity lasts for a short period of time.Data are publicly available with [47, 48] .There is no conflict of interest between the authors.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-29",10

Since the first case reported in February 2020, Brazil has been severely affected by the epidemic and was the second most affected country in the world, with over three million confirmed cases and more than a 100,000 deaths by the first days of August. 1, 2 Since the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in China, chest computed tomography (CT) has been used in the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency setting, even though it has not been recommended for routine screening or as an isolated diagnostic test. 3, 4 Although several radiological findings have been associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] their presence in other diseases hamper CT's reliability for this specific diagnosis. 10 Chest CT specificity has broadly ranged in different studies, but the lack of standardized criteria impairs comparisons between them. 11 Tomographic standards, such as the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) expert consensus, British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidance for radiological reporting and COVID-19 Reporting and Data System, have been proposed to overcome these limitations. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] These proposed imaging classifications may help clinicians assess the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia before molecular test results are available or in settings where the access to these exams are limited.So far, the majority of studies addressing the role of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia evaluated its performance in Chinese or European populations. 12, 13, 16 The reproducibility of these findings may theoretically change across distinct regions of the globe due to potential differences in the affected population or circulating viruses. In this study, we aimed to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values and reproducibility of the RSNA imaging categories for COVID-19 pneumonia in patients evaluated at the emergency department of a referral center for COVID-19 patients in the early period of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.The institutional review board approved the study and informed consent was waived. This was a cross-sectional study with patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms, from March 1 st to April 14 th , 2020, at a COVID-19 dedicated area in the emergency unit of a private hospital. All patients who collected a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 were eligible. The study included consecutive patients with suspected pneumonia that underwent che st CT, at the discretion of the attending physician. Chest CT was ordered according to the institutional protocol taking into account pneumonia severity criteria, laboratory tests and comorbidities.Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, lack of data in medical records, and severe respiratory motion artifacts on chest CT. One oropharyngeal and two nasopharyngeal (from both nostrils) rayon swabs were collected. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR were performed at an external laboratory (Grupo Fleury), a reference private laboratory in Brazil, using primer and probes according to the Charité protocol, as previously described. 18 Imaging acquisitions were obtained with patients in the supine position during endinspiration without contrast medium injection. Chest CT was performed on a 16 -slice CT All chest CT images were evaluated independently by two radiologists with two and 10 years of thoracic imaging experience. Both readers evaluated every patient scan twice with a 2-day interval between readout sessions to assess intra and inter-rater agreement. Discordant reports were evaluated by a third thoracic radiologist with 12 years of experience and consensus was reached among the three radiologists. All radiologists were blinded for RT-PCR, clinical and laboratory results, and previous imaging exams.CT features were classified as ""typical,"" ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" and ""negative"" for COVID-19 pneumonia"", according to RSNA expert consensus. 15 COVID-19 typical features are peripheral, bilateral and multifocal rounded ground-glass opacities (GGO) with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines (""crazy-paving""). Reversed halo sign and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f other findings of organizing pneumonia can be seen later in the disease. Indeterminate features may occur but are nonspecific for COVID-19 pneumonia, such as diffuse, perihilar, or unilateral GGO. All unusual or unreported findings for COVID-19 were classified as atypical (e.g., centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, or lung cavitation). If no CT suggestive findings of pneumonia were present, a negative classification was assigned. A typical appearance was considered a positive chest CT for COVID-19.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18 prevalence were also estimated. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. (Table 1) . Age and sex were not significantly different between both groups. Anosmia was significantly more frequent in COVID-19group. The non-COVID group had a shorter median duration of symptoms before attendance at emergency. COVID-19 patients had significantly lower oxygen saturation at emergency admission, lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelets counts.The median time between collecting nasal and oropharyngeal swabs and performing chest CT was 3.6 hours (IQR, 1.6-8.3), and the median time from onset of symptoms to undergoing CT was seven days (IQR, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Eighty (93.0%) COVID-19 patients had their diagnosis confirmed in the first RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, while in 6 (7.0%) the first test was negative but the second was positive.Chest CT features were classified as typical in 80 (50.3%) patients, as indeterminate in 30 Of these, according to their attendant physician, 13 had the final diagnos is of bacterial pneumonia, one had decompensated heart failure and three had no confirmed alternative diagnosis. The most common findings among these patients were centrilobular nodules (n=15) and tree-in-bud opacities (n=7) (Figure 4 ). Among patients with indeterminate appearance (n=30), seven had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. In this group, common findings were very few and non-rounded GGO (n=4), diffuse GGO (n=2), and unilateral features (n=1) ( Figure 5 ). One of them also had radiological features of pulmonary fibrosis.A total of 26 (32.5%) patients with typical findings were tested for influenza by molecular methods (three of them for all other pathogens described in Methods; two were patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) and none had positive results. Molecular tests for influenza were negative in other five (16.7%; one also negative for other pathogens), three (17.6%) and five (15.6%; one also negative for other pathogens) patients with indeterminate, atypical, and negative CT findings, respectively.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Intra-rater agreement in assigned classification was seen in 282 (88.7%) of 318 observations. Regarding intra-rater agreement, Cohen's kappa of observer one was 0.847 (P=.13), and observer two was 0.924 (P=.06). Inter-rater agreement ranged from 0.725 (P=.001) to 0.772 (P=.05) between two radiologists (see Tables S1 and S2). The agreement coefficients of selected typical findings are shown in Table S3 . specificity (84.8%) rates in that specific population. These results are comparable to those demonstrated in a recent study evaluating Italian patients, in which the authors used the same radiological criteria and found that a typical pattern had an specificity of 91.6% for COVID-19 pneumonia. 24 Other Chinese and Italian studies performed in the early COVID-19 pandemic showed much lower specificity rates (25.0% to 56.0%) for chest CT; 6, 25 However, those studies have not addressed the chest CT criteria proposed by RSNA, which may have affected their results owing to the lack of standards in CT interpretation. 6, 25 Finally, a recent meta-analysis found a pooled specificity of 37.0% for chest CT. 26 However, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as considered by the authors, there was significant heterogeneity among the studies. 26 We believe that it was mostly caused by the fact that studies using non-standardized criteria for interpretation were included in the analysis.Only four patients with typical CT findings were not diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR.Although all had negative RT-PCRs, this diagnosis could not be ruled out in at least two of them, who had no alternative diagnosis during hospitalization ( Figure 6 ). Additionally, one patient had pulmonary embolism, which is a possible complication described in COVID-19patients. 27 Other studies also showed similar findings related to some false negative RT -PCR results with typical chest CT appearance. 28 -31 A previous study has assessed the RSNA classification inter-rater reliability, with moderate to substantial agreement results. 32 Our study reinforces these findings, demonstrating an almost perfect intra-rater and substantial inter-rater agreements. These are encouraging outcomes, suggesting that the classification may be useful for clinicians to accurately estimate their suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia before RT-PCR results become available and increase the confidence in imaging classification, especially in settings where molecular tests are restricted or unavailable. Actually, in pandemic scenarios where the expected COVID-19 prevalence in patients with respiratory symptoms is above 30%, the PPV of typical CT appearance was higher than 80%. Moreover, it was higher than 90% when the prevalence was above 40%, making imaging classification a reliable tool to identify highly suspicious cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.Even though typical appearance sensitivity was near 90%, it is not possible to rule out the diagnosis with a non-typical appearance, particularly in the high prevalence scenario.Previous studies suggested a high sensitivity for CT; however, the lack of clear definitions for positive CT findings impairs the generalizability of those findings. 25, 26, 33 On the other hand, it is important to highlight that the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was correctly excluded in all patients classified as atypical, suggesting that this classification may be Among typical findings, the most frequent were multifocal and rounded GGO, crazy-paving, and perilobular pattern, usually peripheral and bilateral. Interestingly, despite discordance among readers regarding some isolated typical CT signs, there was agreement in the final standard. It is noteworthy that each radiological finding should not be considered individually, considering that these features are not uniquely related to COVID-19 pneumonia. Even noninfectious diseases may present findings that might overlap with CT features related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as pulmonary edema, organizing pneumonia, drug-related toxicity, pulmonary infarcts, and interstitial lung diseases. 34 -37 Furthermore, coinfection with other viruses cannot be ruled out using only chest CT.However, it is noteworthy that the study was conducted in a period before the influenza season in our region and, in addition to our data on molecular tests for influenza, it should be highlighted that, during the study period, only one case of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by influenza was reported to the Municipal Health Secretary, in mid March and from another institution (https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020).Our study has limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. First, there was not a previously defined criteria for ordering RT-PCR and chest CT and, during the study period, RT-PCR was mostly collected from patients showing signs of moderate or severe d isease.Therefore, COVID-19 patients presenting with mild disease and pneumonia could have been discharged with no further imaging and laboratory investigations. Second, it was a single-center experience with thorax-experienced radiologists, and scans readings may be less precise when evaluated by general radiologists. Third, our findings are applicable to patients with acute moderate and severe respiratory symptoms performing chest CT during J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a COVID-19 epidemic period. Finally, alternative diagnoses for non-COVID-19 patients were not fully evaluated in all patients. However, as discussed above, two of the four patients with ""typical"" appearance and negative RT -PCR were considered as nonlaboratory confirmed COVID-19 by attendant physicians before hospital discharge.In conclusion, in patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, chest CT categorical classification of COVID-19 findings is reproducible and demonstrates high agreement with clinical and RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19. Our study reinforces the role of tomographic standards to improve accuracy of radiological reports and to help physicians diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. a Considered as other findings of organizing pneumonia seen later in the disease.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-31",10

An internet-based ecological 2 study"". 3","2020). By May 5th, 2020, an early report, using number of curfew days in 49 countries, found 58 evidence that lockdown could be used to suppress the spread of COVID-19 (Atalan 2020). 59Measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic with Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPIs) 60 were adopted after Brazil enacted Law No. 13979 (Imprensa Nacional), and this was followed by 61 many states such as Rio de Janeiro (Decreto 46970 27/03/2020), the Federal District of Brasília 62 (Decree No. 40520, dated March 14 th , 2020) (Decreto 40520 de 14/03/2020), the city of São 63Paulo (Decree No. 59 .283, dated March 16 th , 2020) (Decreto 59283 2020 de São Paulo SP), and 64the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Decree No. 55240/2020, dated May 10 th , 2020) (Decreto 55240 65 de 10/05/2020). It was expected that, with these actions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 66 would be reduced. Of note, the country's most populous state, São Paulo, adopted rigorous 67 quarantine measures and put them into effect on March 24 th , 2020 (Decreto 59283 2020 de São 68Paulo SP). Internationally, Peru adopted the world's strictest lockdown (Tegel 2020). 69Recently, Google LLC published datasets indicating changes in mobility (compared to an 70 average baseline before the COVID-19 pandemic). These reports were created with aggregated, 71anonymized sets of daily and dynamic data at country and sub-regional levels drawn from users 72 who had enabled the Location History setting on their cell phones. These data reflect real-world 73 changes in social behavior and provide information on mobility trends for places like grocery 74 stores, pharmacies, parks, public transit stations, retail and recreation locations, residences, and 75workplaces, when compared to the baseline period prior to the pandemic (Google LLC). 76Mobility in places of residence provides information about the ""time spent in residences"", which 77we will hereafter call ""staying at home"" and use as a surrogate for measuring adherence to stay-78 at-home policies. 79Studies using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports and the daily number of new 80 COVID-19 cases have shown that over 7 weeks a strong correlation between staying at home 81 and the reduction of COVID-19 cases in 20 counties in the United States (Badr et al. 2020); 82 COVID-19 cases decreased by 49% after 2 weeks of staying at home (Banerjee and Nayak 83 2020); the incidence of new cases/100,000 people was also reduced (Wang et al. 2020); social 84 distancing policies were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread in the US (Gao et al. 85 2020); as well as in 49 countries around the world (Atalan 2020). A recent report using Brazilian 86and European data has shown a correlation between NPI stringency and the spread of COVID-19 87 (Candido et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2020) ; these analyses are debatable, however, due to their short 88 time span and the type of time series behavior (Bernal et al. 2017) , or for their use of Pearson's 89 correlation in the context of non-stationary time series (Gao et al. 2020) . For instance, applying 90 the same statistical analysis to stationary and non-stationary time series is not sufficient for 91 statistical analysis (Nason 2006) , and the latter is the case with this COVID-19 data. A 2020 92Cochrane systematic review of this topic reported that they were not completely certain about 93 this evidence for several reasons. taking the sum of deaths/million per epi-week, and the average of the variable ""staying at home"" 172 per epi-week, non-stationary patterns were mitigated by subtracting week t by week t-1 . 173Details regarding the pre-processing and methodological details were presented on the approach 175 for analyzing the time series data. Our variables were the difference in the variation of deaths 176 between locations A and B (dependent variable -outcome), and the difference in the variation of 177 staying at home values between the same location (independent variable). 178Direct comparison, between regions with and without controlled COVID-19 cases, was 180 considered in two scenarios: 1) Restrictive if, at least three out of four of the following 181 conditions were similar: a) population density, b) percentage of the urban population, c) HDI and 182 d) total area of the region. Similarity was considered adequate when a variation in conditions a), 183 b), and c) was within 30%, while, for condition d), a variation of 50% was considered adequate. 1842) Global: all regions and countries were compared to each other. 185Rationale 187Time series on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/millions) display a non-stationary pattern. The daily 188 data present a very distinct seasonal behavior on the weekends, with valleys on Saturdays and 189Sundays followed by peaks on Mondays ( Figure S1 ) 190To make it stationary, one may introduce dummy variables for Saturdays, Sundays, and 191 Mondays, regress the number of deaths in these dummy variables, and then analyze the residuals. 192However, in most cases, the residuals are still non-stationary time series, and special treatment 193 would be required in each case. Although this approach may be feasible for a few series, we are 194 interested in analyzing hundreds of time series from different countries and regions. Hence, we 195 need a more efficient way to deal with this amount of data. The covariates present another issue 196 in regressing the daily time series of deaths/staying at home. The covariates are typically 197 correlated with error terms due to public policies adopted by regions/countries. Mechanisms 198 controlling social isolation are intrinsically related to the number of deaths/cases in each 199location. An increase in the death rate may cause more stringent policies to be adopted, which 200increases the percentage of people staying at home. This change causes an imbalance between 201 the observed number of deaths and staying at home levels. In a regression model, this 202 discrepancy is accounted for in the error term. Hence, the error term will change in accordance 203 with staying at home levels. 204Approach for analyzing the time series data 205 Data aggregation by epidemiological week is a plausible alternative ( Figure S2 ). In this way, 206 artificial seasonality, imposed by work scheduled during weekends and the effect of 207 governmental control over social interaction, in a regression framework, are mitigated. The 208denotes the variation of deaths between weeks ‫ݐ‬ and t-1 , also known as the flux 215 of deaths. The same is valid for the staying at home time series. This simple operation yielded, in 216 most cases, stationary time series, and verified with the so-called Phillips-Perron stationarity test 217 (Perron 1988) . In the few cases where the resulting time series did not reject the null hypothesis 218 of non-stationarity (technically, the existence of a unitary root, in the time series characteristic), 219this was due to the presence of one or two outliers combined with the small sample size. These 220 outliers were usually related to the very low incidence of COVID-19 deaths by the 9 th 221 epidemiological week when paired with countries with a significant number of deaths in that 222 same week, thus resulting in an outlier which cannot be accounted for by linear 223regression.(Perron 1988) 224To investigate pairwise behavior, we propose a method to assess the relationship between deaths 225 and staying at home data between various countries and regions. ; consequently, we conclude that the behavior, 237 between A and B, is similar and the number of deaths and the percentage of staying at home are 238 associated in these regions. The other non-spurious situation implying ߚ ଵ ് 0 occurs when the 239 variation in the number of deaths in locations A and B increases/decreases over time following a 240 certain pattern, while the variation in the percentage of ""staying at home"" values also 241 increases/decreases following the same pattern (apart from the direction). In this situation, we 242found different epidemiological patterns as in the variation in the number of deaths, and in the 243 staying at home values, in locations A and B were on opposite trends. However, if these patterns 244were similar (proportional), this would be captured in the difference and, as a consequence, in 245 the regression. This means that the different trends were near proportional and, hence, the 246 variation in staying at home is associated with the variation in deaths. 247The proposed approach presents a way to evaluate staying at home and the number of deaths 248 between two countries/regions. In the section below ""Definition of areas with and without 249 controlled cases of COVID-19"", each country/region was classified into a binary class: either 250 controlled or not controlled areas for COVID-19. The proposed method allows for insights 251 regarding the association of the number of deaths and staying at home levels between 252 countries/regions with similar/different degrees of COVID-19 control. 253A flowchart of the data manipulation is depicted in Figure 1 The global comparison yielded 3,741 combinations; from these, 184 (4.9%) had a p-value < 297 0.05, after correcting for False Discovery Rate (Table S3) . After performing the residual 298 analysis, by testing for cointegration between response and covariate, normality of the residuals, 299presence of residual autocorrelation, homoscedasticity, and functional specification, only 63 300showing the comparison between the 87 regions is presented in Figure 2 . 304Brewer 2003). 376There are strengths to highlight. Inclusion criteria and the Healthcare Access and Quality Index 377 were incorporated. We obtained representative regions throughout the world, including major 378 cities from 4 different continents. Special attention was given to compiling and analyzing the 379 dataset. We also devised a tailored approach to deal with challenges presented by the data. To 380 our knowledge, our modeling approach is unique in pooling information from multiple countries 381 all at once using up-to-date data. Some criteria, such as population density, percentage of urban 382 population, HDI, and HAQI, were established to compare similar regions. Finally, we gave 383 special attention to the residual analysis in the linear regression, an absolutely essential aspect of 384 studies using small samples. 385In conclusion, using this methodology and current data, in ~98% of the comparisons using 87 386 different regions of the world we found no evidence that the number of deaths/million is reduced 387 by staying at home. Regional differences in treatment methods and the natural course of the virus 388 may also be major factors in this pandemic, and further studies are necessary to better understand 389 it. 390Approach for analyzing the time series data 606Time series on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/millions) display a non-stationary pattern.

Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation 57 data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which 58 To infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled phylogenetic tree, we selected global 181 reference sequences used for the Nextstrain analysis specific for South America as of 182To obtain an estimate of the number of independent introductions of SARS-204Pocitos, Malvin, Reducto (all in Montevideo), and Rivera ( Figure S5A) . 285 286surrounding South American countries, resulting in five clusters 288To assess global introductions and the regional spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 289 Uruguay, we performed discrete phylogeographic analysis using BEAST with all 73 290Uruguayan sequences, complemented with 1737 global reference sequences, based on 291 the global subsampling dataset suggested by Nextstrain (Table S2) The results of the discrete phylogeography analysis we performed that 304 considered seven ancestral state locations further revealed that 18 of the 23 independent 305China recorded in mid-November [28] [29] [30] [31] . 316Only five of the 23 independent virus introductions into Uruguay resulted in 317 monophyletic clades with more than two sampled sequences in the country. These 318 clades comprised 21, 18, 5, 4, and 3 sequences, respectively (Figures 3 and 4 , Figure  319 S8), suggesting that these viral outbreaks were maintained by community transmission 320 once introduced into Montevideo. 321To investigate the timing of the introduction of the viruses that founded these 322 five main clades circulating in Montevideo, we estimated the time of their most recent 323 common ancestor (TMRCA), acknowledging that the actual introduction events likely 324 occurred even before the corresponding TMRCAs. 325The TMRCA of the first main clade of 21 sampled sequences, highlighted in red 326in Figure 4 , was estimated to fall between the 2 nd and 5 th of March, 2020 and involved 327 the importation of a GISAID clade S virus. Viruses within this transmission cluster 328 were restricted to Montevideo, where they were distributed among nine of the local 329 neighborhoods, including two Hospitals and one research institute (Figure S8) . A North 330The TMRCA of the second main clade, which comprised of 18 virus sequences, 333 highlighted in yellow in Figure 4 , was estimated to fall between the 13 th and 17 th March 334 2020 and involved the import of a GISAID clade G virus. Viruses within this 335 transmission cluster were restricted to the city of Montevideo, where they were 336 distributed among nine neighborhoods and included samples from two nursing homes 337 and one hospital ( Figure S8) . The viral sequences in this clade were inferred to have a 338South American origin. 339The TMRCA of the third main clade of five sampled sequences, highlighted in 340 blue in Figure 4 and corresponding to a GISAID clade GR, was estimated to fall 341 between March 20 th and May 26th, 2020. This transmission cluster consisted of five 342 viruses from the Hospital de Rivera in Rivera, a small city situated on the border with 343Brazil (Figure S8 ). This clade was inferred to have originated in South America and 344 groups with a sequence from Brazil on the MCC tree suggesting this was the source 345 location for this viral introduction 346The TMRCA of the fourth main clade with four sampled sequences, highlighted 347 in purple in Figure 4 , was estimated to fall between March 14 th and May 20 th , 2020 and 348 involved the introduction of a GISAID clade G virus into Montevideo (Figure 4) . This 349 clade comprised four viruses from within two Montevideo neighborhoods ( Figure S8) . 350The virus responsible for this introduction was also inferred to have originated in South 351Within these five clades we identified a total of ten sequence clusters (sequences 369 from the same institution that group together on the tree), spread across six of the seven 370 health institutions from which we had more than one sample ( Figure S8) . These 371 included one cluster of five GISAID clade GR sequences in the Hospital de Rivera (red 372 dots), two clusters of two clade G sequences in the Hospital Vilardebó (green dots), 373 three clusters each comprised of two clade S sequences in the Institut Pasteur (brown 374 dots), and two clusters from the Asociación Española Primera en Salud (blue dots) 375 comprising two S and two G clade sequences (Figure S8) . 376The availability of study participants' clinical and demographic data combined 379 with mutational data of the infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses enabled us to perform 380 comprehensive correlation analyses (Figures 5 and 6, Figures S9-S11) . Overall, 381The tight network of positive clinical correlations and a more outspread correlation 393 network of clades with regional appearances and selected demographic parameters are 394 shown in greater detail in Figure 6A . Specifically, statistical analyses of lethal outcome 395 as study parameter revealed significant positive correlations with arterial hypertension 396 (AHT), kidney failure and ICU admission complemented by borderline-significant 397 associations with additional clinical parameters (hospitalization, diabetes mellitus II, 398 and obesity) and age, but no association with any specific mutation ( Figure 6B, Figure  399 S10). Accordingly, the spike D614G mutation and clade G-related viruses, in 400 consequence, are not associated with any clinical parameters, severity or lethality. 401 D614G only correlates with co-occurring/inversely occurring mutations, treating 402 healthcare institutions, and time since sampling started ( Figure 6C, Figure S11 ). 403End of March/early April 2020, we observed a subsequent switch in dominance 425 from clade S to clade G-variants (G, GR, and GH) (Figures 1 and 2) . It positioned 426In sum, our characterization of Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics, 534 mutation patterns, and their correlation with demographic and clinical parameters did 535 not identify critical viral attenuations or clinical peculiarities that can primarily account 536 for the exceptionally well curbed regional COVID-19 epidemic [2] . It instead suggests 537 that socio-epidemiologic mitigation strategies managed to curtail COVID-19 to 538 restricted regional transmission clusters in Uruguay. 539We hope that these findings contribute to define the South American COVID-19 540 outbreak better, to optimize and develop efficient, fast, and low-cost mitigation 541 strategies and diagnostic pipelines for Uruguay and other countries, and to assist 542 physicians dealing with strategies for this and future emerging infections. 543 544 Acknowledgments 545The authors thank all participants who agreed to participate in this study and the 546 healthcare personnel in Uruguay for their dedication to COVID-19 patients' care.

Although a huge effort in many fields of sciences is being made to mitigate its effects, the disease is continuously spreading and, in many regions, a second wave is causing great concerns. The difficulties in controlling the epidemic are in part due to a crucial combination of being highly contagious [1] , having a long incubation period [2] during which contagions are possible a few days before symptoms onset [3] , having mild or asymptomatic cases [1] and also because the diagnosis may take a few days since contacting the Health Care system. In particular, the latter yields that outbreaks spread and epidemic evolves while laboratory results are being processed. This effect being more important in low and medium income countries due to operational and logistic problems, generally caused by technological and economic inequalities [4, 5] .We present in this work a method to mitigate the epidemic effects by estimating the number of COVID-19 cases without having to wait for lab confirmations. This provides the Health Care system a tool to react in advance and evaluate current or next Public Health policies.In mass accidents or major catastrophes Early Warning Systems (EWS) play a key role for disaster mitigation [6] [7] [8] decreasing response times and improving their effectiveness. The main strategy of EWS in infectious disease surveillance is the incorporation of information produced nearly from the infection [9, 10] . In this case, the symptoms onset and their detection by the individual and community health perception is the first detectable signal of cases and, in particular, an outbreak. EWS based on syndromic surveillance have been applied in epidemiological surveillance for early outbreaks identification and confirmation [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . One of the main characteristics of EWS is the utilization of health information provided by the population in order to activate local alarms. Nowadays, with the wide use of cell phone applications and specific health-system phone lines, important databases with information about syndromic surveillance are generated each day [16] . Geo-location plays a main role is spatial and temporal definition of the outbreaks detected by EWS [17] .In Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), the COVID-19 phone line 148 is one of the first contacts between a person that believes to be infected and the Health Care System. The trained Health Care team receives and responds to people questions generating, simultaneously, a syndromic surveillance database. If the person has symptoms that could indicate a COVID19 infection, it is instructed to follow the corresponding protocol. Importantly, such syndromic database was used as input for estimation of cases and outbreak detection in Buenos Aires Province.This work is divided as follows. In Section 2 we describe the COVID-line data and present the details of the mathematical model to estimate the number of cases using the phone calls data. In Section 3 we show how the model works in Buenos Aires Province and how it can be used to track on-stream the epidemic. In Section 4 we present the Early Outbreak Alarm and show its details in Villa Azul (Quilmes) case. We discuss the limitations and current improvements of the model in Section 5, and we present our conclusions in section 6. Figure 1 : COVID-line 148 workflow. As people call the COVID-line upon their health perception, the COVID-trained operators determine whether they correspond to suspicious or close-contact case. In such a case, their record is passed to the Epidemiological Surveillance team and a COVID-19 swabbing is ordered. Some days later the swabbing lab result is added to the corresponding record. The algorithm described in this paper works with the first part of the information which is delivered on-stream as the operators determine the case passes the corresponding threshold.2 Estimating on-stream COVID-19 cases through calls to a COVID-lineWe describe the mathematical model implemented to relate phone calls to a COVID-line to lab-confirmed cases per district per day. In the following paragraphs we outline the functioning of the 148 COVID-line and then we describe the details of the model.The COVID-line grew in personal as the epidemic spread in PBA. The call request grew from a few hundreds per day at March up to approximately 20k per day at the end of August. Until late June the system was not outperformed and all calls requiring assistance were taken. We therefore consider that during this regime an indicator coming from this COVID-line would be relatively unbiased. This is specially true if one compares this to other indicators as testing, or lab processing, which were changing their behavior considerably as epidemic spread during this period. We find that April 1st to June 26th is a period in which the COVID-line has been relatively stable to major changes.As people call the COVID-line 148, they enter into an automatic voice menu in which one of the options corresponds to COVID-like symptoms. As user go into this option their call is taken by a COVID-trained operator and a short questionnaire on their experience indicates whether the call does not pass the threshold to be registered or corresponds to one of the two registered categories: close-contact and suspicious case. If the call corresponds to any of these categories, then the operator registers their data and in particular the district from which they are calling. We depict in Fig. 1 the workflow of the COVID-line. At the early stage that the system was implemented, the record did not include trustful information on the exact address of the user. This crucial fact led us to develop the system we explain below by restricting our information on the user to only their district. Although future upgrades on the system are providing more accurate location of the call, the current work restricts to the caller district and only once their call is taken by a COVID-trained operator.We present the mathematical model to estimate the new infected using the phone call data, and apply it to PBA. The reasoning in this section follows the same lines as in Ref. [18] , but with different purposes and different filtering in the data set.We consider a data set of calls from many districts and during a given time range to a COVID-line. Each one of these calls can either be background: people with similar symptoms but not infected signal: people infected with COVID-19.Where N This fit works better if all chunks correspond to periods in which the testing methods have not changed drastically, as it can be for instance if the number of daily tests is modified considerably, or if new symptoms are considered as threshold for testing, among others. The reason for requiring this is to have a coherent balance between the number of infected reported and the number of calls in all chunks all the time. With this objective, is better to re-fit the parameters every time there are major changes in the testing and reporting methods.Once the parameters θ p,I in Eq. 1 have been fitted, including their uncertainty from the fit, we can estimate the number of new infected in a given chunk as n (j)Observe that the Right Hand Side requires data that is obtained in the same day, and therefore one can estimate the number of cases n I on-stream, without need of waiting the laboratory results. Notice, that the algorithm allows to estimate the total number of new cases in each chunk, but not to determine which of the calls correspond to the new cases. The uncertainty in the estimation n (j) I is computed by applying the usual error expansion formula on Eq. 2. If variables are correlated, as for instance θ p and θ I , one should take this into account, however in our case we neglected this correlation in comparison to other terms. For the parameters θ p,I we use the uncertainty coming from the fit, for N c we use Poisson uncertainty, and for N p one should decide whether to add a systematic uncertainty or only use Poisson, as we did in this work. As discussed below, uncertainties in the estimations play a central role in the design of the Early Outbreak Alarm, and therefore should be handled with care, specially the systematic ones if present.In order to show the robustness of the hypotheses, we show how this model works with data from May 1st to June 26th, divided in two equal length time-windows each. We consider all districts in PBA whose number of calls in these chunks is greater than 100. After this filtering we are left with 43 chunks, i.e. 43 data points. After performing the fit indicated in Eq. 1 we obtain θ p = (5.16 ± 1.59) × 10 −6 calls per inhabitant per day θ I = 0.69 ± 0.05 calls per infected people It is worth noticing that the precise values of these fitted coefficients have a strong dependence on the process of call filtering and call system architecture. In particular, these values differ from those in Ref. [18] because we are considering a different level of filtering to obtain the district of each user. The fit for this data set yields a coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.91, which indicates the robustness of the involved hypotheses. In Fig. 2 we show the comparison between data and fit for the number of phone-calls, as posed in Eq. 1.The mathematical model described in the previous section provides a framework to estimate many days in advance the number of lab-confirmed cases per day, as a function of the spatiotemporal distribution of phone calls to the COVID-line. This is a compelling achievement because the phone call information is available on-stream, whereas lab confirmation of cases may require from a few days to up to a week since patient report their first symptoms. Along this section we show how this system can be used to have an estimate of the epidemic evolution on-stream, along with real case results in PBA.As this system was developed there was no time for validation. However, obtaining a very satisfactory R 2 0.85 in the fit was a signal that the model was insofar working well. As months went by, we had the possibility of comparing in a long range time-window the model estimation against the measured lab-confirmed number of cases per day per district.In Fig. 3 we show the comparison between the estimation and the late lab-confirmed cases per day for two any districts in PBA. Similar results are obtained for other districts. Is central to observe in this figure that the number of lab-confirmed cases (red line) is an information that is available many days after the corresponding date, whereas the model estimation (blue) is available at the end of each day. As it can be seen in the figure the estimation has a good agreement with the real data. There are a few date ranges in which door-to-door swabbing through DETECTAR operatives [19] induce an expected sub-estimation in cases.This syndromic surveillance has been used to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks, to monitor disease trends, and to provide reassurance that potential outbreak has not occurred. In particular, it has also been very useful as an early outbreak detection, as we detail in next section. Syndromic surveillance systems seek to use existing health data in real time to provide immediate analysis and feedback to those in charge with investigation and follow-up of potential outbreaks. Particularly, the data collected by the COVID-line calls proved to be a valuable and reliable input to track the epidemic along the PBA.Along this section we detail a compelling by-product of the model in Section 2 to detect COVID-19 outbreaks considerably earlier than through lab confirmation. We briefly describe the working of the model and then provide its detail through the description of a real case that occurred in mid May in Villa Azul (Quilmes) and Villa Itatí (Avellaneda) in PBA.Provided the on-stream estimation of the cases per day in each district, we are interested in developing a statistical and automatic tool that can trigger an alarm when a potential outbreak is on rise. Having an early alarm on this kind of epidemiological features is a crucial tool to avoid its spread and drastic consequences.To detect a potential outbreak there are many indicators that should be simultaneously analyzed. On one hand it is important to have an estimation of the daily absolute and relative number of cases, and on the other hand is also important to have an estimation on the daily variation of these observables. To have an objective quantitative indicator of the potential of an outbreak in a given region, it is essential to have a correct assessment of the uncertainties in all the estimations of the model. Along the system implemented as an Early Outbreak Alarm, we have considered that the important indicator is the significance of all the basic indicators which signal an anomaly as they depart from zero. Here significance is defined as the distance to zero from the central value of the indicator, measured in units of its uncertainty. Or, in other words,As it can be seen in Eq. 3, the correct computation of the uncertainties (or error bars) is crucial for the functioning of the Early Outbreak Alarm.The developed algorithm computes everyday the estimation for the total number of new cases in each district in PBA. Since in the studied time-window, specially before June, the number of estimated cases per day of many districts were below ∼ 5 − 10, we considered to include the estimation of cases for the last two days. This would reduce the relative Poisson uncertainty due to small numbers. We computed the number of estimated cases in absolute value, and also relative to 100k inhabitants to be equally sensitive to all districts.A third and decisive observable that signals the level of danger of an outbreak is the daily increase of estimated cases. Given the daily estimation provided by the mathematical model, we can recognize a rapidly increasing curve in many ways. We have considered to fit a straight line to the case estimation for the last three days and use the slope of this line as an estimation of the central value of the daily increase. We also use the significance as the most relevant indicator to decide the level of danger of each district. In this case, the computation of the error bar in the slope of the line includes all the uncertainties in each day estimation included in the computation of the fit uncertainty through the least squares residuals. We use three days to fit a line because is the minimum time needed to see a two-day consecutive increase, while being still well ahead of the laboratory results. In addition, three days is also a good time-window for the specific COVID-19 characteristics.We report the details of one of the outbreaks indicated by the Early Outbreak Alarm in mid-May in Quilmes district. This case was the first major outbreak in a low-income neighborhood in PBA and had a great impact in the news [20] , not only for its magnitude but also because of its early detection that drove a strict lock-down and isolation of the outbreak to control its spread to the close neighborhoods. Figure 4 : Cases-per-day estimation using the model on the COVID-line phone calls for the last two days. Observe that districts are not sorted by their central value, but by their significance, which is defined as the rate between the central value and the uncertainty. This is why error bars are crucial to provide an Early Outbreak Alarm. Results are shown in absolute value (left) and relative to every 100k inhabitants (right). In the figure we show the scenario for May 20th in which Quilmes is almost as large as La Matanza in absolute value, with ∼ 1/3 of its population. Whereas Quilmes is in the top position when scaled to relative per 100k inhabitants.These observations indicated in advance by the Early Outbreak Alarm needed to be verified by an independent complementary indicator. On the following day a DETECTAR operative [19] was sent to Villa Azul, where the acute situation was verified and door-to-door swabbing with urgent lab results started right away. As first results were confirming the outbreak in Villa Azul, the PBA Administration decided a strict lock-down and isolation for 14 days since may 24th [20] .Villa Azul (Quilmes) and Villa Itatí (Avellaneda) are two adjacent low-income neighborhoods. The last demographic analysis indicates that Villa Azul has a population of 3.128 and Villa Itatí 15.142. High density building and housing, and tiny streets bring the population into close contact. These characteristics make these neighborhoods susceptible to a fast spread [21] . Taking this into account, early outbreak detection implies a main challenge in these complex cases where detection and propagation block must be done when the first few cases are reported. In particular, the above described early alarm for the outbreak occurred in Villa Azul allowing a fast response of the Health Care System team to mitigate and control its propagation to Villa Itatí.Once produced the strict lock-down and isolation, water and food-supply were delivered by the social care-team. People were not allowed to leave the house during the entire isolation. Active surveillance health teams started with a door-to-door symptoms monitoring. Those cases with clinical manifestation related to COVID-19 were tested. Confirmed cases were isolated inside their houses in cases where this was possible (if there was an empty room for example) and in cases where it was not, the people were sent to an out-of-Hospital center.The development of the mathematical model to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases was done in urgency and adapting it to the available data. There was no time to request changes in data acquisition nor processing. Of course the algorithm and the system can be improved in many directions. We discuss some of these features in the following paragraphs.One of the major weakness in the algorithm is the large granularity, which corresponds to districts. Districts population in the relevant area are in average 500k people. This issue is translated in that the Early Outbreak Alarm stops working once the density of cases is such that there are more than a few outbreaks in each district. This happened in late June in PBA. In a future implementation we are carrying out a workaround for this issue by obtaining a trustful address from the COVID-trained operator that takes de call. A more stable solution would be to obtain this information from the telephone company, however regulations many times block this possibility.On the other hand, the algorithm has a very important benefit that is its unbiasedness. Given that the COVID-line works 24 hours the 7 days of the week and with a fair equal methodology all the time, the algorithm estimation does not rely on tests availability or overloaded testing facilities, among others. Of course, the system does have slight biases that may come -for instance-from different backgrounds due to different features in the districts, or seasonally social behavior as months go by. Some of these biases may be solved by re-fitting the model once in a while, others by fitting different models in different regions.Importantly, the algorithm provides information about the background calls that vary in space and time. Further studies could be done in order to understand and extract properties of the background, as it can be its seasonality, variations according to regions, to public announcements or news, etc.The crucial point in the mathematical model is that recognizes anomalies due to collective behaviors. Therefore, we find that the mathematical model and the Early Outbreak Alarm algorithms can be useful for many other epidemiological diseases -as for instance Dengue-, and other events such as natural catastrophes, among others. We are currently working in the improvement of this system in many aspects, also including Machine Learning algorithms, and these advancements will be published in a future work.Along the manuscript the model, its estimations, and how we compute their error bars were described. Also, it has been shown how the estimations, which are obtained in-stream, can be used to address Public Health policies without requiring to wait for lab results, which require many more days to converge. The algorithm worked in PBA from April to June, since during this time the COVID-trained call center was not overloaded. Therefore the estimation was relatively unbiased.We have shown how this estimation can be used to create an Early Outbreak Alarm. Furthermore, we describe how the construction of indicators that have to do with daily cases, and daily increase of cases, can indicate outbreaks in advance. The relevant statistic variable in this case is the significance, since it is a real measure on how far from zero are the indicators. Importantly, this system can detect an outbreak and, in particular, we exemplify its application in the outbreak detection in Villa Azul (Quilmes).The limitations on the Early Outbreak Alarm were discussed in this paper, many of them because of the characteristics of the data available at the moment of its (urgent) development. We have pointed out many ways to improve its sensitivity and accuracy, on which we are currently working. This alarm would also be useful, not only for other epidemiological diseases, but also for events that yield changes in collective behavior, such as Dengue epidemic, natural catastrophes, or others.The presented algorithm and mathematical model have been one of the main tools in the PBA Health Care system dashboard during the epidemic, and its current and upgrade versions are still being used to track the epidemic and detect outbreaks.","Argentina","abstract","2020-10-13",10

RNA separation from other macromolecules is often achieved by a combination of pH and organic solvents, such as phenol/chloroform [13] [14] [15] [16] . RNA concentration is most commonly achieved by high salt and isopropanol or ethanol precipitation 11, 12, [17] [18] [19] [20] .We reviewed the published literature to search for procedures of RNA extraction that could potentially be used to replace commercial kits. Many different protocols and variations have been published over the years that optimize or simplify the RNA extraction process from various types of samples. We tested five types of procedures to identify an efficient procedure for extracting RNA from clinical samples that is compatible with downstream RT-qPCR analysis. Of the procedures evaluated, a simple method based in acid pH separation of RNA was found the most suitable. It can be carried out in approximately 40 min for ten samples, and is not more laborious than current methods using commercial kits. This procedure requires reagents and equipment that can be found in any standard molecular biology laboratory, thus avoiding supply chain issues. The resulting RNA can be used to detect SARS-CoV2 by standard RT-qPCR testing protocols with robust results comparable to those obtained using commercial RNA-extraction kits.Screening of alternative procedures for RNA extraction. For validation of the RNA extraction procedures, the RNase P target was amplified in a one-step RT-qPCR reaction, as quality control for the extraction method. As shown in Fig. 1 , three of the five procedures evaluated yielded enough RNA to amplify the target gene, whereas two of them did not. The TRIzol approach was most effective, exhibiting the highest yield when amplifying the human RNase P target (Fig. 1) . The BSA-based protocol also allowed for amplification of the RNase P target, albeit with a lower yield and significant variability among replicates (Fig. 1) . Acid pH-based method also allowed amplification of the RNase P target, though with lower yields when compared to the TRIzol method (Fig. 1) . The direct method and high-temperature method did not yield enough RNA to amplify the RNase P gene under our experimental conditions. While TRIzol appears to be the best experimental procedure in terms of yield, it is not easy to use for a diagnostics laboratory setting as it requires a chemical hood for the organic extraction step. Biosafety cabinets class II (BSL-2) necessary for operator protection are not appropriate for working with organic solvents. BSA, TRIzol, and acid pH procedures provided comparable yields, but the acid pH method was more consistent among replicates. Based on these considerations, we decided to validate the acid pH method to extract RNA from clinical samples, using High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) as the gold standard.Validation of the acid pH RNA extraction method in clinical samples. To validate the acid pH method of RNA extraction, RT-qPCR using TaqMan probes and primers recommended by the CDC were used 21 . The nucleocapsid viral proteins N1 and N2 were amplified as viral targets, and RNase P was also amplified as a control. We analyzed 50 clinical samples: 22 were positive, 11 were undetermined, and 17 were negative according to RT-qPCR recommended by CDC 21 , using RNA extracted with High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). Undetermined samples are described as having a viral load around the limit of detection (LOD) of the RT-qPCR method that was reported as 10 0.5 RNA copies/µl 21 . This means that the RT-qPCR method can detect 16 RNA copies per PCR reaction. The PCR test used detects 2 targets of the virus: N1 and N2. The mean Cq value for N1 target reported for sets of dilutions that are ≥ 95% positive is around 36 21 . Therefore we analyzed the efficiency of both extraction methods in two different groups of samples: those with Cq N1 ≤ 36 and those with Cq N1 > 36. The results for the 50 samples are shown in Table 1 . For samples with Cq N1 ≤ 36 there were no differences in Cq Fig. 2A ). In contrast, for samples with Cq N1 > 36, Cq values for N1 and N2 were higher for High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) than those obtained with acid pH method (p = 0.026 and p = 0.022 respectively) (Fig. 2B ). For samples with Cq N1 ≤ 36, Cq values for RNase P were slightly higher for acid pH method (p = 0.021), whereas for samples with Cq N1 > 36 there was no significant difference between both methods. The percentage of agreement between both methods was calculated considering samples whose report changed from positive, undetermined or negative. In total, 8 samples changed their report. The 17 negative samples were also negative using RNA extracted with the acid pH method. Out of 22 positive samples, 21 were also positive using RNA extracted with the acid pH method, whereas one sample was undetermined. Out of 11 undetermined samples analyzed, 4 were still undetermined using RNA extracted with the acid pH method. However, 3 of them were negative and 4 of them were positive. Agreement for negative samples was 100%. The percentage of agreement for samples with Cq N1 ≤ 36 was 89.5%. As expected, the percentage of agreement for samples with Cq N1 > 36 was only 57%. Importantly, the processing time and laboriousness of the acid-pH method is similar or less than that of High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) method. A detailed scheme of the method is shown in Fig. 3 .Here we tested several kit-free RNA extraction methods compatible with RT-qPCR analysis and selected one simple procedure based on RNA extraction using acid pH. We validated this method using 50 clinical samples with results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. There are three key aspects of this method that must be pointed out. First, the acid pH-based methods that we reviewed 12, 14, 22 are intended for RNA extraction from tissue, cultured cells, and cell-associated virus. Therefore, the first step of these protocols is centrifugation with subsequent lysis of the cell pellet. However, we need to recover free viral particles in solution, which do not sediment after routine centrifugation at 15,000 g. For this reason we used the uncentrifuged sample directly mixed with lysis buffer, with subsequent precipitation of viral RNA in the whole mix volume. Using uncentrifuged sample is the key step for efficient RNA recovery because when centrifuged sample was used in preliminar www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tests, Cq values were much higher than those obtained with High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). Second, the acid pH method uses the anionic detergent Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that can lyse cells and viral coats through disruption of noncovalent bonds in proteins causing them to lose their native conformation 12 . Third, low pH and high concentration of salt make possible the selective recovery of RNA. Within the pH range of 5.5 to 6.0, RNA degradation is minimized 22 . RNA phosphodiester bond is more stable at acidic than alkaline pH, where it is susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis at pH greater than 6 23 . Acid hydrolysis can only occur at pH lower than 2 12, 24 . Moreover, DNA and RNA have different solubility at different pH, mainly due to the 2′ hydroxyl group of RNA, which increases the polarity of this nucleic acid 25, 26 . Therefore, it is essential to adjust the Lysis Buffer to pH 5, as described in materials and methods It is worth mentioning that all of the samples that changed their report had Cq values that were around the cutoff value of 40. These changes occurred in both directions, meaning that some Cqs increased and some Cqs decreased. It would have been very clarifying to perform triplicated RNA extractions, in particular for undetermined samples, whose viral load is around the detection limit. Because of the above exposed information we consider the acid pH method robust and reliable. In fact, it is currently being used in our diagnostic laboratory since the 3 rd week of April 2020 for routine detection of SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples.The RNA extraction procedure with acid pH described here has many advantages over commercial kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 in the context of the current pandemic. This experimental procedure utilizes low cost reagents and equipment that can be found in standard molecular biology laboratories. The cost of extraction is a critical issue in most clinical laboratories, and the cost of our in-house method is around ten times lower than extraction kits. Moreover, DNase treatment is not necessary because SARS-CoV-2 detection is not altered in the presence of DNA. In fact, residual DNA may serve as the template for RNase P gene amplification. Because of current environmental concerns, we would also like to highlight the lower plastic contamination generated by this in-house method. Column-based extraction kits use several disposable tubes per sample, columns, bottles of buffer solutions, and plastic bags. Our in-house extraction method is by far, much more environmental friendly; it requires only two Eppendorf tubes per sample. Finally, our in-house method is comparable in hands-on time to commercial kits: it can be carried out in approximately 40 min for a set of 10 samples. However, it is important to mention that additional care must be taken in handling to avoid cross-contamination between samples.In conclusion, the RNA extraction procedure with acid pH described here is an excellent alternative to commercial systems to test for SARS-CoV2. Our results support a new method for RNA extraction from swab samples www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that can be used to detect SARS-CoV2 by standard RT-qPCR testing protocols. This procedure can be a helpful alternative for laboratories facing supply-chain disruption and commercial kit shortages.Biological samples. Two types of biological samples were used. For preliminary evaluation of the RNA extraction methods we used saliva samples obtained from two asymptomatic volunteers. Saliva is routinely collected for the initial assessment of viral infection. Two saliva samples were obtained from each volunteer and at least three independent RNA extractions were performed from each sample, obtaining a minimum of six RNA preparations to test each experimental procedure. For validation of the RNA extraction method selected, we used nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Swabs were obtained from 50 patients that attended the outpatient service of Red Salud UC-CHRISTUS (Santiago, Chile) because of suspected coronavirus infection. Only one sample was obtained per patient: one portion of the sample was extracted using the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche), and another portion of the same sample was extracted using the acid pH method. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians. Samples were processed in the Laboratory of Diagnostic Microbiology of the same institution. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.RNA extraction methods evaluated. The following experimental procedures were tested in this study.Saliva samples were centrifuged before taking an aliquot of supernatant for processing as described below.(1) TRIzol. The standard TRIzol-based method was evaluated 9, 11, 18 . First, 800 µL of TRIzol were added to 200 µL of sample and vortexed briefly. Then, 200 μL of chloroform were added, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase (600 μL) was recovered in a clean tube containing 600 μL of isopropanol. The tube was mixed by inversion and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.The tube was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 500 μL of 70% ethanol, centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was dried at room temperature for 10 min and resuspended in 25 μL of RNase-free water by incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. (3) Acid pH-based method. Under acidic pH, RNA can be separated from DNA and other molecules due to the differential polarity given by its hydroxyl groups, which maintains it in solution 12, 22, 25, 26, 29 . Based on the methods described by Heath (1999) 22 , Sambrook and Russell (2001) 12 , and Chomczynski and Sacchi (2006) 14 , 300 µL of pH 5 Lysis Buffer (69,4 mM SDS, 68 mM sodium citrate dihydrate, 132 mM anhydrous citric acid and 10 mM EDTA, then adjust the buffer to pH 5) were added to 200 µL of uncentrifuged sample and mixed by pipetting three times. Then, 150 µL of Precipitation Buffer (17 mM sodium citrate dihydrate, 33,3 mM anhydrous citric acid, and 4 M NaCl) were added and mixed by inversion 10 times. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 3 min at room temperature. 600 μL of the supernatant were transferred to a clean tube containing 600 μL of isopropanol and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. A new centrifugation step was made at 15,000 g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet washed with 300 μL of cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 3 min at room temperature. Supernatant was discarded and tubes were inverted in paper towel. The pellet was dried, leaving the tubes open for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μL of nuclease-free water pre-warmed at 70 °C. NOTE: If the buffer is stored for later use, it precipitates at 4 °C, so it needs to be heated for 5 min at 60 °C for its use.(4) High temperature-based method. Based on the method described by Fomsgaard and Rosenstierne (2020) 30 , 50 µL of the sample were directly heated at 98 °C for 5 min and cooled at 4 °C. Then 19 µL of the sample were mixed with 1 µL of BSA (20 mg/mL) and kept on ice for immediate use or at -80 °C for later use. (5) Direct use of the samples. An aliquot taken from the original sample was directly used to perform RT-qPCR analysis 31 .The 50 nasopharyngeal swabs used for the validation of the RNA extraction method selected, were extracted using High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. This RNA extraction method was considered as the gold standard for comparison purposes, and it is based in capture of RNA using columns with silica filters.RT-qPCR analysis. For preliminary evaluation of RNA extraction procedures, we used RT-qPCR against the human RNAse P gene with primers and a Taqman probe previously described 32 . RP1-F: AGA TTT GGA CCT GCG AGC G, RP1-R: GAG CGG CTG TCT CCA CAA GT, and RP1-probe: TTC TGA CCT GAA GGC TCT GCGCG. The RNase P gene is used as an internal control because many copies of it exist in the human genome, and it is readily detectable. The source of RNase P comes from the human cells that are present in every sample used. It is assumed that if human nucleic acids were extracted to detect the human gene RNase P, viral nucleic acids were Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:16608 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73616-w www.nature.com/scientificreports/ also successfully extracted. The RNase P target is also amplified as a quality control for the extraction method and to corroborate the absence of PCR-inhibitors in the sample. For RT-qPCR 5 μL of RNA from saliva samples, 2 μL of RNase-Free water, 1 μL of each RNase P primer, 1 μL of TaqMan RNase P probe and 10 μL of 2X TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), were used in a final reaction volume of 20 μL performed in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).For validation of the selected RNA extraction procedure, RT-qPCR using Taqman probes and primers recommended by the CDC was used 21 . Two viral targets were amplified: the nucleocapsid viral proteins N1 and N2. Primers and probe for N1 were N1-F: GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT, N1-R: TCT GGT TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT CTG , and N1-probe: FAM-ACC CCG CAT TAC GTT TGG TGG ACC -BHQ1. Primers and probe for N2 were N2-F: TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA, N2-R: GCG CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA , and N2-probe: FAM-ACA ATT TGC CCC CAG CGC TTCAG-BHQ1. Primers and probe for RNase P were RP2-F: AGA TTT GGA CCT GCG AGC G, RP2-R: GAG CGG CTG TCT CCA CAA GT, and RP2-probe: FAM-TTC TGA CCT GAA GGC TCT GCGCG-BHQ1. A one-step RT-qPCR reaction was performed in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Cutoff points for Cq values (Cycle of quantification, or Cycle Threshold) required to decide whether a result is COVID-19 positive or negative were those specified by CDC as follows. To report a positive result, both viral targets N1 and N2 must be Cq < 40. To report a negative result both viral targets must be Cq ≥ 40. If one of the viral targets is Cq < 40 and the other is Cq ≥ 40, the result must be reported as undetermined. The RNase P target must be Cq ≤ 35.Mean Cq values obtained through both methods for each target gene were analyzed in pairwise comparisons using a paired Student's t-test. The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software.","Chile","first author","2020-10-06",10

Sedentary behaviour, especially TV-viewing, is associated with increased energy intake (4) , which can be through different mechanisms as the higher consumption of ultra-processed foods while watching TV, as well as higher exposure to ultraprocessed advertises (5) (6) (7) . In addition, other types of sedentary behaviours that become more frequent with social restriction measures (e.g. computer, tablet and smartphone) can also be associated with poor dietary habits given the new routine found during the quarantine.However, the association between changes in sedentary/screen behaviours and incidence of poor dietary habits during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. In this study, we aimed at analysing the association of change patterns on TV-viewing and computer/tablet use and the incidence of elevated consumption of ultra-processed food consumption and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesise those participants with increased TV-viewing and computer/tablet use are more likely to also increase the frequency of ultra-processed food consumption and reduce the consumption of fruits and vegetables.This was a national cross-sectional behavioural web survey, with retrospective information. Data collection was conducted between 24 April and 24 May 2020. The invitation of participants was through a chain sampling procedure. In the first stage, fifteen researchers involved in the study chose a total of 200 other researchers from different states in Brazil. Also, each researcher in the study chose twenty people from their social network, making a total of 500 people chosen. The people chosen in the first stage were called as seeds of the chain recruitment. These seeds sent the survey link to at least twelve people from their social networks, obeying a stratification by sex, age range (18-39; 40-59; 60þ years) and educational level (incomplete high school or less; complete high school or more). In addition, information about the Behaviour Survey was circulated through press releases, social communications from participating research institutions, state health departments and social media. All procedures were approved by the National Research Ethics Commission (CONEP) (process: 30598320.1.0000.5241). The total sample was composed of 45 160 participants. The sample was weighted (through the use of sampling weights) according to characteristics from the National Household Sample Survey (2019), considering the population in each state, education, age, sex and prevalence of chronic diseases, aiming to let the sample nationally representative.Ultra-processed food and fruit and vegetable consumption Ultra-processed food and fruit and vegetable consumption were assessed by asking about the frequency of eating fruits, vegetables, sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods. We classified risk behaviour as those reporting eating fruits or vegetables <5 d/week as well as eating at least one ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) 5 or more d/week, which were classified according to the NOVA classification (8) . For the purposes of this study, for ultra-processed food analysis, we only classified those without elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption before the quarantine, and for fruit and vegetable analysis, those without low frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption before the quarantine.For TV-viewing, participants were asked: 'Usually, before the pandemic, how many hours a day did you used to spend watching television?' and 'During the pandemic, how many hours a day have you been watching television?'. Possible answers for both are (1) none;(2) <1 h/d; (3) between 1 and <2 h/d; (4) between 2 and <3 h/d; (5) between 3 and <4 h/d; (6) between 4 and <5 h/d; (7) between 5 and <6 h/d; (8) 6 h/d or more. Also, computer/tablet use was assessed using two questions 'Usually, before the pandemic, how many hours a day did you used to spend using a computer or tablet?' and 'During the pandemic, how many hours a day did you used to spend using a computer or tablet?' with open answer. TV-viewing and computer/tablet use were classified using the cut-off point of 4 h/d in both moments (before and during the quarantine), especially considering the elevation in the incidence of CVD and mortality risk (9) (10) (11) . TV-viewing and computer/tablet use patterns were created using four change patterns: (1) Consistently low; (2) Become low (High to low); (3) Become high (Low to high) or (4) Consistently high.We used sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during the quarantine, skin colour, diagnoses of COVID-19 on a close friend, co-worker or relative and adherence to the quarantine as covariates. The highest academic achievement was classified as incomplete high school, complete high school and college education or more. Per capita income before the pandemic was estimated through the total income of all members of the household divided by the number of members and classified as lower than one minimum wage (approximately 200 dollars), one to two minimum wages and three or more minimum wages. Working status during the quarantine was classified as currently not working, working on a normal routine and home office. Skin colour was classified as white or other. The adherence to the quarantine was classified as positive for those just going grocery stores and pharmacies or stayed strictly at home, leaving only for health care needs; and negative for adherence for those reporting that continued a normal life or tried to stay away from people, reducing contacts a little, not visiting the elderly, but kept working and leaving home as usual.For the ultra-processed food and fruits and vegetable consumption analyses, proportion estimates and 95 % CI of all sample characteristics were calculated. Crude and adjusted models (adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine) were used to analyse the associations of TV-viewing and computer/tablet use patterns with incidence of elevated ultra-processed food consumption and low consumption of fruit and vegetables. All analyses were conducted using the software Stata 15.1.The final sample was composed of 39 208 adults due to missing data. However, 5307 (weighted prevalence: 14·3 %) presented elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption and 26 572 (weighted frequency: 78·0 %) presented low consumption of fruit and vegetable before the pandemic and were excluded from the specific analyses. Therefore, the final sample was composed of 33 901 adults for ultra-processed food consumption and 12 636 adults for the low consumption of fruits and vegetables analysis. The samples for both analyses were similar, except for age group (sample of fruit and vegetable consumption analysis was slightly younger) and highest academic achievement (sample of fruit and vegetable consumption analysis presented slightly higher frequency of more than high school) ( Table 1 ). The prevalence of participants who started consuming elevated ultra-processed (Table 1) . Only participants who presented high TV-viewing incidence were at risk for elevated frequency of ultraprocessed food consumption incidence (OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·37, 2·12) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables incidence (OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·23) ( Table 2) . Participants with consistently high computer/tablet use (OR 1·58; 95 % CI 1·24, 2·01) and those becoming high computer/tablet use (OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·31, 2·27) were at risk for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption incidence, while only those with high computer/ tablet use were at risk for low consumption of fruit and vegetables incidence when comparing with the consistently low computer/tablet use group (OR 1·53; 95 % CI 1·08, 2·17).Our main findings were that participants who started to present elevated TV-viewing were more likely to present incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption and low fruit and vegetable consumption. However, this association was not clear for considering the computer/tablet use patterns, in which participants who started to have computer/tablet high use and those with consistently high computer/tablet use presented higher odds for incidence of poor dietary habits.The COVID-19 pandemic promoted several changes in health behaviours such as the reduction of physical activity, an increase in sedentary behaviour and an increase in the consumption of unhealthy foods (3) . However, our findings highlighted that people with high TV-viewing incidence were more likely to present incidence of unhealthy diet behaviours. The difference between computer/tablet use and TV-viewing can be in the co-occurrence of unhealthy foods such as snacks while watching TV (5, 6) . Also, 14·2 % of the advertises of free-to-air TV channels from Brazil were food-related, and approximately 90 % of the food-related advertises were of ultra-processed food (12) , which can also lead to higher consumption of ultra-processed food as well as lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (7) . Given the negative effects of the sedentary behaviours and unhealthy diet for health, these findings highlight the need to identify and to intervene on population groups that presented higher incidence of more than one unhealthy behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially groups at risk for non-communicable diseases.Our findings should be inferred in light of some limitations. Even with the weighting of our sample according to the National Household Sample Survey, the research had a low representativity of individuals with low socioeconomic conditions, illiterate as well as people without access to the internet. Also, the retrospective design and self-reported questionnaires can be associated with recall bias. We were only able to analyse few types of Table 2 Association of TV-viewing and computer/tablet use patterns with incidence of ultra-processed food and low fruit and vegetable consumption* Elevated frequency of ultraprocessed food consumption ultra-processed food and only the frequency of consumption, without information on daily serving and specific energy contribution of each food, and we were not able to estimate the specific contribution of ultra-processed food on daily energy consumption. Moreover, the present research was conducted probably before the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil, which should be considered in the interpretation of our findings. On the other hand, we presented data of a large nationwide sample, which was weighted for being nationally representative assessing the associations between change in sedentary/screen behaviours and incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption and low consumption of fruit and vegetables during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and we consider this as a strength.Thus, participants who started to present high TVviewing and computer/tablet use during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine were more likely to present incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption and low consumption of fruit and vegetables. Our study highlights that policies for the promotion of health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic should focus on multiple behaviours.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-22",10

Patients can present a wide variety of symptoms, and the prognosis varies from mild or moderate illness to severe and death (Guan et al., 2020; He et al., 2020) . A significant percentage of infected are symptomatic, and between 18 and 40% of cases have evidenced to be asymptomatic, a condition that helps the silent spread of the disease (Hadi et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020) .The S protein gives the virus its distinctive crown of spikes and is responsible for binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2), which allows the virus to enter the host cell Zhou et al., 2020b) . These receptors are present in various human cell types, with particular abundance in respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells .Indeed, an analysis of the ACE2 receptor distribution in human tissues found the highest levels of expression in intestine (Vuille-dit-Bille et al.; Zhang et al., 2020) . Although respiratory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f symptoms are the most frequently described in patients with , several studies have shown that the gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis found that 15% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms and that about 10% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms but no respiratory symptoms Liang et al., 2020) .In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in the feces of people without gastrointestinal symptoms (Xu et al., 2020) . It has been found that more than half (55%) of those tested for fecal viral RNAs were positive and noted that the virus is excreted in the feces for long periods, and in some cases, beyond negative testing or with respiratory symptoms (Effenberger et al., 2020) . Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is an epidemiological tool improve predictions and assist in mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks by evaluating biomarkers in a specific community (Daughton, 2020) . The primary advantage is related to minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike (de Lima et al., 2020) . While researchers have evaluated biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 there is no information of how the wastewater microbiome is altered in communities infected by coronavirus or if the enteric bacteria can display species-specific signatures detected in sewage either from symptomatic or asymptomatic patients (Dhar and Mohanty, 2020) . Notably, cumulative evidence has been associated with dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota, and the relationship with pathologies such as obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression states, hypertension among others (Cani, 2018; Cryan et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020) . With this in mind, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these pathologies increase the risk of severe in the human population. Surprisingly, the WBE tool has not yet been integrated with metagenomic analysis based on sequencing DNA technology and risk factors for viral diseases.This novel approach can help epidemiologists and public health officials improve SARS-CoV-2 surveillance outbreak predictions which could lead to better mitigation strategies (La Rosa et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020).In this study, we analyze the microbiome signals using nanopore technology for fulllength 16S rRNA sequencing in samples collected from sewage produced in a residential care home (RCH), a penitentiary (P), and a healthcare facility (HCF). The HCF corresponds to quarantine accommodations, where COVID-19 positive patients stay-short periods in isolation for health recovery. For each location and sampling time-point, wastewaters were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR. The study was conducted from May to August 2020 in Chillan City, southern Chile. This research aimed to evaluate if changes in the sewage microbiota can be associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 in a specific human community. More importantly, if particular bacteria are associated with chronic diseases or risk factors for illness severity in patients with COVID-19. Overall, we provide novel evidence that the wastewater microbiome shows a specific-pattern related to gastrointestinal disorders and appears to precede the SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage. This finding suggests that integrating metagenomic analyses into WBE provided an early indicator for COVID-19 outbreaks.Untreated wastewater (sewage) samples were obtained from May to July 2020 in Chillan (200,000 people), a city in southern Chile. Wastewater operators collected a 24h flowdependent composite sample of 10 L using a submersible in-situ high-frequency autosampler.Samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 °C until further analysis. For this study, three sewage sampled points were selected according to their social isolation level, risk factor, and the confirmation for COVID-19 by qPCR. Herein, for high-isolation level and size. The filtrates were concentrated in Amicon®-50 kDa (Millipore) by centrifugation at 5000xg for 15 min. Finally, 200 µL of concentrate wastewater was used for RNA isolation using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, USA). The concentration and purity of the RNA were determined by Nanodrop™ One/One C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The integrity of total RNA was evaluated by TapeStation Wastewater samples from the three sample points and times were centrifugated at 4500xg for 30 min, and then the supernatant was removed, and the organic pellet was used for DNA isolation using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer""s instructions. DNA integrity was verified by electrophoresis as above mentioned, and concentration measured by fluorescence in a Qubit 4 (ThermoScientific, USA) using the Qubit J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dsDNA BR Assay Kit (ThermoScientific, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.Genomic DNA samples were diluted to 10 ng/µL, and amplification of full-16S rRNA gene was performed by PCR in 25 µL with the 27 F 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ y 1492 R 5′ GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′ primers and Taq DNA polymerase LongAmp (NewEngland Biolabs, USA). PCR conditions were the followings: initial denaturing step at 95 ºC for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 20 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec and 65 °C for 2 min, and an extension at 65 °C for 5 min. PCR products were evaluated by electrophoresis.After confirming the presence of full-16S rRNA amplicon, PCR products were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) in a 1:2 sample-beads ratio. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and the sample placed in the magnetic stand for ethanol washing (freshly prepared at 70%). The washed mixture was resuspended in ultrapure sterilized water, and the purified product was separated from beads by placing it in a magnetic stand. The purified amplicons were used as a template for library synthesis using the 16S Barcoding Kit (SQK-RAB204, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) following the manufacturer""s instructions for 1D sequencing strategy. Purified 16S amplicon was mixed with barcodes accordingly, and using the LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA).PCR was performed with a final reaction volume of 50 µL. The PCR product was purified again with Agencourt AMPure XP beads and incubated in HulaMixer for 5 min. After the magnetic beads washing step, the purified product was eluted in 10 µL of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 with 50 mM NaCl).The final concentration of the library was quantified by fluorometry using Qubit 4 (Thermo Fisher, USA) and evaluated by TapeStation Bioanalyzer 2200 system (Agilent Technologies, USA) using DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. A single library was synthesized from wastewaters DNAs for three J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sample points at three different times. Then libraries were pooled in multiplex mode following the protocol of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and the flowcell MK1 Spot-ON FLO-MIN107-R9 was accordingly loaded. For each sample point, three replicates were sequenced. A total of 36 libraries were run in three flowcells for the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Sequencing efficiency was monitored through the software MinKNOW 2.0 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Finally, as internal control, the DNA of a microbial mock community (ZymoBiomics Microbial Community Standard, USA) was extracted and sequenced following the same described procedures to evaluate the sequencing run accuracy through the observed/expected taxa abundances.After the sequencing runs, the yielded fast5 files were base-called using Guppy (version3.2.2, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK), and a filter step was applied to retain only sequences with Q-score ≥7 (quality filter). Sequences were then evaluated using the Fastq 16S v3.2.1 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) pipeline, which included demultiplexing, primers, and barcode trimming. Sequences with ambiguous identification were excluded from subsequent analysis.BLASTN aligned cleaned sequences against NCBI RefSeq for 16S ribosomal RNA database for bacteria and archaea within the EPI2ME software package (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and only the sequences with identity ≥75% were retained (confidence level filter) as mentioned by Edwards, et al.(2019) . The occurrence of each NCBI taxonomy identifier was evaluated for each sample using R, and the relative abundance of each NCBI taxa id was calculated per sample to normalize. Taxonomical identifiers were ordered, and to minimize singletons, doubletons product of sequencing errors taxon with <0.01% of relative abundance in at least one sample were eliminated. For each sample, an equivalent to OTU (Operative Taxonomic Unit) frequency table J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was built using R, and rarefaction analysis was performed to assess sequencing depth performance. The alpha diversity of microbiota communities associated with wastewater was compared among sample points by calculating the Shannon and Simpson 1-D diversity indices, the Chao-1 richness index and community evenness using ""Vegan"" package in R. The difference among sample points was evaluated with One-Way ANOVA followed by the posthoc multiple comparison Tukey-HSD test when applicable, considering a P-value < 0.05. Microbial community structure was analyzed based on taxon relative abundance data, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were performed as a multivariate unsupervised data exploration.Variations of the microbial community along sample time points were explored by plotting relative bacteria abundance, which corresponded to normalized reads of each taxon by the total of reads of the corresponding sample. Also, multivariate exploratory analyses were performed through PCoA from the microbiome collected in positive and negative sewage samples for SARS-Cov2. Distance between communities of different sample and time points was evaluated at the species level by hierarchical clustering using the UPGMA method. A group of selected species and genera were also evaluated due to previous findings related to COVID-19 outbreaks.Pearson""s correlations between the relative abundance of these bacteria and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the samples were calculated using the R software by the Corrplot package (Wei et al., 2017 ).From May to July 2020 in Chillan, Chile, we monitored wastewater SARS-CoV-2 load from a residential care home (RCH), penitentiary (P), and health care facilities (HCF) selected according to their social isolation level and risk factor. COVID-19 was confirmed by qPCR analysis of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ORFab1 and N protein genes. The quantity of virus genome units per liter of sewage samples was calculated by a 10-log standard curve using 10-fold dilutions of a Positive control TaqMan TM 2019-nCoV Control Kit v1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (Fig. S1 ). The positive control group, HCF, scored positive for SARS-CoV-2 genes with average C T values of 32 and 33 for ORFab1 and N protein genes. These C T values corresponded to an estimated maximum concentration of 1x10 4 Genome Unit/L (Fig. 1) . Samples obtained from RCH, with middleisolation level and high-risk factor, registered an outbreak of COVID-19 from July 10 th to July 21 st (corresponding to week 4 of the study) with C T values between 32 and 33 for both genes to an average virus load of 7x10 3 Genome Unit/L. In addition, penitentiary samples evidenced an outbreak of COVID-19 during July 10 th with a 4x10 3 Genome Unit/L, observing C T values of 35.6 and 33.4 for ORFab1 and N protein genes, respectively. The demography data obtained for each studied location and group of people showed substantial differences in sex proportions, age, and comorbidity. This last characteristic associated with risk factors for COVID-19 indicated less prevalence in youngest individuals and under confinement in prison.Metagenome analyses were conducted in sewage samples collected from the three different sites and four sampling points (Fig. 1) based on Oxford nanopore sequencing. Reads obtained from the DNA sequencing from the different samples collected were annotated through BLASTn against the NCBI RefSeq for 16S ribosomal RNA database for bacteria and archaea, and an equivalent to OTU (Operative Taxonomic Unit) frequency table was built. Rarefaction analysis indicated that all sequenced libraries reached a plateau, indicating that the sequencing effort was enough to capture most of the microbial variability in the samples (Fig. S2 ). In parallel, NCBI Taxonomy J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tree from the wastewater microbiome was produced, indicating high bacterial diversity represented by the most abundant (30) taxa (Fig. 2) .Diversity indexes were calculated based on the generated OTU table. These indexes included Shannon, Simpson's, Evenness, and Chao-1 indexes (Fig. 3) . Even though no significant variations were perceived on Shannon, Simpson's, and Evenness, a marked variation in the Chao-1 index was evidenced in the different sampled sites and points. Thus, an increase in the diversity value from samples collected during the COVID-19 outbreak was observed using one index.Notably, the highest index for the residence care home and the penitentiary was observed at timepoint S3 (Fig. 3d) . Concerning the health care facility (HCF), no differences in taxa diversity during the study were found. Interestingly, a variation in the relative abundance of identified phylum was observed. Specifically, there was a marked reduction in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and corresponding increase in other phylum at the residential care home and the penitentiary during the outbreak (Fig. 3e ).There were substantial differences in microbiota communities in wastewater collected from all locations (Fig. 4) . At the level of species, the penitentiary showed the highest number of exclusive taxa (304); meanwhile, the residence care home and the health care facility samples contained 135 and 45 species. respectively. Notably, a core microbiome was observed with 333 bacterial species (Fig. 4A and Table 1S ). We analyzed samples from all the localities according to the viral quantification with the aim of evaluating differences between exclusives and shared species for wastewaters tested for SARS-CoV-2. Samples collected from locations testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 contained 521 and 198 exclusive taxa, respectively. There were 409 taxa present in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. (Fig.   4B and Table 1S ). Furthermore, the analysis evidenced that exclusives species were most represented in positive samples for coronavirus collected from RCH (25.7%) and P (28,6%) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f locations. Unexpectedly, negative samples for SARS-CoV-2 were associated to exclusives bacterial species from wastewaters collected from the Penitentiary (76.3%). With respect to exclusives bacteria found in HCF, the analysis showed a low representativity either for positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 samples. This analysis also shows that overall high SARS-CoV-2 loads of sewage are associated with infected individuals or communities. (Fig. 5B) . The top species associated with positive samples (particularly samples from HCF in all the sampling times, P and RCH on July 17th) were Arcobacter suis, A. venerupis, A. cloacae, Prevotella copri, A. aquamarines, and Bacteroides vulgatus. Notably, these species were also more abundant in P and RCH sampling points in the sampling time before the first SARS-CoV-2 detection (July 7th) even when the virus was not detected.A subset of bacteria was used to evaluate the association with COVID-19 outbreaks (Zuo et al., 2020) . These taxonomic units were selected according to their functions and previously reported association with SARS-CoV-2 infections, including commensal symbionts and opportunistic pathogens. Relative abundance was calculated, as previously described. Normalized reads of selected bacteria were correlated with viral load values through Pearson""s correlations using all of the data. The commensal symbionts Eubacterium ventriosum, and commensal species from the Roseburia genus and the Lachnospiraceae family were significantly correlated to the viral load in the samples (Fig. 6A) . However, the opportunistic pathogen species Bacteroides nordii, and species from the Rothia and Veilonella genera were positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 levels in the sewage samples.In contrast, pathogens from the Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus genera were negatively correlated with the viral load, and the same was obtained for the commensal species from the Ruminoccoccaceae family. Evaluating how the abundances of this selected subset vary in the different locations, a heatmap of normalized reads was built (Fig. 6B ). In general, the most variable location was the Penitentiary (P), where bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae and Rumnococcaceae families were the most abundant after the COVID-19 outbreak. A similar trend was also obtained for Alistipes genus in this location. Most of the selected bacteria were identified in the sampling point before COVID-19 outbreak detection (July 7th), particularly in the P and RCH locations. The location with constant COVID-19 positive detection (HCF) had lower variations of this group.Our data are consistent with the idea that the wastewater microbiome reveals species-specific profiling associated with human communities where SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, independently J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the symptomatic/asymptomatic status of those individuals. This finding strongly suggests that the virus alters the microbiome of infected individuals similarly to risk factors of severe COVID-19 (Zhou et al., 2020a) . Several studies have implicated the microbiome in a range of physiologic processes that are vital to host health, including energy, metabolism, gastrointestinal health, immune response, and neurophysiology (Cani, 2018; Cryan et al., 2019) . The microbial community supports metabolic interactions connecting those with the host and its physiological state. Notably, the enteric microbiome has an active role in humans' well-being, involving complex molecular signaling between the gut-brain axis (Cryan et al., 2019; Rieder et al., 2017) .Moreover, dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal microbiome is strongly associated with chronic diseases and psychological disorders in humans (Jie et al., 2017; Rieder et al., 2017; Taylor and Holscher, 2020; Villette et al., 2020) . Our study revealed substantial differences in the microbiota associated with wastewaters collected from three communities with different levels of social isolation and risk factors for COVID-19. However, a core microbiota community was significantly found in sewage laboratory-tested for SARS-Cov-2. This finding suggests that the putative microbiome dysbiosis of infected individuals is the primary factor for the wastewater microbiota variations. However, this study does not support how the risk factors for are involved in the magnitude of the microbiota dysbiosis, and consequently, in the wastewater microbiome associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Notably, the demographic data obtained for this study did not indicate a high prevalence of comorbidities related to the Penitentiary population. Unexpectedly, the analysis conducted in wastewaters collected from patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing indicated more exclusive bacterial species than samples associated with individuals negatives for coronavirus. Our results indicate that Simpliscira, Flavobacterium, Acidovorax, and Acinetobacter genera were negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2. aquamarines, and Bacteroides vulgatus appear to precede the SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage.Previous studies have suggested strong correlations among these taxonomic units with chronic diseases such as obesity (Crovesy et al.) , immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017) , and cardiovascular diseases (Tang et al., 2017) .Studies connecting the microbiota with distal organs in regulatory functions such as gutlung axis have revealed a key role in the respiratory system (Groves et al., 2018) . It has been reported that respiratory viral infections alter the gut microbiota, modulating the antiviral immune response through TNF-and CD8 + cells (Groves et al., 2020) . For example, gastric disorders during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza virus infection in mice resulted in significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, increased Bacteroidetes, and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance. Viral infection also led to changes in the fecal gut metabolome, with a significant shift in lipid metabolism. Sphingolipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the short-chain fatty acid valerate were all increased in abundance in the fecal metabolome following RSV infection (Hasegawa et al., 2017) . Our findings showed that Eubacterium ventriosum, and commensal species from the Roseburia genus and the Lachnospiraceae family were significantly correlated to the viral load in wastewater samples.Notably, opportunistic pathogens from the Bacteroides genera showed high modulation during the study, and some species positively correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 levels. This evidence can be connected with a recent study where the sphingosine gene expression was significantly correlated with increased Bacteroides in patients with acute respiratory viral infections (Groves et List of figures Figure 1 .

In order to study the dissemination of this disease, various mathematical models have been proposed and revisited. A large part of these models is based on compartments and relations between the different groups of individuals [5] . As pointed out by Adam [1] , many of the mathematical models used to guide the policies of the countries to the pandemic situation are improvements of the simple compartmental SIR model (representing susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, respectively). Some authors introduced new effects in this kind of model; for instance, Lin et al. [7] modified a SEIR model (here, E refers to exposed individuals) to introduce the effect of government actions and individual reactions to the disease. Recently, Ndaïrou et al. [11] presented a compartmental model with emphasis in super-spreader individuals, applied to the Wuhan case. Liu et al. [8] proposed the application of a four-stage modified SEIR model to the spread of the disease in Wuhan; some important factors were considered, as the isolation of the city and the construction of field hospitals. A possible vaccine administration strategy was detailed by Libotte et al. [6] , considering the Wuhan case and using a multiobjective approach. This scenario indicates the large number of possibilities to enhance the predictions of compartmental models.In all these models, no information about uncertainties are considered, that is, errors associated with modelling and estimation of parameters are neglected. In this case, optimal solutions may be influenced by small perturbations, as demonstrated by Deb and Gupta [3] . The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of noise during the solution of an inverse problem that aims to determine the parameters that characterize a SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead, and Recovered) model. For this purpose, a robust inverse problem is formulated and solved using the Stochastic Fractal Search [12] . The problem proposed in this work considers the minimization of deviation between experimental and calculated values, together with the maximization of robustness parameter.In many optimization problems, decision variables are subject to perturbation. When solving the problem, one must consider that the solution must be acceptable with respect to small changes in the values of the decision variables. Robust optimization is aimed at obtaining solutions that are least sensitive to such perturbations, that is, solutions that present the smallest possible deviation in relation to the objective value when subject to noise. The concepts of robust optimization were introduced by Tsutsui and Ghosh [16] .The objective function to optimize in searching robust solutions may be formulated as follows:where δ is the noise parameter, and pðδÞ represents the probability distribution function. Usually, this effective objective function is not available, since the probability distribution may not be known. Therefore, the calculation of the expected performance is usually not trivial in many applications. Deb and Gupta [3] proposed a methodology for obtaining robust solutions in the context of multiobjective optimization (more details on multiobjective optimization can be seen in Miettinen [10] ). Essentially, it is proposed to optimize the mean effective objective values computed at a point by averaging the function values of a few samples in its vicinity, instead of optimizing the original objective functions. Thus, a solution x * is called a multiobjective robust solution of type I, if it is the global feasible Pareto optimal solution to the multiobjective minimization problem given bywhere f eff i ðxÞ is defined as follows:for i = 1, ⋯, m, and B δ ðxÞ is the hypervolume of the neighborhood. This approach is suitable for problems in which the result of the integral in Equation (3) can be obtained in a closed analytical form. For problems in which the search space is more complex, Equation (3) can be approximated by the mean value of the objective function, using a Monte Carlo integration given byIn practice, a set of H points are randomly sampled (or respecting some structured manner, such as the Latin Hypercube method) in the range y k ∈ ½ð1 − δÞx, ð1 + δÞx, and the mean function value approximates Equation (3).In the last decades, the development of optimization algorithms based on swarm intelligence has allowed the solution of complex problems in different areas of science and engineering. Inspired by the collective intelligent behavior of insects or animal groups in nature, such as flocks of birds, swarms of bees (bats, fireflies), colonies of ants, and swarms of fruit flies, various optimization algorithms have been proposed [15] . In this work, we use a promising method, recently proposed by Salimi [12] , called Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm. The main steps of the metaheuristic are presented below.The SFS algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic based on the natural growth phenomenon of fractals. Candidate solutions (particles) explore the search space considering a diffusion property which is regularly seen in random fractals. The SFS approach is based on random fractals grown by Diffusion Limited Aggregation concept [17] . This optimization strategy adopts a random walk in order to simulate the diffusion process, where the diffusing particle sticks to the seed particle. This process is repeated until a cluster has been created [12] .Two steps are applied to generate new candidate solutions at each iteration: diffusion and updating. In the first, each particle diffuses around its current position to ensure the exploitation property. The diffusion process avoids being trapped in local optimum and increases the chance of finding the global solution. In the second, a point in a group updates its location based on the locations of other points in the group. SFS considers a static diffusion process, that is, the best particle generated from the diffusion process is the only particle that is considered; the rest of the particles are ignored. In addition to efficient exploration of the feasible problem, SFS uses some random methods as updating processes.The diffusion process uses Gaussian random walks to generate points around each particle until a predefined maximum diffusion number is reached. There are two types of Gaussian walks in the diffusion process:where ε and ε ′ are uniformly distributed random number in the range ð0, 1Þ. In turn, BP and P i are the position of the best 2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine point and the i-th point in the group, respectively. The first two Gaussian parameters are μ BP and σ, where μ BP is exactly equal to BP. The two latter parameters are μ P and σ, where μ P is equal to P i . The standard deviation σ is dynamically adjusted based on the number of the generation g.The update process employs two statistical procedures to undertake the exploration in SFS. Initially, all the points are ranked based on the value of the fitness function, by calculatingwhere rank ðP i Þ is the rank of the point P i among the other points of the group. In the first updating process, for each point P i in group, the j-th component of P i is updated according towhere P r and P t are randomly selected points in the group. The point is updated if the condition Pa i < ε is satisfied, where Pa i is given by Equation (7). Otherwise, P i remains unchanged. In the second update process, P i ′ is updated if Pa i < ε holds for P i ′. Thus, the point is modified according toif ε ′ ≤ 0:5, where ε ′ is a random number generated by the Gaussian distribution. Otherwise, P i ′ is updated byIn these cases, P t ′ and P r ′ are randomly selected points obtained from the first procedure. Details on the implementation are presented by Salimi [12] .In this work, the SFS strategy is extended for multiobjective optimization context. This new approach, called the Multiobjective Optimization Stochastic Fractal Search (MOSFS) algorithm, incorporates two operators to the original SFS algorithm: Fast Nondominated Sorting and Crowding Distance [2] . Briefly, MOSFS presents the following structure. An initial population of size NP is randomly generated. Then, a new population is generated from the current population, using the operators proposed in SFS. Each candidate of the new population is evaluated considering the vector of objectives. All dominated candidate solutions are removed from the population through the Fast Nondominated Sorting operator. The population is sorted into nondominated fronts (sets of vectors that are nondominated with respect to each other). This procedure is repeated until all vectors are assigned to a front. During the evolutionary process, if the number of individuals in the current population is larger than a predefined number, it is truncated according to the Crowding Distance.Traditionally, models based on compartments have been used to represent dynamic behavior of disease. In the literature, various applications involving this type of model can be found. The objective of this work is to determine the parameters of an epidemiological model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic considering experimental data from China, considering uncertainties. For this purpose, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infectious, Dead, and Recovered) model is adopted [5] .In this model, it is assumed that, for each infected individual/host, the disease can be transmitted to a susceptible individual. The number of susceptible individuals (S) varies with time according towhere t is the time and β is the rate of disease transmission The dynamics of the number of infected individuals is calculated bywhere γ is the per-capita recovery rate, and ρ is the death probability. In turn, the number of dead individuals is calculated bywith m = ðρ/1 − ρÞγ representing a per-capita mortality rate [5] . Finally, the number of recovered individuals is obtained fromThe initial conditions of the system are given by ðSð0Þ, Ið0Þ, Dð0Þ, Rð0ÞÞ = ðS 0 , I 0 , D 0 , R 0 Þ.In this work, we used a normalized version of the SIDR model, with scaled variables defined as S n = S/N, I n = I/N, D n = D/N, and R n = R/N, where N is the population size. In this case, the following constraint must be obeyed: S n ðtÞ + I n ðtÞ + D n ðtÞ + R n ðtÞ = 1. Thus, the system represented by Equations (11)-(14) is converted into the normalized model represented by3 Computational and Mathematical Methods in MedicineThe new initial condition for the susceptible, infected, dead, and recovered populations is represented by S n0 , I n0 , D n0 , and R n0 , respectively.In order to determine the SIDR parameters, it is required to formulate and solve an inverse problem. In general, the identification procedure consists in obtaining the model parameters through the minimization of the difference between calculated and real values. For the real data of the epidemic in China, both infected ðI e Þ and dead ðD e Þ time series are known. Thus, the merit function to be minimized is defined as follows:where I c and D c are the calculated values for infected and dead individuals, respectively. M and N are the number of data for I c and D c , respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of perturbations in this (nominal) optimization problem, the robustness of the variables I c and D c is analyzed. In this case, for each candidate solution generated by using the MOSFS algorithm, H points are sampled using the Latin Hypercube method. Each point is evaluated considering the system of ordinary differential equations given by Equations (15)- (18) . For this purpose, the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta method is used. After such simulations, the Mean Effective approach is employed. Then, the mean effective objective is associated with the candidate generated by MOSFS. This procedure is performed until the maximum number of generations is reached.Considering the methodology presented, two cases are analyzed: in the first, the parameters of the SIDR model are estimated through the formulation and solution of an inverse problem without considering possible uncertainties. In the second one, the influence of possible perturbations on the decision variables is considered. For this purpose, the criteria below are defined.In both problems analyzed, the parameters of the SIDR model are defined in the following intervals (obtained after preliminary runs): 0:1 ≤ β ≤ 0:6, 0:04 ≤ γ ≤ 0:6, 0 ≤ I 0 ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1. The results correspond to 20 runs of the metaheuristics (using a different seed for each run) for a maximum of 250 generations in each run. The initial conditions of the compartmental model are given by ðSð0Þ, Ið0Þ, Dð0Þ, Rð0ÞÞ = ð1 − I 0 , I 0 , 0, 0Þ, and the COVID-19 data are retrieved from Worldometer [18] . In order to evaluate the performance of SFS, three other evolutionary algorithms are considered: Genetic Algorithm (GA) [4] , Differential Evolution (DE) [14] , and Firefly Algorithm (FA) [19] . For GA, we adopted a population size equals to 25, maximum number of generations equals to 250, crossover probability equals to 0.8, and mutation probability equals to 0.01. In the case of DE, the population size is equal to 25, maximum number of generations equals to 250, and probability crossover and perturbation rate both equal to 0.9. In FA, we set the population size equals to 25, maximum number of generations equals to 250, and maximum attractiveness value and absorption coefficient both equal to 0.9. In both algorithms, the stopping criterion used is the maximum number of generations.In the deterministic inverse problem, Equation (19) must be minimized. For this purpose, SFS is employed with 25 individuals in the population. Table 1 presents the results for the best result and the standard deviation considering SFS, GA, DE, and FA algorithms in 20 runs (using a different seed for each run). In this table, we can observe that all algorithms converged to the same result. Table 1 presents the results for the best result and the standard deviation. It can be noted that the optimal value of F is relatively high. However, the corresponding standard deviation value indicates that the metaheuristic obtained very close optimizers in all runs. This is due to the fact that the population dynamics undergoes many variations in the course of the epidemic. Such variations are due to government actions, disease mitigation strategy, and capacity of the health network. All of these aspects have an impact on the time series of the number of infected and dead individuals. Therefore, the best curve fitting is not necessarily able to accurately describe the behavior of the epidemic at all times. Figure 1 presents the nonnormalized profiles considering the estimated parameters by solving the inverse problem defined by the minimization of Equation (19)-these results are weighted in relation to number of infected individuals, that is, the population size is a portion of the population that has been effectively tested. In Figures 1(b) and 1(c), we can observe the accuracy of the curve fitting. Note that the time series present sudden changes between two consecutive points that make the compartmental model not be able to describe its behavior more accurately. This is clear, mainly, from day 85 in the data referring to the number of dead individuals. Figure 1(a) presents the evolution of susceptible population during the epidemic. As expected, after the maximum value observed for the number of infected individuals (approximately between days 20 and 30), the number of susceptible individuals decreases.The influence of each parameter of the model on the objective function is assessed by perturbing the best solutions presented in Table 1 , aiming to show the variation of F in the vicinity of the optimal value of each parameter. The vector of optimal parameters is denoted by θ * = ðβ * , γ * , I * 0 , ρ * Þ. For each parameter, 100 equally spaced points are evaluated, in the range ½ð1 − τÞθ * k , ð1 + τÞθ * k , for k = 1, ⋯, 4, where τ = 0:25. Figure 2 shows the influence of each parameter in relation to the objective function defined by Equation (19) . Note that, in the analyzed range, in fact, the optimal values of the corresponding parameters represent the minimum 4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine value of F. This indicates that, at least locally, the optimal parameters obtained represent the best fit in relation to the analyzed data. In addition, it is possible to notice that β is the parameter that presents greater sensitivity in relation to F, in the proposed analysis. In order to analyze the sensitivity of the design variables, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated. In the robust inverse problem, Equation (19) must be minimized and the noise parameter ðδÞ is maximized. By solving this new problem, it is possible to assess the parameters of the compartmental model in the presence of uncertainty. Thus, the adjustment of the time series of data considers possible variations caused by external factors, such as underreporting of infected and dead individuals. Figure 3 shows the Pareto curve obtained for the robust inverse problem, calculated by the MOSFS method, using the Effective Mean approach Table 1 : Results of the deterministic inverse problem obtained in 20 executions of the SFS method, with t f = 95 days. with H = 50 random samples, noise parameter varying in the range 0 ≤ δ ≤ 0:1, and the same parameters adopted in the previous problem.In order to compare the obtained results by using the MOSFS (population size equals to 25 and maximum number of iterations equals to 250), three evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms are considered: Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) [2] , Multiobjective Optimization Differential Evolution algorithm (MODE) [13] , and Multiobjective Optimization Firefly Algorithm (MOFA) [9] . For NSGA-II, we set the population size equals to 25, maximum number of iterations equals to 250, crossover probability equals to 0.8, and mutation probability equals to 0.01. For MODE, we adopt population size equals to 25, maximum number of iterations equals to 250, crossover probability equals to 0.9, and perturbation rate equals to 0.9. For MOFA, the population size is equal to 25, maximum number of generations equals to 250, and maximum attractiveness value and absorption coefficient both equal to 0.9. The stopping criterion used is the maximum number of iterations. The Effective Mean approach runs with H = 50 random samples and noise parameter varying in the range 0 ≤ δ ≤ 0:1. Figure 3 shows the Pareto curve obtained for the robust inverse problem considering different multiobjective optimization strategies.The analysis of Figure 3 shows that, as the noise parameter δ increases, the value of the objective F also increases. Initially, note that the nominal solution is equivalent to the point on the Pareto curve that δ = 0 (see Table 1 ). Increasing F means that the associated fitted curve departs from the actual data as δ increases. Such displacement is caused by noise in the design variables, which can be understood as the existing uncertainties in the real data. In addition, in this figure, we can observe a similar behavior for all algorithms. Thus, the proposed multiobjective strategy was able to obtain the Pareto curve when compared with other algorithms. Table 2 presents some highlighted points of the Pareto curve (points A, B, and C), as shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 : Pareto curve of the robust inverse problem. 6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Figure 4 shows the nonnormalized profiles corresponding to the parameters of points A, B, and C, as shown in Table 2 . Each of these three points presents a different compromise in relation to the objectives of the robust inverse problem. Point A, represented by a circle, presents an extreme compromise in relation to F, that is, it does not prioritize robustness. On the other hand, point C, represented by a diamond, has an extreme compromise to robustness. In turn, point B, represented by a triangle, presents an intermediate compromise between both objectives. Figure 4 also shows the profile which is equivalent to the nominal inverse problem solution ðδ = 0Þ, represented by the solid line.Especially in relation to the curve of infected people as a function of time (Figure 4(b) ), note that the solution of the robust inverse problem provides profiles which are shifted in relation to the result corresponding to the nominal case. Such displacements tend to become more pronounced when the required level of robustness increases. Thus, the profiles of the susceptible, dead, and recovered compartments are also shifted, in order to maintain NðtÞ = SðtÞ + IðtÞ + DðtÞ + RðtÞ constant.In this work, we proposed and solved two inverse problems (nominal and robust) to simulate the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 considering real data from China. Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm was employed to solve the nominal Table 2 : Some points of the robust inverse problem obtained with the MOSFS method. Points A, B, and C are highlighted in Figure 3 . Table 2 . The profile represented by the solid line corresponds to the nominal case, whose parameters are shown in Table 1.   7 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine inverse problem. We also proposed an extension of SFS in the multiobjective context to solve the robust inverse problem. In order to assess uncertainties, the mean effective concept was considered. The parameters of the compartmental SIDR model were determined and analyzed considering both nominal and robust context. In order to analyze the influence of uncertainties, a multiobjective optimization problem was formulated and solved. This problem considers the minimization of deviations associated with the experimental data and calculated values considering the proposed model and the maximization of the robustness parameter. In general, the solution of the proposed multiobjective problem demonstrates that the increase in the noise parameter implies an increase in the value of the objective function. The use of the proposed robust approach to estimate the compartmental model parameters demonstrates the importance of incorporating a methodology to assess the robustness during the solution of the proposed inverse problem. Finally, the use of a mathematical model associated with optimization tools may contribute in the future to the study and development of strategies to understand the dynamic behavior of COVID-19.The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the Worldometer's COVID-19 Data (https://www .worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/).","Brazil","first author","2020-10-15",10

The virus quickly spread to several continents, and strongly impacting Brazil. This pandemic claimed numerous victims with millions of confirmed cases worldwide and thousands of deaths. In Brazil alone, to date, more than 4 million cases have been confirmed with approximately 144,000 deaths, and these numbers are increasing dramatically. The main symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, and fatigue. 2 COVID-19-associated hospitalization is an alarming issue with a higher cumulative rate in people aged 65 years and older 3 and with high public health care costs.Because it is a new virus with such lethality, WHO and the governments of each country have adopted isolation and physical distancing as a preventive measure to contain the spread of the virus. So far, there are very few effective treatments, and vaccines are still being developed in ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, behavioral measures, such as personal hygiene, wearing masks, healthy nutrition, and physical activity, are potential strategies in preventing or mitigating the disease. 4 5 It is well known that exercise training (a subtype of physical activity) improves immune system response, protecting against infections caused by intracellular microorganisms. 6 For instance, regular exercise improves the pathogenic activity of tissue macrophages in parallel with training might be an important prevention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and could play a key role in preventing hospitalizations and supporting faster recovery of infected patients.The present study aimed to assess the association of physical activity before the pandemic and quarantine measures with the prevalence of hospitalizations in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, we investigated symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and the use of mechanical ventilation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the association with sufficient and insufficient physical activity. We hypothesized that physically active patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have a lower number of hospitalizations compared with patients with insufficient levels of physical activity.This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04396353), and its protocol has been published previously. 10 This is a cross-sectional study comparing the physical activity levels before the pandemic and quarantine measures of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. This study was approved by the local Human Subject Protection Committee at the Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (CAPPesq 5044-20-073), and all participants provided an online written informed consent. We followed the STROBE statement checklist for cross-sectional studies. 11 Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We disclosed the electronic link of the form across the country through social media, newscasts, hospitals, medical care providers, and disease control centers in some cities. The questionnaire included questions regarding clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation) and cofactors like age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The inclusion criteria were men and women who had recovered and were survivors of the disease. Also included were individuals of all ages, with or without symptoms; patients with disease confirmed by a quantitative PCR viral test (qPCR), blood test (serology), and a rapid antibody test with or without hospitalization (nursery, semi-intensive and intensive unit care) and discharged from the hospital. Those with or without drug treatment, and with any chronic disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, among others were also included. The exclusion criteria were illiterate patients who had difficulty filling out the electronic form and patients still hospitalized and with symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, after completing the form, some participants were excluded due to the quality control of the responses provided (see quality control below).We collected a total of 1597 completed questionnaires, and all data were assessed to identify possible fraud and inappropriate responses. We identified 118 (7.4%) duplicate responses, which were excluded. One hundred and twenty-one (8.2%) participants were excluded because they answered that they did not have COVID-19 and did not perform any diagnostic tests. Additionally, 277 (18.7%) participants who declared that they had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (because they believed they were sick) but without any diagnostic test and with or without symptoms were also excluded. Finally, only 2 children under 10 years of age answered the questionnaire, and we decided to exclude them from the sample (Figure 1 ). After this first analysis of quality data responses, 1200 participants were selected.The second part of the data quality control was to correlate the self-report of physical activity with the answers provided in the IPAQ questionnaire. In one part of the questionnaire, we asked how the participants declared themselves: ""athlete,"" ""physically active,"" or ""sedentary."" These 3 categories were correlated with the amount of physical activity reported in the IPAQ questionnaire. For instance, if the participant declared him/herself as sedentary, but performed more than 150 minutes of physical activity per week, he/she was excluded. After this correlation, 938 (78.2%) were included in the final analysis ( Figure 1 ).The participants were subdivided into 2 categories according to IPAQ information: sufficient physical activity (""athlete"" and ""physically active"" were pooled) and insufficient physical activity (""sedentary""). Sufficient physical activity was considered when the participant performed at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity and/or at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity. 13 14 Insufficient physical activity was defined when the participants did not meet these recommendations. In addition, sedentary behavior was defined considering the number of hours per day spent sitting. 15 The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest (equal to 3.5 mL/kg/min) was calculated to estimate the energy expenditure values. 12 Within our sample, we also calculated the 25th percentile of physical activity time (100 minutes/week) and METs (11.2 METs/hour/week); both were used to estimate the primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome of the study was to assess the number of hospitalizations among individuals with sufficient physical activity and insufficient physical activity who were infected All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The sample size was calculated using the Epi-Info program, version 7.2.3.1, considering an infinite population, an unknown prevalence of 50%, a confidence level of 95%, a sampling error of 5%, and a delineation effect (deff) of 2 points. The minimum sample size was 768 subjects. Considering possible dropouts and to control for confounding factors in multivariate analysis, 10% was added resulting in a sample of 850 patients. The data analysis was performed using SPSS v.25 software. The distributions of the quantitative variables were verified by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.

No reuse allowed without permission.The sample characterization variables were associated with physical activity levels by using the chi-square test. When significant, the analysis of adjusted standardized residues was used to identify local associations with values equal to or greater than 1.96. The Poisson regression model was used to estimate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and their respective 95% CI. The statistical significance of the PR was assessed using Wald's statistics. Crude analysis of the variables was performed between the outcomes. After that, important multivariate outcomes were included in the model.Among patients who were hospitalized, the association between physical activity levels and clinical variables of hospitalization (such as symptoms, medications, and mechanical ventilation) was analyzed. The distributions of length of hospital stay between physical activity levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn post-hoc test.Of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. When degree of hospitalization was compared between men and women, men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6% [P=0.013]). Patients older than 65 years had 7 times the prevalence of hospitalization compared with adults aged 18-65 years (P<0.001). Patients with obesity I were hospitalized more than subjects with normal weight (P=0.003). When compared with eutrophic patients, those overweight and obese patients had a higher prevalence of hospitalization between 83% and 166%.

No reuse allowed without permission.The present study aimed to assess the association of physical activity before the pandemic and quarantine measures with the prevalence of hospitalizations in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The main finding is that sufficient physical activity as recommended by WHO 14 16 decreases the prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalization.Interestingly, performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderateand vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, is associated with a 34.3% lower prevalence of hospitalization due to COVID-19 (PR=0.657; P=0.046). However, physical activity has no additional protection among those patients who were hospitalized. There was no difference in the prevalence of intubation, oxygen therapy, symptoms, and length of hospital stay between physically active and inactive patients.To date, Brazil has experienced mortality of approximately 3% (68.72 deaths/100,000 population 17 ), and COVID-19 has been associated with a higher incidence of hospitalizations 18 .Approximately 8% of confirmed cases (more than 389,000 patients) required hospital care. This burden has a high public health impact with an estimated cost of US$ 13,000 for less severe patients and US$ 40,000 for more severe patients with ventilator support. 19 Several studies have shown that obesity, preexisting diseases, and advanced age are important predictors of the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.In the present study, we observed the higher prevalence of hospitalization in older patients, which could be explained by the association of systemic inflammation (termed ""inflammaging 22 "") in elderly people. Interestingly, exercise training attenuates aging biomarkers and modulates the redox balance. 19 Master athletes have better redox balance and inflammatory status compared with middle age-matched controls. 23 Thus, physical activity may be a strategy to prevent clinical severity in elderly persons with COVID-19.Obesity has been associated with insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior. 24-27 Indeed, we found a higher proportion of obese patients with insufficient physical activity.Inflammation has been described as a key mechanism in the worsening of COVID-19 in the obese. 28 29 Interestingly, physical activity is recommended as part of weight loss for obese adults (Evidence Category A). 25 30 31 In addition, physical activity is one of the nonpharmacological therapies to reduce inflammatory cytokines, 32 which may be a possible mechanism of protection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It has been suggested that central obesity compromises lung ventilation and may exacerbate COVID-19. 33 Increased abdominal obesity 34 and obstructive sleep apnea 35 are common conditions in obesity, and both are remarkably improved after an exercise training program. 25 30 Physical activity improves the immune system response mainly due to the amelioration of recirculation of immunoglobulins, neutrophils, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and immature B cells. 6 Additionally, exercise prevents and treats numerous COVID-19-associated complications, such as cardiac, neurological, and metabolic disorders, 27 36 including the positive effect on the renin-angiotensin system. [37] [38] [39] Future studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in physical activity and its benefits in patients with COVID-19. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.This is an observational study and the results should be interpreted with caution.Although we found an association between physical activity and lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations, we did not investigate the mechanisms involved in this relationship.All participants filled out the electronic form by themselves and possible bias should be considered. However, we constructed a quality control criterion to reduce such biases. We did not directly measure physical activity by an accelerometer device; however, self-report physical activity questionnaires have been largely used in research, and a systematic review shows that the IPAQ short form has excellent test-retest reliability (r=0.91). 40 CONCLUSION Sufficient physical activity is associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by 34.3%. Public policies should encourage regular physical exercise to prevent complications from COVID-19.• Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderateand vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, is associated with a 34.3% lower prevalence of hospitalization due to COVID-19.• To date, there are very few effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines are still being developed in ongoing clinical trials.

It is considered complex, comprehensive and innovative as the dimensions 'food' and 'nutrition' are combined into a single concept (1) .A human rights approach to FNS, as committed to by Brazil, establishes the responsibility of the country to promote, provide, respect and protect this right. However, by analysing the history of the political agenda of FNS, it is possible to observe a dismantling of the intersectoral policies that were created in order to ensure this right. An expression of this dismantling was the termination of the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security (CONSEA) in January 2019, an important venue for dialogue and articulation between civil societal needs and the governmental priorities (2) .When CONSEA was a section of the National System for Food and Nutrition Security (SISAN), it operated on an agenda that was considered strategic in guaranteeing the FNS led Brazil to be left off of the Hunger Map in 2014 (3) .The termination of CONSEA jeopardised the decisive agenda that was being consolidated throughout the country and created the possibility of Brazil returning its place on to the Hunger Map (2) .When COVID-19 arrived in Brazil, a crisis scenario that incorporated economic, social and political aspects became highly visible. This scenario fostered unemployment, poverty and hunger. The fight against food insecurity in Brazil was interrupted with the adoption of austerity measures, such as the National Amendment 95/2016 (4) , which reduced public expenditure on social policies, in addition to labour and social security reforms, which represents a scenario of violation of human rights that are being aggravated by the current pandemic. In this context, the goal of this commentary is to expose the situation of FNS in Brazil in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a critical analysis of this scenario and suggesting ways to move forward.FAO estimates that the expected number of people in food insecurity by 2020 will increase from 135 million to 265 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic (5) . According to the FAO report, the countries most affected by the pandemic are those that have already faced serious food insecurity problems due to conflicts and wars, climate change, and economic crises. In these countries, the risk of food supply chain interruption is imminent, thus damaging farmers' incomes and the food supply of cities (5) .In Mexico, the country with the third largest number of deaths caused by COVID-19, behind only the United States and Brazil (until August 2020), Vilar-Compte et al. (6) pointed to the absence of interventions and social protective actions by the federal government, especially of those aimed at children. In the United States, the country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world, trillion-dollar packages have been released to support the country's economy companies and maintain jobs. Direct income support, increased unemployment benefits and additional support for federal food assistance programmes in the United States have also been implemented (7) .In Brazil, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed multiple vulnerabilities that have been festering over the past few years prior to the pandemic. The latest population surveys carried out in Brazil in the years 2004, 2009 and 2013 indicate that there is regional inequality in the distribution of food insecurity with the North and Northeast regions being the most affected (8) . These regions are characterised by a scenario of inadequate access to essential and basic services, which exposes them both to food and nutritional insecurity and to the spread of COVID-19. This inadequacy is demonstrated by the fact that these were also the regions most affected at the beginning of the pandemic. This finding shows that the social determination of food insecurity in Brazil is similar to that of the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting mainly people in racial, social, economic and sanitary vulnerability (9) . In this context, COVID-19 found fertile ground in Brazil for its dissemination and community transmission.The impact of the suspension of many commercial activities and other economic sectors due to the pandemic was quickly felt socially and economically in Brazil. The comparison of the final quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 revealed an increase in the unemployment rate, which was the highest in the Northeastern region and caused a higher number of poor and extremely poor people in Brazil than was already there (10) . By June 2020, more than 10 million workers had already had their job contracts suspended or had their working hours and salaries reduced, and the country had more than 1·2 million people unemployed.The increase in unemployment rates and poverty in the country in addition to the increase in prices of natural or minimally processed food during the pandemic (11) indicate the addition of millions of Brazilians to the group of people who are vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. It is important to highlight that at the beginning of the pandemic, the population was concerned with the lack of food, but currently, no signs of food shortage in Brazil are visible. Therefore, although no interruption in food supply occurred, Brazilians with compromised incomes during the pandemic may have problems accessing food as they are unable to afford it.A study conducted in Brazil by the UNICEF and the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (IBOPE) from 3 July 2020 to 18 July 2020, showed that during the pandemic, one in five Brazilians aged 18 years or older (33 million) experienced an episode of having no money to buy food when their income ran out. This study also reports that about nine million Brazilians were unable to have a meal because there was no food or money to buy one (12) .Given the evident and expected impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to the population's FNS, the Brazilian government responded with a few actions although they were slow and uncoordinated. Furthermore, it is important to stress that the majority of these actions were pressured and amplified by the National Congress. The main governmental action to minimise the impacts of the pandemic over the income of the most vulnerable families was the introduction of an emergency aid payment in the amount of US$120 over a 5-month period for informal workers, individual entrepreneurs, independent workers and the unemployed. The initial proposal of the federal government was only US$40, but the amount was increased after Congressional intervention. Up to 3 August 2020, 66·2 million Brazilians had already received this payment. However, the way this aid has been operationalised has been heavily criticised due to the difficulties in access to registration for some population groups and delays in processing registrations (11) .Moreover, an announcement about the expansion of the income transfer programme Bolsa Família, aiming to release more than US$680·000·000 has been made. However, until 18 August 2020, only 12·2 % of the amount allocated to the expansion had been used (13) . Another measure implemented to preserve family incomes was payment exemption of up to 220 kWh/month towards the electricity bill of low-income families from 1 April to 30 August.The Program for Food Acquisition (PAA) is one of the main FNS programmes in Brazil. This programme's main goal is to promote access to food and encourage family agriculture. Due to COVID-19, this programme received a budget supplementation of 500 million reais, which is considered insufficient (14) , especially considering the scenario caused by the pandemic, and delayed since the publication of the provisional measures only happened almost 2 months after COVID-19 hit Brazil (11) . This emergency act took place after recent stripping of resources allocated to PAA, which were reduced from US$117·200·000 in 2012 to US$12·600·000 in 2019 (14) .The National School Nutrition Program (PNAE) (3) is the oldest public policy for FNS in Brazil. With schools closing as a strategy to reduce the spread of the virus, millions of students have become vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. As a way to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the FNS of this part of the population, the federal government authorised the use of school nutrition resources for the distribution of food to students. In this programme, 30 % of the purchased food should come from family agriculture. Therefore, purchasing of this food even during the pandemic allows the continuity of the outflow of production and farmers' income.With respect to the sanitary and hygienic aspects of FNS, the food supply chain and the food industry also needed to adapt to changes in food safety protocols imposed by the pandemic. Although there is little evidence of transmission of COVID-19 through food, it is important to highlight that there are potential sources of risk of contamination along the food supply chain that involve many people, surfaces and environments. In this sense, to ensure food and environmental safety, strict safety protocols are necessary (15) .The National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) has published sanitary guidelines in relation to COVID-19 and the Good Practices for Manufacturing and Manipulation of Food (16) . However, we believe that the capacity of food safety inspectors is limited when it comes to implementing the recommendations in this publication after considering that before the pandemic ANVISA already had difficulties in satisfying all of its inspection demands.The impact of the pandemic on the FNS of the Brazilian population was strengthened as the country faced a previous scenario of progressive weakening of FNS policies marked by the termination of CONSEA, budget cuts for programmes for promotion and support of family agriculture, and the disbanding of these programmes. These policy and institutional changes undermine the capability of the State to satisfy the demands that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed on the FNS of the population. However, in the current scenario, we believe that a few actions would result in better responses to FNS protection. Among those, we highlight the urgent need for actions imposed by the State and then coordinated among the three levels of the government. The need for coordinated and intersectoral actions to address FNS is even more important during a pandemic. Another recommendation is to harness the great potential of Primary Healthcare to implement FNS programmes in territories. Primary health care has been underused when it comes to identification and attention to the needs of families regarding FNS.Mobility restrictions recommended as a way to prevent the dissemination of COVID-19 and the work-from-home conditions imposed on thousands of Brazilians in addition to full-time childcare could make families seek more practical and quicker foods, such as ultra-processed and fast food items. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that the population will further increase the intake of ultra-processed foods and aggravate the situation of food insecurity thus leading to worsening of the dietary quality (12) . Evidence that the diet has worsened during the pandemic in Brazil can be found as there was a decrease in the consumption of fruits and vegetables and an increase in the consumption of several types of ultra-processed foods. Together with the deterioration of dietary quality, increased sedentary behaviour demonstrated by longer screen time and a drastic decrease in physical activity practice has been reported in Brazil during the pandemic (12, 17) .The perpetuation of these inadequate food and lifestyle habits during the months of quarantine has resulted in an increase in the prevalence of overweight and other chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Therefore, actions to promote healthy eating and physical activity in the context of social isolation must be implemented.The weakening and the attempt to disarticulate social control, especially represented by the termination of CONSEA, is also an aspect that limits and hinders the capability to respond to actions for improving FNS during the pandemic. Nevertheless, some of the actions that have Food and Nutrition Security and COVID-19 taken place to date happened under great pressure from civil society since a remnant of organised structure of social control still exists.Finally, with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, another action which has become even more urgent is that the government again should prioritise the FNS agenda and update the National Plan for Food and Nutrition Security (PNSAN). The last one ended in 2019, and the replacement that was supposed to be implemented from 2020 to 2023 has not been created. Updating the PNSAN would allow for the creation of coordinated actions with cities and municipalities and budget transfers that are aligned with the needs of the programmes and public policies. This would ensure again the realisation of the Human Right to Adequate Food and expand FNS programmes.Strengthening human rights, including FNS, is essential for the structuring of a more equitable society, and it has a legal basis through the Constitution. However, it is a historical challenge that will become even more complex in the context of a pandemic and runs counter to political will and commitment of leaders and nations.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-12",10

The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic due to the rapid increase in the number of cases. To date, on July 24, 2020, there are more than 15 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including 619,150 deaths. Brazil has a current critical situation with the second-highest number of cases and deaths in the world. 1 963711I NQXXX10.1177/0046958020963711INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and FinancingCotrin et al.INQUIRY Unfortunately, an effective vaccine or medicine is not available to treat COVID-19, and the most efficient strategies for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic are preventive measures and social distancing. However, these interventions make this pandemic a problem more significant than a health crisis with an impact meaningful in societies, politics, and economies as a whole. 2, 3 In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic causes concerns to the entire population, especially the health care professionals that are essential and continued to work and maintained patient care, despite the social distance and lockdown adopted in many countries. Many of the healthcare workers are in the front line, in close contact with COVID-19 infected patients, at high risk of infection and of transmitting the disease to their families and coworkers. 4 In Brazil, there is lack of a homogeneous, transparent, and comprehensive surveillance system for COVID-19 cases among Brazilian health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 5 The coronavirus pandemic represents one of the greatest health challenges worldwide in this century, and this has a more devastating effect in third world countries, like Brazil. An increase in the workload of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported in other countries, 6, 7 but the financial impact to these professionals were not yet fully reported, especially in Brazil, that is facing an economic crisis that appears to be only in its beginning.To prevent infection and transmission of COVID-19 by healthcare workers, the WHO and other national and international public health authorities recommended the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). However, a shortage of PPE is being observed as a result of the high demand considering the increasing number of cases. 3 In Brazil, since the beginning of the pandemic, there is a great concern with the lack of PPE, low adherence to the social distancing measures suggested, and low coronavirus testing, indicating an underestimation of the number of cases in the country. 5, 8 Another critical aspect regarding the protection of healthcare workers is the training to deal with COVID-19 disease. A study performed with healthcare workers working in the National Health Service (NHS) across the United Kingdom showed that approximately 50% of them did not receive proper training. 4 In addition to the risk of contamination, healthcare workers have suffered high-stress rates. Many studies observed high rates of anxiety, stress symptoms, mental disorders, and post-traumatic stress among the healthcare workers during the pandemic. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Primary care services are slightly superior as compared to traditional health care. In the Brazilian health system, the first contact of patients occurs with professionals of the primary care service such as physicians, nurses and dentists. 16 However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there were changes in workload, jobs and general life of these professionals. This way, this study aimed to compare the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the healthcare workers: physicians, nurses, and dentists, regarding workload, income, PPE, training, behavior, feelings, and level of anxiety.This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of Ingá University Center Uningá, under number 31054320.6.0000.5220 and all participants agreed to participate in the survey.Sample size calculation was performed with a confidence interval of 95% and margin of error of 5%, considering the application of a survey/questionnaire, with the number of physicians (496 422), 17 nurses (2 321 509), 18 and dentists (338 790), 19 in Brazil, resulted in the need for at least 385 answers.The sample was randomly selected among the three categories of healthcare workers in Brazil. A Google Forms (Google Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) questionnaire was elaborated and sent by e-mail and WhatsApp messenger (WhatsApp Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) to 700 healthcare workers. Inclusion criteria were: healthcare workers (physicians, nurses or dentists), above 22 years of age, working in the front line of the pandemic in private and public hospitals, healthcare units and private clinics, but not necessarily with direct contact with COVID-19 infected patients. Healthcare students were excluded from the sample.In the introduction of the questionnaire, the informed consent approved by the human research ethics committee was described, and the subjects were informed about the objectives. The participant's anonymity was ensured. The survey comprised questions about personal information, jobs, income, workload before, and during the pandemic. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and training for COVID-19 patient care and behavior during the pandemic were also assessed in the questionnaire.A structured questionnaire was developed and tested on a pilot population before its administration in this study. The pilot study was undertaken with 30 healthcare workers previously and randomly selected to clarity the questions and the language used. Some words were rewritten with synonyms so that all participants were more likely to understand. The pilot study participants were not included in the main study.The levels of concern, anxiety, anger, and impact of the pandemic were evaluated with a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10. 20To evaluate the intrarater agreement, one of the questions with yes/no responses was duplicated in the questionnaire. The answers to this duplicate question were compared using Kappa statistics. The result showed a coefficient of 0.96, indicating an excellent agreement. 21 The percentage of distribution among the groups about sex, age, years of experience, income and workload information, knowledge about personal protective equipment (PPE), training to treat COVID-19 suspected or infected patients, and behavior during the pandemic were assessed with chi-square tests. The one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for the intergroup comparison of the levels of anxiety and confidence about work, anger, concerns with family, and the influence of pandemic in the relationship with patients and the work team. Statistical analyzes were performed by Statistica software (Statistica for Windows, version 10.0, Statsoft, Tulsa, Okla, USA), and the results were considered significant at P < .05.The response rate was 76.6% since a total of 536 healthcare workers answered the survey: 179 physicians (117 female; 62 males), 170 nurses (151 female; 19 male), and 187 dentists (125 female; 62 male). Most healthcare workers were between 31 and 40 years old, and physicians were younger than dentists and nurses. Females were the majority in all groups, but more significant in the nurses' group. Physicians' respondents had fewer years of experience in the profession than nurses and dentists (Figure 1 ; demographics).Physicians and dentists had more jobs than nurses before the pandemic. With the pandemic, the number of jobs reduced in all groups, but significantly more in the dentists' group. Workload before the pandemic was higher for physicians, followed by dentists, and then the nurses, that presented a significantly lesser workload. The majority of physicians and dentists reported a reduction in workload during the pandemic. The monthly income was higher for physicians, followed by dentists and lesser for nurses. The majority of physicians and dentists reported a change in the monthly income with the pandemic. The income was reduced significantly in all professional groups and maintained the same pattern of difference between the groups ( Figure 2 ).Almost all healthcare workers knew the WHO recommendations about the use of PPE. More nurses reported to have only partially the PPE, and more dentists have PPE in their work environment. More physicians and dentists reported that their work has PPE following the WHO recommendations than nurses, and approximately one-third of the healthcare workers reported that available PPE followed WHO recommendations. About half of the physicians and nurses were working directly with COVID-19 infected patients, but the minority of dentists were. Most healthcare workers did not receive training for treating patients suspected and infected from coronavirus ( Figure 3 ).Nurses were respecting the quarantine more than physicians and dentists. Most of the healthcare workers believed that their positioning and behavior influence people around them, but physicians and nurses believed more than dentists. More dentists and nurses thought about giving up their jobs or professions after the beginning of the pandemic than physicians. In all groups, approximately 90% of the respondents reported being afraid of being infected by coronavirus in the clinical or hospital environment, and more than 95% of them changed habits fearing to contaminate their family members. The minority were pressured by family members to quit their jobs. More physicians and nurses were feeling more tired than usual than dentists. Most of the healthcare workers in all groups reported difficulties in sleeping during the pandemic (Figure 4) . Dentists felt less prepared and confident to care for COVID-19 patients than physicians, and nurses and dentists were more anxious and stressed with the pandemic. Nurses believed that the pandemic will have a more positive impact on their profession and that the experience during the pandemic will have a more significant influence in their professional future than physicians and dentists. The level of concern about infecting family members was high (above 8 of 10) and similar between the three groups. Physicians, nurses, and dentists were feeling comfortable similarly in providing patient care during the pandemic. Nurses were feeling angrier than physicians and dentists. Dentists reported being more anxious when providing patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic than physicians. Dentists answered that the relationship with the patient was more influenced by the pandemic than physicians and nurses, and the relationship of dentists with their work team was more influenced by the pandemic than physicians (Table 1 ).This survey gives a broad outlook of the Brazilian healthcare workers' views about the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, it is necessary to bring the Brazilian context in facing of the pandemic, mainly because the projections about the behavior of the pandemic and people related to it depend not only on scientific knowledge but mainly on quality and reliable data regarding the new disease, 5,22 and currently it is not possible in Brazil. There is no clear leadership. 23, 24 Since May 15, 2020, Brazil does not have a health minister, and the governors and the president of the republic do not follow the same guidelines regarding the implementation of quarantine and medications. Effective quarantines and lockdown measures were not even implemented in Brazil. While the world scientific community says that only strict social isolation measures can slow the spread of the virus 25, 26 and that there is still no effective pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, 27 the Brazilian denialist actual president 24, 28 insists on reopening of business offices, schools and churches, he also is against the use of face masks. He makes open advertisements about a medicine whose studies have already been canceled by WHO because the medicine is not effective against coronavirus. 27 So, in Brazil, there have been no federal guidelines for primary health care services in response to COVID-19. 28 Amid this situation, the healthcare workers do not know whether to follow the WHO recommendations or the president's denialist recommendations. The national response is, in practice, being guided by developments at the local level, without any semblance of central coordination. 28 Healthcare in Brazil is the responsibility of the municipalities, using the Health Unic System (called SUS in Brazil), including pandemic preparedness. It means that matters such as the provision of PPE, rules on social distancing, and testing arrangements vary. 24 Starting from this specific information, it is then possible to begin to affirm that the COVID-19 pandemic has burdened unprecedented psychological stress on people around the world, especially the medical workforce. 29 Emotional and behavioral reactions that healthcare workers may experience during this crisis (e.g., difficulty sleeping, anger) are also being shared by the entire community. 30 Healthcare providers are vital resources for every country, mainly in disruptive periods like this that we are facing. The intensive work drained healthcare providers physically and emotionally, 6 and the entire population trusts in the work of these professionals and hopes that they can carry out their tasks safely and correctly. Therefore, it is essential to know the impact that the pandemic has had on health professions to promote strategies to counteract stressors and challenges during this outbreak. Studies like this are necessary because mobilization now will allow public health to apply the learnings gained to any future periods of increased infection and lockdown, which will be particularly crucial for healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, and to future pandemics. 31 Reporting information like this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. 10 The questionnaire was created using Google Forms and was sent via a link in a messaging app, e-mail and social media, and is in accordance with Iqbal et al. 4 Consolo et al 32 also used Google Forms to create their survey, but they sent it via an anonymous e-mail. In this study, a messaging app was chosen because they are practical and can be accessed quickly by cell phone, which facilitates the healthcare workers' response.Most health care workers were in the 31 to 40 years age range (Figure 1 ). Lai et al 33 found similar results; however, the respondents of Chew et al 9 were younger (age range: 25-35 years). This age difference, although not significant, may have been due to the methodology that the surveys were conducted. Chew et al 9 survey was conducted directly at the healthcare workers' workplace, while this present study sends on-line questionnaires via messaging app. The greatest part of the respondents were females, and also the females were the majority in all health profession groups, but even so, greater in the nurses' group ( Figure 1 ) Other authors found similar results. 9,33 Also, cross-sectional studies show minimal male participants in this type of study. 32, 34 Besides that, women are more willing to participate in researches, 35 and the majority of nursing professionals in Brazil are females. 36 The workload was reduced for physicians and dentists during the pandemic (Figure 2 ). This reduction was observed because quarantines were recommended in several cities in Brazil, and private practices, both for physicians and dentists, were closed for elective procedures. This result also justifies why the dentists and physicians had more jobs than nurses before the pandemic. Most respondent nurses work in public health, with a predetermined workload, which has not been changed due to the pandemic. Besides that, the income was significantly reduced in all professional groups (Figure 2 ). It is known that a pandemic often brings economic recession, and this is what happened during the first quarter of 2020. 37, 38 This result is in agreement with a study about dental practitioners, 32 conducted in Italy in the early stages of the pandemic, where all respondents reported practice closure or substantial activity reduction with serious concerns regarding their professional future and economic crisis. Previous crises have shown how an economic crash has direct consequences for public 39 and this is no different for healthcare workers. With the increasing cases in Brazil, it was expected that job opportunities would also increase, but this was not observed in this study, no new hires were made, which leads to the conclusion that the concern about the future financial impact is great among health professionals. However, this survey was conducted in an earlier stage of the pandemic, and now, in the peak, this scenario may have changed.It can be speculated that physicians and dentists have more PPE following WHO recommendations than nurses because as most of them work in their private practice, they bought the necessary PPE themselves, while the majority of the nurses work in public health, where PPE is sometimes not adequate (Figure 3 ). PPE has gained even more importance in recent times because with the increased demand for use, PPE has become more expensive and scarcer. Healthcare workers reported that there was limited access to essential PPE and support from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic from Latin America to Europe. 3, 4 Some physicians related reusing face masks that are meant to be disposable because their hospitals may run out in the next few weeks. 30 Consolo et al 32 related that 77% of the dentists in their study increased the use of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the professionals' inherent concern with PPE, in Brazil there is also a concern about the shortage of supplies needed to treat the more severe patients, scarce availability of diagnostic tests and constant tension regarding the collapse of the ICU beds available is also observed. 5 To date and exemplify, as of July 22, drugs used to keep ICU patients sedated will end in four days on Paraná state, in the South region of Brazil. 40 About half of the physicians and nurses were working directly with COVID-19 infected patients, but the minority of dentists were (Figure 3) . A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in the first two weeks of April showed similar results, where 95.26% of the healthcare workers had direct patient contact in daily activity. 4 Dentists had less contact with infected patients because as already seen, their elective appointments were suspended due to the quarantine. 41, 42 In this scenario, it would be expected that healthcare workers have adequate training to care for patients infected with COVID-19, but most healthcare workers did not receive this training. In a study conducted in the UK, half of the healthcare workers also reported that they did not have adequate training. As already stated here, this is an unprecedented event, so many countries, even the richest, are having difficulties in establishing training protocols for healthcare workers. Besides that, dentists reported being more anxious when providing patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic than physicians ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). It is reasonable that dentists feel more anxious to assist patients during the pandemic, as it is known that the contamination rate of this disease is very high in aerosols and droplets, 43, 44 which makes the dental community a relatively high-risk population. However, it is essential to highlight that in the early stages of the pandemic, the Brazilian Ministry of Health launched a national program called ""Brazil Counts on Me"". 45 This program focused on training and registering healthcare workers to face the coronavirus pandemic. It seems that many professionals did not do this training offered by the government. Moreover, a recent survey 29 showed that as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients showed higher scores of fear, anxiety and depression. This implies that effective strategies toward to improving mental health should be provided to these individuals. 29 Healthcare workers often feel fully responsible for the well-being of their patients. They usually face the challenges of work as their duty. 6 This has become more evident in recent times and could reflect in the way that they influence people around them, like respecting the quarantine, as an example. In this study, the majority of the healthcare workers believed that their positioning and behavior influence people around them, and physicians and nurses believed more than dentists (Figure 4 ). One can say that physicians and nurses believed they have a more considerable influence on society than dentists due to the nature of their work. People, in general, tend to view physicians and nurses as essential professionals, and they tend to observe them as an example, even outside the work environment. So, it is natural for them to believe that their behavior can influence (in a positive way) the people around them.In all groups, approximately 90% of the respondents reported being afraid of contamination by the coronavirus in the clinical or hospital environment (Figure 4) , agreeing with previous reports. 4, 32 This was probably the cause of more dentists and nurses thought about giving up their jobs or professions during the pandemic, although the minority of healthcare workers reported pressure from family members to quit their jobs ( Figure 4 ). As already discussed above, several factors must be related to the insufficient training to care for infected patients, lack of adequate PPE, and decreased income. Another point that must be taken into account is the amount of healthcare workers deaths by the coronavirus, which is alarmingly high in Brazil. In May 2020, which was the early stage of the pandemic in Brazil, Brazil already surpassed the USA in deaths of nursing professionals by COVID-19 and had more deaths than Italy and Spain combined. 18 Most of the healthcare workers in all groups reported difficulties in sleeping during the pandemic (Figure 4) . Previous pandemic experiences showed that these reactions reflect a sense of fearful waiting, or even terror, about what the future may hold for all humankind while an unfamiliar and uncomfortable quiet fills the halls. 46 This is expected because the own nature of the pandemic and the unique characteristics and unpredictable evolution of the COVID-19 disease, like a uniquely high risk of asymptomatic transmission and significant knowledge gaps about the viral pathophysiology 47, 48 can also lead to loss of sleep. Recent studies showed that a significant part of the healthcare workers presented symptoms of insomnia. 9,33,34 All these features generate many uncertainties in healthcare workers, but, for the Brazilian ones, the challenge is even greater, and the scenario is even scarier. Additionally to the already established insufficient scientific knowledge about the new virus and its high speed of dissemination, 49, 50 little is known about the transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 in a context of great social and demographic inequality. Here in Brazil, people are living in precarious housing and sanitary conditions, without constant access to water, in an agglomeration and with a high prevalence of chronic diseases. 22 Nurses and dentists were more anxious and stressed with the pandemic, and nurses were feeling angrier than the other healthcare workers evaluated in this survey (Table 1) . A recent systematic review showed that anxiety was the most prevalent mental health symptom during the pandemic. 12 Studies on the mental health of the healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that there are occupational differences regarding affective symptoms among healthcare workers, and nurses showed the highest levels. 34 Besides that, nurses may face a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients as they spend more time in the front line, providing direct care of patients. 6 Dentists, physicians, and nurses had a similar level of concern about infecting family members (Table 1 ). It was observed that more physicians and nurses were feeling more tired than usual than dentists. This was expected, because, in addition to all the concerns inherent to the actual moment, these two categories of healthcare workers are dealing directly with infected patients, and there are also other contributing factors related to this: excessive workload and work hours, work-life imbalance, inadequate support, insufficient rewards, interpersonal communication, and sleep privation). 13 Although many of the health care workers accept the increased risk of infection as part of their chosen profession, some may have concerns about family transmission or feel pressure to comply because of fear of losing their job, desire to be part of the team, and altruistic goals of caring for patients in need. 30 Disruptive periods like this generate uncertainty and fear of the unknown, especially in the professional field. When asked how the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the future of their professions, nurses were more optimistic than physicians and dentists. They believed that the pandemic would have a more positive impact on their profession. Consolo et al 32 showed that ¾ of the respondent dentists reported that there had been an extremely negative impact on their practice.Dentists believed that the relationship with the patient and their staff were more influenced by the pandemic than physicians and nurses (Table 1) . This is understandable, as dentists usually have a very close relationship with their patients and staff. Since the dental team is considered to be at high risk for COVID-19 infection, dental offices had to prepare for providing care, improving communication with their patients, changing the routine of their dental offices, and improving the PPE of their employees and patients. In the long term, patients will notice these changes and will value professionals who care about them. On the other hand, according to Consolo et al 32 there is a concern regarding the inability to prevent the end of the pandemic, followed by the impaired economy that might affect future patient turnover and the capability to pay for the dental practice expenses, which include buying further devices and to adequate to new clinical protocols to counteract the spreading of SARS-CoV-2.The number of jobs reduced to all healthcare workers during the pandemic, but this reduction was more significant for dentists. Also, the workload and income reduced to all healthcare workers.Almost all healthcare workers were aware of the WHO recommendations about the use of PPE. Nurses related that their work has PPE partially following the WHO recommendations. Most healthcare workers did not receive training for treating patients suspected and infected from coronavirus.Physicians and nurses were feeling more tired than usual than dentists. Most of the healthcare workers in all groups reported difficulties in sleeping during the pandemic. Dentists reported being more anxious when providing patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic than physicians.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Karina Maria Salvatore Freitas https://orcid.org/0000-0001 -9145-6334","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-09",10

In comparison to centers in Europe or the United States, the scarcity of data on these terms might impair design of adequate measures to ameliorate the pandemic's potential damage. The first survey-based analysis revealing regional information is herein presented. Methods and Materials: From May 6 to May 30, 2020, the American Society for Radiation Oncology's COVID-19 Survey was distributed across Latin America with support of the local national radiation therapy societies. Twenty-six items, including facility demographic and financial characteristics, personnel and patient features, current and expected impact of the pandemic, and research perspectives, were included in the questionnaire. Results: Complete responses were obtained from 115 (50%) of 229 practices across 15 countries. Only 2.6% of centers closed during the pandemic. A median of 4 radiation oncologists (1-27) and 9 (1-100) radiation therapists were reported per center. The median number of new patients treated in 2019 was 600 (24-6200). A median 8% (1%-90%) decrease in patient volume was reported, with a median of 53 patients (1-490) remaining under treatment. Estimated revenue reduction was 20% or more in 53% of cases. Shortage of personal protective equipment was reported in 51.3% of centers, and 27% reported personnel shortage due to COVID-19. Reported delays in treatment for low-risk entities included early stage breast cancerThe outbreak of the coronavirus-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome pandemic by late 2019 has had a particularly deep impact on cancer health care due to the inherent features of this high-risk group of patients. 1, 2 Scientific reports from Asia, Europe, and North America have remarked on the difficulties to overcome to guarantee proper delivery of continuous oncologic treatment. [3] [4] [5] Scarce data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on developing economies have been published to date.Latin America constitutes a region where health care, especially oncology, has been chronically neglected. 6, 7 The rapid development of the pandemic is currently showing the overall fragility and impaired response measures of regional public health policies and institutional capacities. 8 Radiation therapy is an essential, nonelective service. Considering the region-wide existing deficit and centralized distribution of facilities, any threat to radiation therapy capacity in Latin America endangers patients' access to ideal treatment options. 9, 10 Knowing the current real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiation therapy services across the region might yield insights for cancer control policy. Recently, an impact survey was distributed to radiation oncology practice leaders in the United States by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). This was also administered in Europe by the European Society for Radiation Oncology. With ASTRO's permission, we administered this survey across Latin America to assist in identifying the impact of COVID-19 on our region.ASTRO's permission was obtained to distribute the COVID-19 Survey. Spanish translation was performed by 2 native-speaker radiation oncologists. The survey's content was uploaded to the REDCap online platform (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, Tennessee) for data storage and analysis in both Spanish and English. National radiation therapy society presidents or key opinion leaders from Argentina, Aruba, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela were individually contacted. They were instructed to distribute the survey exclusively to department heads or directors. Only 1 answer from each center was accepted.From May 6 to May 30, the answers were recorded. In total, 26 items between entries and questions were requested to be completed. Data were anonymized to display only the country of origin. The detailed survey in Spanish can be observed in Appendix EA. Frequencies in absolute and percentage values for each field and corresponding median values when applicable were analyzed and displayed, matched with the formulated question in English.Overall, 229 centers were contacted. Complete answers were obtained from a total of 115 surveys (50.2% response rate) and subsequently analyzed, with 85.2% in Spanish and 14.8% in English. Answers were recorded from Argentina (10.4%), Aruba (0.9%), Bolivia (1.7%), Brazil (17.4%), Chile (6.1%), Colombia (13.0%), Costa Rica (0.9%), Dominican Republic (2.6%), Ecuador (1.7%), El Salvador (0.9%), Mexico (26.1%), Panama (0.9%), Paraguay (0.9%), Peru (14.8%), and Venezuela (1.7%) ( Table 1) . Practice financiers were found to be distributed between public (41.1%) and private (50.9%) sources. Other systems were also reported (8%). The median number of radiation oncologists per center was 4 (range, 1-27) and radiation therapists per center was 9 (1-100). Among all participating centers, 87.8% treated 2000 or fewer new patients in 2019, with a median of 600 (24-6200).Overall, over 97% of practices continued to provide radiation services during the pandemic. Only 2.6% (n Z 3) of the responding Latin American centers are currently closed due to the pandemic. Telemedicine was newly incorporated in 64.3% of facilities for on-treatment (29.6%) and posttreatment (34.8%) follow-up. Practices reported a median of 53 (1-490) patients under treatment; however, 80.9% reported a reduction in patient volume (median reduction, 8%; 1%-90%). The estimated revenue decrease was >20% in 53% of answers, whereas 1.7% expected their revenue to increase.Notably, primaries or sites by affected treatment delays are mostly early stage breast cancer (42.6%), low-grade gliomas (24.3%), low-risk prostate cancer (PC) (67%), intermediate-risk PC (41.7%), high-risk PC (13.9%), nonurgent palliative treatments (23.5%), and nonmalignant conditions (42.6%). Detailed locations and entities can be observed in Table 2 .Regarding personnel safety, staff members are routinely screened for COVID-19 in 74.8% of centers, with 96.5% requiring wearing masks, face shields (80.9%), gloves (77.4%), and gowns (67%). Staggered shifts were implemented in 71.3% of facilities. Notably, 51.3% of facilities experienced personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage. Shortages in staff were mostly reported related to COVID-19 infection (27%) or family member infection (27%). New operational measures were taken, with 85.2% routinely screening all patients at the door of the facility, not allowing visitors (82.6%), and requiring patients to wear masks (82.6%). Quarantine procedures were developed for treatment of known COVID-19epositive patients at a specific daytime schedule (22.6%) or treatment at a specific vault or satellite location (10.4%).Regarding information resources for COVID-19, 45.2% used ASTRO's COVID-19 information page and 47% used COVID-19 clinical guidance. No ASTRO-associated resources were used in 31.3% of centers.Interestingly, 58% of responders considered whole-lung radiation therapy to carry positive effects against COVID-19 pneumonitis and would be interested in participating in a prospective trial to investigate this possibility.All detailed answers with their corresponding absolute and percentual values are shown in Appendix EB.This is the first comprehensive effort to gather information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiation oncology in Latin American. Despite tremendous variability in wealth and health care capacities in countries across Latin America, this survey identifies broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the region's cancer care systems.Preliminary results from the ASTRO's COVID-19 Survey, conducted among practitioners across the United States, have been lately released. Findings highlight personnel and PPE shortages, decreased patient volumes and delays in care, and significant economic impact. 11 Despite supply deprivation, general preventive measures have been undertaken in practice, allowing providers to continue uninterrupted treatment delivery. However, a diminution of patient attendance is ongoing, yielding financial shrinkage. 11 Based on this experience, major concern is raised for Latin American facilities. Of the consulted institutions, 50.9% are privately financed centers, which are financially highly dependent on patient influx and thus insurance reimbursement. In addition, a major deficit of PPE is affecting medical practice in the region, impairing radiation therapy services (51.3%) in the same fashion. 12 Another problem arises in terms of dual practice for health care workers in the region; this might be a widely established practice, posing an additional crossedcontagion risk. 13 Moreover, 27% of the consulted centers have reported personnel shortage due to COVID-19. Determining options for not delaying treatment delivery rests mostly on the potential increased mortality risk of adopting delays. In this analysis, the sites most affected by treatment postponement were early breast cancer, PC, nonurgent palliative treatments, and nonmalignant conditions. For most, despite representing ""low-risk"" pathologies, unnecessary delay of treatment onset might undermine expected oncologic outcomes and miss curative possibilities for these patients. 14 Options such as hypofractionation, with strong supportive data, should be explored in centers without previous experience as a potential alternative to delayed treatments.Implementing telemedicine programs could be another beneficial strategy for follow-up schedules, as long as the patient is not required to personally attend. Compared with the US-reported 89% service offer, 64.3% in Latin America have included this feature in favor of the patients. Great advances have been achieved in the past decade in terms of remote controls, mostly through apps specially designed for these purposes; however, logistic limitations such as Internet bandwidth and socioeconomic and geographic characteristics (installed infrastructure) might affect its potential reach. Highlights from the aforementioned results can be observed in Figures 1 and 2 .The novel interest for investigating whole-lung radiation therapy's effects against COVID-19 pneumonitis is another measured parameter in this survey. The willingness to participate (58%) in prospective trials to address this hypothesis should be carefully regarded. Major logistic issues in terms of preventive and protective measures might arise, endangering both practitioners and patients with cancer. Research on these grounds is encouraged only when safety criteria are met. Regional information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America might help elucidate suitable intervention strategies for both personnel and patients. A follow-up survey will be carried out for dynamic monitoring of the pandemic's impact on radiation therapy services and adoption of ameliorating measures.What is the current percentage of patients compared to your typical patient volume?What percentage would you estimate that patient revenue will decrease in your practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic?Is your practice incorporating telemedicine visits?

To date, it has infected almost 33 million individuals and caused more than 991 thousand deaths across the globe (World Health Organization, 2020). Older age and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes are associated with an increased risk of infection and severity of COVID-19 (Espinosa et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Comprehensive social distancing policies, which include closing schools, prohibiting agglomerations, travelling restrictions, and staying-at-home recommendations, have been adopted by several countries to prevent introducing the disease to new areas or reduce human-to-human transmission in areas where COVID-19 is already circulating (Aquino et al., 2020) . Despite the benefits of social distancing as a public health strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic, its consequences on daily lifestyle have negatively impacted the cardiovascular (Mattioli et al., 2020) and mental health of individuals (Dubey et al., 2020) .Although changes in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) are expected (Hall et al., 2020) , the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on objectively measured PA and SB is still unclear. For older adults with hypertension who represent a high-risk group (Espinosa et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) , the description of movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic may play accelerometer wear time. The subject was included as a random effect due to the high intra-subject variability, as observed by the intra-subject intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 0.26 and 0.64 for volume-related variables of SB and PA and by the intra-subject ICC between 0.08 and 0.73 for pattern-related variables of SB and PA, respectively. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to calculate the coefficient estimates (β), estimated marginal means (EMM), standard error (SE), and 95% confidence interval (CI). Residuals distribution was verified using the normal Q-Q plot. The variables that were not normally distributed were square root transformed. In these cases, the model analysis was performed only with the transformed variables, but the original descriptive results were presented for a better clinical interpretation. A two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Win/v.25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).Five participants declined to participate in the study (three for personal reasons, one was sick with dizziness symptoms, and one was in quarantine due to direct contact with a relative infected by COVID-19). One participant was excluded due to a technical issue with the accelerometer. Thus, a total of 35 participants were included in the final analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included participants. Most participants were women (65.7%) and married (48.6%). All participants were taking antihypertensive medication(s). In addition, most participants had dyslipidemia (51.4%) and were overweight/obese (48.6%). Approximately one-third had type 2 diabetes (34.3%) and one-fourth were ex-smokers (22.9%).The PA and SB volumes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 . Considering the total period (weekdays and weekend), there was a significant increase in SB (β = 29.6 min/day, p = 0.032), a decrease in steps/day (β = -886, p = 0.018), moderatevigorous PA (β = -2.8 min/day, p = 0.018), and a trend for light PA (β = -26.6 min/day, p = 0.053).Similar results were observed in the models using the accelerometer wear time %. There was a significant decrease in moderate-vigorous PA (β = -2.3 min/day, p = 0.030) and a decreasing trend for steps/day (β = -721, p = 0.081) on weekdays. No significant changes were observed for SB and light PA. However, there was a significant increase in SB and a decrease in light PA and moderatevigorous PA in the models using the accelerometer wear time %. Greater changes in movement behavior were observed on the weekend. There was a significant increase in SB (β = 57.8 min/day, p < 0.001) and a decrease in light PA (β = -51.6 min/day, p = 0.003) and moderate-vigorous PA (β = -5.8 min/day, p = 0.003) in both models (min/day and accelerometer wear time %). There was also a significant decrease in steps/day on the weekend (β = -1739, p < 0.001). In addition, it was tested the within-group changes in PA and SB volumes controlling for age and sex (Supplementary Table 1 ). After the inclusion of these covariates, the results remained unchanged.The PA and SB patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Table 3 .Considering the total period, there was a significant increase in sedentary bouts ≥ 10 and 30 minutes (β = 42.0 min/day; β = 37.7 min/day, respectively; p < 0.05) and the length of sedentary bouts.Also, there was a decrease in the number of breaks ≥ 1 and 5 minutes from SB (β = -6.0 breaks/day; β = -2.3 breaks/day, respectively; p < 0.05) and the break rate. There was a significant increase in sedentary bouts ≥ 30 minutes (β = 33.4 min/day, p = 0.023) and the length of sedentary bouts, as well as a decrease in the break rate on weekdays. The greater changes in the SB pattern were observed on the weekend. There was a significant increase in sedentary bouts ≥ 10 and 30 minutes (β = 73.9 min/day; β = 54.4 min/day, respectively; p < 0.05) and the length of sedentary bouts. In addition, there was a decrease in the number of breaks ≥ 1 and 5 minutes from SB (β = -J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 8.0 breaks/day; β = -4.6 breaks/day, respectively; p < 0.05) and the break rate. No significant changes were observed in the PA pattern on weekdays or on the weekend. In addition, it was tested the within-group changes in PA and SB patterns controlling for age and sex (Supplementary Table   2 ). After the inclusion of these covariates, the results remained unchanged.This study aimed to report the objectively measured movement behavior of hypertensive older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main findings showed that the individuals increased the time spent in SB, decreased the amount of steps/day and the time spent in light and moderate-vigorous PA during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the SB pattern was modified, whereas prolonged/uninterrupted sedentary time increased and breaks in SB decreased.Importantly, the greater changes in PA and SB occurred on the weekend.A comprehensive social distancing policy has been adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, including high-, middle-and low-income countries (Aquino et al., 2020) . Particularly in middle-and low-income countries where individuals often live in houses with limited space shared with other family members (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2020), it seems reasonable to expect that a period of high mobility restriction in the public areas and a ""stayat-home"" recommendation might impact the PA and SB levels (Hall et al., 2020) . Indeed, our findings confirm the expected unhealthy changes in movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight that the decreases in PA and the increases in SB levels occurred in a sample of hypertensive older adults who already had low PA (~5,800 steps/day, ~5 hour/day of light PA, and ~15 min/day of moderate-vigorous PA) and high SB (~11 hour/day) levels before the COVID-19 pandemic.Hypertensive older adults are a high-risk group for COVID-19 severity (Espinosa et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Since the interruption of the HEXA study in March 2020, the participants have been asked about COVID-19 symptoms and their compliance with the social distancing policy by weekly phone calls. From March 2020 to the end of the data collection on June 2020, no participants J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reported COVID-19 symptoms and all of them reported that they are following the social distancing policy imposed in the city of Natal, which included staying at home. Interestingly, the greater changes in PA and SB were observed on the weekend, which may be partially explained by higher restrictions for activities commonly performed on Saturday and Sunday outside home, such as playing with grandchildren, going to a park, attending religious activities, and shopping at malls and grocery stores. Our findings suggest that there was a reallocation of time spent in light PA and steps for time spent in SB with a more prolonged/uninterrupted pattern especially on the weekend.A high amount of time spent in SB, especially in a prolonged/uninterrupted sitting pattern, might have several cardiovascular-and metabolic-related implications (Biswas et al., 2015) . Although it is not possible to determine how much time the participants spent sitting in the present study, this is the most common SB in humans. Prolonged/uninterrupted sitting reduces the blood flow of the lower limbs, decreasing the shear stress, which attenuates nitric oxide and increases endothelin 1 production, in turn promoting endothelial dysfunction due to a decreased flow-mediated dilation (Carter et al., 2017) . These alterations can contribute to increase the arterial stiffness, which is a strong predictor of major cardiovascular diseases/events (Ben-Shlomo et al., 2014; Vlachopoulos et al., 2010) . In addition, experimental studies have showed impairments in post-prandial insulin sensitivity and glucose levels using prolonged/uninterrupted sitting models (Loh et al., 2020) .Taken together, our findings suggest that the participants are more vulnerable to a cardiometabolic disturbance cascade during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may potentially increase their risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, prolonged/uninterrupted SB should be considered as a target for management during the COVID-19 pandemic in hypertensive older adults.Additional changes in movement behavior which have occurred in the present study were a reduction in steps per day and time spent in light PA. It seems that the majority of time spent in steps per day and light PA before the COVID-19 pandemic was reallocated for SB, given that the reduction in time spent in moderate-vigorous PA was modest and the individuals already had a very low PA level in this intensity. Evidence has emerged in more recent years showing that in addition J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to moderate-vigorous PA, the amount of steps per day (Saint-Maurice et al., 2020) and time spent in light PA seem to play a role in reducing mortality risk (Ku et al., 2020) , although its protective mechanisms are less known. In a prospective population-based cohort study of older men from the UK, each additional 30 minutes spent in SB and light PA were associated with a hazard ratio for allcause mortality of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.25) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.90), respectively (Jefferis et al., 2019). In addition, each additional 1,000 steps/day were associated with a hazard ratio for allcause mortality of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) (Jefferis et al., 2019). Therefore, in addition to decreasing SB, two additional targets for management during the COVID-19 pandemic are the increase in the amount of steps per day and time spent in light PA, which were dramatically decreased on the weekend (~1,700 steps/day and ~51 min/day, respectively).Moderate-vigorous PA is the core component of PA guidelines given its well-known benefits. Despite this, the majority of older adults do not perform the recommended amount of Stamatakis et al., 2019) , which is very uncommon in hypertensive older adults. Therefore, it seems unrealistic to propose home-based countermeasures delivered to increase the moderatevigorous PA levels of these individuals in a great magnitude during the COVID-19 pandemic.Feasible home-based actions focusing on reducing the time spent in prolonged/uninterrupted SB, reallocating time for PA independent of its intensity, seems to be more realistic actions.Based on our findings, a rule of thumb seems to be ""move more, sit less, more often"" (Dempsey et al., 2018) , particularly at home. Although challenging, some actions might be implemented to elicit healthier movement behavior: i) increase time spent in moderate-vigorous PA by home-based aerobic exercises (e.g. walking in place, walking, dancing), bodyweight exercises (e.g. chair squat, wall push-ups, calf raises), and household chores (e.g. cleaning, dusting or vacuuming), trying to meet 150 min/week (Pescatello et al., 2015) ; ii) decrease the time spent in SB This study has limitations which should be mentioned. First, this study was not a priori designed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on movement behavior in hypertensive older adults.It is an exploratory analysis that has included a sample of participants who have been screed for a clinical trial that was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, this study included medicated hypertensive older adults aged 60-80 years without known cardiovascular diseases (i.e. coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure). Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution and not generalized for other hypertensive populations. Despite the above-mentioned limitations, our preliminary findings might contribute to better understanding of the unhealthy changes in movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic and guide future feasible preventive and therapeutic actions for hypertensive older adults.The COVID-19 pandemic may elicit unhealthy changes in movement behavior in hypertensive older adults, characterized by an increase in time spent in SB and a decrease in time spent in PA, especially on weekend. Further studies involving larger samples are needed to confirm our preliminary results.This study was supported by the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development Values expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%).Abbreviations: ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; HR, heart rate; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic.This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program.We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred.Early in the emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, created the Centralized Registry of Convalescent Plasma Donors (CROCPD-BA), with the aim of collecting, processing and distributing convalescent plasma, and issuing recommendations for its use in patients with COVID-19 [17] . Accordingly, the objective of the present study is to compare the epidemiological characteristics, outcomes and independent predictors of mortality among patients who received convalescent plasma and those who did not receive it, who were admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted over 2 months, beginning on June 1, 2020, which included consecutive patients ≥18 years diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 with RT-PCR, admitted to hospitals with pneumonia. Data were obtained from the National Vigilance System (SNVS 2.0), the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System, and the CROCPD-BA.Collected variables were age, gender, comorbidities [18] [19] (arterial hypertension, diabetes, preexistent cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency), requirement of mechanical ventilation, treatments, death or discharge, and convalescent plasma administration. Severe adverse events related to plasma infusion, as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusionassociated circulatory overload (TACO) were also recorded [20] .Information about plasma collection and characteristics is available in the Supplement.The requirement of convalescent plasma was initiated by assistant physicians as part of a Program of Expanded Access [17] . The indications issued by the CROCPD-BA were presence of pneumonia, defined as of lung infiltrates, plus one of the following: were confirmed on patient death certificates.Statistical analysis: Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median, [0.25-0.75] percentiles. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages. Differences between survivors and nonsurvivors, and between patients who received plasma or not, were analyzed with chi-square, t, or Mann-Whitney U-tests, as appropriate.To identify independent predictors of 28-day mortality, variables differing between survivors and nonsurvivors with a p value <0.10 were entered into a multivariable regression model, using a forward stepwise analysis. Adjusted risks were expressed as odd ratios (OR) and confidence intervals of 95% [CI95%]Data were analyzed with SSPS-21 (Amonk, NY, US).The main finding of our study was that the administration of convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with a decrease of 24.4% in adjusted mortality. This effect was consistent over all grades of severity on admission, although it was greater in less critical patients-those admitted to the general ward.In this study, the global mortality of 34.6% was higher than the 21-28% shown in observational studies [21] [22] [23] [24] which can be ascribed to a different patient case-mix. The proportion of patients admitted to the ICU was 42.6%, of which 21.6% required mechanical ventilation on admission. These figures are notably higher than those reported by two studies from Spain (respectively for each: n=15,111 and 4,035, with ICU admission of 8.3% and 18%;and mortality of 21% and 28%); United States (n=11,721, ICU admission of 19.9%, and mortality of 21.4%), and United Kingdom (n= 20,133, ICU admission 16.8%, and mortality of 26%) [21] [22] [23] [24] .Conversely, two small clinical trials demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality: in a study from Spain (n=81) including severely ill patients, mortality in the convalescent plasma subgroup was 0% vs. 9.3 % in the control, and in an Iraqi study (n =49), it was 4.8% vs. 28.5%, respectively [27-28].Our study develops a different approach to this very relevant issue. We analyzed a cohort of 3,529 unselected, consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 868 received convalescent plasma; its administration was evaluated as any other prognostic variable for mortality. We observed an independent, favorable effect on survival, and this is a novel finding. Although the nature of our study was observational, it was carried out using a robust database composed of observations prospectively collected, within the framework of a pre-established government program. Other independent predictors of mortality were age, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, similar to current literature on the topic [23, [32] [33] [34] .This effect of convalescent plasma was more pronounced in less severe patients -those admitted to the ward, suggesting the importance of timely administration. Even though age >65 was one inclusion criterion for receiving convalescent plasma, surprisingly, those who received it were, in fact, younger. We cannot discard selection bias of physicians prescribing a seemingly promising therapy to patients with greater chances of responding to it. Nevertheless, older age was an independent predictor of mortality, as expected [23,34]","Argentina","first author","2020-10-09",10

Worldwide, as of September 30, 2020, there are more than 33 million infected people and more than 1 million deaths from COVID-19. In Brazil, the COVID-19 outbreak is still not under control, and the number of cases is still rising or maintained, depending on the Brazilian region. Brazil is in a critical situation, with 4,777,522 of confirmed cases and 142,921 deaths by It is known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is predominantly transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth, or nose. 2 There is still no effective pharmaceutical intervention or vaccine to cure or prevent coronavirus infection.In this context, non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, hand hygiene and changes in population behavior) are associated with the reduced transmission of COVID-19. 3, 4 Additionally, facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings. 5, 6 The global spread of COVID-19 in early 2020 has significantly increased the demand for facemasks around the world. 7 This caused a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) mainly because the general population gets started to use and stock PPE, fearing the contamination without following national guidelines. 8 Latin America's shortages are compounded by a fundamental lack of preparedness and a lack of manufacturing resources to make PPE or ventilators. 9 However, these countries are receiving global support and help to face the pandemic and these challenges. 9 The use of facemasks in public places and business closed spaces is compulsory in many countries. 10 The purpose of wearing masks is to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets containing viruses, preventing infected people from transmitting the virus to others and offering protection to healthy people against infection. 7, 11 Studies show that the mask acts as a temporal low pass filter, smoothens the droplet rate over time, and reduces the overall transmission. 3, 7 Systematic reviews about the use of facemasks indicate a reduction of the relative risk for infection ranging from 6 to 80%, including for several types of coronavirus infection (COVID-19, SARS, MERS). 12, 13 This wide range of results might be a result of different criteria in the selection of studies, population, and probably the type of facemask. For the COVID-19 specifically, the evidence of prevention of contamination is low because it was based on observational studies with a high risk of bias. 13 However, facemasks are physical barriers, cheap, and efficient in reducing short distance transmission through direct or indirect contact and droplet emission. 11, 12, [14] [15] [16] Despite the uncertainty of infection control with the use of masks, the possible risk reduction must be considered in the context of the local epidemiology. 13 This way, in Brazil, the public health measures to implement of facemask is more crucial due to the higher baseline risk for transmission. 17 Mandatory use of facemask in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic caused the worsening in the global shortage of commercial supplies and led to the widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives, 7 and this have changed the Brazilians population' habits. From a public policy perspective, there are concerns about the efficacy and the discomfort of prolonged use facemasks, which have led the population to a wide variation adherence to the government's recommendations; some people are not using facemasks, and others are using as recommended.Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the compliance, opinion and behavior of the Brazilian population about the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.This cross-sectional study was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol number: 4.079.866).A structured questionnaire was developed according to the CHERRIES recommendations 18 and tested on a pilot population before its administration in this study. The pilot study was undertaken with 30 laypeople to evaluate the questions' clarity and the language used. Some words were rewritten with synonyms so that the individuals were more likely to understand. The pilot study participants were not included in the main study.The web-survey was prepared in Google Forms, and the link was posted on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and sent by WhatsApp by the authors. In the introduction of the questionnaire, the subjects were informed about the study's objectives and gave their informed consent agreeing to participate. The approximate time for answering the questionnaire of 5 minutes was also informed.The online survey was available for responses for 7 days, from July 25 to July 31, 2020. The questionnaire was anonymous; no personal identification was requested. Since the original questionnaire was an open survey, a sample size calculation was not performed, and it was not possible to determine a response rate.The questionnaire contained 17 multiple-choice questions, including participants' characteristics (sex, age, region of residence, level of education and family income) and questions about the use of facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1 ). The approximate time for the answer to the questionnaire was informed, being about five minutes. Before sending the response to the questionnaire, participants could change their answers many times as they wish.After data was collected, an excel spreadsheet was assembled for statistical analysis. No duplicate response control tool was used, but if identical responses in the submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13 sequence were observed, one was excluded. The answers and data obtained were stored by the researchers and used only for this study.To assess the intrarater agreement, question 8 (Are you wearing facemasks during the pandemic?) was asked twice throughout the questionnaire. This question was chosen because it presents only two choices: yes or no, and was an important question for the survey. Kappa statistics was used to verify the intrarater agreement, and the result showed a coefficient of 0.96, which is considered an excellent agreement. 19 Descriptive statistics were performed with percentages for each question/answer. Chi-square tests were used to compare the answers between health professionals and persons with family members working with health care and the laypeople.Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (version 20, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and the results were considered significant at P<0.05.A total of 1277 individuals participated in the survey. Demographics are shown in Figure 2 . The mean age of the respondents was 39.03 years (SD 12.02). Most participants were females (81.8%), from the southeast (45.4%) and south (40.1%) Brazilian regions, had a postgraduation degree (46.4%) and had family income more than 5 minimum wages (51.1%) ( Figure 2 ). The mean level of anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic was 6.18 (SD 2.79). Most of the respondents (66.4%) were health professionals or had family members working in healthcare. This healthrelated group presented more males, a higher education level, a greater family income, and was less anxious with the pandemic than the laypeople group (Table 1) .Almost all the participants (99.1%) reported wearing facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 34.2% are wearing masks just because it is mandatory; 65.8% would continue to wear masks even if it was not mandatory. More lay people reported that they would not wear masks if not mandatory (Table 1) . Most subjects (50.4%) believe that the use of masks is effective in preventing infection by the novel coronavirus; 43.9% think that it prevents partially, and 5.7% believe that the use of masks does not prevent contamination by COVID-19.Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants (49.5%); 43.1% are wearing disposable masks, and 7.4% are wearing both types of facemasks. From the subjects that are wearing reusable fabric masks, 44.3% always wash it right after the use, when they get home, even if the mask was used for a short time; 29.2% wash it every day, 12.8% twice to three times a week, 9.6% once a week and only 4.1% reported to had never washed their facemasks.Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to business offices, supermarkets, pharmacies, shops (99.5%), and health facilities such as medical and dental offices (93.1%). Most participants were wearing masks to go to malls and wide closed locations (68.4%), walking outdoor (74.5%), to receive someone who comes to your home (67%) and inside elevators and public garages (77.7%). The minority of subjects were wearing masks to go to the house of family members or close friends (44.6%), to practice exercises outdoor (48%) or in closed places (47.8%) and while driving a car (45.3%). In public transportation, only 3.8% of the participants did not wear masks; 46.4% use masks and, 49.8% do not use public transportation ( Figure 3 ).The great majority of the participants (83.1%) feel more protected with the use of facemasks, but the health-related group feels more protected than the laypeople (Table 1) . Eighty-three percent of the subjects would wear a mask during the pandemic in certain living environments with other people, even if it was not mandatory. Health professions and related subjects reported more that would wear a mask in certain environments, even if it was not mandatory (Table 1) .Most respondents (67.3%) reported that the use of masks bothers them in some way; the most cited reasons for the discomfort was: 58.9% feel trapped, suffocated, 55.1% feel shortness of breath, 49.8% feel discomfort in the ears due to the elastics, and 43.9% reported that the use of mask fogs up the glasses. Other reasons were to feel the own breath (11.1%), dermatitis/skin problems (6.6%) and esthetic issues with the use of masks (5.3%). Laypeople reported more discomfort with the use of masks than health-related subjects (Table 1) .This survey's findings showed that despite some concerns and issues, the Brazilian population is wearing facemasks. These data also suggest that people believe that wearing facemasks protect against COVID-19 infection.Because clear water, soap and sanitizer alcohol gel are sometimes unavailable, people can be infected through hand-mouth, hand-nose, or hand-eye contact before handwashing, 14,20 so the use of facemasks have gained great importance lately, being of mandatory use for coronavirus prevention. 10 As this generated a huge change in the daily routine of the population, this study aimed to assess their adaptation and behavior concerning the use of masks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the use of facemasks by the community in Brazil.Open surveys do not allow calculation of the response rate. Our sample presented a satisfactory number of participants since the subjects were from all Brazilian regions, with a great age range (excluding children and adolescents below 16 years), with different education degrees and family incomes. However, the sample is not necessarily generalizable, and this is a limitation of our study. Nevertheless, open surveys generate interesting data, especially when the objective of the study is a qualitative analysis to analyze the current trends of a specific issue. 21 Besides, the internet nowadays has great representativeness in society and population. 22 This way, the sample obtained is adequate and satisfactory, allowing reliable assumptions about the Brazilian population's opinion and behavior about the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.Females were the majority in the present study. This was already expected since women participate more in answering surveys. [23] [24] [25] [26] The mean level of anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic was 6.18 (SD 2.79). Recent studies showed that depressive and anxiety symptoms had been reported in 16 to 28% of the subjects screened during the COVID-19 pandemic and these responses affect both the general public and healthcare workers. 27, 28 Uncertain prognoses and uncertainty about the future, the imposition of unfamiliar public health measures that infringe on personal freedoms, large and growing financial losses, and conflicting messages from authorities are among the major stressors that undoubtedly contribute to widespread the emotional distress and increased risk of anxiety during the pandemic. 29, 30 Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comMost of the respondents (66.4%) were health professionals or had family members working in healthcare. This health-related group presented more males, a higher education level, a greater family income, and was less anxious with the pandemic than the laypeople group (Table 1) . It was expected since it is known that higher income is beneficial for psychological well-being. 31, 32 People with higher income are happier, more satisfied with their lives, material status, health, achievement, economic situation, and social conditions. 33 When the questionnaire was sent to the subjects, the use of facemask had been advised or compulsory in Brazil for more than three months, and the coronavirus pandemic was at the outbreak's rising curve. A recent survey showed that N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer fabric could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols, respectively. 20 Moreover, the use of masks can enhance vigilance, prevent direct hand-mouth or handnose contact, and reduce air contamination of pathogens from infected people. 20 Recent studies demonstrated a decrease in psychopathological symptoms after the compulsory use of masks in public spaces 34 and workplaces. 35 Facemasks increased the level of perceived self-protection as well as improved well-being and mental health. 34 Almost all the participants (99.1%) reported wearing facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is in agreement with the results of Leung et al 3 conducted in Hong Kong in the early stage of the pandemic. However, 34.2% are wearing masks only because it is mandatory. It is known that compliance with the use of facemasks is affected by the perception of risk. 36 During a pandemic, it would be expected that compliance improves. Models suggest that public mask wearing is most effective at stopping the spread of the virus when compliance is high. 37 The balance between risk perception and discomfort affects individual decisions to use facemasks. 5 When the risk of infection is thought to be high, acceptance and compliance with interventions to prevent infection are generally higher. 38 A common policy response to this is to ensure compliance by using laws and regulations, which is still not completely defined in Brazil.Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants (49.5%). It was expected since there is currently a global shortage of N95 and FFP2 respirators, as well as disposable surgical facemasks; the use of simple fabric masks seems to be a smart and low-cost solution. Howard et al 37 recommend adopting reusable fabric mask wearing, as an effective form of infection control, in conjunction with hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies.Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to business offices, supermarkets, pharmacies and public transportation (Figure 3) , and the great majority reported feeling more protected while using facemasks (Table 1) . Another finding was that the health-related group feels more protected than the laypeople (Table 1 ). The available evidence suggests that near-universal adoption of nonmedical masks in public places, combined with complementary health measures, could successfully reduce the community spread. 37 One can think that wearing masks can give the false feeling that the public is completely DovePress protected from the virus, and within this context, it could be speculated that the health-related group was feeling more protected due to their greater knowledge related to infectious diseases and also the usual routine of wearing masks. Nevertheless, Chu et al 12 did not detect any striking differences in the effectiveness of facemask use between community settings and health care settings. However, the existing evidence regarding the efficacy of using facemasks is sparse, and findings are inconsistent. While some studies support the use of respiratory protection, 12, 20, 37, 39 they also evidence that this intervention did not afford complete protection from infection. 12 Therefore, the objective of this study was not to evaluate the effectiveness of the facemask use but to evaluate if and how the population is using it.The health professionals and related subjects reported more that would wear a mask even if it was not mandatory (Table 1) , maybe because these individuals or their family members are frequently more in contact with possible infected people than the other group, and need to be more cautious and prevent against contamination. Besides that, for frontline healthcare workers, wearing masks is necessary as it empowers them to fight the deadly COVID-19 with less fear and anxiety of contracting the disease. 40 However, ""the mask"" is perhaps the mostpowerful psychological symbol for the common people.Most respondents (67.3%) reported that masks bother them somehow, and the main reason reported for the discomfort was the sensation of feeling trapped or suffocated. Besides that, laypeople reported more discomfort with the use of masks than health-related subjects (Table  1) . A recent study 41 showed that the use of masks ends up being a new social norm. The higher the frequency of people wearing masks in the displayed social group, the less strange they felt about themselves because the mere exposure to social groups wearing masks reduces the strange feeling of wearing a mask. 41 According to MacIntyre et al, 5 discomfort is not the sole determinant of compliance, which is also influenced by cultural factors, risk perception, and experience of serious outbreaks such as SARS. In Brazil, the cultural factors associated with the bad example of the President who appears in public places without wearing a mask can lead to less adherence by people to the use of masks as recommended by health authorities.The acknowledgment of the uncertainty about the quality of evidence and understanding the difference between relative and absolute reductions in risk of contamination is the key to sort out the many questions and the confusion about the use of facemasks. 13 Despite that, exceptional situations require exceptional measures. In front of the huge challenge to mitigate the pandemic, many daily habits were altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic and one of them is the use of masks, even with all the issues inherent to it.Based on several previous findings, the use of facemasks can help prevent the COVID-19 and other infections. 6, 39, 42 However, the use of facemasks by the general public is most effective at reducing the spread of the virus when compliance is high. 37 And compliance is related to the comfort of people wearing it. 6 Besides, individuals are more likely to wear facemasks due to the perceived susceptibility and severity of being infected with life-threatening diseases. 6 Some factors that limit the population's compliance with the use of masks are discomfort and the sense of embarrassment. 6 Media campaigns and public health promotion activities supported by governmental agencies can increase the use of facemasks by the population. 6, 37, 43 This study will give policymakers a broader view of how the general public responds to the COVID-19 pandemic and changing their lifestyles.The mean level of anxiety with the COVID-19 pandemic was 6.18. Almost all the participants were wearing facemasks, and they believe that its use effectively prevents infection by the novel coronavirus. Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants. Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to crowded and public places, and most participants feel more protected with the use of facemasks.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-19",10

While COVID-19-related research advances at remarkable speed, all other scientific areas have suffered from social distancing or lockdown restrictions. Therefore, the scientific community must use this moment to reflect and understand what structural characteristics give the SARS-CoV-2 such a high targeting and infectious efficiency [1] [2] .Over the past decades, science has advanced to a point of astonishing control over materials at the nanoscale and nanomedicine has developed sophisticated platforms able to improve therapeutic outcomes significantly [3] . However, one of the main challenges in the field remains the design of successful targeting strategies [4] . Many of the currently available nanoparticle formulations undergo non-specific interactions that result in random drug delivery and cellular internalization profiles. These interactions divert nanoparticles from their intended path, generate a series of off-target effects and leave them more vulnerable, for example, to phagocyte clearance. Viruses, in turn, are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f considered as successful examples of targeted nanoparticles that have been refined through evolution. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 uses its structural spike (S) glycoprotein specifically to mediate its entry into host cells [5, 6] . This protein is homogeneously distributed on its surface as part of a well-defined geometry and symmetry [7] . Such surface homogeneity is not observed in laboratory-made nanoparticles, since standard functionalization methods lead to a non-homogeneous surface coverage which likely hinders the specific interaction between active groups and their receptors. Scientists have looked to viruses for inspiration for some time [8] [9] [10] [11] , however, to our knowledge, most strategies only benefit from either viral topographic features or specific receptormediated interactions. Therefore, we suggest the key to improve targeting strategies may lie in structural features that bring together the meticulous viral surface organization and responsive interactions with cell receptors.Here, we shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 architectural characteristics as an example of a highly-efficient targeted nanoparticle, establishing an analogy with the current challenges regarding synthetic targeted nanomaterials.SARS-CoV-2 (60-140 nm) provides a nanoscale scaffold that can be explored as a model for studying and developing synthetic nanoparticles for biological applications [12, 13] . Before establishing an analogy with engineered nanomaterials, it is necessary to understand the viral structure and its interactions with the host machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 structural spike (S) protein is homogeneously distributed on the virus surface and plays a central role in viral tropism through selective binding to the human membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2, 14] . The nose is the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f initial site of airway SARS-CoV-2 infection and serves as a reservoir for the virus to spread across the respiratory tract [2] .Notably, ACE2 receptors are specifically harbored on the motile cilia of nose epithelium cells [15] , which gives the virus considerable advantage. First, the cilia length is about 50-fold the virus size (~5 µm vs. ~100 nm) and represents a substantially large surface area containing receptors for virus attachment (Fig. 1 ) [16] . Second, this virus-cilium interaction impairs proper ciliary function in later disease stages, inhibiting the mucociliar clearance that could prevent further viral infection [15] . Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 presents a 10-fold stronger binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV, although both viruses share 76% of the S protein genetic sequence [17] . In coronaviruses, the S glycoprotein, a homotrimer comprised of two domains (S1 and S2), presents a conformational flexibility that is used both to evade immune surveillance, in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is hidden and less likely to be found by defense cells (lying down conformation), and specifically to bind to ACE2 receptors, in which the RBD is exposed to the environment (standing-up conformation). SARS-CoV RBD is predominantly found in the ""up"" state, whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is predominantly found in the ""down"" state. Even so, SARS-CoV-2 is able to maintain high infectivity rates. The reason is that, upon activation, the S protein radically changes its conformation and exposes the RBD to bind to ACE2 receptors with incredible affinity. These changes involve the shedding of S1 enabled by host proteases at the cell surface that cleave the S1/S2 junctionsuch as the serine protease TMPRSS2. This cleavage is possible due to a four amino acid insertion (PRRA) in the S1/S2 region that is particular to the SARS-CoV-2. This results in the exposure of a conserved C-terminal sequence that is known to bind to neuropilin co-receptors, thus creating an additional binding site for virus entry [18, 19] . Upon cleavage, S goes from what is called the pre-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fusion to the post-fusion conformation. It was found that the S proteins rotates freely around their stalks when in the pre-fusion conformation. This rotational freedom is not usually found in other coronaviruses and is associated with the sparser S protein density observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, this rotational freedom may facilitate the engagement with ACE2 receptors since these are dimers and bind to two RBDs at a time. Moreover, pre-fusion S are spaced by 15 nm average distance between each other, which may also be key for the ACE2 binding [20] . Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are densely and homogeneously decorated with several kinds of Nlinked glycans composed of complex-type and oligomannose-type glycans that ensure adequate folding of the S protein, modulate the accessibility to ACE2 and often act as a physical shield by helping the virus to evade immune system, since the glycans, mostly belonging on the host cell itself, are rarely recognized as invaders [5, 20, 21] . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can be considered as a complex nano-structure with a remarkably effective protein-receptor pair that is highly sensitive to in loco stimuli to complete its internalization.Viruses are highly ordered biological structures. They display a surface organizational level where repetitive units of specific protein domains are located at almost-crystalline distances [7] . The viral protein arrangement is an example of natural self-assembly and results in nano-structures with characteristic geometries. Therefore, viruses are classified within mathematical models that describe their symmetries [7] .This highly symmetric architecture allows viruses to build up their structures by coding the maximum number of protein copies from the minimum genetic informationa principle that Crick and Watson called genetic economy [7] . Proteins adopt quasi-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f equivalent positions within the viral geometric constraint and repeat this configuration throughout the structure [22] , forming what resembles an almost artistic mosaic-like composition.This meticulous spatial arrangement enables the occurrence of multivalency where multiple ligand copies interact simultaneously with various cellular receptors [23] . This phenomenon turns a number of weak interactions into a strong binding event which increases the internalization probability [23] . Instinctively, the scientific community usually illustrates synthetic functionalized nanoparticles with homogeneously-distributed ligands on the surface. However, commonly-used functionalization protocols lead to a non-homogeneous ligand distribution [24] . Therefore, the nanoparticle surface displays areas with much higher ligand density than others as well as areas with no ligand at all [24] . This lack of surface homogeneity is, perhaps, the most striking difference between laboratory-made nanoparticles and viruses. Although it is not completely clear to what extent nanoparticles can benefit from ligand arrangement homogeneity and/or symmetry, some works suggest that an optimal interligand distance can result in stronger protein-receptor interactions, especially when one of them is a dimer/trimer [25, 26] . We can envisage possible consequences of a random distribution regarding cellular recognition and internalization. A non-homogeneous ligand spacing may impair the advantage of multivalent interactions, since they are highly sensitive to the ligand density and distancing [25, 26] . This, in turn, likely decreases the effectiveness of nanoparticle uptake through specific mechanisms. Naturally, the binding affinity constant plays a pivotal role and, for some protein-receptor pairs, a single binding event may be enough for the cell to internalize the nanoparticle. Nevertheless, the viral homogeneouslyarranged protein distribution statistically favors a successful binding encounter when all J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f particle rotational degrees are taken into account. For SARS-CoV-2 specifically, this probability is tremendously enhanced by the aforementioned presence of ACE2 on the cilia of nasal epithelium cells by the S protein rotational freedom, since both are flexible enough to assume spatial orientations that favor multiple binding events. For engineered nanomaterials, the probability of a successful anchoring event is hindered by a noticeable chance that the nanoparticle encounters the surface portion of the cell that presents no active binding groups, which consequently results in no recognition (Fig.   2a) . It is worth mentioning that viral particles are all quasi-identical copies (as long as mutation is discarded). Thus, the evolution-optimized protein arrangement is present on every particle and maximizes the chances of molecular recognition. Conversely, current functionalization methods result in nano-formulations that are collections of ""one-of-akind"" particles and compel researchers to adopt the concept of an ""average"" nanoparticle that is, in fact, illusive.SARS-CoV-2 can be simplified to a nanoparticle that reaches its target almost without obstacles and interacts with its target-receptors with remarkable affinity. We can then endeavor to translate this extremely targeting-effective example to the nanomedicine context. Although this exercise seems trivial, we must thoroughly take into account the viral structure and overcome synthetic and functionalization barriers to maintain the bio-functionality of active groups on the surface of engineered nanomaterials. Thus, one of the most challenging tasks to mimic natural entities is related to the precise control of the surface organization. SARS-CoV-2 prefusion S protein, as mentioned, presents an average distancing of 15 nm and benefits from a rotational freedom that confers the necessary flexibility to assume orientations that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f favor efficient binding to ACE2 dimers. To mimic the viral organizational level, nanomaterial designers need to surpass current methods and couple precise synthetic approaches with surface functionalization strategies that allow the control of averagedistancing between bio-active groups. This would naturally improve intra-batch reproducibility (i.e. homogeneity among particles), which we see as a key factor to advancing targeted nanomedicine. The translation of surface patterning techniques (e.g.DNA origami) [27, 28] to the nanomaterials surface represents a promising alternative.Likewise, microfluidic devices offer impressive control over nanomaterials' physicochemical properties and have been extensively used in nano-synthesis [29] . Similarly, it is highly relevant to highlight that these laboratory-synthesized nanoparticles must maintain their colloidal stability and avoid non-specific adsorption of components that may divert them from the intended target [30, 31] .It is clear that the fine control of surface arrangement could uplift nanomaterial active targeting strategies, which so far have failed to achieve regulatory levels. Another key concept is that biological events are highly selective and most of them are part of a ""cellular responsive"" mechanism. It is worth recapitulating that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes to enable receptor binding [5] and viral active groups suffer specific on-target modifications (e.g. S1 shedding) in response to cellular activation. These changes characterize a natural example of what we refer to here as ""responsive targeting"". Note that by ""responsive targeting"" we specifically refer to receptor-mediated targeting in which the bio-active group suffers in loco modifications triggered by the cell to complete the interaction. This concept differs from the stimuli-responsiveness usually applied in drug delivery, in which nanomaterials respond to local stimuli (e.g. pH, temperature) to release their contents [32] . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this ""responsiveness"" is essential for the viral tropism, since the RBD J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f is exposed only when it finds its target, keeping the domain safe from immune recognition. Moreover, the modifications on the S protein enable it to bind co-receptors that favor viral entry. It is unclear if protein-functionalized nanoparticles require any coreceptor regulation or structural changes (Fig. 2b) to be specifically recognized and if bio-conjugation techniques impair this flexibility. Therefore, the use of glycans and other post-translational modifications to decorate bio-functionalized nanoparticles may be crucial to grant the proteins conformational flexibility required to bind their receptors selectively. In summary, the translation of viral targeting efficiency to nanomaterial design must unify the surface arrangement and architecture with the rationally-designed ability of the nanomaterial to perform on-site modifications of its active groups (proteins) so to increase the efficiency of receptor-mediated interactions and consequently raise cellular internalization rates. We believe this may be the passport to the development of successful targeting strategies.

This has led school systems around the world to attempt to rapidly transition to remote learning. However, it is unclear how prepared students are to respond to this challenge, and whether a lack of availability of electronic devices and internet connections prevents many students from engaging in remote learning. Even when students do have access, there is little available evidence on how much of their time they will devote to learning. Newspaper reports from U.S. schools report high absence rates for low-income students, with fewer than half of students regularly participating (Goldstein et al, 2020 ). The concern is that these problems of low access to remote learning technologies and limited attendance may be even greater in developing countries, resulting in limited schooling taking place during school shutdowns.We examine remote learning of high school students in Ecuador, a country which suffered one of the worst outbreaks of Coronavirus in the world (Cabrera & Kurmanaev, 2020) . Schools in Ecuador were closed on March 13, 2020, and a national lockdown and quarantine period imposed. We began a rapid response phone survey on March 31, 2020 of over 1500 students who are part of an ongoing evaluation in high schools in the Zone 2 administrative region of the country. Over the month of April we were able to interview 64 percent of our baseline sample, asking them questions about their access and use of remote learning technologies, detailed time-use questions, and questions on their mental health and the main stressors they face because of COVID-19. We then examine heterogeneity in these responses by gender, school grade, wealth quartile, mother's education, ethnicity, province, and internet access.We find that most students are engaging in remote learning. Access to remote learning technologies are reasonably high, with 74 percent having internet access at home, and 59 percent also having a computer or tablet. Three-quarters of students have done some form of online or tele-educative learning in the past week, and 86 percent have done some form of schoolwork. The median student spends 4 h on schoolwork per day. Gender differences in remote learning are small, with females doing slightly more schoolwork. Female students also do more household tasks than https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105225 0305-750X/Ó 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd. males, while male students are more likely to be working than females. Final year (Grade 12) students spend more time on schooling than younger grades. Students from more disadvantaged groups -the lowest wealth quartile, indigenous students, students whose mothers have secondary education or lower, and students without internet access -have less access to remote learning technologies, and are less likely to be doing schoolwork. For example, 22 percent of students without internet access did no schoolwork in the past day, compared to 9 percent of those with internet and a computer or tablet. Nevertheless, while these differences exist, the majority of students in the lowest wealth quartile and of those with no internet access are still engaging in remote learning.In addition to detailed information on remote learning and time use, our surveys directly ask students questions on mental health status, and on how the COVID-19 pandemic is most affecting them. Most students had spent zero hours outside their house in the past day. The majority identify disruptions in schooling as the biggest issue they face because of COVID-19, with feelings of social isolation the next biggest concern. Despite this, more than two-thirds say they were happy most or all of the time during the past month. While the majority appear to be coping, 16 percent have mental health scores that lie below a threshold indicative of major depression. This suggests scope for psychosocial support to supplement remote learning efforts.The information provided here is, to date, unique in providing detailed time use information and reports directly from students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Less detailed information in other developing countries is being collected from parents or other household adults as part of rapid response household surveys. An early example is provided by Le Nestour et al. (2020) for Senegal, who provide a more pessimistic view of remote learning there: most students were either doing no educational activities, studying alone, or doing exercises given by parents; with fewer than 5 percent doing exercises given by teachers and less than one percent doing online courses. Debenedetti et al. (2020) report that only half of children in Burkina Faso are spending any time on education at home. Asadullah et al. (2020) report an 80 percent decline in the amount of time rural Bangladeshis spend learning. Bosumtwi-Sam and Kabay (2020) report that 26 to 32 percent of secondary school children are spending no time on education, and under one-third of households had been contacted by their child's school since schools had closed. Kihui (2020) reports that a survey of household heads in Kenya found that only 22 percent of their children were engaged in online learning, and another survey in Kenya found parents to be more worried about the educational impacts of COVID-19 than the impacts on their income or health (Kantar, 2020) . Given these problems in access, Bolivia and Kenya went as far as to cancel the entire school year of 2020. Ecuador therefore provides an example of much more engaged remote learning.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides details of the context and survey methodology; Section 3 summarizes access to and use of remote learning technologies; Section 4 examines time-use; Section 5 mental health; and Section 6 concludes.The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Ecuador on February 29, 2020 (El Comercio, 2020 , with the first death occurring March 13 (Reuters, 2020). On this date (March 13), the government suspended classes at every level of schooling in the country, and stay-at-home orders were issued March 16. This interrupted classes partway through the school year, which was to end in June. Cases continued to rise, and on Monday April 6, the Ministry of Education announced that students would not return to school during the current school year. As of May 4, confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached over 31,000, with 1564 deaths (Ministerio de Salud Pública, 2020a), although these numbers are acknowledged to be undercounts due to a lack of testing (Cabrera & Kurmanaev, 2020) . By September 7, 2020, these numbers had grown to over 110,000 confirmed cases and 10,576 deaths (Ministerio de Salud Pública, 2020b).Ecuador's 24 provinces are divided into nine administrative zones or regions. Our study takes place in Zone 2 of Ecuador, which covers three provinces: Pichincha, a relatively urban province that includes the capital city of Quito, and which had the secondhighest number of COVID-19 cases in the country at the time of surveying (1732 as of May 4); and two more rural provinces Orellana (39 cases) and Napo (42 cases) that cover the jungle region and have been less directly affected by COVID-19. By September 7, 2020, Pichincha accounted for the largest share of diagnosed cases in the country (22.8%), while Orellana and Napo were still much less affected, accounting for less than 2 percent of cases each (Ministerio de Salud Pública, 2020b) . Students in Zone 2 appear relatively representative of the country as a whole in terms of performance on the standardized state exam (Ser Bachiller), with the average performance of students in Zone 2 being at the median (fifth) out of the nine zones in the 2018-19 educational period (INEVAL, 2019) .Schooling in Ecuador is compulsory up until the age of 15, which covers primary and lower secondary (up to grade 9). The government has invested heavily in promoting access to upper secondary education (grades 10 through 12), and data from the Ministry of Education show that the attendance rate in 2017 for students of this age was 84 percent.In partnership with the Ministry of Education of Ecuador, Zone 2 (MINEDUC, Zona 2), we have an ongoing project that aims to teach high school students, in grades 10, 11 and 12, skills relevant for careers in entrepreneurship and science, using an online course called Showing Life Opportunities (DOV for the Spanish acronym) that was taught during class time using computers in schools. To be eligible for our project, schools had to have a reliable internet connection (the Ministry of Education improved connections in most of our schools before the program started) and a computer center with enough computers for one class to study. Our project covers 126 high schools in Zona 2, with these schools collectively accounting for more than 80% of all students in Zone 2 in the targeted grades. The schools we cover are more urban (78%) than the national average of 64% of households living in urban areas (World Bank, 2020) , reflecting that schools in urban areas were more likely to have computer laboratories. The average socioeconomic status of students in our study schools is approximately the same as the national average.We randomly selected a sample of 2412 students from 88 schools to attempt to contact for our phone survey. 1 We used phone contact information that the students had provided for themselves and their parents in our baseline survey, along with additional contact assistance from teachers and the Ministry of Education. Students are 14 to 18 in age, with an average age of 15.9 years.The phone survey averaged 20 min in length, and a team of 9 enumerators carried out an average of 60 surveys a day, commencing on March 31, with a two-day break over Easter (April 12/13). Students were randomly ordered, and our protocol was for an enu-1 Our ongoing experiment randomized schools to receive either online entrepreneurial training, online placebo classes in Spanish and English, or a mixture of entrepreneurial training and statistics education. Given time and budget constraints, we excluded schools randomly allocated to the statistics education from our phone survey. Our sampling frame for the phone survey then consisted of 4,163 students in 177 classes in 88 schools. We stratified sampling by treatment status and class, to sample an equal number of students from both treatment arms and include students from all classes.I. Asanov, F. Flores, D. McKenzie et al. World Development 138 (2021) 105225 merator to make at least three attempts to reach a student, and if unsuccessful, a second enumerator would also make at least three attempts, and if still unsuccessful, the same would be done by a third enumerator. The survey took place throughout the month of April, interviewing students in weeks 3, 4, 5 and 6 after schools had closed, with final attempts ending May 3. We successfully interviewed 1552 students for an overall survey response rate of 64.3%. Only 12 students (0.5%) refused the survey, while the rest had phone numbers that were not answered (11.0%), were nonexistent (5.4%), or went straight to voicemail (16.7%). Asanov et al. (2020) provides data and replication files. Appendix Table A1 compares the characteristics of students who respond to the survey to those who did not. While response rates are lower for those from the bottom wealth quartile, students with less-educated mothers, indigenous students, and students in the two more remote provinces, we still have good coverage of students from all these groups. Nevertheless, we caveat that to the extent that students who do not respond have less technology and are more isolated, we may overstate the share of students who are engaging in remote learning. Nevertheless, we see few differences in the characteristics of those students we reach on first attempt, versus those who it took multiple attempts to interview. Reweighting the sample means using inverse-probability weights to account for selective response on the observed characteristics in Appendix Table A1 leads to changes of two percentage points or less in our estimates of the percent of students with access or that are engaged in online learning, and so we report unweighted means that reflect the sample of responders. 2 3. Access to and use of remote learning technologies Table 1 summarizes the remote learning technologies that students have in their homes. Two-thirds of students have a computer or tablet in their home, 74 percent have internet, and 59 percent have both internet and a computer or tablet. An alternative to online learning is educational programs broadcast by television or radio: 92 percent of students have television in their homes, and 59 percent radio. Access varies with socioeconomic level. We measure wealth quartiles on the basis of household assets measured in our baseline survey. 3 Only 57 percent of students in the bottom wealth quartile have internet in their homes, compared to 87 percent of students in the top wealth quartile. Likewise, access is lower for students whose mothers have at most high school education, for students of indigenous ethnicity, and for students from the more remote Napo and Orellana regions. Table 2 then examines usage of different forms of remote learning. We first asked whether students have used any form of online learning or tele-educative content in the past seven days, and if so, which platforms they had used. As a check against students giving what they think to be socially desirable answers, we included the name of a made-up platform ''Leer Ahora"" (Read Now). Only 4.7 percent of students claim to have used this platform, suggesting a low degree of social desirability bias. To be conservative, we code these students as not using any of the other platforms. We then see that 74 percent of students have used online or tele-educative learning in the past week. Usage of the Ministry of Education's Educa platform, which is available online, by television, and by radio, is very low, at only 8 percent. One possibility is that because some of this content is also available on YouTube, some students report this as accessing YouTube and not Educa. Nevertheless, it does at least suggest low brand recognition for the Educa content.The program Showing Life Opportunities (DOV for its Spanish acronym) that we had developed for online use in schools was used by 11 percent of students. This usage is relatively organic, since the program itself did not push students to use this content during April. Another online platform, EdModo is used by 19 percent. EdModo is a private educational technology company that offers a free service that teachers can use to communicate with students. The most common forms of online learning are via YouTube (48 percent) and Google Classroom and Zoom activities carried out by teachers (41 percent).In addition to asking about this usage in the last seven days, we also asked students whether their teachers had held online classes, sent materials to them, or set homework activities since school had closed. 37 percent of students report online classes, 83 percent have received materials, and 94 percent have been given homework to do.Gender differences in usage are small, although female students are 5 percentage points more likely to have done some online or telelearning. Students in the final year of school (Grade 12) have received more content from teachers, and are more likely to be doing online learning. This may reflect both a desire from teachers to help them learn as much as possible since they will not be back for another year, as well as pressure on the students to prepare for final year examinations (should they be held).Disadvantaged groups are less likely to be using remote learning: 64 percent of the lowest wealth quartile have done any online or telelearning, compared to 81 percent in the top quartile. However, one notable feature is that even many students who lack good access have found ways to do some remote learning. For example, 61 percent of students without internet in their homes have done online or telelearning. One way that students have been able to do this is through the use of paid time on smartphones: by paying for some minutes on the phone, some basic social media including one or two hours of YouTube usage are often available for free. Another approach is for teachers to send homework by email, students to pay for some minutes to download this, and then work remotely and send back an email with this work. 4 We collected detailed time-use information (described in the next section), which enables us to determine not just whether students are doing any schoolwork, but also how much. Fig. 1 provides histograms to show the distribution of time spent on schooling (on weekdays) for students with computers and internet access, compared to those without internet access. For students with technology, the mean (median) time spent on schooling on the past day is 4.4 (4) hours, compared to 3.6 (3.5) hours for those without internet access. However, we note substantial dispersion, with 23 percent of those without internet access doing no schooling, compared to only 9 percent of those with computer and internet access. Table 3 examines the breakdown of time spent on schooling by different student characteristics. Overall, 14 percent of students did no schoolwork on the past weekday, 42 percent did 0.5 to 4 h, and 44 percent did more than 4 h. In addition to formal schooling, students could be pursuing other educational activities, such as reading for fun. However, the last column shows that only 4 percent of students did any reading that was not part of formal schoolwork in the past day. We see Grade 12 students spend more time on schooling than younger grades, and wealthier students spend 2 For example, the inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimate of the share of students with both internet and a computer or tablet is 57.0 percent, compared to the unweighted sample average of 59.0 percent, and the IPW estimate of the share engaged in any form of online or tele-educative learning is 73.5 percent, compared to the unweighted 74.3 percent sample average. 3 We take quartiles of an asset index formed as the first principal component of the more time on schooling on average than students from the lowest wealth quartile. However, the amount of time spent on schooling does not differ that much by ethnicity, region, or mother's schooling level -grade, wealth, and technology access appear to be the main correlates of how much schooling students are doing.Our surveys took place during a period when schools were closed, and a nationwide shutdown (with exceptions for certain types of workers and businesses) was in place. When asked, 82 percent of students said they had not left their house in the past day. To examine how they spend their time during the shutdown, we used a detailed 24-hour time use questionnaire based on the American Time Use Survey (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Our module asked the students to recall their activities from 4 a.m. the previous day to 4 a.m. on the interview day. This is recorded in half hour increments, using 24 pre-coded activities developed during pre-testing, plus a code for other activities.We then examine five main activities: sleeping, working (which includes working in a household business, working in another job for pay, and looking for work), household tasks (meal preparation, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping and looking after younger siblings), educational activities (reading books and magazines, viewing educational content, learning college options, and doing homework and teacher exercises), and leisure activities (watching tv, playing musical instruments, practicing a hobby or sport, hanging out with friends in person or online, and surfing the internet).We then plot time-use in these aggregated categories by hour of day, examining how this differs by wealth quartile (Fig. 2) , gender (Fig. 3) , and internet access (Fig. 4) . The y-axis shows the proportion of students engaging in this activity at that time of day, with the range shown differing across activity. For example, 98 percent Notes: Educa online and by radio is the platform of the Ministry of Education; DOV is Showing Life Opportunities, a platform provided by the authors. YouTube refers only to educational use of this platform; Google Class/Zoom is use of Google Classroom or Zoom; EdModo is an online educational platform. Tests of equality report p-values for ttests (two groups) or F-tests (for grade equality) of equality of means across the groups. Pichincha is the more urban province, and Napo and Orellana the more rural provinces. Notes: Columns 2-6 show the proportion of students in a category who have the respective remote learning technology. Column 7 shows the p-value for testing the mean of computer and internet access for a group is equal to everyone not in this group. Pichincha is the more urban province, and Napo and Orellana the more rural provinces.I. Asanov, F. Flores, D. McKenzie et al. World Development 138 (2021) 105225 of students are asleep at 5 a.m, 74 percent at 7:00 a.m, 14 percent at 9:00 a.m, and 1.2 percent at 11:30am; whereas a maximum of 10 percent of students in the lowest wealth quartile are working at 10:30am. We see that the overall routines in terms of when students do different activities are strikingly similar across wealth, gender, and internet access groups. In particular, the timing of when students do educational activities is similar across these groups. The only slight difference in the timing of activities is that students with internet access and from wealthier quartiles tend to wake up later and go to bed later than those with no internet access and from the lowest wealth quartile, with less time spent on leisure late at night for those in the latter group. For example, 70 percent of students in the lowest wealth quartile are asleep at 10p.m and 25 percent doing leisure activities, compared to 48 percent asleep and 43 percent doing leisure activities in the top wealth quartile.We see more differences arise in terms of how large a proportion of students are engaging in education, work, household tasks, and leisure at different times. Time spent on education peaks at 11 or 11:30 a.m for all groups, with a second peak after lunch at around 3p.m. However, at this peak time, fewer lower wealth students are engaging in schooling than wealthier students, with more working or doing household tasks instead. A similar pattern is seen by access to the internet. One clear gender difference in time usage occurs between work and household tasks -males are more likely to engage in work, and females in household tasks. Males and females are equally likely to be pursuing education in the morning, but in the late afternoon relatively more female students continue schooling as males engage in relatively more leisure activities. In combination with the gender difference in time spent on household tasks, this may indicate a higher risk of fatigue resulting from home schooling for female students.A potential concern is that students may start off attempting to carry out educational activities, but that their enthusiasm and usage may wane over time, especially once it becomes clear that they will not be heading back into classrooms this school year. Since we randomly ordered students, the groups of students called in each week are similar, and so we can compare time-use of students interviewed in different weeks. Fig. 5 shows that this fear does not appear to have been realized during April (covering weeks 3, 4, 5 and 6 since schools closed). Exactly the same proportions of students are engaged in education at each hour in the morning for each of the four weeks of April, and although there is more variation in the afternoon, it is not the case that the proportion doing schooling falls as the month progresses.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to both directly cause anxiety to students as they worry about the potential health consequences of its spread, as well as indirectly affect their mental well-being Notes: number of hours of schooling based on time-use question, and excludes weekends. Pichincha is the more urban province, and Napo and Orellana the more rural provinces. Tests of equality report p-values for t-tests (two groups) or F-tests (for grade equality) of equality of means across the groups. I. Asanov, F. Flores, D. McKenzie et al. World Development 138 (2021) 105225 through concerns about family finances, their ability to continue their education, and through social isolation. Giannini (2020) reports that a survey conducted by the United Nations in Thailand found more than 7 in 10 children and young people said the pandemic is causing stress, worry, and anxiety. Our phone surveys measured mental well-being using the 5item MHI-5 index of Veit and Ware (1983) . This asks students to answer on a five-point scale how often in the past month they have been happy, felt calm and peaceful, been very nervous, felt downhearted and blue, and felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer them up. Scores range from 5 to 25, where higher scores indicate better mental health. We follow several studies (Urban Institute, 1999; Yamazaki et al., 2005) in using a cutoff of 17 as an indicator of major depression. We also use the first question from this scale to code a binary indicator of happiness, which takes value one for students who say they were happy all of the time or most of the time. Table 4 summarizes the levels of indicative depression and happiness overall, and by different student characteristics. We see that 16 percent of students have mental health scores that indicate major depression, while 68 percent are happy. Although we do not have pre-COVID-19 measures for these same students, this level of depression is substantially higher than the 6.2 percent rate reported by Torres et al. (2017) for first-year university students in Ecuador, suggesting depression rates have increased. 5 There is not a strong wealth difference in depression rates, nor does it vary much with region or internet access. We do see higher levels of depression for females, and for indigenous students. Happiness does have a statistically significant wealth gradient, with students from wealthier households, with internet access, and more educated mothers being more likely to be happy. Mental well-being does not appear to worsen over the month of April as the shutdown persists - Fig. 6 shows day-to-day fluctuations, but no strong trends in the proportion of students who are depressed or happy.In addition to assessing mental health status, we also asked students what they saw as the most major problem of the COVID-19 crisis for them personally. The last three columns of Table 4 show the three of the most common responses: schooling, which half of students see as the main issue, social isolation, which 21 percent list, and concerns around household finances, which 9 percent list. We see school closures are more of a concern for final year (Grade shows time-use on weekdays only, by survey week. Students were interviewed in random order, although the last week (April 21-April 25) includes fewer students and some students who it took more effort to reach. 5 We acknowledge that a difference in diagnostic scales and sample populations means that such a comparison should be made with caution, and we include this as suggestive evidence of the base rate only.I. Asanov, F. Flores, D. McKenzie et al. World Development 138 (2021) 105225 12) students, but does not otherwise vary a lot in importance with student characteristics. We see socioeconomic variation in the relative importance of household finances (viewed as more of a concern by less wealthy students, and those without internet) compared to social isolation (seen as more of a concern by students with remote learning technology access and with more educated mothers).The majority of Ecuadorian students in our sample have both access to remote learning technologies, and have engaged in remote learning during the COVID-19 school shutdown period.Students and teachers have proved to be adaptive, with even the majority of students without internet access at home managing to take part in some remote learning. However, we do find a minority of students not engaged in any schooling, with this being more prevalent among students from poorer backgrounds. While we do not have data on school attendance in regular times to compare this to, it does raise concerns about widening inequality. In addition, we find about one-sixth of all students to be potentially suffering from depression, suggesting a need for providing psychosocial support services. Finally, a limitation of our phone surveys is that we measure time spent on learning activities, but not how much learning has taken place. Continuing to monitor these students over time to measure learning effects is therefore needed.This work was supported by the World Bank's ComPEL and SIEF programs.

We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making.Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the interzone distance.States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit during pre-and post-COVID periods to show that the odds of mortality of whites and blacks are statistically equivalent [23] . Myers et al. analyzed the COVID-19 positive patients in California to investigate its prognosis in the higher age groups and individuals with preexisting conditions [24] . Zoabi et al. applied ML on 51,831 COVID-19 positive patients to understand the effect of gender, age and contact to show that close social interaction is a strong feature for COVID-19 transmissibility [25] . Khan et al. applied regression tree, cluster analysis and principal component analysis on Worldometer infection count data to study the variability and effect of testing in prediction of confirmed cases [26] . Finally, Pan et al. studied the effects of the myriad public health interventions (such as lockdown, traffic restriction, social distancing, home quarantine, centralized quarantine, etc.) on 32,583 COVID-19 patients, with respect to their age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity [27] .Contributions: While it is evident that factors such as gender, race, age, testing, social contact and distancing have been analyzed in a piecemeal manner, there is no comprehensive study that combines the demographic, economic, and epidemiological, ethnic and health indicators for infection and mortality from COVID-19. To address this gap, we carry out a machine learning-based analysis with the following three objectives.1. We curate a dataset of diverse features (detailed in Sec. 2.1) from 50 states of USA. This dataset is somewhat unique, since, in addition to the above features, it includes factors such as airport traffic, homeless and variations in lockdown dates. Also, note that the lockdown was enforced on the US states at around the same time, when each state was at a different stage of the COVID-19 infection cycle.2. We analyze the variation of COVID-19 infection spread and mortality rates using a set of standard supervised ML methods. We rank the key discriminatory factors based on the importance score calculated from randomized decision trees. We combine the findings to identify the most vulnerable age groups and US states. We also show the effect of testing and lockdowns on the infection spread dynamics.3. We utilize multiple linear regression to gauge the extent to which the key pre-lockdown factors affect the post-lockdown infected and death numbers. This study assigns weights to features and drive mitigation efforts and large scale policymaking.Our data-driven experiments using supervised methods demonstrate that population density, testing [28] and airport traffic [29] are key factors contributing to infection and mortality rates. Furthermore, high age group (40 and beyond, and specifically exceeding 60) population are more vulnerable. Principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: highly affected US states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) showing consistent or newly peaking rate of infection and death. Multiple regression analysis shows that the postlockdown numbers are most influenced by the pre-lockdown infected and death numbers followed by population density and airport activity, while overall healthcare index of a state does not seem to play a part in the overall death count. Similarly, the race of individuals did not play any significant role in the infection or mortality numbers. Despite increased testing rates, the fraction of individuals tested positive drop approximately three weeks into the lockdown, suggesting that the social distance measures has had an impact on curbing spread. Finally, we discuss the role of mobility and distance in infection spread. In the absence of large-scale inter-state mobility data, our case study on the boroughs of New York City show that peaks of infection correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the interzone distance.All the experiments have been performed using Scikit-learn, which is a popular Machine Learning library in Python [30] .Let us discuss the details of the two datasets used in this work.2.1.1 Data from US states. Our dataset has been carefully curated from several open sources to examine the possible factors that may affect the COVID-19 related infection and death numbers in the 50 states of USA. The individual open-access data sources as well as the integrated (curated) dataset has been shared on GitHub (https://github.com/satunr/COVID-19/tree/master/US-COVID-Dataset). Below, we discuss a summary of the features and output labels of the integrated dataset.• Gross Domestic Product (in terms of million US dollars) for US states [31] (filename: source/ GDP.xlsx, feature name: GDP).• Distance from one state to another (is not measured in miles but the euclidean distance between their latitude-longitude coordinates between the pair of states [32] ) (filename: source/Data_distance.xlsx, feature name: d(state1, state2)).• Gender feature(s) is a fraction of total population representing the male and female individuals [33] (filename: source/Data_gender.csv, feature name: Male, Female).• Ethnicity feature(s) are the fraction of total population representing white, black, Hispanic and Asian individuals (we leave out other smaller ethnic groups) [34] (filename: source/ Data_ethnic.csv, feature name: White, Black, Hispanic and Asian).• Healthcare index is measured by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) on the basis of (1) type of care (like preventive, chronic), (2) setting of care (like nursing homes, hospitals), and (3) clinical areas (like care for patients with cancer, diabetes) [35] (filename: source/Data_health.xlsx, feature name: Health).• Homeless feature is the number of homeless individuals of a state [36] (filename: source/ Data_homeless.xlsx, feature name: Homeless). The normalized homeless population of each state is the ratio between its homeless and total population.• Total cases (and deaths) of COVID-19 is the number of individuals tested positive and dead [37] (filename: source/Data_covid_total.xlsx, feature name: Total Cases and Total Death). The normalized infected/death is the ratio between the infected/death count to total population of the given state.• Infected score and death score is obtained by rounding normalized total cases and deaths to discrete value between 0-6 (feature name: Infected Score, Death Score).• Death-to-Infected is a feature measuring impact of death in terms of the difference between death and infected scores. It is calculated as max(Death Score -Infected Score, 0).• Lockdown type is a feature capturing the type of lockdown (shelter in place: 1 and stay at home: 2) in a given state [37, 38] (filename: source/Data_lockdown.csv, feature name: Lockdown).• Day of lockdown captures the difference in days between 1st January 2020 to the date of imposition of lockdown in a region [39] (filename: source/Data_lockdown.csv, feature name: Day Lockdown).• Population density is the ratio between the population and area of a region [40] (filename: source/Data_population.csv, feature name: Population, Area, Population Density).• Traffic/activity of airport measures the passenger traffic (also normalized by the total traffic across all the states of USA [41] (filename: source/Data_airport.xlsx, feature name: Busy airport score, Normalized busy airport).• Age groups (0-80+) in brackets of 4 year (also normalized by total population) [40] (filename: source/Data_age.xlsx, feature name: age_to_, Norm_to_, e.g. age4to8); we later group them in brackets of 20 for the purposes of analysis.• Peak infected (and peak death) measures the duration between first date of infection and date of daily infected (and death) peaks [40] (feature name: Peak Infected, Peak Death).• Testing measures the number of individuals tested for COVID-19 (total number, before and after imposition of lockdown) [38, 42] (filename: source/Data_testing.xlsx, feature name: Testing, Pre-lockdown testing, Post-lockdown testing).• Pre-and post-infected and death count measures the number of individuals infected and dead before and after lockdown dates (feature name: Testing, Pre-infected count, Pre-death count, Post-infected count, Post-death count).• Days between first infected and lockdown date (feature name: First-Inf-Lockdown).The above features, their abbreviations and summary statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum) are enlisted in Table 1 . Note that, for gender and ethnicity we report the fraction of the total state population falling in each category.The New York City (NYC) datasets (https://github.com/ satunr/COVID-19/blob/master/US-COVID-Dataset/NYC_dist_mob.xlsx) show the inter-borough distance and mobility as well as COVID-19 infected (https://github.com/satunr/COVID-19/blob/master/US-COVID-Dataset/NYC-Inf.xlsx) and death counts (https://github.com/ satunr/COVID-19/blob/master/US-COVID-Dataset/NYC-Dth.xlsx) for the 5 boroughs of NYC, namely, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx and Staten Island. Table 1 . Summary of features and their statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation (dev.), maximum (max.) and minimum (min.)). The features in the order shown under ""Feature name"" are: GDP, inter-state distance based on lat-long coordinates, gender, ethnicity, quality of health care facility, number of homeless people, total infected and death, population density, airport passenger traffic, age group, days for infection and death to peak, number of people tested for COVID-19, days elapsed between first reported infection and the imposition of lockdown measures at a given state. Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking• Mobility data (based on traffic volume counts collected by DOT for New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) [43] ) shows the number of trips from one borough to another.• COVID-19 data shows the number of COVID-19 infected and death counts for each borough [44] .We acquire the daily infected and testing counts across US from January-July, 2020 [45] . This dataset is part of the COVID Tracking project that collect COVID-19 statistics on the numbers on tests, cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes from every US state and territory by voluntary public participation.We use the Scikit-learn library KBinsDiscretizer to group the continuous feature values into discrete values by creating balanced clusters using the quantile strategy [46] .2.1.5 Supervised learning methods. Supervised machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps the input training data (i.e., features) to some output labels [47] . In this work, we consider the following supervised learning techniques. (Refer [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] for the details on these ML approaches.)• Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification and regression problems that maps the inputs to high-dimensional feature spaces. SVM operates on hyperplanes-decision boundaries that help classify the data points. The objective is to maximize the separation between the data points and the hyperplane. SVM is memory efficient and effective for datasets with fewer data samples [55] .• Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an iterative approach that fits the data to an objective function [56] . As the name suggests, it is a stochastic variant of the popular gradient descent (GD) optimization model [57] . In GD, the optimizer starts at a random point in the search space and reaches the lowest point of the function by traversing along the slope. Unlike GD that requires calculating the partial derivative for each feature at each data point, SGD achieves computational efficiency by computing derivatives on randomly chosen data points.• Nearest Centroid (NC) is a simple classification model that represents each class by the centroid of its members. Subsequently, it assigns each data point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest to it. NC is particularly effective for non-convex classes and does not suffer from any additional dependencies on model parameters [58] .• Decision Trees (DTs) are a classification and regression technique that assigns target labels based on decision rules inferred from data features [59] . DT maintains the decision rules using a tree. A data point is assigned to a class by repeatedly comparing the tree root with the data point value to branch off to a new root.• Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) are a class of fast, probabilistic learning techniques that apply the Bayes' theorem to assign labels to the data points [60] .While supervised ML approaches generally yield reliable prediction accuracy, they often suffer from overfitting or convergence issues [47, 61] . Each of the above approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. SVM works well when the underlying distribution of the data is not known. However, it is prone to overfitting when the number of features is much greater than the number of samples. SGD needs low convergence time for a large dataset, but it may require to fit a number of hyperparameters. Conversely, DT involves almost no hyperparameters, but often entails slightly higher training time. Unlike DT, NB requires less training time but works on the implicit assumption that all the attributes are mutually independent. Finally, NC is a fast method but is not robust to outliers or missing data. In the context of our work, we intuit that the discriminatory feature(s) will yield a high accuracy irrespective of the underlying supervised ML algorithm used.• Accuracy function measures the fraction of matches between the predicted and actual labels in a multi-label classification, i.e., the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. It can be calculated as:In the above equation, TP, TN, FP, FN denote true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively.• Extra trees classifier is an estimator that fits randomized decision trees (called extra-trees) on data samples. The memory and computation overhead of this approach can be controlled by regulating the size of the extra trees. The nodes in the tree are split into sub-trees resulting in high accuracy (i.e., drop in impurity). Thus, feature importance is measured as total reduction in impurity affected by that feature [62] .• Multiple regression (MR) is a statistical tool to capture the linear relationship between the independent and the dependent variables x and y of a function y = g(x). In our context, MR generates a linear relationshipŷwhere b fi is the coefficient that captures the contribution of feature f i towards the dependent variable y, while β 0 and � are the intercept and error terms, respectively.Given any pair of vectors v andv (jvj ¼ jvj ¼ n), we apply the following standard statistical operations:• Mean centering subtracts the mean μ from each element of a vector v, i.e., v 0 = v − μ(v). This standardization adjusts the scales of magnitude by making the new mean 0 and helps compare data from varied sources or having different datatypes.• Mean squared error (MSE) is calculated as 1• Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between v andv measures the strength of a linear association between two variables, where the value PCC = 1 is a perfect positive correlation and −1 is perfect negative correlation.• Positivity rate ρ is the ratio between the number of individuals tested positive to the number of tests performed daily [63] .This section is classified into the following three subsections: (1) and (2) Table 2 . Unless otherwise stated, the feature set comprises GDP, gender, ethnicity, health care, homeless, lockdown type, population density, airport activity, and age groups, whereas the output labels consist of infected and death scores on a scale of 0-6.We apply supervised machine learning (ML) approaches to identify the key factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death counts. For each supervised ML technique, we perform an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of any 5 features and identify the feature subset (s) with the highest accuracy (discussed in Sec. 2.2) as the most important features. Fig 1 shows the scores for different supervised methods. Although proposing a machine learning algorithm that works best on COVID-19 data is not the purpose of this study, it is worth reporting that decision tree classifier (DT) slightly outperforms the other algorithms for both cases of infected and death scores. We create a pool of all features participating in at least one combination for output labels of infected and death scores. Fig 2 shows a heatmap of the importance I for all such features against each supervised technique. For infected score as output label (top figure), homeless (home), population density (PD), airport activity (air), testing (test), white (wht), etc. have the highest I. For death score as output label, PD, air, test and age groups above 50 years (age50_54 and age80_84) exhibit the highest importance.We apply the extra trees classifier to generate the impurity-based rank for the features (discussed in Sec. 2.2). Fig 3a shows the top 5 important features corresponding to the infected and death scores, respectively. It is interesting that for both cases, the same set of features, namely, population density, days to peak, airport traffic, testing and high age groups, are identified. Also note that the same features exhibit a very high participation in the 5-feature combinations shown in Fig 2. Next, as a validation exercise, we apply dimension reduction on the Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking Table 1 We discussed in Sec. 2.1, that our initial dataset groups ages into brackets of 4 (0-4, 4-8, and so on). Our results from supervised learning (Sec. 3.1) and extra trees (Sec. 3.2) suggest that high age groups are important factors affecting the infected and death scores of COVID-19. To understand the effect of COVID-19 infected and death scores on low and high age groups, we create two feature sets for population of age �40 and >40. Fig 4a shows that for both cases of infected and death, the accuracy (ACC) is higher for higher age groups. We explore this by repeating the above experiment, this time, with a feature set of groups 40-60 and >60. Fig 4b  depicts that ACC for age group 60+ is marginally higher, suggesting that the elderly are amongst the most vulnerable, however the difference in mortality rates in this case was not statistically significant.We carry out a study to identify the pre-lockdown factors of any region (US states in our case) that contribute to the overall post-lockdown infection and death numbers. We partition the total infected and death numbers for each state into pre-and post-lockdown infected and death counts. We then create a feature set consisting of population density, airport business, pre-lockdown infected, pre-lockdown death, days between first infected to lockdown and age group above 80. The features represent the set of observable factors for the administrative and health bodies and were already shown to possess high feature significance in the previous Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking section. The output labels are the post-lockdown infected and post-lockdown death numbers. We perform the following experiments: 3.4.1 Identification of discriminating features. We carry out a simple preprocessing step to convert each feature entry to percentile (with respect to the feature vector) and rank the US states in the decreasing order of infected and death scores (Fig 5) . We calculate the weighted average percentile of features for the top and bottom k = 10 US states using the formulawhere p(f i ) and ρ(f i ) are the percentile and rank of the i th feature value, while r is the number of US states (equal to maximum rank). We intuit that the feature exhibiting the maximum difference in weighted average percentile for top and bottom k COVID-19 affected US states are the discriminating ones. Fig 6a shows the percentile difference suggesting that airport and population density are the most significant, while days between first infected to lockdown and age group of 80+ are the least discriminating.We apply multiple regression (MR) (see Sec. 2.2) to measure the weightage of each of the above features in the observed post-lockdown infected (Post_Inf) and post-death numbers (Post_Dth). We eliminate the days between first infected to lockdown (Fst-Lock) and age group 80+, which are the least discriminating features from the percentile analysis (see Fig 6a) . As a prerequisite for MR, we need to eliminate features that are mutually correlated. Fig 6b shows that Pre-inf and Pre-dth are highly correlated, and hence we run two separate batches of MR: (1) population density, airport business, pre-lockdown infected and (2) population density, airport business, pre-lockdown death.We explore the effect of testing and lockdown on infection spread. We utilize positivity ratio ρ (defined in Sec. 2.3) to gauge how widespread the infection spread is [63] . We acquire the daily infected and testing count in US (see Sec. 2.1.3) and plot the mean daily ρ across all states over the period of February-July 2020. Fig 7a shows that the testing increased over a period time, while the positivity ratio dropped post lockdown (shown in red dotted line). While, testing (and, by extension, positivity ratio) is an effective epidemiological indicator, it cannot curb infection spread by itself. However, Fig 7a shows that the ρ has dropped approximately three weeks into the lockdown, suggesting that the latter had an impact on curbing spread by minimizing social contact. Table 3 shows that pre-infected and pre-death with high coefficients contribute highly towards Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking the post-lockdown infected and death numbers, followed by population density and airport traffic. This finding is further supported by the p values reported for the respective features. Note that the R 2 scores for all the four cases are >0.8, suggesting that the output features capture a high proportion of the variance in the input features. Overall, pre-infected count has higher coefficient and R 2 score and emerges as a marginally better discriminating feature of post-lockdown effects than the pre-death count. Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymakingIn Sec. 3.2, we perform PCA on the feature set of the key factors to show that states with high infection and death numbers stand out of the cluster of other states. These states include some erstwhile hotspots forming group 1 (such as New York City, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island) as well as states experiencing a steady infection and death count and also a strong second wave forming group 2 (such as Texas, Washington, California, Georgia, Arkansas, Utah and Colorado) (Fig 3b) . In the PCA analysis, PC1 and PC2 account for 41% and 21% variance, respectively. We explore how each feature influences each component to show that PC1 is driven by factors such as airport activity and high age groups (70 and beyond), while PC2 is dominated by population density, airport, age (80+) and testing. Notice in Fig 3b, though both groups 1 and 2 exhibit high spread across PC1, group 2 forms a slightly denser cluster than group 1, implying that it exhibits an even mix of PC1 and PC2 features. We intuit that the early peaking in infection in group 1 states is due to high road and airport mobility leading to high mixing and infection spread that is manifested in the elderly population. Group 2 shows enduring infection spread due to high population density and testing, in addition to airport activity and populations with higher age group. We study how demographics affect COVID-19 numbers to show that states with higher age groups (particularly 60 and beyond) numbers are the most vulnerable. Finally, we split the infected and death numbers on the pre-and post-lockdown epochs and apply multiple linear regression to show that pre-lockdown infected and death, population density and airport contribute highly to the post-lockdown numbers. This analysis can be particularly effective in pinpointing the most vulnerable states and recommending lockdown policies on starting dates and duration to curb pandemic spread. Note that our present study pertains to the identification of the discriminatory features with respect to the date of lockdown. There exists several unanswered questions regarding the impact of length, scheduling strategies, lockdown types and extent of lockdowns on pandemic spread that need to be answered. Such an analysis requires a richer feature set as well as a sound understanding of the dynamics of infection spread in terms of healthcare, distance, mobility, etc. As a preliminary study, we first explore whether there is any relationship between the health care index (Health) of a US state and the number of transitions from infected to death (Dth/Inf) in this state. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (see Sec. 2.3) between the two factors is 0.11, suggesting that the overall mortality numbers is largely unrelated to the healthcare facility and may solely depend on the infected individual's attributes, such as age, comorbidities, infection severity, etc.Second, since proximity plays a role in infection spread, neighboring regions should peak at nearly the same time. We posit that mobility may play an even greater role in the spread, than a static measure like distance between a pair of regions. In the absence of a inter-state mobility dataset, we create two feature sets for the NYC boroughs dataset (see Sec. 2.1): (1) inter-borough distance and (2) inter-borough mobility. Each borough b has a distance and mobility vector D b = {d b1 , d b2 � � �} and M b = {m b1 , m b2 � � �} where d bi and m bi are the probabilistic measure of distance and mobility between a borough b with borough i. We calculate the correlation of the mean squared error (see Sec. 2.3) of the distance/mobility vectors of any pair of boroughs b 1 and b 2 against the absolute difference of their peak to infected or peak-to-death features. Fig 7b suggests that mobility yields a higher correlation (0.44) than distance (0.22) suggesting that mobility is a slightly more informative feature to analyze infection spread.We are currently working towards broadening the scope of this study in different directions. First, this work attempted to apply ML analysis on a wide range of features, making the the states of United States the ideal choice, specifically from the standpoint of data availability. In future we would like to extend this work by running these experiments on epidemiological, demographic and economic data of different countries. It would be interesting to report the variation in the discriminatory features identified for different countries. Second, we identify population density, testing, airport activity and pre-lockdown infected count as key features driving the post-lockdown infection and death numbers. We plan to utilize these findings to design policies on the timing, duration and stringency of lockdown for future pandemics. Third, all the input features discussed in this work are static or time invariant. It is imperative to analyze the evolution of dynamic features (such as GDP and unemployment rates) from the pre-COVID to the post-COVID timelines to uncover the long-term economic effects of COVID-19.Machine learning is emerging as an important tool to predict the dynamics of spread of COVID-19 and identify the key factors driving infection and mortality rates. While existing works study the effects of gender, race, age, testing, social contact and distancing separately, we present an unified analysis of the demographic, economic, and epidemiological, ethnic and health indicators for infection and mortality rates from COVID-19. We curate a dataset of US states comprising features (from varying sources discussed in Sec. 2.1) that may potentially impact infection and death rates of COVID-19. We run several supervised machine learning techniques to identify and rank the key factors correlating with infection and fatality counts.

Mathematical models were formulated and used to fit the epidemic curve to estimate the basic reproduction number R 0 .In the literature, the usually assumed basic reproduction number R 0 is around 2.5, see for instance [1] and [2] . The reliable estimation of R 0 is important because this number determines the magnitude of effort to eradicate infection. For instance, the efforts of vaccination to eradicate an infection must be vaccinating a fraction equal or greater than 1 − 1/R 0 of susceptibles [3] . In [4] , analyzing vaccination as a control mechanism, if R 0 is reduced by the vaccine to value lower than one, the number of cases decreased following exponential-type decay.The estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 , however, depends on the mathematical model. We consider two examples. The first model is the simplest susceptible -infectiousrecovered (SIR) model, and the second is a model taking into account more aspects of the natural history of covid-19 infection encompassing the lethality rate depending on the age, called the elaborated model. These models are fitted taking into account the severe covid-19 data collections from São Paulo State (Brazil) [5] and Spain [6] .São Paulo State, Brazil, has 44.6 million inhabitants (demographic density, 177/km 2 ) with 15.3% of the population comprised of elder individuals. The first case was registered on February 26, and partial quarantine was implemented on March 24. Considering that there is a delay around 9 days since the infection and the onset of covid-19, we estimate the basic reproduction number considering collected data from February 26 to April 2.Spain has 47.4 million inhabitants (demographic density, 92.3/km 2 ) with 25.8% of the population comprised of elder individuals. The first case was registered on January 31, and lockdown was implemented on March 16. Considering a delay of around 9 days, we estimate the basic reproduction number considering collected data from January 31 to March 25.Yang et al. [7] , using the elaborated model, estimated R 0 using the first period of covid-19 data representing the natural (without any interventions) epidemic, obtaining 9.24 (São Paulo State) and 8.0 (Spain). The estimation of R 0 based on the first period is in concordance with the definition of the basic reproduction number: Completely susceptible population without constraints (interventions) [3] .In the SIR model, the dynamical system is (the varying total population N is N = S + I + R)where the total population N obeysand φ and µ are, respectively, the birth and natural mortality rates, β, γ, and α are, respectively, the transmission rate, the infectious rate, and the additional mortality (lethality) rate. If φ = µ + αI/N , then N is constant. In Appendix A, the steady-state corresponding to the system of equations (1) was analyzed to obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 . For simplicity, let us consider φ = µ. The system of equations (1), using R = N − I − S, can be rewritten aswhere the effective reproduction number R ef is defined bywith the basic reproduction number R 0 being given by equation (A.2) changing φ by µ, that is, R 0 = β/ (γ + µ + α). Let us analyze the system of equations (3) at two boundaries. Let us assume that the first case of covid-19 is introduced at t = 0, that is, the initial conditions supplied to equation (3) are S(0) = N − 1 and I(0) = 1. For a large population, we can approximate S ∼ N and the system of equations can be approximated byHence, at the beginning of the epidemic, if we estimate the transmission rate β, we can calculate R 0 using the expression obtained from the steady-state analysis. The system of equations (3) does not approach to a steady-state, but attains it when α = 0. In this case, asymptotically (t → ∞), we have dI/dt = 0 if R ef = R 0 S/N = 1, that is, S → S * = s * N and I → I * = i * N , where i * and s * are given by equations (A.6) and (A.7), respectively. Therefore, when α = 0, at t = 0, R ef = R 0 , and when t → ∞ (steady-state), R ef = 1 (see equation (A.7)), from which we retrieve the well known relationship s * = 1/R 0 [3] . Therefore, based on R ef given by equation (4) when φ = µ and α = 0, the basic reproduction number R 0 obtained from mathematical modelings provides two useful information: At the beginning of the epidemic (t = 0), R 0 gives the magnitude of the initial takeoff of the epidemic, and when epidemic reaches the steady-state (after many waves of the epidemic, that is, t → ∞), R 0 measures its severity providing the fraction of susceptible individuals, that is, s * = 1/R 0 . Between these two extremes, the effective reproduction number R ef dictates the course of an epidemic, which follows decaying oscillations around R ef = 1 [4] . It is worth stressing the fact that R ef given by equation (4) is valid only when φ = µ and α = 0, and when one of these conditions is not valid, R ef given by equation (4) can be used as an approximated value.The number of accumulated severe covid-19 cases Ω is given by the exits from S, and entering into classes I, that is,To evaluate the parameter β, we calculatewhere Ω ob is the accumulated severe covid-19 registered cases. The value of β that minimizes Sum is the fitted value. We stress the fact that we are estimating the model parameters against the severe covid-19 cases.We estimate the basic reproduction number using equation (1) with different infective persons at t = 0. The model parameters are γ = 1/10, and, for São Paulo State, φ = µ = 1/(78.4 × 365) and α = 0.002, and for Spain, φ = µ = 1/(83.4 × 365) and α = 0.002 (all in days −1 ). The transmission rate β is estimated and the basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated using equation (A.2).For the data collected from São Paulo State, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R 0 = 3.14 with Sum = 8.02 × 10 5 , for I(0) = 10, R 0 = 2.4 with Sum = 8.49 × 10 5 , for I(0) = 25, R 0 = 2.11 with Sum = 1.86 × 10 6 , and for I(0) = 100, R 0 = 1.62 with Sum = 5.87 × 10 6 . Other initial conditions are S(0) = 44.6 million and R(0) = 0. The lowest Sum occurs when R 0 = 3.14.For the data collected from Spain, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R 0 = 2.97 with Sum = 4.16 × 10 8 , for I(0) = 10, R 0 = 2.5 with Sum = 6.32 × 10 8 , for I(0) = 25, R 0 = 2.3 with Sum = 1.13 × 10 9 , and for I(0) = 100, R 0 = 2.06 with Sum = 1.19 × 10 9 . Other initial conditions are S(0) = 47.4 million and R(0) = 0. The lowest Sum occurs when R 0 = 2.97.We observed that the larger the value of I(0), the small is the estimated R 0 . By the stringent definition of R 0 , we must consider I(0) = 1. However, the initial condition I(0) > 1 mimics the first case of covid-19 occurring earlier than the time t = 0. The Singapore University of Technology and Design [8] estimated R 0 using I(0) = 100 for different countries.One of the main aspects of covid-19 is increased lethality in elder individuals. For this reason, a population is divided into two groups, composed of young (60 years old or less, denoted by subscript y), and elder (60 years old or more, denoted by subscript o) individuals. The vital dynamic of this community is described by the per-capita rates of birth (φ) and mortality (µ), and ϕ is the aging rate, that is, the flow from young subpopulation y to elder subpopulation o.Since we are dealing with the initial phase of the epidemic, the model is that presented in [7] , but the compartments related to quarantine and mass testing are removed. Hence, for each subpopulation j (j = y, o), individuals are divided into six classes: susceptible S j , exposed and incubating E j , asymptomatic A j , symptomatic persons in the initial phase of covid-19 (or prediseased) D 1j , and symptomatic persons with severe covid-19 D 2j , mild covid-19 Q 2j . However, all young and elder individuals in classes A j , Q 2j , and D 2j enter into the same immune class I (this is the 7 th class, but common to both subpopulations).where δ ij is Kronecker delta, with δ ij = 1 if i = j, and 0, if i = j; and β 1j , β 2j and β 3j are the transmission rates, that is, the rates at which a virus encounters a susceptible people and infects him/her. After an average period 1/σ j in class E j , where σ j is the incubation rate, exposed individuals enter into the asymptomatic class A j (with probability p j ) or pre-diseased class D 1j (with probability 1 − p j ). After an average period 1/γ j in class A j , where γ j is the recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals, asymptomatic individuals acquire immunity (recovered) and enter into immune class I. Possibly asymptomatic individuals can manifest symptoms at the end of this period, and a fraction 1 − χ j enters into mild covid-19 class Q 2j . For symptomatic persons, after an average period 1/γ 1j in class D 1j , where γ 1j is the infection rate of pre-diseased individuals, pre-diseased individuals enter into severe covid-19 class D 2j (with probability 1 − m j ) or class Q 2j (with probability m j ). Individuals in class D 2 acquire immunity after period 1/γ 2j , where γ 2j is the recovery rate of severe covid-19, and enter into class I or die under the disease-induced (additional) mortality rate α j . Individuals in class Q 2j acquire immunity after period 1/γ 3j , where γ 3j is the recovery rate of mild covid-19, and enter into immune class I.The new coronavirus transmission model is described by the system of ordinary differential equations, with j = y, o. Equations for susceptible individuals areand for immune individuals,wherewith the initial number of population at t = 0 being N (0) = N 0 = N 0y + N 0o , where N 0y and N 0o are the size of young and elder subpopulations at t = 0. If φ = µ+(α y D 2y + α o D 2o ) /N , the total size of the population is constant. The accumulated severe covid-19 cases Ω is obtained from d dt Ω = γ 1y D 1y + γ 1o D 1o , with Ω(0) = 0.Table 2 summarizes the model parameters. The description of the assigned values can be found in [7] . The transmission and additional mortality rates are estimated.The basic reproduction number R 0 for the system of equations (8), (9) and (10) written in terms of the corresponding fractions iswhereDetails of calculations can be found in [7] .To estimate the transmission rates, we consider β y = β 1y = β 2y = β 3y and β o = β 1o = β 2o = β 3o = ψβ y , and we use equation (6) and Ω given by equation (12). The values for the model parameters are those given in Table 1 . The basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated using equation (13).plus I(0) = 0, where the initial simulation time t = 0 corresponds to the calendar time when the first case was confirmed (February 26 for São Paulo State, and January 31 for Spain). For São Paulo State, N 0y = 37.8 million and N 0o = 6.8 million, and for Spain, N 0y = 35.17 million and N 0o = 12.23 million.For the data collected from São Paulo State, we obtained R 0 = 9.24, with Sum = 1.22×10 6 , while for the data collected from Spain, we obtained R 0 = 8.0, with Sum = 5.8 × 10 8 . If we let z y = z o = 0 (mild covid-19 cases do not transmit) and χ y = χ o = 1 (asymptomatic individuals do not relapse to mild covid-19), the estimated basic reproduction number is R 0 = 8.72 for São Paulo State, with Sum = 1.23 × 10 6 , and R 0 = 7.35 for Spain, with Sum = 1.59 × 10 8 .Firstly, in the elaborated model, there are several infectious classes but the severe covid-19 cases do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2, for this reason, R 0 does not depend on the additional mortality rates α y and α o (see equations (13) and (14)). On the other hand, in the SIR model, there is only one infectious class, and R 0 depends on the additional mortality rate α (see equation (A.2)).As we have pointed out, at the beginning and also in the early phase of the covid-19 epidemic, only hospitalized severe covid-19 cases were registered after confirmed by serological or PCR test. These individuals are either isolated in hospitals (receiving treatment) or discharged from hospitals but recommend to be isolated in their home. Then, somehow, the majority of these individuals are not participating in the populational SARS-CoV-2 chain transmission. In the SIR model, the unique way to estimate the transmission rate is considering that severe covid-9 cases are forming the infective class I. Hence, the estimation of R 0 provided by the SIR model using severe covid-19 cases is unrealistic.In the elaborated model, the initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 were supplied to the dynamical system, resulting in R 0 = 9.24 (São Paulo State) and R 0 = 8.0 (Spain). Instead of comparing with the SIR model, let us compare with the SEIR model considering the same initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 supplied to the elaborated model (see Appendix B). The estimated basic reproduction number for São Paulo State was R 0 = 3.92, and for Spain,Comparing SIR, SEIR, and elaborated model, as the model incorporates more aspects of the natural history of the infection, higher becomes the estimation of R 0 . For SIR and SEIR models, there is not any alternative except considering severe covid-19 cases as infective. However, in the elaborated model, the asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased (D 1 ) and a fraction of mild covid-19 (Q 2 ) individuals are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, but the severe covid-19 (D 2 ) individuals are isolated and do not contribute, except to the hospital staff [9].As we have pointed out, the estimation of R 0 is important because this number determines the magnitude of effort to eradicate infection. In [7] , describing the lockdown in Spain, they argued that if R 0 = 3, at least 67% of the population must be isolated to control the epidemic, while for R 0 = 8, at least 87% of the population must be isolated. They showed that 70% of the population in lockdown did not explain the covid-19 data in Spain, but 90% of the population in lockdown explained better the observed data.With respect to the SIR model, Li et al.[10] explicitly cited that, by using data from January 10 to February 8, 2020, they estimated the effective reproduction number R ef instead of R 0 , arguing that the most recent common ancestor could have occurred on November 17, 2019. The time elapsed from November 17, 2019 (the first case) to January 10, 2020 (the first day in the estimation) is 54 days. However, on January 23, 2020, Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province imposed a rigid lockdown, sowing that they estimated R 0 taking also into account data recorded 16 days after the lockdown. In other words, they used the severe covid-19 data from 54 after the possible first case to 16 days after the implementation of a rigid lockdown (January 10 to February 8).The system of equations (1) does not reach steady state, except if φ = µ + αI/N . However, the system (1) in term of fractions attains steady state [7] . Defining the fraction x = X/N , with X = {S, I, R}, we have d dtusing equation (2) with s + i + r = 1, hence, the equation for r can be decoupled from the system, through r = 1 − s − i. Notice that d (s + i + r) /dt = 0, and the system of equations in terms of fractions attain a steady state.The system of equations (A.1), dropping out the decoupled equation for r, has two equilibrium points: The trivial (disease-free) equilibrium point P 0 = (s = 1,ī = 0) and non-trivial (epidemic) equilibrium point P * = (s = s * ,ī = i * ).The Jacobian matrix J evaluated at the trivial equilibrium point P 0 = (s = 1,ī = 0) isHence, P 0 is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. The non-trivial equilibrium point P * = (s = s * ,ī = i * ) has the coordinates given bywhere i * is the positive root but small than one of the second degree polynomial P 2 (i) given by(A.4) which has the value, at i = 1,When R 0 > 1, we have P 2 (1) < 0 (the condition γ + φ > α is satisfied once γ > α), and the two positive roots of P 2 (i) are such that 0 < i * 1 < 1 < i * 2 . Hence the small root i * 1 is biologically feasible. When R 0 = 1, we have i * 1 = 0 and i * 2 > 1, hence i * 1 = 0 is biologically feasible. When R 0 < 1, we have i * 1 < 0 and i * 2 > 1, hence i * 1 = 0 is biologically feasible. Therefore, the small root i * 1 , which is biologically feasible, assumes a negative value for R 0 < 1, zero at R 0 = 1, and positive value but lower than 1 for R 0 > 1. The small root of P 2 (i) is given bywhere ∆ isand the fraction of susceptible individuals, from equation (A.3), isWhen α > 0, comparing equations (A.3) and (A.5), we notice that s * has a complex dependency with R 0 , not simply 1/R 0 .Including the exposed class E in the SIR model, we have the SEIR modelwhere σ is the incubation rate. As the previous analysis for the SIR model, we can obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 , which is given bywhen φ = µ, and the accumulated cases Ω obeysTo estimate R 0 for the elaborated model in the main text, we used as the initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 among others. For SEIR model, let us consider as the initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1, but S(0) and R(0) are the same supplied to the SIR model. We let σ = 1/5.8 days −1 (elaborated model), and the values for other parameters are those provided in the SIR model. The value γ = 1/10 days −1 in somehow considered an average value among γ, γ 1 , γ 2 and γ 3 in the elaborated model. The estimated basic reproduction number for São Paulo State was R 0 = 3.92 with Sum = 1.29 × 10 6 , and for Spain, R 0 = 4.41 with Sum = 2.24 × 10 8 .For the data collected from São Paulo State, with S(0) = 44.6 million, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R 0 = 7.84 with Sum = 1.11 × 10 6 , for I(0) = 10, R 0 = 5.1 with Sum = 4.52 × 10 5 , for I(0) = 25, R 0 = 4.02 with Sum = 1.21 × 10 6 , and for I(0) = 100, R 0 = 2.74 with Sum = 3.51 × 10 6 . The lowest Sum occurs when R 0 = 5.1.For the data collected from Spain, with S(0) = 47.4 million, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R 0 = 6.86 with Sum = 7.01×10 8 , for I(0) = 10, R 0 = 5.1 with Sum = 7.79×10 8 , for I(0) = 25, R 0 = 4.46 with Sum = 9.54 × 10 8 , and for I(0) = 100, R 0 = 3.58 with Sum = 1.33 × 10 9 . The lowest Sum occurs when R 0 = 6.86.Comparing with the estimated R 0 provided by the SIR model (see the main text), we observe that SEIR model estimated with higher value. Let us assess the role played by E(0). We choose data from São Paulo State, letting I(0) = 10, S(0) = 44.6 million, R(0) = 0, and varying E(0) (for the SIR model, R 0 = 2.4). for E(0) = 1, R 0 = 5.03 with Sum = 4.57 × 10 5 , for E(0) = 10, R 0 = 4.61 with Sum = 6.19 × 10 5 , for E(0) = 25, R 0 = 4.13 with Sum = 9.86 × 10 5 , and for E(0) = 100, R 0 = 3.04 with Sum = 3.31 × 10 6 . The lowest Sum occurs when R 0 = 5.03, however, as E(0) increases, the estimated R 0 approaches to that provided by the SIR model.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-13",10

A particularly useful tool for the assessment of parent satisfaction is a questionnairebased survey. The advantages of a questionnaire are manifold: parents can answer questions anonymously and do not have to fear negative consequences because of their opinion. Questionnaires are, in contrast to interviews, more economic, faster, and are regarded as more voluntary [1] .Telemedicine is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) applied to different healthcare fields, especially when geographical distance is a critical factor [2, 3] . Since the first medical consultation by telephone was documented in 1879, there has been an enormous development in the use of telemedicine, also in the fields of child and adult neurology [4] [5] [6] [7] . Although scientific evidence is still insufficient, telemedicine emerges as a valid alternative for conventional medicine or as a complement to reduce disparities and improve access to healthcare [5] . Epilepsy & Behavior 112 (2020) 107493 Over the last few years, there has been extensive development of new telemedicine tools, such as smartphone applications (mHealth). The use of instant messaging services has led to improved communication within medical teams by providing means for fast teleconsultation, information sharing, and early treatment initiation [8, 9] . WhatsApp is a communication tool that allows users to send instant messages, photos, videos, and voice messages; to share records; and to make voice and video calls with up to eight people using a mobile internet connection.Epilepsy is a chronic disease with certain characteristics that make it feasible to be approached remotely, without compromising patient safety and satisfaction [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Different reports comparing telemedicine and conventional medicine show similar results, especially regarding aspects such as seizure frequency, visits to the emergency department, or adherence to drug therapy [10, 12] . Advances in ICT have contributed to the rapid development of numerous digital tools used synchronously or asynchronously in the virtual management of epilepsy [13, 15] .During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine services have aimed to improve the management of people with epilepsy [16] [17] [18] [19] .Ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) is the most common nonpharmacologic treatment for people with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). At present, there are four major KDTs: the classic KD, the modified Atkins diet (MAD), the medium-chain triglyceride diet (MCT), and the low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . There are few reports on the management of KDTs for patients with epilepsy through telemedicine as the main resource [27] .Implementation of KDTs in our country dates back the 1970s [23] . The recent trend in all diet modalities is outpatient treatment, avoiding fasting and using lower ketogenic ratios, without modifying effectiveness [23, 24] .The purpose of this study was to assess parent satisfaction with the management of KDTs through telemedicine using WhatsApp as the main tool during the COVID-19 pandemic.In Argentina, the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic began on March 20, 2020 and continues at the time of this report. In the first week of June, we conducted a survey to assess how telemedicine services were responding to the demands of patients on KDTs.A survey on quality of care was administered to 54 parents of children on KDTs. The age of the patients ranged from 8 month to 18 years. Overall, 17 patients were on the classic KD, seven on a modified classic KD with low fat-to-protein-and-carbohydrate ratios, 20 on the MCT, four on the LGIT, and six on the MAD. This study was approved by ethics committee.Our study was conducted at two secondary-care KDT centers: a public hospital in the province of Tucumán (Hospital del Niño Jesús) in the north of Argentina following 1565 pediatric patients with epilepsy and a private clinic in the province of Neuquén (Clínica San Lucas) in Patagonia following 933 children with epilepsy ( Fig. 1 ). Both centers are connected with Hospital Nacional de Pediatria J.P Garrahan (Buenos Aires), a tertiary-care center, for consultation.Both teams cover a patient population with limited financial resources and levels of education. Given that many families did not have either computers or WIFI, or any other access to ICT, WhatsApp was chosen as a tool as it was available on the cell phones of all the families and professionals.In both centers, the interdisciplinary KDT team consists of child neurologists specialized in DRE and dietitians and/or medical nutritionists. Possible candidates for KDTs are selected by the neurologist based on the expected benefits in relation to the epileptic syndrome or type of epilepsy and after having ruled out conditions in which the diet is contraindicated [26, 27] . Parents have the personal telephone number of the professional team members. They are able to reach out for professional support at any time of the day by means of asynchronous (message) and synchronous (video call) WhatsApp messages. Most of the queries are about occurrence of epileptic seizures, medication changes, diet or drug adverse effects, modifications in the ketogenic ratio, and weight and height control. By the same means, adherence to treatment, compliance with vitamin supplements, ketonemia or ketonuria, and the results of laboratory tests are monitored.This work modality had been implemented prior to the pandemic, which, we believe, was key to the feasibility to continue KDT management during it.The survey was developed with Google Questionnaire forms and sent to the families via WhatsApp. All families with a child on the diet during the COVID-19 pandemic filled out the questionnaire. The parents answered 13 questions related to the care provided by the KDT multidisciplinary team regarding initiation or maintenance of the diet, understanding of how to prepare meals, measuring ketonemia/ketonuria, compliance with the team in the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period, accessibility to the professionals, benefits of initiation or follow-up through telemedicine, resolution of emergency situations, evaluation of laboratory results, diet or vitamin supplement adjustments, and modification of prescriptions. The questionnaire is shown in Fig. 2 .Since the nationwide lockdown began on March 20, 2020, patients in different phases of KDTs have been managed almost exclusively by telemedicine, although patients who for some reason required an inperson consultation had the opportunity to see a physician at the outpatient clinic.Two months into the lockdown, 54 families from both centers were surveyed.At that time, 16 .7% were in the pre-diet evaluation phase, 7.4% in the initiation phase, 74% in the maintenance phase, and 1.9% were discontinuing the diet. Patients in the pre-diet evaluation phase received instructions on how to reduce carbohydrates. Twenty-three families that received instructions on how to prepare meals through video calls reported that understanding the instructions was easy (65.2%), complex but they were able to manage (30.4%), and difficult and they needed in-person instructions (4.34%).Understanding how to perform ketonemia/ketonuria controls through telemedicine was easy for 67.9% of the family, complex but they were able to manage for 24.5%, and difficult and they needed inperson instructions for 7.6%.Almost all families reported a high level of satisfaction with their KDT team both during the pandemic and in the pre-pandemic period (96.3%), while 11.1% of them stated that they were more satisfied than in the pre-pandemic period, and 3.7% were dissatisfied with this modality.Accessibility to the team members during the pandemic was rated as excellent by 68.5% of the families and good by 31.5%. None of the families considered accessibility to be poor.The reasons to initiate or follow-up KDTs through telemedicine were the COVID-19 pandemic (83.3%), geographic distance (44.4%), the convenience of being able to consult the team from the comfort of their homes (29.6%), team decision (18.5%), and economic reasons (11.1%).The main advantages of initiating or following-up KDTs through telemedicine for families were ease of access to the medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic (77.8%), the convenience of being able to consult the team from the comfort of their homes (63%), and travel cost savings and less absenteeism from work or school (33.3%).In emergency situations, the response from the team for the resolution of the problem was considered as excellent in 52.1% and good in 47.9%. None of the families rated the response as poor.The management of indications for and medical evaluation of laboratory results by the KDT team via WhatsApp during the pandemic was considered by the families as excellent in 58.5%, good in 39.6%, and poor in 1.9%.The response of the team in making adjustments to the diet or vitamin supplements based on laboratory results was considered excellent by 46% of the families, good by 52%, and poor by 2%.Assistance in the modifications of recipes when necessary during the pandemic (economic reasons, food availability) through telemedicine was evaluated as excellent (54.7%) and good (45.3%).The availability of a social support network (parents WhatsApp group) coordinated by the KDT team was considered to be useful by 90.7% of the families, useless by 1.9%, while 7.4% were indifferent.Most families (72.2%) would recommend the use of telemedicine in any situation regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 27.8% would recommend using telemedicine only during the pandemic. None of the families would advise against treatment via telemedicine.The main results of the survey are summarized in Table 1 . This is the first report assessing parent satisfaction with telemedicine for the management of their children receiving KDTs using WhatsApp as the main communication technology.Our study indicates that management of children with DRE on KDTs through telemedicine is feasible and well accepted by the families. The possibility of continuing treatment during the pandemic and the easy access to the team from the comfort of their homes were considered to be the main advantages. Most families would recommend using telemedicine in any situation regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the families stated that they would advise against treatment by telemedicine. Ninety percent of the respondents considered that having a social support network (parent WhatsApp group coordinated by the KDT team) was helpful. Satisfaction survey for parents or caregivers of children with drug-resistant epilepsy, treated via telemedicine by a ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) team during the covid-19 pandemic. WhatsApp is a simple but comprehensive tool to manage KDTs in patients who live far from the treating center or when in-person visits are difficult as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.Some authors have warned about legal and ethical concerns regarding confidentiality privacy and data security in WhatsApp. Another issue is how to keep clinical data safe. Nevertheless, the main strength of WhatsApp is that it is a free means of communication and available to everybody, even in resource-poor areas [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 28, 29] .Different studies have defined WhatsApp as an effective telemedicine tool in many healthcare fields [9, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Nevertheless, we have not found reports of its use in the management of KDTs. On the other hand, other tools have been successfully used for the initiation and maintenance of KDTs. Cervenka et al. demonstrated that the MAD administered solely via e-mail to adults with DRE was feasible, safe, and effective. Tolerability and efficacy were similar to those reported by the same center in patients treated in a conventional office setting by a team of dietitians and neurologists [20] . Recently, Kossoff et al. published their successful experience in starting and maintaining the KD by telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic in children and adults with DRE at the Johns Hopkins KDT center. In this study, online platforms (e.g., Zoom, Polycom, or Doximity) and phone calls and e-mail were used to contact the families and patients. Recommendations are given on how to manage KDTs during the pandemic [22] . Ferraris et al. retrospectively described the use of remote monitoring of the classic KD by e-mail in 34 children with DRE or glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome during the first year of follow-up [32] .The fast spread of the pandemic has led to priority care for patients with COVID-19, overwhelming health institutions and turning them into potential sources of contagion. It has generated new doctor-patient relationship models. The KDT teams should encourage the use of ICT to optimize access, remote management, and monitoring of KDTs. Information and communication technology is also useful for coordination between different teams, information sharing, consensus building, training, and counseling (telementoring) [33] .Many reports have described the key requirements for developing telemedicine, not only in emergency settings but also in everyday practice [13, 34] . The COVID-19 pandemic required immediate government policies, such as the development of telemedicine, ensuring connectivity, cyber and legal security, training of healthcare professionals and patients in the use of ICT, confidentiality, appropriate remuneration, and an adequate ethical framework.The use of WhatsApp allowed for a comprehensive management of patients with DRE on KDTs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing the possibility of continuous contact with patients and their families to avoid the loss to follow-up of patients. In addition, it proved to be a fast, easy, and free-of-charge communication tool to monitor these difficult patients receiving a complex treatment that requires strict controls.Similar to a previous study, our survey showed a high level of satisfaction with this treatment modality among the families of the patients [11] . Nevertheless, the study has several limitations, mainly the subjectivity of the answers to qualitative questions in the survey. On the other hand, the survey was conducted in an area of limited resources, in a developing country, using popular and free communication tools, such as WhatsApp and Google Questionnaire Forms.Our patient satisfaction survey shows parents were pleased with the comprehensive management of KDT through telemedicine. WhatsApp provided easy access to each member of the team for medical and dietary consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most families stated that they would recommend using telemedicine in any situation regardless of the pandemic.The management of the KDTs in in patients with DRE by telemedicine is feasible and probably as safe and effective as conventional medicine. WhatsApp may be an interesting option in the remote management of a complex nonpharmacological treatment such as KDT coordinated by a well-trained multidisciplinary team.None.

Aproximadamente 15% de los pacientes corresponden a casos graves y 5% a enfermedad crítica, siendo la mortalidad en ese último grupo alrededor del 50% (2) .Se han identificado varios factores de riesgo asociados con el desarrollo de síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda (SDRA) y la muerte, como edad avanzada, disfunción orgánica medida por SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, en inglés), coagulopatía y elevación de D-dímero (3) (4) (5) . La detección temprana de pacientes con probabilidad de desarrollar enfermedad grave es de importancia, y puede ayudar a proporcionar atención adecuada y una conveniente distribución de recursos.Hasta el momento, existen pocas herramientas de evaluación de gravedad para pacientes con COVID-19 (2, 6) . En varios protocolos se ha propuesto utilizar escalas como CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure and 65 years of age and older), PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) y qSOFA (quick SOFA score); sin embargo, su utilidad en la COVID-19 se ha investigado poco (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . De dichas escalas, el CURB-65 es sencilla y útil para predecir la mortalidad a 30 días de pacientes adultos con neumonía bacteriana (13, 14) .Por ello, este estudio multicéntrico valora la utilidad del CURB-65 para predecir la mortalidad a 30 días de pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19.Estudio de cohortes retrospectivo en el que se revisaron datos de pacientes adultos hospitalizados en alguno de los 6 hospitales participantes de la ciudad de Guayaquil entre el 1 de marzo y el 30 de abril de 2020, con diagnóstico confirmado o sospechoso de COVID-19, de acuerdo a los protocolos para el diagnóstico y manejo de la COVID-19 en Ecuador (15,16). Se J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 incluyeron únicamente pacientes registrados por los investigadores del estudio y se excluyeron los casos con exudado nasofaríngeo para SARS-CoV-2 negativo. El registro contó con la aprobación ética del Instituto de Investigación e Innovación en Salud integral de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Católica de Guayaquil.Los variables del estudio COVID-EC se han publicado previamente (17) . Los investigadores de cada centro recogieron datos demográficos, variables clínicas, analíticas, radiológicas, microbiológicas y terapéuticas.Se registró la muerte intrahospitalaria por cualquier causa, y en todos los pacientes se calculó el CURB-65 durante el primer contacto en Urgencias (13) .La variable de resultado principal fue muerte intrahospitalaria y a 30 días por cualquier causa.Las variables cualitativas se expresaron como frecuencias absolutas y relativas. Las variables cuantitativas se expresaron como media y desviación estándar (DE). Para las comparaciones se utilizó el test de Chi cuadrado (χ2) o el test de Fisher para las variables cualitativas y el test t de Student para las variables cuantitativas. Se realizaron curvas de Kaplan Meier para la variable principal de resultado en función de la clasificación por CURB-65, y se compararon mediante el método de log-rank.Para evaluar la asociación independiente del CURB-65 con la mortalidad, se ajustó un modelo de regresión de Cox en el que se incluyeron variables asociadas a la variable resultado en el análisis univariable con una p<0,10. Las medidas de efecto se mostraron con Hazard Ratio (HR) y su intervalo de confianza del 95% (IC 95%). Las áreas bajo las curvas (AUC) de los modelos de predicción se compararon utilizando el enfoque de Delong y Clarke-Pearson. Se consideró que las diferencias eran estadísticamente significativas cuando el valor de la variable p era inferior a 0,05.Los análisis estadísticos se realizaron utilizando el paquete estadístico SPSS (IBM, North Castle, Nueva York, EE. UU.).En total se incluyeron 247 pacientes (edad media 60 ± 14 años; 70% varones; 47,4% ingresaron en unidad de cuidados intensivos -UCI-; mortalidad global 41,3%). La comorbilidad más frecuente fue hipertensión arterial (48,6%), seguida de sobrepeso/obesidad presente en 28,3% de los casos.Los síntomas de COVID-19 más reportados fueron: disnea (90,7%), fiebre (85,4%), tos (84,2%) y astenia (81%). El hallazgo radiológico más común fue la presencia de neumonía bilateral (76,1% de los casos), y 35,2% de los pacientes presentó afectación intersticial en la tomografía (TC) torácica. En 22% de los pacientes se confirmó la infección mediante exudado nasofaríngeo para SARS-CoV-2 según la técnica de reacción en cadena de la polimerasa con transcriptasa inversa (RT-PCR). En 193 pacientes no fue posible realizar confirmación de la infección mediante RT-PCR por falta de disponibilidad de las pruebas (18) .Tras clasificar a los pacientes según el CURB-65 (0-1 vs ≥2), los pacientes con CURB-65 ≥2 presentaron edades más avanzadas (64 ± 13 vs. 54 ± 14,6 años, p<0,001) y mayor comorbilidad (hipertensión 57% vs. 36,2%, p=0,002; sobrepeso/obesidad 34% vs. 20,2%, p=0,02; enfermedad coronaria 7,3% vs. 0%, p=0,007). Estos pacientes presentaron saturaciones de oxígeno más bajas (81 ± 15% vs. 88 ± 9%, p<0,001), requirieron mayor soporte con ventilación mecánica (55% vs. 36,2%, p=0,005), presentaron más SDRA (68,9% vs. 49,8%, p=0,002) y muerte (57% vs. 17%, p<0,001). Las características generales de la muestra se presentan en el anexo 1 (ver material suplementario).Las curvas de supervivencia de Kaplan Meier mostraron diferencias significativas entre pacientes según CURB-65 (0-1 vs. ≥2) para la variable mortalidad a 30 días (Figura 1). En el análisis multivariable, el CURB-65 ≥2 se relacionó de forma independiente con la mortalidad a 30 días por COVID-19 (Tabla 1). El CURB-65 es probablemente la escala de predicción de mortalidad de neumonía más utilizada a nivel mundial ya que combina solo 5 variables para determinar la gravedad de la enfermedad, poniendo más énfasis en los parámetros fisiológicos, y siendo más fácil de calcular que otras escalas como el PSI (14) . Por estos motivos el CURB-65 se ha incluido en protocolos hospitalarios para el manejo de pacientes COVID-19 (19) .Estudios previos han identificado factores de riesgo de muerte en adultos hospitalizados con COVID-19; en particular, edad mayor a 50 años, enfermedades cardiovasculares, niveles de Dímero-D >1000 ng/mL y puntuación SOFA elevada al ingreso (3, 10) .Además, se han observado con más frecuencia niveles aumentados en sangre de IL-6, troponina I y LDH en pacientes con enfermedad grave (3). En un estudio reciente con 681 pacientes se objetivó que el CURB-65 ≥2 presentó una adecuada capacidad discriminatoria para predecir la mortalidad a 30 días, similar a lo encontrado en nuestro estudio (11) .Otras evidencias señalan que escalas como APACHE II y SOFA predicen mejor la mortalidad intrahospitalaria que el CURB-65 (AUC 0,96, IC 95% 0,94-0,99 para APACHE II; AUC 0,86, IC 95% 0,81-0,93 para SOFA, y AUC 0,84, IC 95% 0,78-0,91 para CURB-65, utilizando puntos de corte de 17, 3 y 1, respectivamente). Esto se explicaría porque APACHE II incluye entre sus variables comorbilidad y edad, mientras que el CURB-65 solo la edad. Por ello, las escalas APACHE II y PSI podrían ser más adecuadas para estratificar el riesgo de mortalidad en pacientes con comorbilidades (8, 11) . pese a que originalmente ha sido diseñada como una herramienta para neumonía bacteriana (9, 10, 12) . Utilizando un punto de corte ≥2 hemos encontrado diferencias significativas en mortalidad en pacientes adultos hospitalizados con COVID-19. En nuestra serie, la mortalidad del grupo con CURB-65 0-1 fue del 17%, lo que contrasta con lo previamente reportado en neumonía bacteriana (14) .En una serie francesa publicada recientemente con 279 pacientes se observó que 21,1% de los pacientes con CURB-65 0-1 presentó mala evolución (12) . Esto permite inferir que la puntuación CURB-65 se relaciona con una mayor mortalidad, pero su aplicabilidad para guiar la toma de decisiones respecto al ingreso hospitalario de pacientes COVID-19 es dudosa: no identifica adecuadamente a los pacientes que se pueden manejar ambulatoriamente. Esto podría deberse a que existen diferencias en términos epidemiológicos y de severidad en pacientes COVID-19 respecto a aquellos con neumonía bacteriana. Por esto, si se utiliza el CURB-65, antes de tomar la decisión de alta del paciente directamente desde Urgencias, se debe considerar la probabilidad de complicaciones directas de la neumonía como insuficiencia respiratoria, derrame pleural, exacerbación de enfermedad subyacente, capacidad de tomar medicación oral y disponibilidad de un cuidador (14) .Si bien ya se ha desarrollado y validado una puntuación de riesgo específica para predecir el desarrollo de enfermedad grave/crítica entre pacientes hospitalizados por COVID-19 (AUC 0,88, IC 95% 0,84-0,93), esta requiere de 10 variables, y la utilización del CURB-65 continúa siendo más sencilla (2) . A efectos prácticos, la simplificación de clasificar pacientes en grupos de riesgo intermedio-bajo o moderado-alto puede resultar adecuada, y, por este motivo, consideramos que la utilización del CURB-65 resulta más viable en la práctica clínica real.El presente estudio tiene varias limitaciones. En primer lugar, las inherentes a un estudio retrospectivo no aleatorizado. Segundo, el diagnóstico de COVID-19 no se pudo confirmar en 9 todos los casos, dado que en Ecuador no hubo suficiente cantidad de pruebas para el diagnóstico (18) y, al igual que en otros países, los criterios diagnósticos se modificaron a lo largo del tiempo (20). Tercero, no todas las pruebas radiológicas y/o de laboratorio estuvieron disponibles para todos los pacientes. Sin embargo, pese a las limitaciones señaladas, se trata de un registro de práctica clínica real, el único multicéntrico realizado en hospitales de Guayaquil, Ecuador (17) .El CURB-65 es una herramienta útil y sencilla para predecir la mortalidad a 30 días en pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19, utilizando un punto de corte ≥2.

On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. As of August 23 th , 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection reached about 23 million confirmed cases worldwide in more than 213 countries and caused more than 800,000 deaths (https://covid19.who.int). To date, no specific treatment was proved to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection, beside supportive care.Passive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP), a classic adaptive immunotherapy, has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases over many decades, from A/H1N1 Spanish Flu in [1917] [1918] to SARS in 2012. 1 The efficacy of passive antibody therapy has been associated with the concentration of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in plasma of recovered patients. 2 CP from patients who have recovered from viral infection can be used to improve clinical conditions and survival rate of patients with acute viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, without severe adverse effects. Preliminary data showed a reduction of viral load, shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 treated with CP in comparison to those who were not. 3, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Possible mechanisms related to the efficacy of CP therapy in SARS-CoV-2 include the passive transfusion of neutralizing antibodies and an immunomodulatory effect via amelioration of severe inflammatory response. 9, 10 Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop a primary immune response by days 10-14, which is followed by virus clearance. 11 Therefore, theoretically, it should be more effective to administer the CP at the early stage of disease. A recent matched study suggested that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation. 12 However, other treatments might influence the relationship between CP and antibody level, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin.We are conducting a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of CP for patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Convalescent donors have been recruited from the community. Pre-requisite for plasma donation include age (>18 years old); no previous pregnancy; time elapsed from the last day of symptoms (> 14 days); laboratorial evidence of prior infection by SARS-CoV-2; and screening negative for infectious diseases transmissible for blood (HIV 1+2, HTLV 1+2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and Chagas Disease). Moreover, we also have evaluated the level of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and the absence of RNAemia in a blood samples before plasma collection. As nAbs play important roles on virus clearance and have been considered as a key immune product for treatment against viral diseases, in concordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we stablished that CP unit for transfusion should contain nAbs with minimum titer of ≥1:160 (https://www.fda.gov/media/136798/download).However, neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2 are limited in availability and throughput, requiring biosafety level 3 facilities and skilled labor. Since such assay is often unavailable, one alternative is to perform the test later in a stored sample, or to perform another test to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prior to issuing the plasma unit for transfusion.The correlation between immunoassays antibodies titers and neutralizing antibodies has not been thoroughly investigated and the knowledge of this association can help to make better therapeutic decisions.The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of criteria based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for the prediction of high nAbs titers in CP donors.Two commercials immunoassays comprising the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S1 domain) were tested in parallel with all collected samples: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott (Chicago, US). Tests were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)Blood samples with DO/CO ≥ 3 on the IgG immunoassay were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR using TaqMan method. A quantitative in house real-time PCR assay amplifying the virus RdRp RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope was applied to determine the copy number of SARS-CoV-2. 13 The test had sensitivity of approximately 100 copies/mL. In all amplification reactions, positive and negative controls and an exogenous internal control were used.Two hundred and fourteen samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were seeded 24 hours before the infection in a 96-well plate. Plasma samples were, initially, inactivated for 30 min at 56°C. We used 8 dilutions (two-fold) of each plasma (1:20 to 1:2560). Subsequently, plasma was mixed vol/vol with 10 3 TCID50/mL of SARS-CoV-2/human/BRA/SP02cc/2020 strain virus (GenBanK access number: MT350282.1) 16 and pre-incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to allow virus neutralization. Then, the plasma plus virus mixture was transferred onto the confluent cell monolayer and incubated for 3 days at 37°C, under 5% CO2. Virus neutralization titer referred to VNT100 is described as the highest dilution of serum that neutralized virus growth (absence of cytopathic effect). In each assay, a strong, assured internal positive control serum (RT-qPCR positive + PRNT90>640) 17 was used, as a negative pre-outbreak serum sample. All the procedures related to CPE-VNT were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory, in accordance with WHO recommendations 18 .A descriptive analysis was carried out using frequencies, central tendency and position measures. Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric tests were used to compare nAbs values in different groups and Bonferroni post-hoc method was applied to adjust results for multiple comparisons. The variables age and days since last symptom were tested according to groups from tertiles of the distribution values.There were 263 potential CP donors evaluated, of whom 49 were excluded from the analysis either because nAbs titers were lacking (n=35) or because the evaluation was performed less than 10 days after the symptom resolution (n=14)Table1 shows the descriptive data of the analyzed sample. Most donors were male (57.9%) and young (median age was 35 years/IQR=15). The two most common clinical comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension (8.7%) and pulmonary disease (6.5%).The titers of nAbs of the studied sample varied widely Approximately 1 in each 5 donors (19.1%) had nAbs titers <1:80 (Figure2). Titers were significantly higher among: 1) men (difference of median=160 nAbs, p<0.001), 2) individuals in the upper tertile ofage (difference of median to lower tertile=160 nAbs, p=0.003) andfrom two immunoassays analyzed, Abbott and Euroimmun (p<0.001). These data have already been observed in other manuscripts that used an immunoassay. [25] [26] [27] [28] However, this is the first report showing a positive correlation between nAbs tested by an ELISA and a Chemiluminescence assay. This correlation is very important since many services do not have access to measuring nAbs, and, in this scenario, an immunoassay can be used as a screening to detect the presence of antibodies anti SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of convalescent donors.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

(85% of the territory), mainly occurring in disperse rural settings, although the probable presence of endemic, unstable and low-intensity malaria transmission has been recently reported in urban and peri-urban areas of the Pacific coast and a few others in the eastern regions of the Amazon and Orinoco regions (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) .For more than 25 years research has been developed towards evidencing, understanding and modelling the linkages between El Niño, the warm phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, and malaria outbreaks in Colombia (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Figure 1 shows the annual series of malaria incidence in Colombia from 1960 to 2019, represented by the Annual Parasite Index [(number of confirmed cases/population at risk) x1000], using data from previous studies and the Colombian National Institute of Health. El Niño years are denoted by red arrows, according to the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of US. The two last months of 2019 and the three first months of 2020 were also under the influence of El Niño, and until the 27 th epidemiological week of 2020 (June 28-July 4), 41,701 malaria cases have been reported in Colombia, of which Malaria incidence shows both an increasing trend, of which climate change cannot be disregarded, as well as outbreaks (sudden jumps) during the occurrence of historical El Niño events in the tropical Pacific. The most important climatic factors that have been identified to explain the outbreaks of malaria during El Niño are, mainly, increases in air temperatures and reductions in rainfall brought about by El Niño in Colombia (17) (18) (19) , due to an increase in the biting rates of the mosquito vector and the shortening of the duration of the sporogonic cycle (reproduction of the parasite inside the mosquito). The increasing trend seems to be decreasing in recent years but malaria outbreaks keep coming back with El Niño events. The situation has been worsened with the on-going humanitarian crisis in the neighboring Venezuela which has triggered the migration of over 1,200,000 Venezuelan citizens to Colombia and other South American countries. In 2019 there were 2,288 cases of imported malaria Colombia, with 95.7% from Venezuela (19) . Until the 27 th epidemiological week of 2020 (June 28-July 4) there have been 296 imported cases with 95,3% from Venezuela (16) .Other endemic vector-borne diseases also exhibit well-documented strong outbreaks associated with El Niño in Colombia, such as dengue (21) (22) (23) (24) , which are mostly explained by the generalized increase in air temperature in Colombia during El Niño. A strong outbreak of dengue occurred during 2019 in Colombia with 127,553 cases, representing 475.4 cases per 100,000 people at risk (18) . Until the 27 th epidemiological week (June 28-July 4), 61,467 cases of dengue have been reported (229.8 cases per 100,000 people), including 662 cases (1.1%) of hemorrhagic dengue (16) .Further research needs to be carried out to better understand the geo-bio-physical linkages between the occurrence of vector-borne diseases with climate variability in Colombia, but also with the on-going and future impacts of climate change in the tropical Americas (25) , and the alarming deforestation rates of the country, especially after the peace accord between the Colombian government and the leftist FARC guerrillas (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) .The whole public health situation in Colombia has been aggravated by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. According to data from the Colombian Ministry of Health, until July 15, 2020, there have been 165,169 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 71,736 recovered and 5,814 deaths. The situation is especially worrisome in poor and vulnerable populations of the Pacific coast and the Amazon and Orinoco regions of Colombia, due to precarious transportation systems, lack of medicines, nonexistent laboratory testing capabilities, shortage of ICU personal and beds, mechanical ventilators and other specialized equipment, and ancient deficiencies in hospital infrastructure, amid poverty, marginalization, deficient public services' supply, high unemployment rates exacerbated by the socio-economic lockdown imposed by the pandemic, and strong socioenvironmental vulnerability. This note constitutes an urgent call to Colombia's public health system to act to ensure the maintenance of malaria, dengue, and many other vector and water-borne diseases services, which cannot become neglected, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The health sector must be prepared to cope with the endemicity of the likely new outbreaks of malaria and dengue amid the COVID-19 pandemics. Will the poorest people of Colombia continue to be the next foretold victims of the simultaneous occurrence of ancient endemic diseases along with the new COVID-19? The answer is in the hands of the Colombian health authorities.☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Criteria and fundamentals for the organization of work Hospital radiopharmacy in Argentina during the COVID-19 pandemic. Criteria and fundamentals for the organization of work. Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria en Argentina durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Criterios y fundamentos para la organización del trabajo","We are currently going through a pandemic in which all activities are modified in order to continue life as safely as possible. Hospital radiopharmacy is no exception and should have an adequate work plan which is objective of the present article.Safe practice of the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed within the setting of nuclear medicine requires a permanent supply of high quality radiopharmaceuticals prepared according to good radiopharmaceutical practices 1 . This is the objective of hospital radiopharmacy.The head of hospital radiopharmacy should be a qualified professional who can guarantee the final product and the application of a quality system that ensures all the aspects of Good Radiopharmaceutical Practice. The need for acting with foresight and developing a culture of constant evaluation and supervision must be emphasized 2, 3, 4 .The technological or organizational capacities and competences made available to Nuclear Medicine Departments by Hospital Radiopharmacy Services enables the adoption of measures to improve the services provided, being of added value to critical situations such as a pandemic.In the current scenario, all of the most adequate health care measures are taken in patients who are positive or suspected of having COVID-19 and require nuclear medicine procedures. These measures are aimed at protecting the health care personnel performing the procedure and thereby ensuring the continuity of services 5 .The documents consulted which include the institutional CNEA procedures as well as the IAEA 7,8 and WHO 9 recommendations and other scientific publications 5, 10, 11, 12 are the foundation of the safety protocol designed.In order to fulfill the specific objectives of hospital radiopharmacy, the general recommendations inherent to the Center of Nuclear Medicine (CNM) of the CNEA are listed taking into account the relationship between these two areas:• Reinforce general hygiene measures.• Respect hygiene norms of the admission of personnel and patients to avoid circulation of the virus from the exterior to the interior of the CNM.• Train personnel by providing instructions indicated for the situation of a pandemic and define controls of compliance to ensure the functioning of radiopharmacy according to the present protocol.According to the WHO, the following points must be considered in order to ensure the health of the personnel, the patient and related persons, family members, etc. With these considerations, the following work strategies are proposed:1.-Coordinate tasks.Segregate the personnel in fixed equipment with different days, reducing the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f number of personnel to the essential minimum and promoting communication and interdisciplinary work.Each group must have a professional who is responsible for the group and has autonomy for decision making, thereby avoiding delays in activities which could produce major exposure of both patients and personnel.Achieve medical consensus to establish which studies are urgent and which can be reprogrammed in order to avoid unnecesarily expose of personnel in the hospital setting. For example, radiopharmaceuticals for studies such as the detection of sentinel lymph nodes, the localization of digestive hemorrhage or emergency cardiology studies should be labeled the same day. Favor social distanicing between health personnel and patients and between the same health care providers, organizing a calendar of patients so that the personnel can perform their tasts calmly and carefully, as well as the corresponding disinfection tasks (of equipment, common areas, etc.)Provide workers with the personal supplies necessary to ensure full protection. When some element is lacking, the head of the sector must be immediately informed in order to undertake the necessary measures to replenish the stock.Tasks must not be developed without the necessary elements of personal protection required.Each worker must have their own PPE and must establish that the PPE supplies were given in a closed package. Each person must be responsible for the care, correct use and discarding of their PPE 9,10 .1. If any member of the hospital radiopharmaceutical staff is suspected of having become infected or presents any symptom of COVID-19 during or after their workday or has been in contact with a confirmed case in the last 14 days, the immediate correponding head and the Medical Services must be informed according to the department. Thus, this person must not come to the nuclear medicine department and must remain at home and follow the mandatory social isolation.2. The personnel of Hospital Radiopharmacy are capacitated and trained in the aspetic management of injectables. Tasks are developed in a clean area under established protocols which allow safe delivery of radiopharmaceuticals according to the CNEA Hospital Radiopharmacy Quality Management System (Fig. 1) . 3. In the clean area and hot lab the cleaning protocols are periodically reinforced and the registry of these tasks are verified.4. Patients must be a safe distance before the entry of personnel into the hot lab.Up to now there is no prophylaxis to fight this disease. Therefore, we must prevent contacts, seeking useful criteria to avoid dissemination of the virus in our essential shared work tasks. In addition to criteria for selecting diagnostic and prognostic tests and the detection of the development of protective immunity, the actions must minimize the factor of contagion, and this is not possible without mitigation measures.Several articles report the care which health care personnel and other essential workers must have and describe useful criteria for the organization of work groups 5, 9, 10 .The activity of hospital radiopharmacy should reflect the current situation of the pandemic, with simple management and clear biochemical and immunological concepts.Following the decoding of the viral genoma in China, sequencing of the RNA of the virus was used to design different diagnostic tests around the world. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test detects the presence of the virus.The theoretical specificity of these tests is 100%, because the design of the imprinting is specific of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenceIn regard to immunologial response, the recruitment mechanism of white blood cells or lymphocytes, which are the producers of antibodies (Ab), is of note.There are two types of lymphocytes, the B and the T. B lymphocytes are responsible for the immune system mediated by antibodies; that is, they are differentiated into plasma cells which produce antibodies verus antigens which are proteins constituting the virus. T lymphocytes are responsible for the immune system mediated by cells. Some are cytotoxic T lymphocytes (cytolytic T lymphocytes) and natural cytolytic lymphocytes (natural killer [NK] cells) which establish physical contact and destroy cells which are foreign or altered by the infectious agent. Certain T lymphocytes are responsible for the onset and development (helper T lymphocytes) or suppression (Treg lymphocytes) of most immune responses mediated by antibodies or cells. This regulation occurs by the release of signaling molecules known as cytokines.Antibody-mediated immunity is studied by serological analyses with enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) tests which analyze and quantify immunoglobulins. The variety of antigens of the virus enables the design of different diagnostic kits. The following graph (Fig. 2) shows the theoretical immunologial profile of a viral infection. After infection, IgM antibodies are generated (detectable 7 days post infection) followed by IgG antibodies (detectable 14 days post infection) 13 . Figure 3 shows the kinetics of the immunological response of an infected person and the relationship with the evaluation of risk of contagion and propagation of the virus.Kinetics of response to SARS-CoV-2 The viral load generally reaches its maximum peak early in the disease and then reduces as the antibodies develop and antibody titers increase during the following 2 to 3 weeks.The utility of this criterion is that an immunocompetent person develops this immunological profile in the case of contagion, and it is therefore important to take this into account in the work groups.The serological diagnosis is especially important for asymptomatic patients or those with mild to moderate disease. This is becoming an important tool for understanding the spread of COVID-19 in the community and to identify people who are immune and potentially ""protected"" against becoming infected.The most sensitive and safe serological marker is the determination of IgM and IgG antibodies. The highest levels are produced in the second and third week of disease, although positive IgM and IgG have been found by ELISA even on the fourth day after symptom onset 11 .This method has a specificity greater than 95% for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnostic accuracy can be further increased by pairing the initial PCR and its repetition two weeks later. Nonetheless, the long-term persistence and duration of protection conferred by the neutralizing antibodies remains unknown 12 .The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that it is important to have specific diagnostic tests that can identify patients infected by the virus as well as those who have developed protection against the disease.In patients with compatible clinical manifestations and negative PCR results, the presence of antibodies helps to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 11, 12 .The length of PCR positivity and seroconversion varies among children and other groups, including the large population of asymptomatic individuals who are not diagnosed without active surveillance.Many questions remain to be answered, especially in regard to the potential length of immunity in both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2.At an occupational level, the bibliography indicates the following categorization within the work staff considering analysis of their immunological profile:  Active personnel not presenting clinical manifestations: the presence of antibodies provides relevant data on possible current or previous infection allowing avoidance of dissemination and new infections. Personnel who have had the infection and return to work: information on immunocompetence status is of great importance for planning against new outbreaks of the pandemic. Protected personnel can be in contact with COVID-19 positive patients with minimum risk to both patients and colleagues 13 .Considering the theoretical immunological profiles, the personnel affected must perform their work activities in person during one week and remotely for two weeks with the aim of minimizing the proability of contagion to their colleagues and hospital setting in general on their return. If the infected person presents very mild or doubtful manifestations of infection, the immunological profile shown in the previous graphs would show that the disease followed its course. From the biochemical point of view, the variations in IgM and then IgG antibody levels would indicate that the worker had acquired immunity 14 .As the meaning of the word ""immunity"" indicates, the invaded host resisted the invasive agent, and thus, transmission is not possible. This is fundamental to avoid massive contagion of personnel.As with most virus, SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells with exclusive intracellular proliferation linked to its particular characteristics, many of which currently remain unknown. On the other hand, the particular reactions of the host do not vary greatly. These reactions mainly involve differences in the duration of immunty, with antivirus immunity generally being more prolonged than antibacterial immunity 15 .For epidemiological studies and work planning it is important to consider the presence of specific antibodies in order to contain contagions as well as to determine the percentage of workers who have generated protective immunity.The criteria described evaluate the state of immunocompetence to a virus and the return of personnel to the workplace to prevent contagion and viral dissemination and collaborate with the economic impact generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.The safety of personnel replacement is fundamental for immunity and this supports the three team segregation model: one team that works in person for one week and is then replaced by two other teams during the following two weeks (Fig.5) . In this way, if a member of the team acquires the disease, without presenting symptoms, this person will not be in contact with the other work teams because of the rotation system proposed. All follow a 14-day period during which they will develop the disease and/or acquire immunity, reducing the probability of dissemination and contagion.The rotation scheme proposed guarantees the continuity of activities of Hospital Radiopharmacy which are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of patients taking into account the ensured quality of the labeled product delivered by this service.In conclusion, considering the normal immunological profile of an individual in the face of a viral infection and supposing that an asymptomatic person goes to work, segregation into at least three work teams with weekly rotation ensures the provision of services in a Nuclear Medicine Center.","Argentina","abstract","2020-10-19",10

The first reported case occurred in late December 2019, still of unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, China. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the virus as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for causing the disease COVID-19, which quickly spread around the world and became a pandemic with high dissemination and contagion level. In Brazil, the first case was dated February 26, 2020, in the southeastern part of the country, in the State of São Paulo, and quickly spread to several states. On March 6, the first case ever was recorded in the northeast of the country, in the State of Bahia. On March 15, the first case was confirmed in Aracaju, the capital of the State of Sergipe, warning of the high speed of the spread of the disease [1] [2] [3] .Until this moment, it is known that the primary means of transmission are droplets and aerosols (droplet nuclei) from the air and respiratory tracts and can also be transmitted by indirect contact through the surfaces or objects on which the infected come into contact 4 . When a person is infected, some characteristic signs and symptoms similar to a flu-like syndrome are presented, such as fever, tiredness, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, and/or sore throat 5 . Cases considered severe evolve to respiratory distress syndrome 6 . In cases where individuals are infected and symptomatic, a study reveals that approximately 20% will need hospitalizations, aiming at improving their clinical condition. For 5% of these, due to hemodynamic instability, there is a need for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) 7 . For such patients, the worst prognosis is directly related to the presence of comorbidities, such as advanced age, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, respiratory and cardiac diseases 8 .While a vaccine to combat COVID-19 is yet to be developed, the authorities have established the use of a mask, social distancing, social isolation, and quarantine as forms of containment of COVID-19 9 due to the number of ICU beds (0,7% of the total in the country) needed to support the most severely ill patients. Additionally, studies are required to contribute to the analysis of estimates regarding the distribution of cases in the States as well as possible impacts of the epidemic given the control measures adopted.In the current scenario in which strategies to contain or minimize the spread of the virus are essential, the objective of this study was to develop a biomathematical transmission model of COVID-19 in the State of Sergipe, Brazil. Wherein, using numerical simulation computational tools to estimate the distribution of cases over time and to assess the impact of interventions (control measures on isolation and/or social distance) on the size and speed of growth of the epidemic outbreak.This is an epidemiological mathematical modeling study. The epidemiological data used were from people infected in the State of Sergipe, in northeastern Brazil, made available by the Ministry of Health 10 . For that, a logistic growth model was used that adds a withdrawal term for individuals as a control measure 11 . The logistic growth model was chosen in relation to the usual compartmental models due to the analytical advantages that will be presented below. Although it is possible to obtain a numerical solution for the number of accumulated cases via computer simulations and parameter adjustments, the associated uncertainty is high since many parameters are used.The following Initial Value Problem (IVP) satisfactorily models our problem:In this equation I(t) represents the number of individuals infected by the coronavirus at time t, given in days, r refers to the rate of contagion with free mobility between people, K is the carrying capacity of the environment and p; the percentage of individuals (infected or not) removed from social life via isolation. We can still rewrite the differential equation as: This way, 0 ≤ p ≤ r will be considered because the withdrawal rate p = 0 establishes no control measure applied, and p = r means maximum control measure capacity achieved.In a classic logistical model, the carrying capacity may be conceptualized as the maximum number of individuals that an ecosystem can sustainably support 11 . Thus, for our model, K refers to the maximum number of infected individuals to reach in a specific region. Given the possibility of contagion most individuals, except for interventions, we used the population of the State of Sergipe, K = 2,298,696, as an initial support capacity 12 .It is possible to notice that p is established as the factor responsible for the control of I. Therefore if p = 0 we will have the case of the classic logistic model in which growth is free and equilibrium over time will occur in I = K, that is, without any control measures. In the past, if p ≠ 0, with p <r, we observe that the new support capacity will be K. (r -p)/r. Consequently, it is for this new value that function I will reach its equilibrium. Also note that the higher the p-value, the lower the new balance.From the data made available by the Ministry of Health from March 15 to June 2, it was possible to adjust the parameters so that the epidemic curve was as close to the curve as the actual data collected. Therefore, data for the contagion rate were used until March 24, date of government decree No. 40.567, even when there was a free circulation of the population, being then optimized to r = 0.1885. This aspect represents the scenario of the free movement of people having p = 0.For the social isolation scenario, data were used until June 2. The removal of the portion of the infected population and the groups considered at risk (elderly and people with comorbidities) were considered. After optimized data, maintaining the value of r = 0.1888, the value p = 0.0925 was obtained. The data was generated from the correspondent period, March 24, assuming that society adheres to the social isolation measures requested.The last scenario studied is related to total isolation, also called community containment or blockade. In this scenario, there would be a ban on the movement of people outside their houses unless in cases of extreme need. Therefore, it was used p = 0.1225, which is 65% of r -keeping people who provide essential services free from isolation.Based on the PVI solution, it was possible to obtain an expression that relates the portion of the population to be isolated via preventive strategies and the time required for the inflection in the infected curve to happen.Thus, it is justified to use the parameters r and p described above to obtain a more adequate carrying capacity.It is worth to mention that the distancing from the inflection point also results in a decrease in the height of the epidemic peak. Given that the proposed model is continuous with respect to the parameters, we have numerical stability of our method in the sense that small disturbances in the settings produce close solutions quantitatively and qualitatively.We plotted the graphs using GNU Octave, free software with computational language that allows us to solve differential equations numerically like our model. Figure 1 shows the decent number of confirmed infection cases until June 2 (t = 79), the blue curve. On that date, the number of infected was 7989 individuals. Further, it is possible to observe the evolution of infection day by day in four different scenarios: (1) the red curve represents the isolation-free scenario; (2) the yellow curve refers to the growth of the infection based on the measure of social isolation, instituted in Sergipe; (3) the green curve estimates the situation in the State if a lockdown was decreed and; (4) the blue curve represents the real cases.It is possible to notice the accelerated growth of contagion in the free scenario that at the end of April, the number of infected people would be 8000. However, the yellow curve grows much more slowly, registering this number only in early June. However, if the lockdown had been implemented since March 24, the number of people infected with COVID-19 in early June would have been only 80 cases.From this perspective, it is still possible to more accurately analyze the interference of isolation measures in containing the contagion of COVID-19 when the evolution of the number of infected people is projected in the next five months. Figure 2 projects the number of infected individuals until the first half of November 2020. Attention is drawn especially to the green curve, which represents the scenario in the hypothesis of total isolation (allowing only the mobility of professionals from essential services) and complete closure of trade.Observing the epidemic curves, it is clear that the State of Sergipe is still in the initial stage of the disease in any of the scenarios. Thus, the State is heading for the moment when there will be a drastically accelerated growth if social isolation is interrupted (red curve). It is still possible to observe that peak cases and equilibrium, in the current scenario of social isolation (yellow curve), will occur when the new support capacity is reached, at the end of August the formula could estimate this:In approximately 1,171,353 infected individuals.The extreme measure of total isolation, or lockdown, would be the best scenario with the lowest incidence of infected people when compared to the other measures. The number of infected people would grow slowly over the months, reaching approximately 154,250 in the first half of August, as seen on the green curve. In using the same formula to calculate the new stabilization, a maximum of approximately 805,305 cases would be observed in November. Taking into account the small portion of the population of Sergipe that is being tested, we estimate that the number of symptomatic individuals in this scenario would be 40,265 cases.The main finding of this study was that the rate of contagion modeled could be quite accelerated if official isolation recommendations are not met, whether partial or total (red curve in Figure 2 ). Our findings suggest that state control of outbreaks is viable with a combination of the proposed intervention measures that involve, in addition to the hygiene actions recommended by WHO, the adoption of lockdown (green curve in Figure 2 ). .The first case of COVID-19 in Sergipe confirmed on March 15, 2020, was a woman that lives in the capital Aracaju, aged 36, and who had returned from Spain. By personal decision, she was isolated for a few days at her residence, and when she decided to undergo tests, her infection was confirmed. Since the confirmation of the diagnose, the state and municipal governments proposed several measures in minimizing the spread of the virus among the population.In March, Brazil recorded 2,239 more deaths from respiratory failure and pneumonia than in the same month of the previous year 13 . The number of Brazilians hospitalized exceeded 40 thousand in the first half of April with respiratory symptoms, of which only 15% had a confirmed diagnosis for COVID-19 14 . In Italy, the epicenter of the disease in Europe, 2500, new ICU beds were needed to treat patients with respiratory failure, resulting from COVID-19 15 . In Sergipe, the average number of ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants is approximately 0.9, almost three times less than recommended by the Ministry of Health. Due to the limitation of the health system for the considerable expansion of the number of ICU beds in the State of Sergipe and to minimize the burden on health services, control measures are justified 12 .Authorities have been challenged to adopt effective public health measures to combat COVID-19. As long as there are no specific vaccines and therapeutic procedures, as well as more information about the means of transmission and the profile of asymptomatic patients, the momentary objective aims to contain the expansion of the virus to avoid overcrowding in health facilities. For this purpose, the social distancing was proposed seeking to reduce interaction, and perhaps transmission, between people in the community since there may be asymptomatic infected people transmitting the virus 16 . Based on these data, social distancing measures are justified, which initially included the closure of schools, gyms, clubs, and bars, the closure of part of the trade (deemed not essential), and the prohibition of parties and events, to avoid crowds.Regarding the results obtained in this study, concerning the evolution of the pandemic in Sergipe, the number of coronavirus infections increased over time. It is also noticed that the adoption of isolation measures could be able to slow the growth of cases in the State. It is estimated that the pandemic could be contained in the second half, reaching less than half of infections if there is no more social isolation (a scenario in which all individuals would be infected sooner or later).Based on previous experience in the management of SARS-CoV and MERs-CoV infections, WHO has recommended some control interventions to reduce the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections. Including avoiding close contact between people with severe respiratory infections and washing hands frequently with soap and water or cleaning with 70% alcohol. Moreover, people with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should practice cough etiquette, which is, keeping distance, and covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing with their forearms. As well as washing their hands within health facilities is recommended standard infection prevention and control practices, especially in emergency services 17 .In a mathematical modeling study, developed by Koo and collaborators 18 , the impact of early interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in the population of Singapore was evaluated. Among the proposed interventions were (1) the isolation and quarantine of infected individuals and their families; (2) quarantine and immediate closure of schools for two weeks; (3) quarantine and social detachment from workers, with 50% of the workforce being encouraged to maintain work activities at home for two weeks; and (4) a combination of quarantine, with the immediate closure of 5/6 schools and distance from the workplace. The researchers showed that the combined strategy of social distance measures increased the reduction of COVID-19 infection by 78.2% (IQR 59.0 -94.4).In this study, it is possible to observe the significant impact of social isolation measures since, with these measures, the new support capacity is reduced. Notably, the maximum expected number of infected people would be 1,171,353 cases, with the forecast for the end of August 2020. Since about 80% of these are asymptomatic, we would have 234,271 infected people in the State. Of these, 11,713 would need assistance in the intensive care unit, which represents 5% of those infected 7 .On the other hand, if isolation is neglected, there could be an infection of all individuals in the State, that is, about 2.3 million cases. Thus, new transmissions would be made available, especially in the most vulnerable part of the population. These are expected to be among the approximately 5% of those infected who would need treatment in the ICU 7 . However, the number of beds of this type in Sergipe is 177. Stricter control measures, such as lockdown, are thus justified to avoid the collapse of the local health system 12 .Knowing that the maximum number of infected individuals who will need hospitalization is about 40,265, scheduled for November, there would be time for the quantitative adaptation of the health system concerning the expansion of beds, in addition to the adequate dimensioning of health professionals.Although the scientific basis for health interventions is robust, there are other ethical and economic considerations involved. Equally important, political leaders need to maintain policies of quarantine and social detachment without any bias regarding any population group 19 . These interventions can represent risks of income reduction and even job loss for many families, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. Therefore, policies to reduce these risks must be implemented urgently 20 .The COVID-19 pandemic has become a threat to the general population and health workers worldwide in particular, and despite this, knowledge about the new virus remains limited. On the other hand, effective treatment options, as well as the development of a vaccine, are still being studied [21] [22] [23] . Therefore, the aggressive implementation of infection control measures is essential to prevent the spread of the virus through human-to-human transmission.There is likely to be an influence of multiple indirect effects of interventions and changes in human behavior, which are difficult to quantify. With this model, it was not possible to infer the most appropriate times to implement each intervention, nor how for how long they should be carried out for the adequate reach of long-term epidemic control to be explored. This work does not deal directly with spatial diffusion nor consider the heterogeneity in the contact matrix. Furthermore, the data provided could be out of date due to the delay in delivery by the health departments and false-negative results. The voidness of the data could as well be due to the reduced availability of tests that applied in general, exclusively to symptomatic patients, which correspond to a lower than the actual number of infected.Regarding current data, this study may assist the authorities in making decisions and implementing public policies in the short and medium-term in mitigating the virus among the population, and in the planning to create new beds for the treatment of the infected, whenever necessary.With the COVID-19 biomathematical transmission model, used in the State of Sergipe, Brazil, it was possible to project its epidemic growth throughout the second half of 2020. From the estimates made, it is possible to contemplate, in different scenarios, the dimension of the impact of interventions on the size of the epidemic outbreak. Specifically, the use of lockdown is the control intervention with the most exceptional capacity to mitigate the spread of the virus, drastically reducing the number of cases, perhaps deaths, in the population.We thank the researcher Dr. Laécio Carvalho de Barros, for his contributions to the mathematical model used, as well as his excellent and constant contributions to the area of Biomathematics.

The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial","the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.COVID-19 is a multi-systemic and multi-factorial syndrome caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its exact mechanisms of action are still largely unclear, and despite the massive number of infections and deaths, effective approaches before it becomes severe lack (1) (2) (3) (4) .One of the most likely reasons to explain why we have failed to detect effective approaches is that while we are searching for molecules with antiviral activity, we are detecting COVID-19 too late, when viral infectivity no longer plays a key role in the pathophysiology at that stage, which will naturally lead to lack of efficacy from these antiviral approaches.While we have focused the vast majority of the researches on patients after they acute lung injury and hospitalized patients, a relative shortage of researches in actual earlier stages of COVID-19, in comparison to the relevance of trying to discover effective approaches for secondary prevention, i.e., preventions of COVID-19 complications after its detection. Meanwhile. number of researches that allege to have researched in mild patients actually included hospitalized patients only, which is inherently contradictoryBecause of the large pre-symptomatic period, asymptomatic infected subjects, prolonged incubation and viral shedding period, and unrevealed means of transmission, viral spreading remains, despite all unprecedented public policies.(since anosmia and ageusia tend to appear after three a five days only), highly heterogeneous clinical presentation, and lack of good predictors of those who will further develop acute lung injury are still challenges to detect COVID-19 during the period when therapies focusing on antiviral activity may still be effective (6) (7) (8) (9) .An additional challenge to be overcome it the persistence of policies focusing on the sine-quo-non presence of fever or shortness of breath to perform the diagnostic realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (10,11). While these two symptoms should not be considered as signs for the presence of COVID-19, but for severe COVID-19 instead, we will fail to diagnose COVID-19 when complications are potentially avoidable. The reports on the literature claiming that fever is present in the majority of patients with COVID-19 are based on data collected from registers that require fever to diagnose COVID-19, which is per se a limitation for a more accurate description of COVID-19 manifestations. Reports based on diagnostic tools for COVID-19 that do not require fever show that fever may be present in as low as 10% of infected patients only (12) (13) (14) .Several different molecules demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and have been proposed as promising therapies for COVID-19 (13) , among which the most attempted drug combinations included azithromycin in the majority of the cases, in association with hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin or nitazoxanide (13, 14) . However, since detection of COVID-19 is predominantly delayed due the mandatory presence of fever for its suspect, antiviral approaches will be less effective, since at this stage of the disease viral infectivity becomes less central. Accordingly, randomized clinical trials (RCT) on alleged early COVID-19 yielded conflicting results, although the majority have been exclusively performed in hospitalized patients (10-14).We have concluded that pharmacological therapies for truly early and mild COVID-19 has not been investigated thoroughly, which precludes from conclusive findings regarding the efficacy of antiviral approaches at this stage. To evaluate potential antiviral therapies, it is critical to detect COVID-19 during the first days after its appearance, which is only feasible with more sensitive approaches its diagnosis.Although underreported, risks for acute lung injury, thrombosis and other clinical complications in COVID-19 are also related to increased exposure, enhanced activity, and/or hypersensitivity to androgens (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Overrepresentation of males in terms of complications related to COVID-19 are not fully justified by differences in age, body mass index (BMI), prevalence of comorbidities, i.e., there is an inherent risk related to male sex (15) (16) (17) (18) . This is likely explained, at least partially, by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS-2), a critical protein for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells, that are largely and solely regulated by androgens. Among males, androgenetic alopecia (AGA) as an independent predictor of complications related to COVID-19, possibly due to a resultant of overexpression of androgen receptors (AR), due to enhanced dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, activity, response, or a combination between these factors, that discloses AGA as a clinical phenotype expression.While females are underrepresented among severe COVID-19 patients, risk factors including menopause, aging, uncompensated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and obesity seem to enhance the risk of severe COVID-19 in females more than in males. In addition, in an analogically similar manner than AGA males, females with any expression of hyperandrogenism (HA), including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21alphahydroxylase or 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency, female AGA, or idiopathic HA, have sufficient mechanistical plausibility to support the hypothesis that this population may be at higher risk compared to non-HA females.In this regard, the use of antiandrogens has demonstrated promising results, as already observed for both males and females, at least when used chronically (19) (20) (21) (22) . This reinforces the role of the role of antiandrogen approaches as an additional path to improve outcomes in COVID-19. Nonetheless, similarly to the use of antiviral therapies, antiandrogens should be tested during the first stage, as it affects viral infectivity.There were sufficient theoretical, mechanistical, observational and epidemiological observations to intuitively hypothesize that if the lack of sensitivity is to detectCOVID-19 is addressed and therefore diagnosed during the first stage, preferably before seven days of symptoms, antiviral pharmacological attempts could be then effective. At this point, it is uncertain whether this approach would be affective, which is our objective.Together, the evaluation of sex differences, as well as differences between phenotypes within each sex, would also disclose additional information for promising approaches for specific populations.The objectives of the present study are to perform a thorough and comprehensive clinical characterization of patients with COVID-19 detected through a highly sensitive case-detection basis, and to explore the clinical responses and outcomes to a variety of drug combinations. In addition, we aimed to detect sex-specific and androgenic phenotype-specific clinical manifestations and outcomes. This is an open-label prospective observational study performed alongside with our currently ongoing RCT This specific study is an open label prospective observational study of the characterization and clinical outcomes of females with COVID-19 in response to specific therapeutic combinations. In order to detect cases during the earliest stages of COVID-19, we employed a highly sensitive case-detection criteria for suspect for COVID-19. We changed from the mandatory presence of severity or specific signs (shortness of breath, fever, anosmia, ageusia) to the occurrence of absolutely any atypical symptom or changes in patters of chronic symptoms, even when not supposedly related to COVID-19.After characterization, drug combination including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days, with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day for three days was then provided. The choice between hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, and/or ivermectin was based on an almost-random manner, i.e., randomly, except when clinical judgement considered otherwise. In addition, spironolactone, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, apibaxan, rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, and glucocorticoids could have been prescribed, also according to medical judgement.Patients were then evaluated for: 1. Time-to-appearance and duration of each symptom (number of days); 2. Time until full remission of symptoms, not including anosmia and ageusia (number of days); 3. Time until full remission of symptoms, including anosmia and ageusia (number of days); 4. Duration of positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (in number of days, where rtPCR was performed every seven days); 5. Level of clinical improvement in Days -7 to -4, -3 to -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 days, where 0 corresponds to the worst day of symptoms (scored according to the number and severity of symptoms) and 100 means asymptomatic or entirely recovered; 6. Ability to perform everyday activities in Days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 30 (0 = no loss of capacity and 100 = complete inability to perform any self-care or everyday activity); 7. WHO COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale; 8. Brescia COVID-19 score; 9. Disease progression outcomes, including hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death. Full raw data is available at a data repository (https://osf.io/cm4f8/).Hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone, ramelteon) Selective serotonin reuptaker inhibitors (SSRIs) (fluoxetine, (des)venlafaxine, sertraline, (es)citalopram, vortioxetine, fluvoxamine) Other antidepressants and humor stabilizers (bupropion, topiramate, trazodone, ami-ou nortriptiline, topiramate, oxcarbamazepine) Benzodiazepines (Lora-, broma-, dia-, clonazepam; alpra-, midazolam) Atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, aripiprazole) Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (methylfenidate, lisdexamfetamine, modafinil)In total, 270 females confirmed for COVID-19 were included. Of these, 195, 67, and eight were from the non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups. The dropout rate for clinical characterization and disease outcomes was zero.COVID-19 has shown the following sequence of symptoms, in a chronological order: 1. Earlier symptoms (< 2.0 days from the first symptom; in days): 4.7 ± 2.5), hyporexia (4.8 ± 2.8), and conjunctival hyperemia (4.9 ± 2.6); and those with prolonged duration (> 5 days), including dry cough (5.4 ± 3.5) ""sore throat"" (5.5 ± 1.9), headache (5.7 ± 3.5), ""sinusitis"" (6.0 ± 2.6), dry eyes (6.2 ± 2.1), ageusia (7.0 ± 5.7), dry mouth (7.0 ± 0.0), fatigue (7.2 ± 4.9) and anosmia (7.9 ± 6.2).None of the patients presents as Scores 3 to 5 throughout the disease.Researches have largely focused approaches for stages two and three, while assumed that none of proposed therapies for earlier stages would be effective ('wait and see'). Culturally, unlike bacterial infections, specific antiviral treatments tend to be avoided. Except for chronic and relapsing viruses, antivirals have been studied at an irregular basis, and their clinical use have long been avoided. Moreover, drugs for other diseases that might disclose direct or indirect antiviral activity have been underestimated.More important than the culture of non-viral treatment that surrounds the medical field, is that the lack of specific symptoms and the usual presence of uncommon clinical presentations, that likely precluded the majority of the patients from an actual early diagnosis.The change in the paradigm for detection of COVID-19 towards more sensitive and active search for COVID-19 may have driven the better outcomes observed in the present study. We consider imperative that policies for COVID-19 diagnosis changeThe patient with COVID-19: characterization of the patients and the disease Baseline characteristics were significantly different between non-HA and HA probably because HA females tend to be shorter and present higher BMI. The differences between age is understandable when one considers that the phenotypical expression of HA tends to occur earlier in lifetime. Furthermore, recognition of female HA (except for dramatic cases, as beard females) has only occurred in the last decades, and was underdiagnosed until short time ago.In a similar manner of what has been observed in males, symptoms in females could be easily clustered (23-26). At least two symptoms of each cluster were together within a same patient in more than 80% of patients. The clusters of anosmia-ageusia predominance, dengue fever-like, URTI-like, and GI infection-like clinical presentation have been detected, in addition to those with unspecific symptoms, or with more than one cluster. The remarkable URTI-like clinical symptoms among HA females may be due to enhanced infectivity that has been shown to occur under hyperandrogenic states.The similar number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin and the lack of major differences at least in terms of COVID-19 complications shows that the choice for a specific medication to be added to azithromycin is not imperative. Also, although preliminary hypotheses and data demonstrating the important role of azithromycin as an adjuvant therapy against SARS-CoV-2, whether this drug plays an add-on benefit effect is uncertain, and remains unanswered, since we did not compare with versus without its use.Correspondingly, additional drugs and supplements were given according to an individualized clinical evaluation, and were used in similar percentages between groups.The use of anticoagulant, specially Xa factor inhibitors and enoxaparin, were based on the risk for thrombosis and development of other complications, since COVID-19 is a pro-thrombotic state per se. Vitamin D, and at slightly lesser extent, zinc and vitamin C, were prescribed to the majority of treated patients. Hence, whether these additional prescriptions helped to improve outcomes cannot be concluded from the present study.Unlike HA-spiro, since time-to-treat and treatment options were similar between non-HA and HA females, obesity prevalence was similar, and HA were younger than non-HA, prolonged clinical and viral duration among HA females may only be explained by the hyperandrogenism.Although spironolactone users had more asymptomatic presentation than other groups, when HA-spiro patients presented symptoms, these symptoms presented similar time-to-appearance and duration than non-HA females. The great majority of the symptoms occurred in similar percentages and presented similar durations for all groups.Increased fatigue, dry cough and anosmia, and increased and prolonged weakness, myalgia and ageusia found in HA females should also be explained by hyperandrogenism, in an analogical manner than male AGA (5, 6, 14, 16, 17) , due to enhanced expression of TMPRSS-2.Differences in disease course were more evident between Days 0 and 7 in HA females, as this population presented slower speed of improvement compared to other groups, as evidenced by three methods to quantify this speed (Tables 11 to 13 ), which means that HA females were shown to improve, but took longer than other groups.Despite the slower symptom regression in HA, all groups showed increased recovery rate after initiation of any of the proposed therapies.The importance of measuring loss of capacity to perform everyday activities lays on the fact that infected patients remain isolated for approximately 14 days, and needs to be able to perform the basic hygiene and self-care activities during this period. Although HA females were more compromised than non-HA and HA-spiro females, even this group was only slightly affected, and lasted for less than three days.Criteria employed to measure COVID-19 severity, ilike WHO COVID Scale and Brescia Respiratory Scale, revealed to be inaccurate in the present analysis, since none of the patients progressed to respiratory complications, hospitalization, and other outcomes.Instead, more sensitive scales were better to detect differences.Oppositely to non-spironolactone HA females, HA that use spironolactone had markedly better clinical outcomes related to COVID-19. Additionally, the small number of patients with COVID-19 taking spironolactone may reflect its potential preventive effect, despite the lack of any other data to support this hypothesis. Spironolactone has been proposed to exert multiple beneficial roles in COVID-19, including increase of circulating-to-attached angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ratio, increased angiotensin receptor (AT) 2-to-AT1 ratio, decreased TMPRSS2 activity, as well as antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities (20) (21) (22) , and its promising roles have been reinforced by the present analysis.As a prospective observational study conducted prior to a double-blind placebocontrol RCT, aiming to better determine the selection process and parameters to be evaluated, as well as define the most plausible pharmacological approach between hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, or none. As per the study deisgn, the lack of a placebo group initially hampers from conclusive findings. However, this has been overcome by the evident differences when compared to the well-established COVID-19 course and outcomes, which disallows us from performing the RCT as a full placebocontrol.The replication of a highly sensitive case-detection guidance that include the occurrence of absolutely any symptom as being suspected for COVID-19 may find barriers that may preclude from a successful approach, including: 1. Lack of general and medical education regarding the unspecific pattern of COVID-19 clinical presentation; 2.Since COVID-19 is an extensive, diffuse, and largely unclarified disease, a thorough medical evaluation that encompasses questions for all organs and systems should be performed at a regular basis, in clinical practice, not only restricted to researching purposes.The early detection associated with any drug combination among azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin yielded notable improvements in terms of course of COVID-19, when compared to literature.Among females, presenting HA may be an additional risk for COVID-19 severity, as they presented to be slightly more affected and had a prolonged recovery process when compared to non-HA and spironolactone users. The chronic use of spironolactone in a daily dose 100mg or more in HA females not only seemed to mitigate, but also reduce risks to below those found in non-HA. This has shown to have similar relative risks when compared to the presence of AGA and use of dutasteride among males, respectively.A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with a drug combination between azithromycin in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide or ivermectin demonstrated unequivocal differences when compared to the extensively described natural disease course when pharmacological treatments potentially effective for COVID-19 is not provided, particularly if detected until three days after the beginning of symptoms.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-06",10

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 spread globally and affected several sectors, including those related to medicine, economics, and politics, among others (Cutler, 2020; Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . COVID-19 has already affected over 200 countries, resulting in more than 30.6 million cases and 950 thousand deaths worldwide as of September 21, 2020 (WHO, 2020 . In Brazil, the first official case was registered on February 26, 2020, and more than 4,490,000 confirmed cases and 135,000 deaths had been registered across the country as of September 21, 2020 (WHO, 2020).Belo Horizonte is the capital of Minas Gerais State, one of Brazil's most populous metropolitan regions (6 million inhabitants). The city recorded 39,379 confirmed cases and 1,168 deaths due to COVID-19 as of September 21 (Secretaria Municipal de Saúde, Recent studies have identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on different surfaces and environments inside hospitals, revealing the dynamics of viral dissemination within these places Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on different types of surfaces, such as metal and plastic, for up to 72 hours, depending on the type of surface material, and can remain infectious in aerosols for at least 3 hours (Van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Assessing the presence of the virus in the environment, objects, and surfaces in public areas is fundamental for understanding the risk of infection in the population. In addition, any information gained can be used by health managers to control population movements in these areas, as well as implement environmental disinfection measures.We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a downtown area of Belo Horizonte between April and June 2020, in a total of nine days. Belo Horizonte's climate is classified as tropical with a dry season, with moderately hot and humid summers and dry and pleasant winters. The temperature is mild throughout the year, with averages ranging from 19°C to 24°C, with the annual compensated average of 22°C and 1430 mm is the average annual rainfall (INMET, 2020) . All samples were collected between 14:00 pm and 17:00 pm. Temperature was between 20ºC to 25ºC (average temperature 22ºC) and relative humidity varying between 36% to 83% transportation and transportation facilities daily. A total of 933 samples were collected from eight different categories of places (Supplementary table 1) , including: a) 38 health care units (hospitals, medical centers, and emergency care units); b) 17 public squares; c) two public parks; d) one public market; e) six bus terminals; f) one shopping mall; g) 10 education centers (universities and schools); 8) 21 other public places, including banks, government departments, among others (Supplementary table 1).Samples were collected from different sources including entrance doors, handrails, benches and tables, bus stops, and ground, and from distinct materials, including concrete, metal, rock, brickwork, and others. For the collection of environmental samples, swabs with sterile phosphate-buffered saline were vigorously rubbed on surfaces (10 cm 2 ) of the aforementioned local and objects. The swabs were then transferred to tubes containing transport solution (1 mL of guanidine isothiocyanate buffer, 4 M) and taken directly to the laboratory for testing. A total of 49 samples (5.25%) were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Table 1 and ranging from 32 to 37.5 (N1) and 34.4 to 39 (N2). We also detected SARS-CoV-2 in different bus terminals in the city, being seven positive samples (14.3%) with Ct values ranging from 29 to 34.7 (N1) and 30.5 to 38.5 (N2). All of these samples were collected at entrance handrails of the bus terminals (Table 1) . Finally, we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration in one sample collected in the wall of the major public market of the city (N1 Ct = 36.9; N2 Ct = 39.6), and four samples collected at bus stops [floor (1) and benches (3)] in front of public banks (2), sport club (1), and a government department (1), with Ct values ranging from 34.7 to 38.1 (N1) and 37.8 to 39.5 (N2) ( Table 1 and Supplementary table 1) . After RNA quantification, we observed that most positive samples had very low viral amount (≤1 genomic unit/cm²), and the higher viral load were detected in samples collected from health care units (Table 1) Table 1 ). Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one sample from a wood bench located in a public square, and one sample from a glass surface in a bus stop in front of a hospital ( Figure 2B and Figure 3 ).Although we sought to detect the presence of viral RNA, not infectious particles, it is possible that infectious particles were present in these environments, and care must be taken to avoid further contamination and the eventual collapse of the local health system. The infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 virions to start a productive infection in humans is still unclear, and also if infectious particles can be recovered from surfaces (Carraturo et al., 2020; Chia et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020) . Chin and coworkers observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in smooth surfaces from distinct materials, including metal and plastic, up to 4 days at 22ºC and humidity around 65% (Chin et al., 2020). Therefore, it is possible that infectious particles could also be recovered from the surfaces found positive for the virus RNA in this study, especially considering that around 40% of the positive samples identified in this study had Ct values below 34. Although the real infectious potential of viruses detected in this study cannot be established, we believe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular assays indicates the potential risk of infection, and care must be taken to avoid further increases in the number of COVID-19 cases. It is important to mention that most of the positive samples in our study had very low amount of RNA (≤1 genomic unit/cm²) and such amount of virus might not be able to trigger COVID-19 in patients. Nevertheless, the viral RNA in different surfaces was detected in our assays, despite the low concentration, and care must be taken to avoid possible infection.Although Belo Horizonte has relatively few cases when compared with other cities in Brazil, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, our data reinforce that the virus is circulating in the city and can be found on surfaces such as benches, tables, handrails, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and floors, and in places with a large flow of people, such as public squares and hospital entrances. The detection of the viral RNA at these sites indicates that adequate cleaning of public environments and reinforcement of educational campaigns for hygienic and social distancing practices should be undertaken. Given the short sampling period in this study, our data do not support a correlation between different environmental parameters, such as local temperature or humidity, and the detection of the virus. Nevertheless, other studies addressed this matter and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for up to 7 days at 22ºC, precisely the average temperature in the days we made the sampling for virus detection for this study (Chin et al., 2020) . Furthermore, in our work, a mean of 54 % of humidity was observed, and another human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, was more stable at 50 % of humidity, a similar humidity value (Kampf et al., 2020) . These data support the indication that viable viruses could be recovered from places where we detected the viral RNA. Further studies may contribute to elucidate better how frequent we can isolate SARS-CoV-2 from inanimate surfaces in the field.It is important to notice that the transmission of the virus in buses seems to be considerably high, as demonstrated in China, where in a bus with 68 individuals, one person in a 100 minutes trip disseminated the virus to another 23 passengers (Shen et al., 2020) . Although we did not evaluate the presence of the virus inside the buses of our city, the detection in the bus terminals and stations is an indicative that those places are an important risk factor for people to get infected, not only inside the buses.

(1) However, in 2003 and 2012, respectively, the emergence of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) (3) revealed that this virus group may also cause severe respiratory illness in humans. In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus, member of the β coronavirus family, has been identified as the source of a pneumonia outbreak (4) and this novel virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). (5) In Brazil, the four endemic CoVs circulate annually (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) and the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was reported on February 26, 2020 (https://covid.saude. gov.br) when SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a 61-year-old male traveller from Lombardia region, Italy, that returned to the São Paulo city, Brazil. Until the first reported case in Brazil, also the first in South American region, (12) there were 81,109 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 38 countries. After these first reported patient, cases in Brazil started to rise reaching 3,846,153 infected persons and 120,462 deaths on August 29 (https://covid.saude.gov.br).Isolation and propagation of new viruses in vitro represents an essential step and may generate important primary tools in early outbreak characterisation. In that way, isolation of the virus presently disseminating in Brazil will provide important information regarding diversity and molecular evolution of the pathogen, but also supply reference material in the struggle to control the rampant spreading of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in the country. Indeed, the availability of infective particles as well as inactivated genetic material as reference reagents are extremely necessary for the preparation of positive controls in molecular diagnosis, development of vaccine formulations, detection of neutralising antibodies, screening of antiviral compounds and for different basic research projects both for public health reference laboratories and the research community.In this study, we describe the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from the first two patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease in Brazil. We describe its genomic sequence (SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA) and in vitro replication characteristics. Virus stocks (infectious particles and lysates) were set available and distributed to the research community.Ethics declarations -All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. This work was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research with Humans from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil (permission number 74683917.1.0000.5467). All specimens were handled under the Laboratory biosafety guidance required for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (13) at BLS3 facilities at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo.Clinical specimen collection -Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were collected from symptomatic patients who had acquired COVID-19 during travels to northwest of Italy (Lombardia region) and returned to the São Paulo city in late February. These patients were treated in the same hospital and were the two first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the São Paulo city. The specimens were collected on day 2-4 post-symptom onset, placed in 1-2 mL of saline medium and used for molecular diagnosis and virus isolation.Nucleic acid extraction and real-time RT-qPCR for virus detection -In order to perform the identification of SARS-CoV-2, the extraction of total nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) from the collected samples (200 µL of initial material) were carried out using the semi-automated NucliSENS ® easyMag ® platform (bioMérieux, Lyon, France), following the manufacturer's' instructions. All specimens were handled under the laboratory biosafety guidance required for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO (13) at BLS3 facilities at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo. The de-tection of viral RNA was carried out using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Waltham, USA) on an ABI 7500 SDS real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), using a published protocol and sequence of primers and probe for E gene. (14) RNA copies/mL was quantified by real-time RT-qPCR using a specific in vitro-transcribed RNA quantification standard, kindly granted by Christian Drosten, Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany, as described previously. (2) Virus isolation -We used Vero E6 cells for isolation and initial passages. We cultured Vero E6 in Dulbecco minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Vitrocell Embriolife, Campinas, Brazil).We used NP swab specimen for virus isolation. For isolation and first passage, we sow cells in a 25 cm 2 cell culture flask in a concentration of 5 × 10 5 cells/mL. After 24 h, we removed the culture medium, washed three times with FBS free-DMEM and inoculated aliquots (500 μL) of the clinical specimens into the flask. After 1 h of incubation (adsorption), we completed the volume for 5 mL with DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS and 1% of penicillin-streptomycin. We grew the inoculated cultures in a humidified 37°C incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and observed for cytopathic effects (CPE) daily up to 72 h. Supernatant was collected daily, and virus replication was confirmed through CPE, gene detection and electron microscopy.Virus titration -Median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 /mL) -Vero E6 and CCL-81 cells were seeded into 96-well plate (5 × 10 4 cells/mL), 24 h before the experiment. Virus was 10-fold serially diluted in medium (10 -1 to 10 -12 ). Medium was removed from plates, virus dilutions applied in sextuplicate and incubated at 37°C. Visualisations were performed daily in an inverted light microscope (Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss Oberkochen) to observe the CPE. After 72 h, the last reading was performed, and the monolayers were fixed and stained with Naphthol Blue Black (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Deisenhofen, Germany) dissolved in sodium acetate-acid acetic. The viral titre was expressed in TCID 50 /mL and calculated using the Spearman & Kärber algorithm, as described by Hierholzer & Killington. (15) Plaque forming units (PFU/mL) -Virus titration was carried out in 24 wells plates seeded with Vero E6 and CCL-81 cells at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 cells/well. After 24 h and a cell confluence of 80-90%, dilutions 10 -1 to 10 -10 in DMEM 2.5% FBS of the virus was transferred in duplicate (100 µL/well) to the seeded plates. After 1 h adsorption at 37 o C 5% CO 2 , the wells were completed with an overlay of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with DMEM, 2% FBS and 1% of penicillin-streptomycin, and plates incubated at 37 o C in 5% CO 2 and stained with Naphtol Blue Black dissolved in sodium acetate-acid acetic. Plates were observed and stained from 48 to 96 h post-inoculation (h.p.i.). Both virus titration (TCID 50 / mL and PFU/mL) were made after the third passage of the isolated virus (T2).Samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon filmcoated copper grids (400 Mesh, CF400-Cu, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were washed with ultrapure water treated with DEPC and negatively stained with uranyl acetate 2% (w/v) with blotting on filter paper after each step. A FEI Tecnai G20 200 kV transmission electron microscope (Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo) was used for image acquisition.Virus growth kinetics in different cell lines -Three Vero cell lines (E6, CCL-81 and hSLAM) plus a human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells, at concentration of 5 × 10 4 cells/mL, were tested for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 by inoculation at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02. The culture medium consisted of DMEM supplemented with 2.5% of FBS. Aliquots of cell-associated and supernatants compartments were collected every 12 h up to 96 h.p.i. for virus quantification via TCID 50 / mL and RNA copy number quantification by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The assay was conducted in triplicate, reproduced in two independent experiments and expressed by standard error of the mean (SEM). Graphics and SEM were done using GraphPad Prism software version 8.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).Next generation sequencing of viral full-length genome -We extracted total nucleic acid from the NP and oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples and cell supernatants isolates with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The purification and concentration steps were carried out with RNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) with DNAse I treatment during the concentration process. Depletion of human ribosomal RNA was performed with the concentrated RNA product using the QIAseq Fast Select RNA Removal kit (QIAGEN). Finally, the RNA samples were submitted to random amplification following the methodology described in Greninger et al. (16) with few modifications.The preparation of sequencing libraries for the Illumina platform was carried out with the Nextera XT Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and multiplex testing, using the random two-step PCR amplification product as input, followed the kit's standard instructions. The libraries were quantified after fluorescence measuring with the Qubit instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and loaded on the NextSeq 550 equipment (Illumina) for sequencing with MID 300 pairedend reads (Illumina).Sequencing analysis -The sequencing data was analysed by a flow of bioinformatics analysis (pipeline) developed at Albert Einstein Hospital. In summary, raw sequencing data was subjected to sequence quality controls, removal of human contaminants by aligning against the HG19 reference genome, taxonomic identification of other pathogens and genome recovery through manual curing. Quality control was performed using cutadapt (17) to filter sequences by length (< 50 bp), average quality (Q p < 20) and trim options to remove low quality ends (9 bp to 5' end and 5 bp to 3' end). Passed QC reads were mapped to HG19 human reference genome using bwa (18) mem with default parameters. Not mapped reads were submitted to assembly using SPADES 1.13. (19) Contigs were inspected and manually curated using Geneious 2020.1 to generate a final assembly. Complete genome was compared to SARS-CoV-2 reference and close isolates by multiple sequence alignment. Final genome was deposited in GenBank (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).The preparation of VIS and VLS stocks was performed as described above for virus isolation. Clinical specimen collection -Patient 1 (HIAE01), a 61-years-old male patient, and patient 2 (HIAE02), a 32-years-old male patient, had returned from northwest of Italy (Lombardy region) and presented respiratory symptoms including cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever, myalgia and headache. Patient 1 was initially diagnosed with a community-acquired pneumonia and received antimicrobial therapy. Both were confirmed for COVID-19 by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), in the São Paulo city on February 26 (HIAE01) and 28 (HIAE02), 2020. A summary of clinical characteristics of the patients is described in Table. Lombardy is considered the centre of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy (20) and has a high influence of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 introduced in Brazil. (21) Virus isolation -Before isolation in cell cultures, we tested the samples using a one-step multiplex RT-qPCR for the detection of 18 additional different respiratory viruses (22) and tested for bacterial contamination using Fluid Thioglycolate Medium (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA). No other pathogens were detected.The positive NP were inoculated on Vero E6 cells. The initial sample collected from HIAE01 was freezed and thawed before inoculation and no virus propagation was obtained. A second sample, from the same patient, was obtained ""fresh"" (conserved at 4ºC for no longer than 12 h) and we could successfully isolate SARS-CoV-2. Sample from HIAE02 was inoculated ""fresh"" from the first moment. The failure to isolate the virus from the first sample collected from HIAE01 may be attributed to a lower virus load and to the freeze-thaw cycle before cell culture inoculation. The schematic timeline of procedures is presented at Fig. 1 .Three days post infection, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from HIAE02 was confirmed by RT-qPCR, electron microscopy and whole genome sequencing (Fig. 1) . The cycle threshold (Ct) value and genome copy numbers (RNA copies/mL) of the pre-inoculated sample was Ct 17.49 and 8.46 × 10 6 (Fig. 2A) . RNA quantification of passages 2 and 3 after 72 h.p.i. gave values of 10.12 -1.19 × 10 9 copies/mL and 9.22 -2.18 × 10 9 copies/mL, respectively. Since virus isolation from HIAE02 (SARS.CoV2/SP02.2020.HIAE.Br) was faster, all the subsequent studies were carried out with this isolate after passage 3. Virus isolation (passage 0) from HIAE01 (SARS.CoV2/SP01.2020.HIAE.Br) was confirmed by RT-qPCR (Ct 15.02 -4.4 × 10 7 copies/mL) and whole genome sequencing, being stored at -80ºC.Negative staining transmission electron microscopy of the SARS.CoV2/SP02.2020.HIAE.Br, here after referred as SP02/BRA, permitted the observation of coronavirus-specific morphological structure, being possible to visualise the protein components of the viral envelope. The virus particle size ranged from 80 to 100 nm (Fig. 2B ).The CPEs were characteristic of SARS-CoV-2: cell rounding, detachment of the cell monolayer and formation of loose cells on the surface, for both Vero E6 and CCL-81 cells and similar to previously observed effects. (23) (24) (25) (26) Nonetheless, the CPEs were more evident in CCL-81 cells. The virus isolate was titrated after two blind passages following isolation (T2) and the CPEs were more clearly observed in CCL-81 cells for TCID 50 /mL (2.11 × 10 6 ) and PFUs (1.5 × 10 6 ). For PFUs titration, effects were not clear for Vero E6 cells, and for Vero CCL81, only a few small plaques were visible at 72 h.p.i., being much larger and more visible at 96 h.p.i. (Supplementary data, Fig. 1 ). Hartcourt et al. (23) described effects more visible for Vero E6 cells when compared to CCL-81. Other successful SARS-CoV-2 isolation reports were based on Vero E6, Vero CCL-81 and Vero hSLAM (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) showing that the three cell lines are permissive for SARS-COV-2.Virus growth kinetics in different cell lines -We examined SARS-CoV-2 growth kinetics in three Vero cell lines (E6, CCL-81 and hSLAM) and compared with HEp-2 cells. All cells were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate (SP02/BRA) and cultured under similar conditions. Virus titre quantification analysis of cell-associated and supernatants compartments indicated that similar levels of infectious SARS-CoV-2 were produced in all three Vero cell lines of Vero, but not in HEp-2 cells, that proved to be not permissive to virus replication. The peak of viral titre was detected 48 h.p.i. (10 7 TCID 50 /mL) after an initial eclipse phase. CPEs was not observed until 48 h.p.i. and reached a peak at 72 h.p.i. (Supplementary data, Fig. 2 ). Quantification of ribonucleic acid copy number (RNA cn ) indicated that virus was released into the supernatant with similar kinetics for all three tested Vero cell lines, with virus yielding slightly higher values on 72 h.p.i. (Fig.  3B) . RNAcp:TCID 50 ratios did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) among the tested Vero cell lines (Fig. 3C ). In addition, these cell lines appeared to release few noninfectious particles at early time points of the infection. The RNAcp:TCID 50 ratios appeared to increase discreetly over time, suggesting an increase in the release of noninfectious virus at later time points or an increase in virus particle degradation over time (perhaps as a consequence of cell culture proteases). Virus RNA was not detected in the cell-associated fraction and cell cultures supernatants of HEp-2 cells (Fig. 3A , B). Any clear-characteristic CPE of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in HEp-2 cells (Supplementary data, Fig.  2) . Similarly to other studies with SARS-CoV (28, 29) and SARS-CoV-2, (23, 26) our findings demonstrated that the three tested Vero cell lines release infectious virus particles and viral RNA copies at the same kinetics and efficient egress.Whole genome sequencing -Whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) and INMI 1/ITA (MT066156) were compared with SP02/ BRA directly isolated from patient's sample (MT126808) and after cultivation in Vero cells (MT350282) using MAFFT multiple aligner tool (algorithm = auto and PAM = 1). Alignment shows only two mutations at the cultivated strain (> 99.993% similarity). Mutations occurred at the nsp2 and spike proteins (Fig. 4) .Distribution network -Until March 20, 2020, the sending of the material comprised 31 different research groups, in public and particular university/hospitals, at 10 different states in Brazil (Fig. 5) . The inactivated virus (VLS) was distributed according of request from the laboratories to testing clinical samples by RT-qPCR, using the VLS as positive controls, which was important, considering the difficulties -availability and price -to import synthetic RNA in Brazil. The criteria for distributing live virus (VIS) was based in the capacity of BSL3 facilities from the host institutions, experience of the principal investigator and the analysis of priority for development of vaccine, drug discovery and virus neutralisation diagnosis. This initiative is crucial to improve the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of methods and strategies for virus treatment and prevention. SARS- CoV-2 isolates were set available to the scientific community by different groups in other countries. (23, 27) The first delivery to the research community at the São Paulo state was set on March 13. The virus distribution by the Brazilian Mail Company was first set on March 18, 2020 and, in less than 13 h, the biological material was delivered to Rio de Janeiro (222.26 miles away from the São Paulo city), the state of Minas Gerais (304.28 miles) and the state of Rio Grande do Sul (815.94 km). Virus samples were sent following technical and biosafety requirements, in accordance with ANVISA recommendations.In conclusion, in this work, we describe the successful isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from the first diagnosed patients in Brazil. The virus was propagated in Vero cell lines and replication features, CPE and growth kinetics were described. The experimental protocols described herein can be used for future attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 in different places in the world. The produced virus stocks were distributed to different research groups and hospitals in the country and are being used as a reference in diagnostic tests and for research, aiming the screening of antivirus drugs, testing the efficacy of vaccine formulations under experimental conditions. The VLS are been used as controls for molecular diagnosis and studies, eliminating the need of imported material in the first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedent and the collaborative work is crucial to the efforts to understand and control the virus spread in the country.Data availability -The complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA from de clinical sample and SARS-CoV-2/human/BRA/ SP02cc/2020 from cell culture isolation have been deposited in the GenBank (accession MT126808 and MT350282, respectively). The version described in this paper is the first version.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-23",10

In 1988, NO was related to soft tissue relaxation in the penis, allowing the organ to become engorged. Eight years later, Viagra came to the U.S. market (Gur et al., 2017) .Due to its small size, neutral charge, and relative lipophilicity, NO diffusion through cell membranes is facilitated even in the absence of channels or receptors (Dioguardi, 2011) . NO action relie s on certain main mechanisms, such as impairment of pathogen replication, interference in the electron transport chain, promotion of Snitrosation reactions in cysteine residues of important pathogen enzymes, and generation of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species (NO x ) (Liu et al., 2017; Seabra et al., 2016) . Moreover, NO quickly reacts with superoxide (O 2 • -), leading to highly toxic and oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO -) (Pacher et al., 2008) .NO has been widely studied for combating tumor cells, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses (Rolim et al., 2019; Santiago-Olivares et al., 2019; Schairer et al., 2012) .Inhaled treatments of gaseous NO have been proposed as an efficient route for administering the gas, but systemic administration is also possible using NO donors, which are molecules able to release NO in the biological medium, and/or by allying NO and NO donors with nanomaterials (Quinn et al., 2015) . The use of NO donors and nanomaterials increases the stability of NO and enables targeted, controlled NO release at desirable concentrations, which is fundamental for NO bioactivity (Quinn et al., 2015) . There are several combinations of NO and/or NO donors with nanoparticles, which can be designed for specific applications (Seabra and Durán, 2017) .There are important recent review articles based on the potential use of NO to combat COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections (Adusumilli et al., 2020;  J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Hedenstierna et al., 2020; Martel et al., 2020) . To the best of our knowledge, these review articles are mainly focused on the administration of gaseous NO (inhaled NO), on discussion of the pathogenesis of viral infections, and on inflammatory responses modulated by NO in vivo. The present review focuses not only on the use of inhaled NO but also on the administration of NO donors in combination with nanomaterials. NOreleasing nanomaterials have been extensively studied in different biomedical applications, including their antimicrobial effects. Due to the versatility of nanomaterials, NO donors allied to a nanoplatform might be important application in the fight against COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections, and we hope that this review will open the way to new studies in this area.The antimicrobial properties of NO usually rely on antifungal and antibacterial effects, although it is well-known that NO not only presents antiviral activity, but also acts to modulate host response (Akaike and Maeda, 2000) . NO has already been reported as a potential candidate for the treatment against coronaviruses and other respiratory viral diseases, such as influenza (Arabi et al., 2015; Keyaerts et al., 2004; Murphy et al., 1998) . Figure 1 shows an overview of NO antiviral activity previously reported against different viral diseases (Akaike and Maeda, 2000; Åkerström et al., 2005; Arabi et al., 2015; Lin et al., 1997) .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f To date, seven coronavirus strains have been identified: HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Kiyuka et al., 2018; Sanchez-Nadales et al., 2020) . Of these, NO has been used against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. More recently, it has been extensively evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 (Arabi et al., 2015; Keyaerts et al., 2004; Sanchez-Nadales et al., 2020; Tavazzi et al., 2020) . Few reports demonstrate the use of NO against MERS-CoV (Al-Dorzi et al., 2016; Arabi et al., 2015) and this topic should be further explored. Inhaled NO treatment was administered in combination with traditional therapies, such as antibiotics, to a hypertense male patient who tested positive for MERS-CoV (Arabi et al., 2015) . Treatments allied to inhaled NO demonstrated positive results, and the patient was discharged to his home 21 days from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the beginning of NO treatment (Arabi et al., 2015) . Moreover, inhaled NO was administered for MERS-CoV in infected healthcare workers and the results also demonstrated that the patients were successfully healed, evidencing that NO might have positive effects in the treatment with low harmful side effects (Al-Dorzi et al., 2016) .More recently, inhaled NO treatment was also employed in a 22-year old immunocompromised patient who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 (Sanchez-Nadales et al., 2020). The authors have hypothesized that NO might have played a pivotal role in the treatment, related to the loss of alveolar perfusion and the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction effect (Sanchez-Nadales et al., 2020) . Taken together, these reports suggest beneficial effects of administration of NO in patients, and further studies are required.In addition to the few publications reporting NO trials in the treatment of coronaviruses, this molecule has already been evaluated against other respiratory viral diseases, such as influenza A/H1N1 (Avnon et al., 2015; Kovačević et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 1998) . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, NO was used in combination with mechanical ventilation in 67% of the patients under experimental trial, particularly patients with thrombotic complications. In general, authors indicated that critically ill patients were administered deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in combination with other treatments, such as inhaled NO (Avnon et al., 2015) . Interestingly, considering that NO is an endogenous signaling molecule, it has also been reported that serum NO levels are higher in patients that survived acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by H1N1, in comparison with non survivors, as well as an increase of oral NO levels after 21-days of virus incubation; this offers a strong association of NO levels with improved clinical outcomes (Avnon et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 1998) . NO can react with important biomolecules controlling physiological and pathophysiological functions. Indeed, NO J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f can nitrosate thiol groups on the surface of red blood cells and the beta chain of hemoglobin, preventing hemolysis and oxidative damage (Zhang et al., 2015) . Previous studies have suggested the potential beneficial effects of NO, opening new areas in this research topic.Although positive biological effects have been reported for the administration of NO donors, further studies are required to better evaluate the levels of inflammatory mediators and the activity of important heme-containing enzymes, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), directly involved in the inflammatory responses in respiratory viral infections (Anderson and Russel, 2020) . During virus infection, a significant increase in the levels of inflammatory mediators can be observed, known as a ""cytokine storm"", associated with endothelial and platelet activation; this can lead to vascular permeability, thrombocytopenia, shock (observed in severe cases), pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia (Belladonna and Orabona, 2020). IDO and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are expressed upon monocyte activation. It has been reported that NO generated by iNOS inhibited the SARS CoV replication cycle (Åkerström et al., 2005) . Interferon-gamma, a molecule with antiviral activity and a regulator of inflammatory responses to pathogens, is a potent inducer of IDO and iNOS (Kang et al., 2018) , in addition to other inflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) and interleukins 6 and 1β (Turski et al., 2020) . For instance, both these enzymes were highly expressed in monocytes of patients infected with dengue virus (DENV-4), compared to healthy controls, during an epidemic in Campo Grande (MS, Brazil) (Fialho et al., 2017) . Inflammatory processes and cytokines stimulate iNOS, which in turn enhance NO production against virus infection. IDO, induced by inflammation or immune responses, participates in tryptophan catabolism and can be induced by IFN- in monocytes, displaying immunosuppressive and antimicrobial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f activities (Mellor and Munn, 2004; Hara et al., 2008) . IDO enzymatic activity helps to control pulmonary inflammation and hypertension, allowing immunoregulation in COVID-19 patients (Belladonna and Orabona, 2020) . It should be noted that IDO activity can be either suppressed by NO or induced by NOS inhibition (Hara et al., 2008) . IDO is a cytosolic immune-modulatory enzyme containing heme iron for which NO has a high affinity, thus endogenous NO and NO donors can inactivate this enzyme (Thomas et al., 1994) . Some papers reported that blockage of IDO activity might enhance antiviral IFN-I/II (interferon type I/II) innate and adaptive T-cell responses in Japanese encephalitis (Kim et al., 2016) and respiratory viral infections (van Wissen et al., 2002) . As IDO and NO have been implicated in T cell immune tolerance (Ye et al., 2017) , the effects of NO donors on IDO and on cytokine production should be further investigated.NO inhaled treatment against COVID has already been proposed in 2020 in two different countries, China and United States of America Gianni et al., 2020a; Lei et al., 2020) . The motivation comes from the historical use of NO-based treatment against SARS-CoV, and also against other respiratory diseases caused by viruses. After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, three different studies demonstrated the potential of NO compounds in the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (Åkerström et al., 2005; Åkerström et al., 2009; Keyaerts et al., 2004) . In a study that overviewed therapeutic strategies available in 2008 for SARS-CoV treatment, NO was highlighted as a potential drug already available and used on infected humans, while NO donors were reported as promising drugs undergoing pre-clinical trials (Wong and Yuen, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2008). In vitro studies performed with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) indicated that NO was able to inhibit the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in a concentration-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the same experiment showed that viral protein and RNA synthesis were also hindered (Åkerström et al., 2009) . Years later, indepth studies of the same research group into the mechanism of NO against SARS-CoV evidenced that the intermediate peroxynitrite was not responsible for the replication cycle inhibition; the authors demonstrated that the antivirus mechanism relied on two major points: (i) interference in the fusion of S protein and its receptor due to reduced palmitoylation of the S protein, and (ii) a reduction in RNA production, probably due to an effect on cysteine proteases (Åkerström et al., 2005) . A similar pattern was reported by Keyaerts and coworkers, evidencing an IC 50 of SNAP against SARS-CoV of 222.3 ± 83.7 µM, and no activity for the non-nitrosated molecule, confirming that the effect relie s on NO release (Keyaerts et al., 2004) . Moreover, NO produced from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) has also demonstrated the ability to inhibit the replication cycle of SARS-CoV (Åkerström et al., 2009 ).Thus, the protocols published to date against SARS-CoV-2 rely on the efficient results previously demonstrated. Three different strategies were proposed to comprehend the treatment under different conditions, using a randomized experiment evolving 2 centers: Boston and Xi'an Gianni et al., 2020a; Lei et al., 2020) . Firstly, NO application in severely ill patients is proposed in two different conditions: (i) high doses of gaseous NO, up to 180 ppm, during short periods of time (20-30 min), and (ii) low doses of gaseous NO, up to 80 ppm, during 48 h-treatment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Lei et al., 2020) . Interestingly, a second protocol proposed inhaled NO to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Gianni et al., 2020a) . The individuals concerned will receive a maximum of 160 ppm of inhaled NO for a short period of time during 14 days. It is expected that the number of healthcare providers contaminated will decrease from 15% to 5% (Gianni et al., 2020a) . The three strategies proposed have different parameters for the treatment period, concentration and people involved; they promise to increase knowledge about the use of NO against COVID-19 in both treatment and prevention. Although a promising strategy, the inhalation of gaseous NO is not the only possible treatment and/or prevention against COVID-19 or future viral diseases.Interestingly, the same authors that first proposed the use of inhaled NO developed a system for high dose NO inhalation, minimizing NO concentration oscillations and the inhalation of NO 2 , which might have a promising application in this field (Gianni et al., 2020b) (Fig. 2) . (Ferrari et al., 2020) . The dose evaluated was 20 ppm for 30 minutes, in patients already treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (Ferrari et al., 2020) .Although NO acts by improving arterial oxygenation, the same pattern was not observed in all patients, especially those with severe hypoxemia. This highlights the fact that even though NO presents promising use in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, further studies must be performed to understand which patients might benefit (Ferrari et al., 2020) . Interestingly, a similar trial employing inhaled NO at a concentration of 25 ppm led to complementary results (Tavazzi et al., 2020) . The treatment did not improve oxygenation in patients with refractory hypoxemia, although promising results were confirmed for patients with right ventricular dysfunction (Tavazzi et al., 2020) .A different pattern was observed in spontaneously breathing patients. Parikh and coworkers evaluated the potential of inhaled NO treatment in breathing patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (Parikh et al., 2020) . Thirty-nine patients with different characteristics, with or without pre-existent diseases, received a dosage of 30 ppm of NO for 2 days. Of all the patients treated with inhaled NO, 53.9% did not require mechanical ventilation and the SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio also improved in those patients (Parikh et al., 2020) . This suggests that NO might not only prevent hypoxic respiratory failure, but also contribute an antiviral mechanism (Parikh et al., 2020) . A higher dose of NO (200 ppm/30 minutes) was evaluated in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 (Safaee Fakhr et al., 2020) . In this trial, six pregnant women received 39 treatments with inhaled NO after hospitalization with COVID-19 with hypoxic respiratory failure.NO treatment in high dosages was shown to be well tolerated, and evidenced an improvement in the cardiopulmonary system (Safaee Fakhr et al., 2020) . All six pregnant patients subjected to NO treatment were discharged from hospital, and half of them had already delivered healthy neonates (Safaee Fakhr et al., 2020) . A singlepatient trial evaluated home treatment with inhaled NO, differing from previous reports J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Zamanian et al., 2020) . Low doses of 20 ppm were administered 12-14 h per day for 11 days with a nasal canula, remotely monitored (Zamanian et al., 2020) . Positive results were observed, opening venues for further trials employing inhaled NO at home as an alternative to hospital treatments (Zamanian et al., 2020) .In the war against COVID-19, NO may not only have a potent antiviral activity but also improve ventilation perfusion in the lungs. In other words, NO demonstrates potential for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 both in severe and nonsevere conditions, improving oxygenation and antiviral mechanisms, and preventing aggravation of the disease (Ferrari et al., 2020; Parikh et al., 2020) . Patients with coronaviruses are susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis (Chen et al., 2004) . Inhalation of NO gas enhanced arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chen et al., 2004) .Indeed, NO gas is approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neonates in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, and recently it has been authorized for use as rescue treatment in patients with hypoxic COVID-19 symptoms (Gebistorf et al., 2016) . Moreover, NO is synthesized endogenously in the blood vessels, regulating blood pressure and thus avoiding clot formation and destroying potential toxins (Ignarro, 1999) .Even though NO has demonstrated important results in the treatment of COVID-19, some authors emphasize that further studies are necessary to better understand which patients will benefit most from inhaled NO treatment. A similar pattern has been previously demonstrated in adults and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which treatment with inhaled NO led to a transient improvement in oxygenation, but did not alter the mortality rate in critically ill patients (Gebistorf et al., 2016) . Moreover, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f it was observed that NO administration might impair the kidney function of the patients treated (Gebistorf et al., 2016) .The data presented in this review are fundamental for revealing promising parameters for further trials employing NO treatment against COVID-19 and/or other respiratory diseases, in order to confirm NO potential, target patients and safe dosages.It should be noted that NO is a free radical, and its stability is improved by the use of NO donors; these fall into different classes depending on the molecule, e.g. organic nitrates, S-nitrosothiols, metal complexes and N-diazeniumdiolates (Wang et al., 2002) .Besides inhaled NO directed for pulmonary treatments, FDA has already approved the use of a few NO donors, such as Nitropress (Opasich et al., 2009) . More recently, it has been demonstrated that the combination of NO donors with nanoplatforms has been an important approach, which can even improve the antimicrobial properties of NO (Douglass et al., 2019) . Recent works have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of NO donors allied to metal or metal/oxide nanoparticles, such as copper (CuNPs), silver (AgNPs), and polymeric nanoparticles. A composite based on SNAP and CuNPs enabled a tunable release of NO from SNAP, through catalyzation with CuNPs (Pant et al., 2017) . NO release was adjusted through the concentration of CuNPs, which promoted a NO flux 6 times higher at the concentration of 5% when compared to free SNAP after 3 and 24 h evaluation. The combination of NO and nanoparticles promoted enhanced antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) andPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). The growth of these strains treated only with SNAP were 3.5 ± 1.3 × 10 4 and 1.8 ± 1.3 × 10 4 respectively, while the values deceased J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significantly when combined with 3% of CuNPs, reaching 8.9 ± 1.8 × 10 2 and 2.4 ± 1.8 × 10 2 respectively (Pant et al., 2017) . A similar pattern was observed for the combination of NO and AgNPs, in which the synergistic effect led to a notable inhibition of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Interestingly, a recent work reported that silver nanoparticle inhalation (3-7 nm) could be effective in early stage COVID treatment (Zachar, 2020) . In the same work, the authors indicate that the minimal inhibitory concentration (10 μg mL -1 ) was achievable in the lower airways, but could be an effective initial method for the upper airways to suppress progression of the infection.Therefore, its combination with NO could be a supplementary therapy for infectious respiratory diseases that should be addressed in future studies. On the other hand, the encapsulation of NO donors in polymeric nanoparticles is a promising alternative. The encapsulation of AgNPs and S-nitroso-mercaptosuccinic acid (S-nitroso-MSA) in alginate nanoparticles promoted sustained release of NO and a potent antibacterial effect against S. aureus, E. coli and Staphylococcus mutans with low cytotoxicity to non-tumoral cells (Urzedo et al., 2020) . The effectiveness of this strategy is not limited to antibacterial applications: the encapsulation of NO donors in chitosan nanoparticles demonstrated important results against leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease (Cabral et al., 2019) . These nanoparticles efficiently inactivated Leishmania (L.) amazonensis promastigotes while no toxic effects were observed in macrophages.More studies are required to better investigate how endogenous NO (produced by NOS) and exogenous NO, from a donor, might be related. It has been demonstrated that both sources of NO (endogenous and exogenous) can have antiviral activity (Åkerström et al., 2005 ). An important advantage of nanotechnology is the ability to design a nanocarrier for sustained, localized drug release (in this case, NO release) for pulmonary application (Cavalcanti and Nogueira, 2020; Lammers et al., 2020) . In other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f words, nanomaterials can be prepared for pulmonary delivery of NO/NO donors, depending on nanoparticle size, chemical structure, chemical surface and charge.Versatile nanocarriers can be designed to deliver therapeutic amounts of NO direct to the desired application site, i.e. the site of the viral infection. Chitosan nanoparticles have been explored for pulmonary delivery of active drugs due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, and their mucoadhesive and non-immunogenic properties (Islam and Ferro 2016; Cavalcanti and Nogueira, 2020; Tatlow et al., 2020) .Thus, important effects that have already been observed for NO against SARS-CoV; these could be improved by combination with nanomaterials, promoting sustained, localized release of NO in therapeutic concentrations (Keyaerts et al., 2004) .NO allied to nanomaterials might thus find important applications against coronaviruses, including in the treatment of COVID-19.Although several drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19, further studies are still required to better elucidate their efficacy, tolerability and side effects (Magro, 2020) . In this war against COVID-19, the use of NO/NO donors might find important medical application. There is still little progress on the antiviral effect of NO, especially against coronaviruses. The three protocols proposed against COVID should significantly contribute to this area, and possibly evidence a promising alternative treatment for the current pandemic. The antiviral effects of NO should be further explored. Interestingly, it has been reported that ambient ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality, independent of vitamin D (Cherrie et al., 2020). UVA triggers generation of NO from NO stores in the skin; this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f is released into the blood circulation, increasing the bioavailability of NO and reducing blood pressure (Weller et al., 2020) .Finally, we would like to encourage investment in promising advances in NO allied with nanomaterials; this treatment has already shown important results in the area of nanomedicine, but is still undeveloped in the field of viral infections, that are of huge importance not only during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but also for the treatment of future viral diseases that may arise. Definitely, NO is bad news for COVID-19.The authors declare no competing interest.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-18",10

Los autores no lograron confirmar los beneficios con el uso de HCQ o CQ administradas solas o en combinación con macrólidos. Los regímenes farmacológicos descritos se asociaron con una disminución de la supervivencia hospitalaria y una mayor frecuencia de arritmias ventriculares. demostrar que su uso fuera efectivo para prevenir la infección ni la enfermedad por SARS-CoV-2 en individuos sanos expuestos a casos con PCR positiva. 31 Cuando se comprobó que la ivermectina era segura y eficaz, MSD en conjunto con la Organización Por eso pese a que la ivermectina posee grandes ventajas, aún faltan ensayos clínicos y otros estudios que demuestren su utilidad.Los andrógenos juegan un papel importante en la homeostasis metabólica y la salud reproductiva de hombres y mujeres, teniendo efectos fisiológicos importantes en la piel. A su vez, pueden J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contribuir al desarrollo de ciertas enfermedades cutáneas, como el acné, la alopecia androgenética, el hirsutismo y la hidradenitis supurativa, entre otras. 44Algunos fármacos con acción antiandrogénica son: el acetato de ciproterona, la espironolactona, el dutasteride, el finasteride y la flutamida.El desarrollo farmacológico comenzó en 1962 con los antiandrógenos esteroideos: el acetato de ciproterona, el acetato de clormadinona, el acetato de megestrol y el dienogest.La flutamida fue el primer antiandrógeno no esteroideo aprobado por la FDA para el cáncer de próstata. Este medicamento de primera clase todavía forma la base estructural de otros antiandrógenos no esteroideos, como la enzalutamida y la apalutamida. 45, 46 En 1970 Dorfmann definió los antiandrógenos como sustancias que impiden la expresión de la actividad del andrógeno en el efector.La relación entre la COVID-19 y los andrógenos podría ser explicada por el mecanismo de entrada del SARS-CoV-2 a las células huésped. La serina proteasa transmembrana 2 (TMPRSS2 por sus siglas en inglés) y el receptor ECA II son factores críticos para la entrada del SARS-CoV-2 a las células humanas y los andrógenos se relacionan con la actividad de ambos. A pesar de que existen otras proteasas involucradas, TMPRSS2 es de particular interés, ya que es un gen regulado por andrógenos, previamente estudiado por su asociación con el cáncer de próstata. 46-50 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fNumerosos estudios han demostrado que las complicaciones y casos más graves por SARS-CoV-2 son más frecuentes en la población masculina, presentando a su vez mayor mortalidad, no es claro si lo anterior es debido a factores biológicos, hábitos o diferencias en las tasas de comorbilidad. 51Esto ha impulsado a la comunidad científica a encontrar el factor que predispone a los hombres a cuadros más graves. Algunos investigadores comparten la teoría de un efecto crucial de los andrógenos en la severidad de la COVID-19, observando que aquellos pacientes masculinos que presentaban un fenotipo hiperandrogénico presentaban mayor carga viral, diseminación de SARS-CoV-2 y severidad del compromiso pulmonar. Lo anterior muy probablemente se relaciona con el mecanismo de acción descrito previamente. 48 Goren et al. (Marzo 2020) realizaron un estudio sobre la prevalencia de alopecia androgénica (AGA) en pacientes hospitalizados por la COVID-19 en España. Contaron con 41 pacientes masculinos, 29de estos (71%) fueron diagnosticados con AGA significativa. 52 Tras esta observación preliminar y dar a conocer ciertas limitaciones en su estudio, los autores se plantean realizar un ensayo clínico para determinar si existe una correlación. 52 Montopoli et al. (Abril 2020) observaron que aquellos pacientes con cáncer de próstata en terapia de deprivación androgénica (ADT por sus siglas en inglés) presentaban un riesgo significativamente más bajo de infección por SARS-CoV-2 en comparación con aquellos pacientes que no recibieron ADT (OR 4.05; IC 95% 1.55-10.59). Una diferencia aún mayor se encontró al comparar pacientes con cáncer de próstata en tratamiento con ADT con aquellos con cualquier otro tipo de cáncer (OR 4.86;IC 95% 1.88-12.56). Los autores finalmente concluyen que los pacientes con cáncer de próstata en tratamiento con ADT estarían parcialmente protegidos de la infección por SARS-CoV-2. 53Page 13 of 31 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Un estudio realizado en células cardiacas derivadas de células madre embrionarias humanas destaca la capacidad de los inhibidores de la 5 alfa-reductasa para reducir los niveles de ACE2 y, por lo tanto, disminuir la internalización viral. 47 Actualmente siguen en curso ensayos clínicos que evalúan la acción de los antiandrógenos y la terapia hormonal en la COVID-19. 54,55La melatonina es un derivado del aminoácido triptófano. Es el principal producto neuroendocrino de la glándula pineal. Poco tiempo atrás era considerada exclusivamente una hormona reguladora del ritmo circadiano y los biorritmos estacionales. Hoy sabemos que lo anterior sólo corresponde a la ''punta del iceberg'', ya que posee propiedades antiinflamatorias, antioxidantes, inmunomoduladoras, termorreguladoras y antitumorales, entre otras y pese a que su uso es limitado actualmente en la dermatología, presenta un potencial prometedor. 56-58Para conocer la historia de la melatonina, es necesario conocer a su descubridor: Aaron Lerner, quien fue un dermatólogo de renombre internacional: fundador y presidente del departamento de dermatología de Yale. Recibió numerosos premios y reconocimientos por su investigación dermatológica, pero sobretodo es reconocido ser el descubridor de la melatonina.Lerner siempre mostró interés por la pigmentación cutánea y escribió un artículo con ThomasFitzpatrick, donde describen la bioquímica de la formación de la melanina y la pigmentación. 59 Page 14 of 31 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f trabajo fue publicado en la revista Physiological Reviews, y estableció a ambos como expertos mundiales en el tema.Realizó un estudio en pacientes con enfermedad de Addison, buscando el factor pituitario responsable de la hiperpigmentación característica de esta patología, descubriendo con sus compañeros la hormona estimuladora de melanocitos. En 1964 Marczynski demostró que la melatonina es un promotor del sueño. 63Inicialmente la COVID-19 genera un deterioro de la respuesta inmune del huésped. El SARS-CoV-2 logra evadir la respuesta inmune innata e induce la apoptosis y disminución de los linfocitos T.Posteriormente la replicación viral acelerada conlleva a muerte celular, daño endotelial y vascular.Lo anterior genera una liberación masiva de citoquinas inflamatorias, también llamada ''tormenta de citoquinas'', que recluta y activa células inmunes no infectadas, generando una respuesta inflamatoria sistémica excesiva con gran repercusión pulmonar. 64Si bien la melatonina no es un fármaco viricida, se ha postulado como útil para reducir los efectos Dentro de los efectos antiinflamatorios de la melatonina destaca la capacidad de bloquear al factor de transcripción nuclear NF-κB, el cual fomenta la inflamación mediante la producción de citoquinas inflamatorias que promueven la exacerbación y mantención de la inflamación sistémica en la COVID-La melatonina ha demostrado reducir los niveles de IL-6 en pacientes con diabetes mellitus tipo 2 con periodontitis crónica y pacientes con esclerosis múltiple, entre otras patologías. 75-77 La IL-6 no solo es un mediador importante en la tormenta de citoquinas, sino que sus niveles se han correlacionado estrechamente con la gravedad y el resultado del síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo, junto con la carga viral de SARS-CoV-2 en sangre, por lo que su disminución podría beneficiar a los pacientes que cursan la fase hiperinmune de la COVID-19. 78 El estado proinflamatorio de la COVID-19 produce un exceso de especies reactivas de oxígenos (ERO) y radicales libres (RL) que resultan dañinos para el organismo. La melatonina interactúa directamente con las ERO, actuando como una especie de ''scavenger'' de RL. Además promueve la expresión de enzimas con acción antioxidante y reduce la de aquellas que aumentan el estrés oxidativo. Recientemente se propuso su uso en conjunto con la vitamina D con la que tendría un poderoso efecto sinérgico. 85 La melatonina es un fármaco económico y seguro con efectos potencialmente beneficiosos en la COVID-19. Actualmente existen 2 ensayos clínicos sobre el uso de melatonina en la COVID-19. El primero pretende evaluar la eficacia de la melatonina en la profilaxis de la COVID-19 en trabajadores de la salud y el segundo estudia la eficacia y seguridad de la melatonina intravenosa en pacientes con COVID-19 ingresados a unidad de cuidados intensivos. 86,87Para finalizar, es importante recordar que existen muchos otros candidatos potenciales para combatir la COVID-19. En esta revisión nos enfocamos en aquellos de uso frecuente en dermatología. Vemos cómo estos fármacos, muy distintos entre sí, con vías y acciones sin relación aparente, podrían ser útiles.

This drove many research groups to better understand the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and pathology to offer new insights for treatments and development of new therapies. Besides a lot of the patients have a good prognosis there are still some individuals that evolve to severe disease and even death [2] . Death seems to be related with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure (MOF) as a consequence of the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) which was detected in several critical patients with COVID-19 [3, 4] . Zhou and colleagues showed that IL-6 and inflammation are increased in critical patients with COVID-19[5]. The higher levels of IL-6 seems fundamental to the disease aggravation and development of ARDS and MOF [6] . Hence, drugs that can control inflammation and IL-6 secretion could be a relevant tool to reduce COVID-19 severity and associated deaths [7, 8] . It was observed that treatment for 10 days with the steroid anti-inflammatory dexamethasone was able to reduce death in patients with severe condiction [8] . However it is well know that glucocorticoids have many side effects[9] including the immunosuppressive action that could potentially lead to increase of plasma viral load. It is well described that many anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) protein witch act by activation of formyl peptide receptors (FPR) family [10]. The anti-inflammatory effects of ANXA1 can be mimic by it N-terminal domain with 26 amino acid termed Ac2-26 peptide [11] . Herein is presented the many effects of Ac2-26 peptide that support the use of it to treat severe COVID-19.During the acute inflammatory response several pro-inflammatory mediators are produced as well the endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators [12, 13] . These anti-inflammatory mediators act regulating the inflammation by reducing cell migration, edema, cytokine production as well promoting inflammatory cells apoptosis [14] . One of the anti-inflammatory mediators is a protein regulated by glucocorticoid named annexin-A1 (ANXA1), [28] . Table 1 summarizes the antiinflammatory effects described for the Ac2-26 peptide.In this moment evidence suggests that host immune response contributes to the severity of COVID-19 as well the higher admissions at intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality [43] [44] [45] . In the severe cases of infected patients it was observed an increased plasma concentration of many pro-inflammatory cytokines as TNF- IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1 characterizing the CSS and the consequent hyperinflammation and MOF [45] . Recent works suggested that drugs as glucocorticoid, anti-IL-6 antibody (Tocilizumab), IL-1 antagonist (Anakinra) could modulate this extreme host reaction resulting in a better prognostic for severe COVID-19 patients [46] . Recently the RECOVERY trial from the Oxford University showed that treatment with 6 mg of dexamethasone for 10 days reduce the mortality of patients with the severe form of COVID-19 [8]. This result was highly associated the presence of lung inflammation. The use of glucocorticoids was previously suggested to others lung infections (e.g. MERS, SARS, severe influenza and community-acquired pneumonia) however the lack of randomized/controlled trials and the heterogeneity of doses or medical conditions discourage it use [47] [48] [49] [50] . Moreover glucocorticoid is not indicated in patients with comorbidities like Cushing syndrome or non-compensate diabetes mellitus [51, 52] . In this way a drug with similar anti-inflammatory profile but lacking the side effects could be a tool to treat these patients.As mentioned above, the ANXA1 derived peptide Ac2-26 share many antiinflammatory effects of the glucocorticoids including the inhibition of several cytokines production (see Table 1 ). These effects were observed in different preclinical models using in vitro and in vivo experiments. The potent inhibitory effect of Ac2-26 over inflammation indicates that the ANXA1-derived peptide could be relevant to reduce the COVID-19 severity and associated deaths. The increased levels of IL-6 and others mediators of inflammation like IL-1, TNF- triggers the so called cytokine storm syndrome which is closely related with the COVID-19 evolution and seems responsible for 28% of the deaths [3, 6] . The cytokine storm promotes an uncontrolled inflammation with directly lung failure and it inflicts multiorgan damage failure, mostly in cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that Ac2-26 peptide was able to reduce inflammation and enrolled mediators in many models where inflammation is relevant and then it was suggested to treat several diseases as allergy, cancer, stroke, sepsis or ischemia [11, 24, 53] . In lungs, Ac2-26 showed protective effects in by reducing inflammation in different conditions [24, 25, 29, 42] suggesting it could have an important paper during COVID-19 treatment. The myocardium damage is also present in patients with severe COVID-19 [54] . In this tissue the Ac2-26 showed a protective effect after ischemia-reperfusion injury [55] . Acute kidney injury rate to 50% of patients in severe COVID-19 being a risk factor for mortality [56] . A work showed that annexin-A1 N-terminal derived-peptide can protect renal tissue against Bothrops moojeni Venom-induced inflammation in rats [32] .Complementary, Ac2-26 showed renal protection against drug-associated inflammation (e.g. tacrolimus or cyclopsporin) or in model of ischemia-reperfusion [57] [58] [59] . Taking together these findings suggest that Ac2-26 could have a relevant protective action on hyperinflammation-driven MOF during COVID-19 and probably reducing severity and death.Other point to mention is that during COVID-16 occurs coagulopathy with increased venous coagulation [60] . Besides there are no evidence of direct action of Ac2-26 on platelet aggregation there are two papers that presented effects of ANXA1 on coagulation. The first work of Kuster and colleagues observed an antiplaque effect of human-recombinant ANXA1 in mice with atherosclerosis [61] . The second described a novel role for ANXA1, the ability to activate anti-thromboinflammatory circuits in cerebral during ischemia-reperfusion [62] .

Both interleukins differentiate M2 macrophages with consequent fibrosis and release growth factors, such as the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) 4, 12 .In the absence of proven effective treatment for COVID-19, current therapy consists of supportive care. Besides, many patients have received off-label medications, including antiretrovirals, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory drugs, and convalescent plasma 13 .In this paper, post-mortem biopsies of COVID-19 patients were compared to patients who died of H1N1pdm09 and the control group to understand the role of IL-14, IL-13, TGF-β, and M2 macrophages recruitment in the cytokine storm and DAD pathogenesis in order to analyze the remodeling phase and its comorbidities.Therefore, we sought to evaluate the histopathological and physiological differences between SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1pdm09, observing cytokine's expression to understand the mechanism leading to COVID-19 from mild to lethal disease as a result of immune dysfunction, thus being a requirement to identify possible treatments for critical disease.Ethical approvals. The presented study was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee (Conselho Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa-CONEP), protocol number 3.944.734/2020, and 2.550.445/2018. The authors confirm that all methods were carried out following relevant guidelines and regulations.Families permitted the post-mortem biopsy of the cases of COVID-19, H1N1pdm09, and CONTROL groups; and signed the informed consent forms.Samples were not obtained from prisoners, and the sample collection followed all relevant ethics and safety protocols.Clinical data were obtained from medical records during hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Hospital Marcelino Champagnat in Curitiba, Brazil (n = 6). Testing for COVID-19 was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs taken during ICU hospitalization, and the performed Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). The viral genome's amplification was performed with the Invitrogen SuperScript™III Platinum ® One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Catalog number: 11732020, Waltham, MA), were positive for SARS-CoV-2.The pandemic H1N1 group consists of lung samples from patients whose cause of death was H1N1pdm09 severe acute respiratory infection (n = 10) during the 2009 pandemic. The patients were tested through the fresh samples of lung post-mortem biopsies, and the performed qRT-PCR (a similar technique to that of the COVID-19 group) was positive for H1N1pdm09.The CONTROL group (n = 11) was composed of necropsy lung samples of patients who died due to cardiovascular and neoplastic disease, not involving lung lesions. The age of the CONTROL group ranged from 18 to 60 years, with mainly male patients, similarly to the pandemic H1N1 and COVID-19 groups.A minimally invasive lung post-mortem biopsy was performed through a left anterior mini-thoracotomy with upper left lobe lingular segment resection. The resected pieces were 3 × 3 cm.Histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. The lung samples provided by post-mortem biopsy were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin-H&E (Harris Hematoxylin: NewProv, Cod. PA203, Pinhais, BR; Eosin: BIOTEC Reagentes Analíticos, Cod. 4371, Pinhais, BR). The immunohistochemistry technique was used to identify the expression of the IL-4, IL-13, TGF-β, and Sphingosine-1 for M2 macrophages scoring ( Table 1) .The replication of the experiment does not apply to the immunohistochemistry technique. The result is confirmed by the positivity of positive control, a sample known to be positive for a specific antibody allocated together with the patient's samples (lung sample with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, skin sample with dermatosis, and hyperplastic lymph node).The IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-beta slides were scanned with Axio Scan.Z1 Scanner (ZEISS, Jena, Germany), and then ZEN Blue Edition (ZEISS, Jena, Germany) utilized to randomly generate the ten high-power fields (HPF = 40X objective). The analysis was blind once the images were randomly generated by the software, with no investigator's interference. The immunopositivity areas were measured by the Image-Pro Plus software version www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Subsequently, these areas were converted into percentages to enable statistical analysis. The Sphingosine-1 slides were also used to highlight M2 macrophages in ten HPF. The images were chosen randomly from the septum and lumen alveolar, where the M2 macrophages were scored using the modified Allred score method. The semiquantitative analysis was obtained by summing two scores (proportion and intensity of positivity), ranging from 0 to 8. The proportion score is subdivided according to the percentage of stained cells: score 0-0% stained cells, score 1-< 1%, score 2-1-10%, score 3-11-33%, score 4-34-66% and score 5-> 66%. While the intensity of positivity is evaluated: negative-score 0, weak-score 1, moderate-score 2, and strong-score 3.The comparison of the quantitative variables of the two groups was performed using the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test. Values of p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics v.20.0 software. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.Clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 (n = 6), H1N1 (n = 10), and CONTROL (n = 11) groups as gender, age, time from hospitalization to death, comorbidities, histopathological patterns, and the tissue expression of IL-4, IL-13, TGF-B, and M2 macrophages score are listed in Table 2 .Tissue expression comparison of IL-4, IL-13, TGF-β, and the macrophages (Sphingosine-1) score of the COVID-19 and H1N1 groups are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 . The COVID-19 group presents statistically significant higher tissue expression of IL-4 compared to H1N1 (p = 0.003) and CONTROL groups (p = 0.05, borderline). The H1N1 group presents a statistically significant higher tissue expression of IL-13 compared to COVID-19 (p = 0.007). No statistically significant differences between COVID-19 and CONTROL groups are shown (p = 0.07). The TGF-β tissue expression did not present statistical significance differences when all three groups were tested (p = 0.51 and p = 0.75, respectively). The M2 macrophages score was statistically significantly higher in the H1N1 group compared to the COVID-19 group (p = 0.05). When the COVID-19 group was compared to the CONTROL group, the former shows M2 macrophages score statistically significantly higher (p = 0.001). Figure 2 demonstrates the lung tissue expression of IL-4, IL-13, and Sphingosine-1 (M2 macrophages) in all the COVID-19 and H1N1 patients. The IL-4 is consistently higher in COVID-19 patients when compared to Regarding the population analyzed, our findings support the literature that shows age as a risk factor and describes comorbidities associated with the severe form of COVID-19 and fatal outcomes [14] [15] [16] . Although we have not found a statistical difference in gender distribution, male patients were prevalent (66.6%) in the COVID-19 group (as well as in the H1N1 group = 80%). The COVID-19 and H1N1pdm09 are different pandemic diseases concerning their demographic risk groups, pathophysiology mechanisms, and coinfection prevalence. Contrary to H1N1pdm09, COVID19 lethality is concentrated in older than 65 years of patients-following long periods of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it is difficult to discard the influence of age, strength and duration of www.nature.com/scientificreports/ mechanical ventilation in the parameters examined in this report [14] [15] [16] . So, it is essential to interpret our findings with caution and validate them in other samples. Concerning the inflammatory biomarkers studied, the COVID-19 group corroborates the Th2 response predominance, given the higher tissue expression of IL-4 of this group compared to H1N1 and CONTROL groups. The higher score of M2 macrophages in the COVID-19 group compared to the CONTROL group may www.nature.com/scientificreports/ suggest that the Th2 response is activated. The clinical finding of lymphopenia may support the M2 pathway Th2 response. Although IL-4 is increased in the COVID-19 group, indicating Th2 response, when assessing IL-13 tissue expression and M2 macrophages score, both were decreased when compared to the H1N1 group (p = 0.007 and p = 0.05, borderline; respectively), suggesting the Th2 proliferative phase was not triggered ( Table 2) .The destruction of epithelial cells in the alveolar space (pneumocytes type I and II) caused by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to macrophages hyperactivation conducting to the cytokines storm. It is suggested that the higher release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) during this initial immune response may suppress T lymphocyte activation, which would explain the presence of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients. A study with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the ICU showed low TCD4 + and TCD8 + lymphocyte scores and the high IL-6 and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) serological levels. Besides, these patients present high levels of PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) that appear to functionally deplete T cells, indicating that the immune system would be tilting abnormally towards Th2 response 9,10,17,18 .Interleukin-4, the main cytokine of the Th2 immune response, plays a critical role in the Th2 pathway as the effector and inducer of this immune mechanism. Both this interleukin and IL-13 are predominantly associated with fibrogenic inflammatory remodeling, while Th1 cells exert anti-fibrotic activity by secreting gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) 19 .Like IL-4, IL-13 actively participates in the Th2 pathway, since both interleukins share the same receptor (IL-4Ra). IL-13 works with IL-4 to induce alternative activation of M2 macrophages (Sphingosine-1), promoting the release of TGF-β and platelet-derived factor. This phase is characterized by the transient expansion of resident fibroblasts and the formation of a temporary matrix and the proliferation of airway progenitor cells and type 2 pneumocytes 9,12,20 .Although IL-4 and IL-13 are closely linked to the remodeling tissue process, it is suggested that asthmatic patients have a lower risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19 because they have increased levels of both interleukins and promote the suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) 21 . Another study that analyzed COVID-19 allergic children and compared them to non-allergic children found no difference between the groups regarding the severity of the disease 22 .When assessing lung tissue expression of TGF-β, there was no significant difference between the groups ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Patients of COVID-19 and H1N1 group have developed DAD with hyaline membranes in the alveoli, which have a strong tendency to organize in 2-4 weeks. Consequently, even if there is a lower lung tissue expression of TGF-β in this samples, the presence of some areas of recent fibrosis in patients with more than two weeks of mechanical ventilations indicate that TGF-β may be participating of the transition from acute to organizing DAD, suggesting remodeling induced by Th2 response. This lower lung tissue expression of TGF-β may also suggest that the proliferative Th2 phase has not been triggered in most patients.Since a significant expression of IL-4 is observed in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and CON-TROL group (p = 0.003 and p = 0.05, borderline) and a lower expression of IL-13 and Sphingosine-1 in this group when compared with H1N1 (p = 0.007 and p = 0.05 respectively), it is suggested that IL-4 may be secreted not only by the Th2 pathway but before it. In some situations, such as extracellular infections, IL-4 is produced by mast cells induced by interleukin 33 (IL-33) and release of immunoglobulin E (IgE) 9 . These cells produce IL-4 independently of the signal transducer and transcription activator 6 (STAT 6), necessary for the differentiation of Th2 cells, which means that they can influence the differentiation of T cells in Th1 and Th2 type responses, being able to modulate the proliferation and production of cytokine in TCD8 + lymphocytes responses 23 . In this work, the IL-4 lung tissue expression was higher in most of the COVID-19 patients since the beginning of the aggravated disease despite the time from hospitalization to death and mechanical ventilation, suggesting that these mechanisms could be considered (Fig. 2) . A study demonstrated a significant increase in mast cells in postmortem biopsies alveolar septa of patients affected by COVID-19. It is suggested that its increased presence is strongly involved in the physiopathology of this disease 24 .Recent SARS-CoV-2 studies report that the modulation of the Th1 response is remarkably reduced, given the low activation of TCD8 + cells, which appears to stimulate the secretion of Th2 cytokines, suppressing Th1/ Th17-mediated inflammation [25] [26] [27] [28] . These findings support the study in question, considering the presence of the Th2 response, in addition to observing little neutrophil recruitment, which demonstrates that the origin of the response inflammatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that found in H1N1pdm09 29 . This tendency of Th1 response in H1N1pdm09 infection is observed in studies that demonstrated a significant serum dosage of IL-10, which would promote an increase in the number of Th1 cells, production of INF-γ, and a decrease in IL-4 levels 30, 31 , besides, to increase of TCD8 + cells in the pulmonary profile in severe cases 32 .Inflammatory cytokines have been the key mediators in the innate immune response and inflammatory reaction in both Middle East Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, patients with MERS-CoV have presented an immune response lacking on Th1 cells and directed towards a Th2 immune response, and studies have related the exacerbated Th2 response to more aggressive forms of its disease 33 .Our study's major limitation was the small number of samples analyzed. It is crucial to note out that the static information of autopsy data cannot reconstruct disease evolution. However, this analysis's strength is the comparison between two pandemic viruses responsible for lung injury but probably using distinct immune mechanisms 34 .Considering the current pandemic scenario caused by SARS-CoV-2, numerous therapies have been proposed as an alternative to prevent the evolution of the disease. Researchers and health service providers strive to find the best therapeutic strategies, but so far, using off-label drugs has been the immediate alternative 35 . In these circumstances, the antiviral against virus RNA, Remdesivir, has been a potential therapy against SARS-CoV-2 without definitive results 36 . Heparin has also been used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and it has Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:18689 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75659-5 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ been actively used since it combats coagulopathies, which are most likely caused by the immune system decompensation when facing COVID-19 37 .Since severe COVID-19 can lead to DAD, which has the potential of developing septal fibrosis, recovering patients may have an impairment of their lung functions, directly affecting their life quality. Considering that it is an irreversible condition, the use of monoclonal antibodies aimed at inhibiting Th2 cytokines could be used as a treatment for COVID-19.Summarizing, although H1N1pdm09 activates the Th2 response, its pathogenesis seems to be strictly linked to the Th1/Th17 responses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 seems to promote lung damage through different mechanisms, such as the scarce participation Th1/Th17 response, and the higher participation of the Th2, when combined, might be inefficient for viral clearance. Thus, the understanding and management of the aggravated and ineffective immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2 merit further clarification.All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.Received: 30 June 2020; Accepted: 14 October 2020","Brazil","first author","2020-10-29",10

OnMarch 21st, 2020, we started a non-governmental web-based application called Juntos Contra o COVID -Together Against COVID in Portuguese, available in juntoscontraocovid.org. After consenting, each participant filled in a form answering questions on current symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. When they completed the form, they had access to a map showing the location of suspected COVID-19 cases. Participants received a weekly email to update their symptom status.The survey had no pre-specified eligibility criteria, ranging from all ages. No symptoms nor prior known contact with the coronavirus was used as an inclusion criteria. Furthermore, no exclusion criteria were predefined. Participants from all over the country were able to contribute in a collaborative fashion. For this study, we presented data collected up to August 29th, 2020.The primary recruitment method was the snowball strategy -where previous participants invite known potential participants to enter the survey. This organic sampling method was All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Two main strategies were used to enhance patient recruitment. The first relied on social media and message platforms. Predetermined messages and images were created to publicize the platform as a free, collaborative and useful tool -where people could navigate through a map and check if their surroundings had suspected COVID-19 cases. This strategy worked as a mainstream method to enhance individuals' access to the web-platform, where they were invited to participate in the research project, sharing their symptoms and health information. The second strategy leaned on publicizing the platform in nationwide news channels. The overall reach of the platform was over 5 million Brazilians.We collected data on self-reported age, gender, COVID- 19 Accordingly, there are three scenarios where a patient is a suspected COVID-19 case: All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.A participant who filled in any of the above rules was defined as a suspected COVID-19case.All data were maintained on an AWS hosted Structured Query Language (SQL) database.Participants were identified by an anonymous hash value created upon form completion. This value was used to track multiple responses from the same user given a pre-established email pattern.We performed a stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases. A Federative unit was used as stratum, the census block as the first stage (primary) sampling unit, and individuals as the second-stage sampling unit. Sampling weights were defined by the inverse of the probability of at least one census block response within each federative unit and the inverse of the probability of the individual response within the respective census block. To account for selection bias from survey responses, sampling weights were adjusted using the general regression method for All rights reserved.

The model performance was checked by comparing the final estimated average age, sex and income levels from the survey analysis with official population data from IBGE Census.From this model, we estimated the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 cases by federative unit and compared them with the reported cases. Finally, we performed a logistic regression model using the same survey-based approach to evaluate the association of income level and number of individuals per household (< 2, 2 to < 3, and 3 and above) with the rates of COVID-19 cases. The analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Supplementary   table 1) . Among participants with suspected COVID-19, the most common symptom was fever (76%) followed by cough (75%), anosmia (40%), ageusia (40%) and dyspnea (38%), and 44% of them reported contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days (Supplemental figure 1). Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the sample, along with data after survey weighting and calibration methods, and the population demographics according to Brazilian census.[11] Compared with Brazilian population, our sample had an over-representation of women between 20 and 60 years old, and an under-representation of individuals younger than 20 years old and older than 80 years old. Moreover, it was over-represented by individuals living in regions with higher income per capita. After weighing and calibration, the All rights reserved.

In this population-based survey, the estimated COVID-19 case rate was 2.75 times higher than it has been reported. Underreporting of COVID-19 varied across states, as reflected by different estimated/reported COVID-19 ratios, and it appears to be higher in states with lower HDI. The rates of COVID-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Similarly, our study found that COVID-19 case rates from self-reported symptoms were 2.75fold higher than the reported cases, with higher estimated/reported ratios in states with lower HDI and lower testing rates. [18] This may imply non-equitable access to testing and diagnosis, but the reasons for under-reporting of COVID-19 are complex and multifactorial, involving both healthcare delivery, cultural aspects and socioeconomic characteristics.We showed a significant association between COVID-19 case rates and socioeconomic factors. Areas with lower income and more people living in the same house were associated with higher rates of COVID-19. Social distancing may be seemingly impossible in small, overcrowded and poorly ventilated houses with a single room, enhancing the transmission of respiratory viruses whenever a family member develops symptoms. [19] [20] [21] Although there is a lack of data on the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in poor communities, a study suggested that a hypothetical pandemic of a new strain of influenza would have greater impact in a lowincome country, such as Papua New Guinea, than in a developed country, mainly due to a larger number of individuals per household. [19] Consistent with this hypothesis, the prevalence of COVID-19 was not associated with income strata and number of individuals per household in the seroprevalence study in Spain. [14] This suggests that the higher transmissibility in crowded households may particularly affect lower-income countries. Policy strategies that address crowded households when an individual is tested positive can be important tactics to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in low-income settings. On the other hand, our data showed that the association between COVID-19 rates and income remained almost unchanged after adjusting for the number of individuals per household, suggesting that other factors play an important role in this association.We found that the COVID-19 case rates were higher, but testing rates were lower, among census blocks with lower average income. This underscores the heterogeneous access to healthcare even when there is universal health coverage. Individuals in the lower income strata, who were at higher risk of COVID-19, were less likely to receive testing and, therefore, All rights reserved.

Despite the concerns on limited access to the internet, we demonstrated that low-cost digital initiatives coupled with effective social engagement can be extremely useful to provide important data on disease activity in a developing country with continental proportions.Our study has limitations that deserve attention. First, we used a web-based application that relies on spontaneous survey responses. Although access to the internet has been reported in 79% of households in Brazil, our sample was under-represented by elderly and lowincome individuals.[30] Appropriate weighing and calibration helped mitigate this limitation, as estimated demographics became similar to census-based population data. Second, most COVID-19 cases were defined by self-reported symptoms and history of contact with a suspected/confirmed case, which may overestimate the number of symptomatic infections and does not account for asymptomatic infections. Nevertheless, this strategy is a feasible approach to evaluate large population-based surveys, particularly in settings with insufficient tests for screening every suspected case, such as most regions in the world during this pandemic.

Hospital das Clinicas is the largest public hospital complex in Latin America. Affiliated to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo academic health system and located in the central area of São Paulo, it comprises eight specialized Institutes (Central, Heart and Pneumology, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, Children, Cancer, Rehabilitation, and Radiology) and has 2400 beds altogether. At this setting, healthcare is provided as part of the national unified public health system framework (Sistema Único de Saúde -SUS), with the specific task of undertaking high complexity care within the hierarchical distribution of responsibilities among health services. Our workforce comprises 20,000 employees, including multi-professional healthcare and support teams.Moreover, being part of an academic health center, Hospital das Clinicas hosts the largest medical residency program in the country, with 1,664 physicians under training in academic programs that cover all nationally-accredited medical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f specialties, as well as 360 senior medical students in hospital internship rotations in 2020.Committee was established at the hospital with the aim of putting together a disaster plan, based on the methodology proposed by the California Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) and consolidated in the Hospital IncidentCommand System (HICS) 7 . The plan can be activated whenever there is a need to respond fast to emergencies or even to non-emergency situations in which healthcare demand is predicted to far exceed our regular provision capacity, conditions fully met by the COVID-19 pandemic.On January 30, 2020, the Crisis Management Committee was therefore activated, approximately one month before the very first COVID-19 case was actually reported in the city of São Paulo. The Committee, run by four medical doctors with large experience in disaster management, developed a strategic Emergency Operational Plan (EOP) to be carried out in four subsequent phases, namely, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, as described in Table 1 .[enter EXHIBIT - Table 1] For its governance, the plan encompasses five major functional areas: command, operation, planning, logistics, and finance/administration, under the responsibility of skilled staff members. Achievable expectations were established for its development, as well as continuous progress assessment using measurable outcomes. It was also necessary to guarantee enough flexibility to allow alternative settlements for a better strategic and tactical A major challenge to the EOP, however, was how to build a minimally safe strategy to allow the academic health system to continue providing urgent/emergency tertiary care and management of relative urgencies for non-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 cases, simultaneously to the compelling need to establish specialized care units for COVID-19 patients in the same hospital building.The best model we could conceive to reconfigure our hospital operation in order to meet the needs of this public health emergency was to physically isolate the Central Institute, an 11-floor building with 900 hospital beds, to become entirely and exclusively designated to COVID-19 care. A similar experience was previously reported by He et al. 8 The COVID-19 epidemic in the city São Paulo is still underway 11 . Even though recent epidemiological reports show a reduction in the incidence of the disease (Figure 1 ), the emergency operation at our hospital is not concluded. In terms of overall results, it should be highlighted that from March 30 to August 30, 2020Throughout the operation, the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 patients in our hospital remained stable, around 30%, which could be considered a very favorable outcome, given the severe disease presented by our hospitalized patients. Among those who required intensive care (50% of cases), 80% needed orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and their mortality rate was 41%.So far, 13% of our 20,000 employees had COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR, whereas 41% of the workforce went on sick leave due to flu-like symptoms in the same period. Interestingly, the rate of infection among HCW was not higher in the COVID-19 designated Institute as compared to the low exposure hospital buildings.In summary, we conclude that upfront organized planning as a preparedness measure can be effective when facing public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, in a middle-income country. Our experience suggests that having a large hospital building physically isolated to provide exclusive care to inpatients with COVID-19 was a remarkably effective measure that helped standardize care provision to a significant number of patients, leading to favorable clinical outcomes.

The amount of available data grows as fast as the epidemic itself, which presents a unique opportunity for policymakers to develop counteract measures. In any case, evidence-based interventions require reliable data.In early June 2020, the Coronavirus panel, which is the primary official platform for monitoring COVID-19 data in Brazil, went offline due to political reasons. The national government suggested arbitrary changes on variable measurements and report standards that were against international epidemiological guidelines. After several days without updates, the system returned without estimates of incidence and mortality, in addition to displaying systematic inconsistencies such as negative cases and measurement error. 2 The Brazilian data blackout got international visibility when John Hopkins University threatened to drop Brazil from the worldwide dataset. One week later, the Federal Supreme Court ruled that the Brazilian Ministry of Health must comply with the World Health Organization standards and disclose full data.In this paper, we employ Newcomb-Benford law (NBL) to evaluate the reliability of COVID-19 data in Brazil. Using official aggregate information, we apply a first digit test for a national dataset of total cases and cumulative deaths.Benford's law, initially proposed by Simon Newcomb, is an amusing example of a mathematical pattern that accurately describes a widely diverse collection of data. 3 Based on frequency counts, NBL postulates that individual digits appear more frequently than others, where 1 is the most common first digit, leading nearly 30% of the time and 9 is the least common, with an expected frequency of less than 5%. Surprisingly, Benford's law fits not only well-known distributions such as the power of 2 and Fibonacci sequence, but also it describes a sizeable broad dataset of natural numbers. In particular, NBL is widely applied as a fraud detection tool in different fields, from tax auditing, banking, quality of survey data, toxic emissions to election outcomes.The following equation gives the probability of digit d occurring as the first significant digit:As the NBL distribution of first digits follows an exponential distribution, it is particularly suited to examine the infectious disease patterns that exhibit increasing changes over time, especially in the early stages of the spread. Using official data from February 25 to September 15, we apply a first digit test for national aggregated records (cases and deaths). To estimate to which extent observed data conform to Benford's law's theoretical expectation, we used the chisquared (χ 2) test of the goodness of fit, which is the most common statistical procedure to assess the null hypothesis. We also examine the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the distortion factor (DF) to get more robust results.The data were analyzed using R Statistical 3.6.3, and all significance tests were two sided. To estimate NBL functions, we used the benford.analysis package developed by Cinelli. 4 All data obtained were from Cota. 5 Replication materials, including raw data and computational scripts, are available on https://osf.io/74xjc/.To make comparisons more precise, we can compute the formal goodness-of-fit tests. The null hypothesis is that the observed data follow the NBL. Therefore, the smaller the P value, the higher our confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis that observed distribution conforms to the NBL theoretical expectations. As Table 1 shows, for both variables we analyze, the χ 2 test leads one to reject the null hypothesis at conventional levels of significance.Similar to Z -statistic, the χ 2 test is highly sensitive to the sample size and tends to reject the null even for small departures from the expected distribution. The MAD test is more robust since it ignores the number of records. The higher the MAD, the larger the average difference between the observed and theoretical distributions. MAD values above 0.015 suggest nonconformity. Following this criterion, we should conclude that Brazilian data are highly discordant to the NBL distribution (see Figs 1 and 2) .Finally, the DF statistic exams the digit patterns to indicate whether the data appear to be underestimated or overestimated and the deformity's magnitude. Table 1 shows that COVID-19 total cases are likely to be underestimated since reports exhibit an excess of lower digits. Under NBL, we expect that mantissa is uniformly distributed with an average of 0.5. Suppose figures are manipulated downward by exclusively altering the mantissa. In that case, the mean observed value will be less than the expected average, which seems to be the case of the COVID-19 Brazilian epidemiological surveillance system.NBL is a well-established statistical tool for detecting suspicious activities in data. The evidence reported here does not constitute proof of illegality, but we have identified consistent departures of Brazilian COVID-19 reports from NBL. Our findings are robust to different empirical tests and data sources, which increases our confidence that the epidemiological surveillance system fails to provide trustful data on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemics in Brazil. Evidence-based policymaking requires valid and reliable information, which depends on institutional mechanisms of transparency and disclosure. Without open data, it is impossible to evaluate the extent to which government interventions affected the outcomes they were designed to change. We are aware of the technical obstacles of measuring a new and complex disease such as COVID-19. However, effective policy policies rely on data quality and availability. We hope to see more sophisticated practices of gathering records by the Brazilian Minister of Health to facilitate data sharing and a more careful analysis of these critical data.

Generally, researchers address their models to the 15 country as a unit or to highly populated areas, mainly big cities and federation states 16 like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro [4, 8, 9] . 17 However, COVID-19 has also impacted other Brazilian regions, such as the North, 18 that is a territory almost entirely covered by the Amazon rain-forest and accounts for 19 almost half of the Brazilian territory. The north has a low population density (4.78 20 inh./km 2 ), accounts for only 8.8% of the Brazilian population, and is responsible for 21 14.3% of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil. It may be represented by infected 22 per population rates: 2.6% in the North, versus 1.5% in the rest of the country [10] . 23 Figure 1 shows the evolution of the infection rate in all five Brazilian regions. 24 ,QIHFWLRQ5DWH Carved into the Amazon rain-forest is Amapá, a northern state of Brazil. Amapá is 25 like an island surrounded by the forest since it displays no land routes with any other 26 Brazilian state (See Fig. 2 ). It has only 830,000 inhabitants but living in an area bigger 27 than England, which is Voc67 times denser. Like other parts of Amazon, Amapá 28 October 5, 2020 2/14 already experiences an excess mortality from infectious diseases, especially among 29 indigenous populations. Despite recent political efforts, many people living in the state 30 still suffers from different social and health problems such as minimal access to clean 31 water and public sanitation [11] . Those and other reasons make Amapá especially 32 susceptible to COVID-19 and other epidemic outbreaks that may occur in the future.By the end of May, Mapacá, the Amapá's capital, saw its health system collapse due to 34 COVID-19. By closing August 2020, the state consolidated the second highest infection 35 rate in Brazil, according to official data [10] . By the end of September 2020, the state 36 also has a low fatality rate (1.29%) when compared to the whole country (3.02%), which 37 may be the result of local attempts to track new cases and avoid under-notifications. Respecting this ambiance, in this paper, we explore and compare traditional and AI 39 forecasting models to support the Amapaense decision-makers in the future decisions to 40 come. The interest variables are the accumulated number of confirmed and death cases. 41 We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA),Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), 43 random trees regressor (RT), seasonal linear regression with change-points (SLiR) and 44 simple logistic regression (SLR), which dictates the baseline performance in this study. 45 We compare the models according to the necessities of local authorities. Thus, we 46 measure the model's effectiveness to forecast the 17 days ahead and how fast they have 47 responded to quick increases and decreases in the number of cases, as well as to periods 48 of stability. This scenarios may repeat in the future, as result of new contamination 49 waves or vaccination, for example. The forecasts are performed to each Amapaense 50 municipality individually and to the state accumulated data, which we paint as our 51 main example.Since the municipalities are in different stages of the COVID-19 spreading, they may 53 also display very different curve growing behaviors. Thus, as a result of this study, we 54 have also created an online application (which can be accessed in 55 http://www.previsor.covid19amapa.com/, that can be used to visualize the data at 56 follow the steps we do, as well as choose the best model to use in different occasions. 58 In this section, we describe our research framework, which we split into: (1.1) data 60 acquisition, (1.2) data splitting, (1.3) fitting and forecasting, and (4) model evaluation. 61 The subsection that follows treats each one of those steps. We performed all modelings to the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Amapá, 64 since the first official case, in March 20 th 2020, up to August 20 th 2020. We gather the 65 data from official reports, from each of the 16 th Amapense municipalities. The collected 66 data is also available in an application programming interface provided by Brasil.io 67 repository [10] . The measurement periods are different for each municipality and Tab. 1 68 summarized the dates of the first and last reports. training set and tried to forecast the next q days. Then, interactively, we added one day 77 to the training set, until it comprised n − q observations. Thus, for a given municipality, 78 we have n − p − q + 1 different cross-validation splittings.Amapense decision-makers. Thus, in the first splitting, the raw data is divided into a 81 proportion of half-and-half between training and testing sets (see Algorithm 1).Each training sample (x) is then standardized (z) by its mean (u) and standard 83 deviation (s), calculated as z = (x − u)/s. We then fit the training datasets to each one the following models: autoregressive running on a daily bases will convert the predicted values before calculating the metrics 99 and comparing them. The models are explained as follows:The ARIMA model stands for integration (I) between autoregressive (AR) and moving 102 average (MA) models. Box and Jerkings [12] are the first designers of this model.ARIMA may also be adjusted to consider seasonality, which optimal value may be found 104 after the conduction of a Canova-Hansen test [13] . The optimum values of 105 autoregressive (p), degree of their differences (d) and moving average (q) may also be 106 found by search-grid. Usually, we select the parameters that minimize the Information 107 Criterion (AIC). Articles such as Benvenuto et al. [14] , Ceylan [15] , and Singh et al. [16] 108 bring examples of ARIMA applications to COVID-19 cases forecasting. The general 109 equations for AR and MA models are [15] :where Y t , ε, φ, and θ are the observed values at time t, the value of the random shock 111 at time t, AR, and MA parameters, respectively. Thus, an ARMA model is given by:Where α is a constant. When dealing with non stationarity, the data may be 113 differenced, and the ARIMA model is then performed. cases [19, 20] . The equations of the additive model follow.Where S is the smoothed observation, L the cycle length, and t a period. The trend 122 factor (b), the seasonal index (I), and the forecast at m steps (F ) are given by: The general logic of an SVR is relatively simple. Suppose a linear regression, which 130 objective is to minimize the sum of square errors.where y i is the target, w i the coefficient and x i the feature. Then, the training of 132 SVR aims to minimize the following system. Random forest is a machine learning algorithm with many decision trees. Breiman [26] 145 proposed a combination of bagging and random subspaces methods. Nowadays, Prophet is a forecasting approach developed by Facebook. It employs a decomposable 156 times series model, with three main model components: trend (g(t)), seasonality (s(t)) 157 and holidays (h(t)). It also assumes an error representing any idiosyncratic changes 158 that are not predicted by the model.with 160 g(t) = (k + a(t) T δ)t + (m + a(t)γ) (15) where k is the growth rate, δ is the rate adjustments, m is the offset parameter, and 161 γ j is set to s j δ j to make the function continuous. Another important aspect is that the 162 model performs automatic changepoint selection, putting a sparse prior on δ.On the other hand, it relies on Fourier series to incorporate daily, weekly, and 164 annually seasonalities. In the case of COVID-19, we are more concerned about weekly 165 seasonality.In the context of COVID-19, Prophet has few appearances in forecasting the 167 accumulated confirmed and death cases [8, 28] . 168 1.4 Model evaluation 169 We evaluate the performance of each forecasting models in terms of R-squared (R 2 ),Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error 171 (SMAPE). We perform the evaluations for each train/test pair created by the rolling 172 forward splitting. Thus, each metric is performed n − p − q + 1 times.where n is the number of observations, y i andŷ i are the i th observed and predicted 174 values. In a general manner, all machine Learning models achieve better results than Logistic 210 regression. In Fig. 6 we can see how Holt-Winters performs in comparison to the other 211 five models. Those findings Notice that we measure rolling forward performances 212 according to the R-Squared given by each cross-validation set.In each pair of models we can observe how the Holt-Winters perform in comparison 214 to an other model and considering the periods we classify as (1) exponential increasing, 215 (2) after sudden daily decreasing and (3) stability of daily new cases.Similar evaluations to the prediction of confirmed cases can be extended to death 217 cases. In this case, Holt-Winters still seems to be the most suitable model, along with 218 ARIMA. Similar considerations can also be draw to the municipalities of Amapá.However, for small cities where data is scarce, most models we present here struggle to 220 make predictions. In this case, even naive approaches seem to be a good alternative. will evolve is critical to local authorities to determine the best responses.Thus, in this paper, we compared classical and machine learning models to forecast 231 the evolution of COVID-19 in the state. Despite the volume of research papers pointing 232 Machine Learning models as those with the best performance for many locations, in the 233 case of Amapá, two classical approaches seem to perform better: Holt-Winters and 234 ARIMA. It may be a consequence of the Amapaense data, which has marked seasonality 235 and sudden variations.

Sun Tzu, The Art of War On December 31, 2019, four cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan (Hubei province) were reported to the Chinese office of the World Health Organization. [1] In record time, on January 12, 2020, Chinese researchers shared the genetic sequence of the etiological agent, [2] the virus that would be called SARS-CoV-2 [3] and caused what came to be known as COVID-19. [4] On February 26, 2020, Brazil's first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in a 61-year-old man who had recently traveled to the Lombardy region of Italy. [5] A day later, the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from this patient was sequenced, a great accomplishment for Brazilian science. [6] The virus has a unique sequence of bases that differs from other species and is genetically different enough from SARS-CoV-1 (genetic similarity of approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (50%) to be considered a new virus.Phylogenetic analyses placed it in the genus Betacoronavirus, within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the Coronaviridae family. [7] The main goal of this narrative, non-systematic review is to provide an update on the genetic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its interactions with the human genome within the context of COVID-19. Although the main focus is on the etiology of this new disease, the genetics of SARS-CoV-2 impacts prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of therapies.The published scientific literature regarding ""Genetics of COVID-19"" was searched in a variety of databases, including MEDLINE, BioRxiv, and SciELO, as well as a manual search on the internet (mainly in 2019 and 2020), to ensure that the majority of relevant studies had been identified. The author called out several keywords (such as ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""genetics,"" ""molecular,"" ""mutation,"" ""vaccine,"" ""Brazil,"" ""Brasil"") so others can identify the work during database searches. The keywords ""Brazil"" and ""Brasil"" were used to find publications that were specific to the Brazilian population's molecular epidemiology data. After the search was complete and all duplicates were thrown out, the author reviewed the abstracts of the remaining articles to ensure that they address our review question. The thirty-seven articles most relevant to the scope were non-systematically selected. The author summarized and synthesized the findings from the articles found and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f integrated them into the writing as appropriate.The genome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2Like other coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a single strand of RNA with a positive strand (ready for translation and consequent synthesis of its proteins). The genome is considered large, with 29,903 base pairs. There are at least 50 different sites where translation can begin (open reading frames -ORFs). These ORFs are each of the RNA sequences understood to include a start codon (AUG), a stop codon (UAG, UAA, or UGA), and the codons between them. This variable origin of transcription sequences allows the SARS-CoV-2 virus to encode for around 50 proteins that have non-structural, structural, and accessory functions. [7, 8] The initial two-thirds of the RNA sequence encode the two main transcriptional units, ORF1a and ORF1ab; these units encode two polyproteins (PP1a and PP1ab, respectively). The larger unit, PP1ab, contains ORFs for at least 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16). The non-structural proteins have various functions in biological phenomena that are important for the virus such as replication, correction of replication errors (""proofreading""), translation, suppression of host proteins, immune response blockage, and RNA stabilization. [8] The final third of the RNA encodes proteins that define the structure of SARS-CoV-2 as well as accessory proteins. Accessory genes are distributed among the genes that encode structural proteins and the 3' end of the genome and contain at least nine ORFs for accessory proteins; these proteins are not significant for viral replication but play an important role in interactions between the virus and host, including modulating and blocking the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, three proteins that structure the virus, known as the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E), are embedded in the outer membrane and give the virus its distinct shape and structure. Inside the virus particle, the RNA is tightly coiled and coated with a fourth structural protein, nucleocapsid (N), which protects its genetic material. [7, 8] New data shows a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral ORFs and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. The new ORFs identified may serve as novel accessory proteins or as regulatory units controlling the balanced production of different viral proteins. [7, 8] So, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 30-thousand-base-pairs genome actually codes for 50 and not 27 proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). [9] How SARS-CoV-2 selects the target cells, fuses its membrane with the host, and injects its J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe spike protein (S) is encoded by 3,831 base pairs of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the four structural proteins, this one selects which type of cell the SARS-CoV-2 will infect. The spike connects the virus and the human cell and causes the viral membrane to fuse with the cytoplasmic membrane of the human cell, so that the viral RNA can be injected into the human cell. Recognition of the membrane receptors in the cells to be infected is the mechanism by which tropism occurs. The spike, through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), recognizes the membrane receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein expressed mainly in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestine. By selecting ACE2 as a target, the virus also selects the main tissues it will infect. Then, human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves and activates the spike protein, which through its fusion peptide fuses the viral membrane with the membrane of the target cell, permitting injection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA into the human cell. [10] Inside the cell, the human protein synthesis apparatus (including the ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex) is commandeered and used to translate the proteins of SARS-CoV-2, forming countless new virions that equip themselves to invade new cells before destroying the cell they have taken over. One of the main stages in this process is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and consists of preactivation of a spike cleavage site by furin, a human protease present in the Golgi apparatus. [11] Furin is significantly expressed in lung cells, and enveloped viruses take advantage of this fact to pre-activate their glycoproteins. One event in the pre-activation of the spike protein (pre-proteolysis) takes place in the Golgi complex of infected and virusproducing cells, since the Golgi contains furins activated by the local pH. This pre-activation by furin seems to grant better selectivity and tropism to the spike with relation to ACE2, allowing it to enter cells that have low expression of other proteases such as TMPRSS2 and lysosomal cathepsins. When the RBD of the spike connects to the host's ACE2 receptor, the host proteases (particularly TMPRSS2 and lysosomal cathepsins, along with furin) cleave and activate the ""pre-activated"" spike protein at the S1/S2 junction, where a cleavage site recognized by the proteases is present. Activation of this site exposes a second protease cleavage site (S2). The spike protein must be cleaved sequentially at both sites, S1/S2 and S2, to be effectively activated. [12] Acquisition of the furin cleavage site might be viewed as a 'gain of function' that enabled a bat CoV to jump into humans and begin its current epidemic spread. As we can see, the SARS-CoV-2 has evolutionary mechanisms that make it very infectious, but not so lethal to the point that it self-destructs with the death of the host it invades or attracts the attention of our immune system. Excessive lethality of an infectious J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f agent impedes it from spreading from host to host, in cases such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and Ebola, which despite extremely high lethality rates did not lead to pandemics like COVID-19 (Fig. 3) .The RBD of the spike in SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity with ACE2 but is less accessible to the receptor because of the shaping of the trimers that comprise the structure of the spike. The dynamic state of RBD in coronavirus spikes explains this paradox; the RBD in coronaviruses can either be ""up,"" which allows it to connect with the receptor, or ""down,"" when it cannot bind with receptors. In the SARS-CoV-1 spike the RBD is usually ""up"" but in the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 the RBD is generally ""down"". For this reason, even though the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has just as much affinity with ACE2 as the RBD in SARS-CoV-1, it is less accessible than in SARS-CoV-1, [13] and as a result, SARS-CoV-2 is less exposed to human immune response. SARS-CoV-2 makes up for this weakness with at least three evolutionary advantages.Of all the coronaviruses, only SARS-CoV-2 has a genetic sequence featuring an insertion of 12 base pairs (4 amino acids) in the spike, called the polybasic site. The four amino acids inserted into the sequence form an exposed loop, increasing the susceptibility of the S protein to cleavage mediated by protease, which facilitates infection by SARS-CoV-2. The insertion sequence also generates a cleavage site for the protease furin. The insertion sequence is unique and has not been found in any other known coronavirus, not even in the RaTG12 coronavirus (in bats), which is highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2. This insertion probably makes up for the poor accessibility of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2. [14] Pre-activation by the host proteases Pre-activation of the spike in SARS-CoV-2 by furin expands the virus's ability to enter the types of cell lines that express ACE2, including pulmonary fibroblasts and epithelium.TMPRSS2 and lysosomal cathepsin activate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and both have cumulative effects with the protease furin when SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell; in comparison, the entry of the SARS-CoV-1 virus is activated by TMPRSS2 and cathepsins, but not by furin. [15] The presence of O-glycosidic bonds alongside the cleavage siteThe insertion of a proline at the junction between S1 and S2 before the 12-base-pair insertion can create a ""mucin-like domain"" that protects epitopes or key residues in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Various viruses use this domain as glycan shields for immunoevasion [16] (Fig.   4) .This question can be answered by comparing different virus genomes in order to find the nearest genetic homology. The SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% of its genome with SARS-CoV-1 and exhibits a remarkable 93.1% homology with the sequence of the RaTG12 virus isolated from a bat (Rhinolophus affinis) from Yunnan province, China, 2,000 kilometers from Wuhan. Although the genome of RaTG13 has 96% homology with the genome of the SARS-CoV-2, its S protein differs in the RBD, indicating that it would not be able to effectively connect to human ACE2. Furthermore, direct contact between bats and humans is rare, so it is more likely that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans occurs through an intermediary host (and not directly from bats), as was the case in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. As far as it is known, after Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the virus with the greatest genetic homology to the SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that infects certain Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica). [17] Considering only the homology of the RBD in SARS-CoV-2, the pangolin coronavirus genome sequence is more homologous than the bat coronavirus RaTG12. Six amino acids in the RBD have been described as determinants for an efficient connection between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, and the genome of the Malayan pangolin contains precisely these six amino acids in the same positions. The bat coronavirus RaTG13 has the same amino acid as the SARS-CoV-2 in only one of these six positions in the RBD, although the bat coronavirus RaTG13 is more homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 considering the genome as a whole. A new bat coronavirus identified in 227 bats collected from Yunnan province, China called RmYN02 is notable for the insertion of nitrogenous base pairs in the spike, which is very similar to the unique insertion of SARS-CoV-2 (the polybasic site). RmYN02 has a nucleotide sequence homology of 93.3% to the SARS-CoV-2, and this rises to 97.2% in the ORF1ab sequence, which is the most homologous to SARS-CoV-2. But in the RBD RmYN02 is less homologous (61.3%) to the SARS-CoV-2 and may not be able to connect to the ACE2. The bat coronavirus RATG13 may have obtained the RBD sequence that connects to the human ACE2 receptor through recombination with the coronavirus from the Malayan pangolin, and the polybasic site through recombination with the bat coronavirus RmYN02. [18] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f This complex evolutionary pattern raises the hypothesis of recombination between multiple viral genomes impacted by natural selection before or during the evolutionary leap to human infection.Various pieces of scientific evidence indicate that it is very unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a laboratory, either intentionally or by accident. genome is another clue that the virus is natural. The sugars create a ""mucin shield"" that protects the virus from attack by the immune system. Since tissue culture plates in laboratories do not have an immune system, it is unlikely that such an adaptation would appear in a laboratory-grown virus, essentially toppling the hypothesis that the virus was multiplied in tissue culture.3. The presence of an RBD very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins allows us to infer that this probably also occurred in the virus that was transmitted to humans, indicating that the polybasic insertion at the cleavage site may have occurred during humanto-human transmission.4. The RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 is different from that of the SARS-CoV-1, and the SARS-CoV-2's connection to ACE2 is not ideal, which implies that other connection mechanisms (""down"" RBD and the polybasic cleavage site providing pre-activation via furin) resulted from natural selection. For this reason, not only the understanding that its ""strengths"" evolved naturally but also the existence of ""weak points"" in the SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the virus was not artificially manipulated.The coronavirus genome is one of the largest among the RNA viruses, and it is natural for variations to occur. However, researchers have found that the coronavirus is mutating relatively slowly compared to other RNA viruses. This is partly because proofreading proteins substitutions/year are expected, roughly 2 per month. [19] This data was recently obtained for the strains present in the Brazilian population, estimated at 1.3×10-3 substitutions per nucleotide per year, the equivalent to an average of 33 variations per year, which is slightly higher than the global average. Even so, the mutation rate is lower than in SARS-CoV-1 or influenza. This does not mean that new strains of SARS-CoV-2 even more pathogenic than those currently circulating may not emerge. One reason (but not the only one, and not a sufficient criterion) to suspect that a certain mutation is being selected because it has an important phenotypic consequence is to monitor whether it is attaining a high frequency in the population. Thanks to the extraordinary worldwide collaborative efforts to sequence and publicly share information on the thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, [20] fourteen variants with slightly higher frequencies have already been identified. [21] The majority of these variants have no functional effect, follow a neutral evolutionary dynamic, and often involve mutational hotspots. The most notable among those variants that have reached a relevant frequency is D614G, in which guanine is replaced with adenine in position 23,403 at terminal C of S1 in the spike. In Europe, where G614 began its expansion, the D614 and G614 forms were co-circulating at the beginning of the epidemic, although D614 was more common in most of the countries surveyed. In March 2020, G614 became increasingly common throughout Europe, and by April it dominated the sampling at that time. There is growing evidence that this variant may have an effect on transmission capacity and even on the severity of the COVID-19 infection. The G614 mutation may decrease interaction between the S1 and S2 units, facilitating S1's detachment from S2 (connected to the viral membrane).Some studies suggest that G614 spread so rapidly through the region because the SARS-CoV-2 with this variant would be more infectious, and perhaps even associated with a higher viral load, but these same studies found no difference in hospitalization rates. [22] Other authors suggest that the predominance of this variant as the pandemic spread (and its low prevalence during the initial stages) could be related to the deletion of a single nucleotide in the TMPRSS2 gene; this deletion is frequent in Europeans and North Americans, but rare in Asia. These studies clearly demonstrate the significant benefits to the country from investment in research, particularly in terms of aspects that might not attract the attention of researchers abroad. Understanding the molecular epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 in a country that spans an entire continent, like Brazil, has a major impact on understanding its evolution and developing public health strategies to combat the virus.All infections have consequences that are related not only to the infectious agent but also to the host. COVID-19 has been shown to be extremely heterogeneous and consequently challenging with regard to understanding its multiple clinical and epidemiological aspects. It is no exaggeration to say that seven months after the first case detected in the world we have more questions than answers. Why children are infected less frequently and less severely?  Why do some take so long to become IgG positive? Why do some respond better to certain treatments? Why do some take so long to recover from the disease?These are just some of the questions that the scientific community still does not know how to answer. At least some of the answers to these questions are expected to come from studies that investigate not only the genome of the virus but also the human genome and its interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several genes are natural candidates for study, including those that are known to play a crucial role in our immune defense system (as in the case of MHC/HLA and CCR5), those that encode for the membrane receptors that bind to the spike in SARS-CoV-2 (like ACE2), and those that encode for proteases that activate SARS-CoV-2 (like TMPRSS2 and lysosomal cathepsins). To this end, an international research consortium on genetic factors in the human genome has been organized.[29] The most relevant work conducted so far has used techniques that investigate millions of variants in the human genome, in patients with COVID-19 and controls, without indicating candidate genes a priori. [30] This study assessed 1,980 patients with severe COVID-19 (defined as hospitalization for respiratory insufficiency and confirmed RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and 2,381 participants as controls from Italy and Spain. Greater risk was found among persons with blood type A than other blood types (odds ratio: 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-1.75; p = 1.48 × 10-4), and O type blood had a protective effect compared with other types (odds ratio: 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.79; p = 1.06 × 10-5). On chromosome 3, more specifically at 3q21.31, the association peak spanned a cluster of six genes (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1), several of which have functions that may be relevant to More detailed studies are needed to investigate whether these findings can be replicated and also to understand how and why these genes could impact the relationship between the genome of human host and SARS-CoV-2. Even more intriguing, this cluster of six genes in 3p21.31 was shown to be derived from part of the Neanderthal genome that was inherited by modern humans. [31] Only future studies will determine the evolutionary significance of this finding.One of the more surprising and intriguing clinical/epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 is the indisputable fact that children rarely experience the more severe forms of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f disease, but some display a unique Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. These aspects have recently been discussed in the Editorial section of this journal. [32] Emergent studies that indicate substantial differences in gene expression of the ACE2 membrane receptor and TMPRSS2 (in nasal as well as lung epithelial cells) are particularly important in pediatrics.Children have lower expression of these proteins, which are the real entryways to the body for SARS-CoV-2, and that may partly explain why COVID-19 evidently spares the pediatric population compared to adults and the elderly in particular. [33, 34] Not only genetic variants but also interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins are being investigated, especially in the cells of the heart and lungs, the two organs most affected by COVID-19. Studies of the ""cardiac interactome"" indicate the importance of microRNA as biomarkers that predict severity, [35] and research on the interactome of lung cells showed potential ACE2 regulators in the human lung, including genes related to modifications of histones such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. [36] Genetic vaccines Over 320 vaccines for COVID-19 are being developed, and 32 of these are already in clinical trials in humans. The great novelties are ""genetic"" vaccines, which thanks to genetic engineering and vectors carry copies of SARS-CoV-2 genes (particularly, for the spike) or those that directly inject synthetic mRNA from SARS-CoV-2 to evoke an immune response.These mRNA vaccines lower the risk of integrating into the host's genome, an advantage of mRNA over DNA vaccines.[37] These genetic vaccines for COVID-19 were developed at an impressive speed, since from previous Coronavirus research, the antigen role of the spike protein and antibodies against it were already known to be fundamental in immunity. A contribution came from the record-breaking speed with which the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced after confirmation of the first cases in China, in turn leading to significant progress in the nucleic acid vaccine platforms that allow the quick production of thousands of copies of the vaccine. One of these mRNA vaccines was the first to enter clinical trials and began to be developed as soon as the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 10, Unprecedented global efforts to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome in record time and study it in detail could make all the difference in how we deal with this threatening pandemic.Investments in local industrial installations that can produce reagents for molecular biology and pharmaceuticals, as well as in genetic research and in human and institutional resources for studying genomes have clearly become a strategic objective for every country that wants to be self-sufficient now and during future pandemics. Independence in this field of knowledge is not a matter of status or elitism, but rather is vital for understanding the epidemiology and spread of these infectious agents among our population, quickly recognizing potential evolutionary changes, diagnosing individuals through the genomic testing of these infectious agents, understanding clinical and therapeutic variability, and developing safe and effective vaccines with the degree of urgency that is clearly necessary to The author declares that he has not received any funding or research grants in the course of the study, research, or assembly of the manuscript.

On March 12, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (1) and, four months later, more than 12 million cases and 550,000 deaths have already been reported worldwide. In July 2020, Brazil exceeded the mark of 1,800,000 cases notified (2) , at the same time exceeding the total of 70,000 deaths confirmed by the disease, becoming the second country in the Americas with more cases, after the United States, and the epicenter of the pandemic in Latin America (3) .Preventing transmission to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (4) , is the main objective of any containment strategy. The approach of testing, tracking and tracing has become a central tool to achieve this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f objective (5) . However, the response to the coronavirus disease pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection in several regions of world.To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis (6) . This diagnostic strategy has been limited by significant logistics and capacity constraints, ranging from the short time of high viral excretion in respiratory secretions, availability of well-equipped laboratories, trained personnel, reagents, swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens and personal protective equipment for health care providers collecting samples. Thus, RT-PCR is particularly challenging in resourcelimited settings. Additionally, RT-PCR execution is relatively time consuming and highly dependent on the pre-analytical phase.In this context, numerous immunological tests, based on antigens or antibodies detection and including point-of-care or conventional platforms, have recently become available and approved for use worldwide. The tests developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are typically based on lateral flow immune assays (LFIAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs). Unlike tests based on viral detection, whose diagnostic window is short and related to the period of viral excretion, serological tests would have the advantage of being longer-lasting markers of infection, which has classically been used as a tool in assessing the population dissemination of infections.Currently, the available tests predominantly target antibodies to the main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus (7) . In theory, the serological strategy, and a point-ofcare approach based on rapid tests, would have the potential to significantly improve the current testing capacity for COVID-19. Serology is easier to perform, requiring less technical expertise and equipment and has a much lower unitary cost than RT-PCR J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f assays. The samples are blood collected in tubes or taken from digital pulp, which pose a lower potential risk to the health care staff. Serology can be performed in a basic clinical laboratory and community settings, thereby reaching a wider application. These potential advantages have been sufficient to encourage government from several countries, especially those with limited resources, and employers in the private sector, to acquire and use serological tests on a large scale during the COVID-19 pandemic, both as a diagnostic tool and as a marker of previous infection and guarantee of immunity. However, the serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remain largely uncertain, such as the relationship between the presence of antibodies and presence of immunity against re-infection (8).Although serologic tests contribute little to urgent decisions on social withdrawal and quarantine, from a public health perspective, serological analysis could be useful to estimate epidemiological variables, such as the attack rate and case fatality rate, which are necessary to assess the virus community transmission and its burden (9) .Regardless of the intended use, the first stage of any decision on the implementation of serological tests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is the careful analysis of their performances over the various stages of the infection, in different specimens and their specificity, challenged in the face of other clinical conditions. Here, we aimed to describe the accuracy of serological assays for COVID-19 registered in Brazil up to May 2020, the comparative performance of rapid tests performed in digital whole blood and serum and between patients with severe and mild clinical manifestations, in addition to the positivity of the different antibodies among patients with less than seven days, between 7 and 14 days and more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms.The panel-based study comprised 289 serum samples from 173 symptomatic patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 116 negative controls. All the cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive) were confirmed by RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and had their clinical condition and demography data compiled.The RT-PCR tests used for case confirmation were performed according to the protocols proposed by Center for Diseases Control/USA (10) or Charité Hospital/Germany (11) , both accepted by World Health Organization (12) . The negative control sera were all obtained before January 2020, the milestone of the introduction of the new coronavirus in Brazil, from patients with serological markers for other infectious or no infectious diseases. Only one sample per individual was included in this panel.Sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were provided by the Minas Gerais State Department of Health, which is responsible for collecting and storing a biorepository since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the performance of LFIAs performed in blood and serum was compared in a group of 32 patients who consented to be double tested. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases included hospital patients and outpatients. For each case, information about the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presence, according to the definition adopted in Brazil ( ≥ 30 breaths/min or an oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest), was registered. Negative control sera were collected before the emergence of the novel coronavirus in previous studies and were kindly provided by their legal guardian, with authorization from the Ethical Board of Instituto René Rachou, according to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Brazilian legislation for research with humans. Only serum samples were available for the control group, for this reason, no control was submitted to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.Due to the small volume of serum available from patients with malaria, samples from ten patients infected by Plasmodium vivax and nine patients with malaria by The minimum sample required for this validation was estimated through one-sample proportion test, using Statistics/Data Analysis software (Stata), version 11.0. As premises were considered a power of 80% and significance of 5% to reproduce the sensitivity and specificity of tests with an expected binomial exact 95% confidence limits, based on the lowest performance rates reported by the manufacturers to ANVISA up to May 18, 2020 (86% for sensitivity and 98% for specificity). Based on that, it was defined as the minimum of 149 cases with seven or more days of symptoms and 116 controls. Additionally, the minimum number of 20 tests performed on digital blood and serum from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients was estimated as sufficient to identify a minimum difference of 20% between the sensitivity in the two clinical specimens. Two of the manufacturers involved in this validation provided fewer tests than requested, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the evaluation was carried out with a proportional sub-group of case samples and negative controls, chosen randomly.A search for diagnostics for COVID-19 was carried out with records in force at the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) through the Agency's website (https://consultas.anvisa.gov.br/#/saude/). The search strategy was based on the terms ""COVID 19"", ""SARS"", ""nCOV"", ""COV"" and ""coronavirus"" and was carried out on May 18, 2020. Sixty-seven serological tests registered in Brazil to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 were identified: 55 lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), six ELISA assays, four chemiluminescence and two immunofluorescence tests. Five manufacturers did not present any commercial contact information, thirty-eight manufacturers did not respond to contact, and other three refused to participate. All the companies responsible for producing the tests identified using the commercial contact available were invited to participate in this validation. By the end of June, nine companies had sent kits for validation and nine others were committed to donating the tests, if not yet received.Thus, twelve registered and commercially available serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were included in this analysis and their main characteristics are shown in Table 1 . There were six LFIA and six ELISA tests.Among the LFIA tests, only one exhibits a total antibody detection line, while in the other five the cassette display two test lines (M and G lines) and a quality control line (C line). All the kits used capture reaction to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and were based on the colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 10-30 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. Briefly, the sample was absorbed by capillary action and mixed with the The serum samples were randomly coded and kept frozen at -70ºC until needed, and then was thawed for ten minutes at room temperature and homogenized before testing.The tests were carried out following each manufacturer's instructions strictly. To avoid comparison between tests, all the samples were submitted to a test before moving on to the next test. The reproducibility of the LFIA kits was assessed using the interpretation of the results by three independent observers using the Kappa index and the final result defined was that indicated by at least two of the three readers. For one of the LFIA kits, the result was obtained using a micro reader provided by the manufacturer. For LFIA blood-serum comparison, approximately 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients represented in this panel was consecutively recruited to donate capillary blood for testing, until reaching the minimum of 20 tests performed of each brand test.The performance parameters of interest were sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, The patients whose serum samples were tested in this study were diagnosed with Tables 2 and 3 summarize the sensitivity by serological test and immunoglobulin class detected. For LFIA tests, the sensitivity for IgM ranged from 13.3% to 72.3% and that for IgG, ranged from 51.4 to 65.9%. For all except one LFIA tests, the sensitivity of the IgG detection alone was numerically higher than that observed for IgM band and for all of them, the highest detection rates were observed by combining the IgM and IgG results, ranging from 52.6% to 75.1% (Table 1) . Among the ELISAs, a test based on the IgA/IgM detection exhibited the highest sensitivity (90.2%, 95%CI 84.9-93.8%). For IgG, the sensitivity for ELISAs ranged from 58.7% to 76.8% (Table 3) . Considering only patients with seven or more days of symptoms, the sensitivity ranged from 59.5% to 83.1% for LFIA and from 50.7% to 92.6% for ELISAs ( Table 4 ). As expected, the sensitivity for patients with less than seven days of symptoms was in general poor, up to 40% for all except one ELISA test. The sensitivity tends to increase with the number of days from the day of symptoms onset. However, there was substantial overlap between the sensitivity 95% confidence interval for the groups of confirmed cases with 7 to 14 days and more than 14 days of symptoms (Table 5) .For all LFIA tests and three of six ELISAs, the sensitivity was higher among patients presenting with ARDS than among those presenting with mild symptoms (Table 6 ).Except for one LFIA, which presents an exceptional low specificity (81%, 95%CI 72.9%-87.1%), the specificity of all other LFIAs was in general high, varying between 97.4% and 100% (Table 4) . Overall, sensitivity for ELISA assays was higher than for LFIA. Excluding one IgG based ELISA test, which presented a sensitivity rate of 58.7%, the rates varied from 66.9% to 92.6%. By contrast, the specificity for ELISA tests was in general lower than that for LFIA, except for the same test presenting the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lowest sensitivity referred above, which exhibited the highest specificity among the ELISA tests (95.8%). Agreement between the results of LFIA performed in digital blood and serum varied markedly among different commercial kits, from perfect to only slight agreement (Table 7) . Among the 116 control sera, only 21 did not show reactivity to any of the 12 tests evaluated, 53 were positive in one test, 27 in two tests, 10 reacted positively in three tests and five controls showed positive reaction in four different tests.The patients of control group whose sample reacted falsely in more than three different SARS-Cov-2 serological tests had serum markers to HIV, dengue, zica, Chagas disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis or parasitological confirmation of visceral leishmaniasis or malaria.This is the first study to assess comparatively the clinical performance of the serological tests available to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. Although some systematic reviews have already been published on the subject (14) (15), none has included data from Brazil, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. Local accuracy data based on real scenarios are essential considering the marked regional differences in the performance of the tests. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, this information is especially relevant to the current reality of Brazil, a developing country that faces serious budgetary constraints and that has been performing suboptimally in relation to its mass testing capacity. By contrast, several successful strategies implemented worldwide, such as aggressive testing and isolation, have promoted transmission control (16) (17) . In this sense, the inverse association between testing capacity and mortality from COVID-19 has been consolidated as evidence of the impact of the isolation of those infected and the tracing and quarantining of their presented here, the highest sensitivity rate observed after14 days of symptoms reaches only a moderate level, just over 90% for a few tests in the best scenario. Thus, in regions with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence below 10%, a reality in many regions of the world, the positive predictive value (PPV) of these tests remain below 80%, that is, these tests will produce around 20% of false-positive results if they have a very high specificity. Additionally, for tests with specificities lower than 95%, this moderate sensitivity will generate an even lower PPV, even with a disease prevalence above 20%.However, considering that a set of clinical manifestations could be used as disease suspicion criteria increasing the pre-test probability, in theory, immunoassays could play a complementary function to RT-PCR, enhancing COVID-19 detection sensitivity and accuracy (21), at rates that need to be established. An important observation presented here is a test performance in general lower than that described by others (24, 25) . The main difference between this and those studies lies on the studied population.Here, approximately 40% of the cases did not meet the Covid-19 severity criterion adopted in Brazil while in most of the first studies only hospitalized patients were tested. Furthermore, the test's performance in the two groups stratified according to the clinical criterium was significantly different, reinforcing the link between clinical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f severity and positivity in serological tests. Other factors as sample size issues and genetic specificities could also justify that difference. On the other hand, as a common result among validation studies, immunoassays still will produce delayed information, if the critical period of viral transmission is considered (26) . For a more accurate performance, serological tests should be used after two weeks after symptoms onset in a context of high probability. Unlike PCR-based tests, serology cannot be used to confirm the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, making its use limited for clinical decision-making or as a reinforcement in the recommendation for social isolation.There is even less evidence to support serological testing of asymptomatic individuals, as proposed for the screening of contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases or in the supposed assessment of protective immunity. The antibody presence and circulating titers may exhibit behavior different from that observed in symptomatic infection.considering the performance reported here and the still low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in general, except in few hotspots, we can expect many more false-positive than true positive results.In relation to the choice between LFIA and ELISA tests, in addition to performance, logistics issues and total cost involved should be considered. To assist in this decision, cost-effectiveness analysis needs to be conducted and should guide more accurate decisions applied to different scenarios where pre-test probability or disease prevalence are estimated.The inadequacy of the use of IgA and IgM antibodies as markers of contagiousness need to be highlighted. Our results revealed that both increase directly with the number of days of symptoms, reaching the highest rate among samples from patients with more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f than 14 days of symptoms, a period in which the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is considered low (27) .Specificity was homogeneously high for all LFIA tests, except for one test, assembled and packaged in Brazil but imported from a manufacturer based in the United States, where the kit had its FDA (Food and Drug Administration) license revoked in June 2020, in addition to more than 70 other tests, because of a poor performance detected by independent analyses (28).Although low specificity was not a problem for most LFIAs, data for ELISAs differ significantly from that described in the package inserts of the tests and in relation to other accuracy studies carried out in China and in countries in the northern hemisphere.Infectious diseases prevalent in the tropics, such as leishmaniasis, arboviruses and malaria, were for the first time described as cause of false-positivity in tests for SARS-CoV-2, which raises concern about its use in these regions. On the other hand, there were few samples from patients with acute respiratory symptoms enrolled in the control group, which would be the real control for this validation. Even so, other studies contemplating samples from acute respiratory patients, including other endemic coronavirus confirmed cases, have revealed similar specificity rates (14, 29, 30) .Additionally, another group of patients possibly prone to cross-reactivity are those with chronic autoimmune diseases, as indicated by some previous observations with SARS-CoV, an association still not confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 (31).High specificity, in turn, is one of the most important properties required for a test to be used in epidemiological surveys. Estimation of the extent of the population that has already been infected in the community is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and the main characteristics of the virus, its attack rate, its lethality and the impact of the various prevention and control interventions. These parameters would also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f be useful to monitor the resumption of social and economic activities. A limiting factor, however, is the lack of knowledge of the longevity of these antibodies, an issue that will require studies with longer observation periods. In this panel, only 19 patients were between 31 and 60 days and another 13 had more than 60 days since the onset of symptoms. This small sample of evaluated patients does not allow us to confirm the lack of differences in the positivity rates of the tests over time.Another limiting factor for the use of LFIA as a point-of-care test is the heterogeneity observed between the results of tests performed using fingerstick whole blood and serum, with the kappa varying from 0.2 to 1.0. This observation cautions the possibility of lower performance using blood, which is variable among kits, and an undeniable commitment to the more striking potential advantages of LFIA: agility and decentralization in mass testing. Few studies until now have addressed this issue because most have presented the results of tests performed solely on serum. In addition, the sample sizes evaluated were generally small and the results conflicting (30, 32) .Finally, the most controversial point regarding the use of immunoassays use is the lack of robust evidence of a correlation between circulating antibodies and acquired immunity (33) , that is, whether the antibodies detected are protective for a significant The accumulated experience with SARS-CoV, another coronavirus with strong genetic similarity to the current SARS-CoV-2, and involved in an outbreak in 2002, provides some insights on immunity. Specifically, the presence of antibodies has been extended for at least three years, being more intense among patients with the most severe forms, with progressive and significant reduction in the neutralizing antibody over time (35) .Thus, at this point, any use of serology as a marker of immunity and criteria to allow or prevent the resumption of social life is only speculation and should not be recommended.In summary, our observations revealed marked differences among the serological tests registered in Brazil. Generally, the sensitivity was only moderate, with insufficient performance for use before seven days of symptoms, as expected for a method based on the search for antibodies. The sensitivity rates reach around 80% to 90% for LFIA and ELISA after 14 days from the onset of symptoms, respectively, confirming that immunoassays are not suitable tools for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population, except for regions presenting high prevalence rates, over 20%. Of the three uses recommended so far, as a diagnostic method for acute cases, as a marker of immunity to allow the resumption of social life and as an instrument for measuring viral dissemination in epidemiological studies, only the last one seems to be justified. Seroprevalence can play an important role in the understanding of COVID-19 spread, however, to estimate the extent of the population that has already been infected in the community, the estimated prevalence rates need to be adjusted by test sensitivity and specificity. As an epidemiological tool, seroprevalence could still be helpful to assess the impact of different collective interventions on different demographics retrospectively. As a diagnostic tool for symptomatic patients, serology represents delayed information, greatly limiting its role in decision making. The inaccuracy of detecting IgM or IgA, as markers of active infectivity, was also confirmed by our results. Further data need to be gathered correlating antibody detection and protective immunity, besides the duration of protection. ","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-09",10

Whereas most of human CoVs cause mild respiratory infections, the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 which emerged in 2003, 2012, and 2019, respectively, have demonstrated how devastating and life-threatening they can be.COVID-19 is caused by a new type of transmissible pathogenic SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2) -formerly 2019-nCoV -which belongs to the zoonotic CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. Symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and in some cases gastrointestinal distress (Guo et al., 2020) .The SARS-CoV-2 genome size of about 30 kb encodes multiple structural and non-structural proteins (Ahmed et al., 2020) . The spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are considered essential to produce structurally complete viral particles (Ahmed et al., 2020; Mangar et al., 2020) . The 3 C-like protease (3CLpro), also known as main protease, is one of the two proteases that SARS-CoVs utilize for replication and infection processes (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . Unlike the catalytic tryad found in serine proteases and other cysteine proteases, a catalytic dyad is present in the active site of SARS-CoVs main protease (Anand et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2020) . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also named nsp12, is the most highly conserved protein among RNA viruses and its role is to catalyze the viral genome replication and transcription (J acome et al., 2020) . RdRp activity is dependent on magnesium ions and requires the non-structural proteins nsp7 and nsp8 for complete activity (Kirchdoerfer & Ward, 2019) . The active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is formed by conserved polymerase motifs (A-G), where the motif A and motif C contain the divalent-cation-binding amino acid D618, and the catalytic residues 759SDD761, respectively .Taken together, these enzymes are attractive drug targets to treat these human CoVs.Potential COVID-19 treatments include ivermectin, a broadspectrum anti-parasitic agent (Caly et al., 2020) ; type I interferons, a group of cytokines with a broad spectrum activity against RNA viruses (Mantlo et al., 2020) ; favipiravir, a viral RdRp inhibitor ; and convalescent plasma. The protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, used to treat HIV infections, and recommended by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China to treat COVID-19, did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or decrease throat viral RNA detection in a randomized, controlled, open-label, not blinded trial involving hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 . However, the work had several limitations and larger studies with greater variety of patients are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment. Remdesivir, a nucleoside analog used to block viral RdRps including filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, as well as animal and human CoVs, was used to treat severely ill patients with COVID-19 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, showing a numerically faster time to clinical improvement but not statistically significant . Using insect cells, it was found to be a direct-acting antiviral inhibiting with the same potency and mechanism of action the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and its ortholog in SARS-CoV (Gordon et al., 2020) . Remdesivir was approved on May 1, 2020, by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. More recently, in a large trial including hospitalized patients critically ill with COVID-19, the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen but were not on ventilators. Importantly, this steroid had not effect on patients with less severe cases those not receiving respiratory support (Horby et al., 2020) .The high diversity and complex molecular structures of natural compounds make them an abundant biological source for drug discovery, even more, considering the limited number of plant species that have been explored for pharmaceutical purposes (Saklani & Kutty, 2014) . Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds that have been proposed as attractive antiviral agents given their broad mechanisms of action including transcription and translation blocking, as well as their general safety and non-cytotoxicity to human cells (Lalani & Poh, 2020; Paduch & Kandefer-Szerszen, 2014) . Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were demonstrated to inhibit the protease activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in vitro (Jo et al., 2020) . We focused our research to the Andean region considering that it is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world due to the different environmental niches resulting from its great elevational and latitudinal diversity gradient (Anthelme et al., 2014; Mutke et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2010) . The present work was aimed to perform molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy estimations, and to predict ADMET profiles of natural compounds identified in medicinal plants growing in the Andean region as potential inhibitors of the 3CLpro and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.Two SARS-CoV-2 proteins were selected as targets based on the key role they played in the replication/transcription machinery. The 3 D structures of the 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. Water molecules and inhibitor were removed from 6LU7 using Discovery Studio Visualizer (2016). Similarly, co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 were removed from 6M71. Missing atoms for residues F70, K73, R74, E83, K98, F101, F102, I114, R365, and D824, in the RdRp file, were modeled using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer v4.1.0 (Guex & Peitsch, 1997) . AutoDock Tools v1.5.6 (Sanner, 1999) was used to add polar hydrogens to the structures and convert them in pdbqt format.Ligands used for molecular docking included 92 phytochemicals from 20 medicinal plants growing in the Andean region in South America, as well as some FDA-approved drugs with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 (darunavir, nelfinavir, paritaprevir, saquinavir, setrobuvir, simeprevir, and sofosbuvir), the aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and cinnamaldehyde as negative controls due to its poor affinity to these SARS-CoV-2 viral targets (Elfiky, 2020) . Natural compounds and synthetic drugs were downloaded from PubChem and DrugBank, respectively. Ligands were converted to PDB format using Open Babel (O' Boyle et al., 2011) and later prepared to pdbqt format using AutoDock Tools v1.5.6 (Sanner, 1999).The active pockets on the target proteins were identified using the CASTp (Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins) server (Tian et al., 2018) .Docking analysis was performed using the AutoDock Vina software (Trott & Olson, 2010) . Grid boxes of 24 Å x 26 Å x 30 Å centered at x, y, z ¼ À10, 12, 69 and 36 Å x 34 Å x 19 Å centered at x, y, z ¼ 113, 113, 130 were set for 3CLpro and RdRp, respectively. A grid spacing of 1 Å and default exhaustiveness were used. After docking, the structures were examined in Discovery Studio Visualizer (2016).The resulting protein-ligand complex structures from molecular docking were used to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in GROMACS 2018 (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005) with MPI support at the Oklahoma State University HPC system. Ligand and protein parameters were generated using CHARMM general force-field (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010) and CHARMM36 force-field (Huang & MacKerell, 2013) , respectively; the topologies for both 3CLpro and RdRp were generated using the pdb2gmx utility included in GROMACS, while the CGenFF online program was used for the ligands (https://cgenff.umaryland.edu) . In order to prepare the system for MD simulations, all protein-ligand and protein with no ligand systems were centered in a rhombic dodecahedron box with a box-system distance of 1.0 nm and solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential (TIP3P) water (Bjelkmar et al., 2010) .Charge neutralization was carried out for the 3CLpro system by adding four sodium ions, while six sodium ions were added for the RdRp system. Then, the systems were relaxed through 50000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm for energy minimization calculations at a tolerance value of 1000 kJ/(mol.nm). This was followed by the equilibration with position restraint on the protein and ligand molecules for 0.1 ns using NVT and NPT ensembles, wherein the systems were heated to 300 K using Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) with a coupling time of 0.1 ps, and the pressure was maintained with a coupling to a reference pressure of 1 bar. For energy minimization, NVT, and NPT relaxation simulation, a smooth force-switch 1.2 nm cutoff was used in short-range interactions, and long-range electrostatics were evaluated using the PME (Particle-Mesh-Ewald) (Darden et al., 1993) ; additionally, hydrogen-bonds were restrained with the LINCS algorithm (Hess et al., 1997) .Final MD simulations of 200 ns were performed without restraints using an integration time-step of 2 fs, and trajectory snapshots were captured at every 1 ps. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) were chosen as parameters to analyze MD trajectories using GROMACS utilities and plotted with Xmgrace. To further confirm the stability of protein-ligand complexes, changes in secondary structures during MD simulations were assessed using the Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm.The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method (Kollman et al., 2000) , implemented in the g_mmpbsa tool (Kumari et al., 2014) of GROMACS, was used to estimate the relative binding free energy of each protein-ligand complex. Briefly, the binding free energy (DG bind ) of a protein-ligand complex in solvent is calculated as the free energy difference between the complex (G complex ) and the summation of the free energy of the protein (G protein ) and ligand (G ligand ):The analyses were performed for 500 snapshots collected consecutively at an interval of 40 ps from the last 20 ns of MD simulations. The solute dielectric constant (e in ) was assigned based on the protein-ligand interfaces by using the scheme: 1 for non-polar residues, 2 for polar not charged residues, and 4 for polar charged (positively and negatively) residues (Ravindranathan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2019) .A total of 19 molecular descriptors were calculated to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity (ADMET) profile of the selected potential inhibitors of the 3Clpro and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, using the Web servers SwissADME (Daina et al., 2017) and pkCSM (Pires et al., 2015) which have been extensively validated with experimental data. The Lipinski's rule of five considering key physicochemical parameters (molecular weight, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrogen bonding, and charge) was used to evaluate the drug likeness of the potential inhibitors.Docking scores of FDA-approved protease and RdRp inhibitors which are used to treat COVID-19 patients were calculated in order to set cutoff values. Remdesivir docking scores (-8.2 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and À7.5 kcal/mol to RdRp) were lower than or equal to those found for lopinavir (-7.9 kcal/ mol to 3CLpro and À6.9 kcal/mol to RdRp) and ritonavir (-8.2 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and À 7.2 kcal/mol to RdRp). Then, À8.2 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and À7.5 kcal/mol to RdRp were set as cutoff values.The docking scores to RdRp of all tested FDA-approved drugs which are being proposed as candidates against SARS-CoV-2, excepting sofosbuvir, were lower than remdesivir. Moreover, paritaprevir, setrobuvir, simeprevir, and nelfinavir also showed higher affinity to 3CLpro than ritonavir and remdesivir (Supplementary Table 1 ). The low affinities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to both enzymes (Supplementary Table 1 ) indicate that they do not interact effectively with these viral targets. In fact, the mode of action of these aminoquinolines is not related to RdRp or 3CLpro inhibition. CQ impairs the autophagosome fusion with lysosomes (Mauthe et al., 2018) , and interferes with the glycosylation of viral or host proteins. More specifically, CQ inhibits the glycosylation of HIV viral particles or SARS-CoV human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Savarino et al., 2004; Vincent et al., 2005) From the analysis of the 92 phytochemicals, 10 exhibited docking scores lower than the cutoff for 3CLpro (corosolic acid, friedelin, hesperidin, guaijaverin, hyperin, lupinifolin, mangiferin, pinocembrin-7-O-rutinoside, quercitrin, and rutin) while 12 had docking scores lower than the cutoff for RdRp (Supplementary Table 1 ). These compounds showing such affinities were selected to perform MD simulations in order to evaluate the stability of protein-ligand complexes.Interestingly, unlike their aglycones, hesperidin (hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside), rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside), and quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-a-rhamnoside) showed significant affinities to both viral targets (Supplementary Table 1 ). In addition, the quercetin glycosides guaijaverin (quercetin-3-O-a-arabinoside) and hyperin (quercetin-3-O-b-galactoside) revealed significant affinities to 3CLpro. By comparing the protein-ligand interactions, the glycoside moiety was involved in molecular interactions.Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational approach used to analyze the dynamic behaviour of complex systems where atoms and molecules interact as a function of time. In general, computational methods improve the efficiency in drug discovery, Importantly, unlike general molecular docking methods, MD simulations consider the flexibility of the targets and combined with binding energy calculations a more accurate prediction of potential inhibitors can be developed (Liu et al., 2018) . Structural parameters including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and number of intermolecular H-bonds were used to evaluate the stability, dynamic behaviour, and compactness of protein-drug complexes.Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone was used to analyze the stability of 3CLpro and RdRp in complex with the selected phytochemicals, where a value lower than that calculated to the free protein indicates a stable complex (Liu et al., 2017) . The mean RMSD values for free 3CLpro and 3CLpro in complex with hesperidin, hyperin, lupinifolin, and rutin were 2.37 Å, 2.13 Å, 2.11 Å, 2.04 Å, and 2.00 Å, respectively. Similarly, the mean RMSD for free RdRp and RdRp in complex with hesperidin, pinocembrin-7O-rutinoside, speciophylline, and vitexin were 2.72 Å, 2.44 Å, 2.69 Å, 2.38 Å, and 2.67 Å, respectively. Then, these phytochemicals did not disturb the structural stability of these enzymes (Figure 1 ). Backbones with mean RMSD higher than free protein are plotted in Figure S1 .To ensure the binding stability of these compounds in the active site, ligand positional RMSD was calculated. In complex with 3CLpro, high fluctuations were found for hyperin, corosolic acid, friedelin, guaijaverin, mangiferin, pinocembrin-7-O-rutinoside, and quercitrin (Figure 2(A) , Figure S2 ). In contrast, hesperidin and lupinifolin were stable throughout the simulation (Figure 2(A) ). Since rutin fluctuated from 0.2 nm to 2.3 nm at the end of the simulation, ten snapshots were downloaded in the interval of 20 ns during the entire simulation wherein it was observed that rutin had moved considerably from the active site, while hesperidin and lupinifolin remained firmly bound (Figure 3) . It suggests the inability of rutin to inhibit efficiently the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Among the ligands that formed stable complexes with RdRp, only hesperidin showed stable binding in the active site ( Figure  2 (B), Figure 4 ). Following analyses were done for hesperidin and lupinifolin which did not disturb the protein stability and remained firmly bound to the active site.In order to calculate the residual mobility in the absence and presence of the phytochemicals, RMSF analysis was calculated and plotted against the residue number and was supported with the DSSP analysis. Part of the noticeable fluctuations occurring to backbones of 3CLpro complexes around position 50 corresponds to residues belonging to a loop surrounding the active site ( Figure 5(A) ). It has been demonstrated that loops can be involved in ligand binding and conformational changes can often take place in these sites (Lee et al., 2012; Teague, 2003) . In contrast, residues interacting with stable ligands including the catalytic dyad H41 and C145 for 3CLpro, as well as the catalytic residues 759SDD761 and the divalent-cation-binding residue D618 for RdRp were among the most stable residues. Missing residues between K50-Y69, F102-P112, and L895-M906 in the crystal structure of RdRp were evidenced by ambiguous fluctuations in those positions ( Figure 5(B) ). In all complexes, there were no significant structural changes during the throughout simulation. The helical and b-sheet content remained stable ( Figure S3 , Figure S4 ).Radius of gyration (Rg) is a measure of the compactness of a protein which allows to understand its folding properties (Lobanov et al., 2008) . Small Rg values indicate a tight packing whereas high Rg values show a floppy packing. A relative constant Rg value through time indicates that the ligands hold the folding behavior of the protein whereas abrupt fluctuations of the Rg values denote protein folding instability (Khan et al., 2020) .The 3Clpro in complex with hesperidin (mean Rg ¼ 2.24 nm) and lupinifolin (mean Rg ¼ 2.23 nm) presented more compactness compared with the free protein (mean Rg ¼ 2.27 nm). On the other hand, the RdRp in complex with hesperidin (Rg ¼ 3.04 nm) was slightly less compact than the free RdRp (Rg ¼ 3.02 nm). In all these complexes, the Rg kept constant with no abrupt fluctuations through the time, indicating that hesperidin, rutin, and lupinifolin maintain the folding behavior of 3Cl pro while hesperidin maintains RdRp folding ( Figure 6 ).It is well known that H-bonds are responsible for the secondary and tertiary structural protein motifs. Formation of Hbonds between a ligand and a protein motif explains the binding affinity of a drug towards a protein target in molecular dynamics simulations; so, the more number of H-bonds the stronger interactions (Menendez et al., 2016) .For 3CLpro, a mean number of hydrogen bonds of 5-6, and 1, were found for hesperidin and lupinifolin, respectively (Figure 7(A) ). The stability of lupinifolin can be explained by the six hydrophobic interactions revealed from the docking analysis. In addition, the contribution of van der Waals interactions to the binding energy of lupinifolin was the lowest among the complexes (Table 1) . Even though pinocembrin 7-O-rutinoside formed 4 hydrogen bonds, it was discarded because of the backbone instability obtained in the RMSD analysis. On the other hand, for RdRp in complex with hesperidin, an average of 2-3 hydrogen bonds was found (Figure 7(B) ). The formation of these hydrogen bonds explains the high affinities of the ligands to 3Clpro and RdRp, as well as the stability of these complexes over time.In general, small non-covalent or reversible covalent inhibitors, such as phytochemicals, display several advantages regarding side effects and toxicity compared with covalent inhibitors (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) .By rescoring docked complexes, the MM-PBSA method has demonstrated to be a valuable tool in drug discovery to remove possible false positive compounds obtained by docking analysis performed with standard methods (Kumari et al., 2014; Rastelli et al., 2009) . Binding energies (DG bind ) of the stable complexes with ligands firmly bound to the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were estimated according to the MM-PBSA method (Table 1) . Molecular interactions of hesperidin and lupinifolin in complex with 3CLpro taken from molecular docking and during the simulation at 100 ns and 200 ns included mostly polar not charged and non-polar residues (Figure 8) , then a value of e in ¼ 2 was set for the MM-PBSA calculations of these complexes. On the other hand, a value of e in ¼ 4 was used for the RdRp-hesperidin complex because the highly charged protein-ligand interface including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, and lysine residues (Figure 9 ).Results indicated that lupinifolin showed more affinity to 3CLpro compared to hesperidin (Table 1) . However, hesperidin also formed a stable complex with RdRp showing a DG bind ¼ À9.46 kcal/mol. In these complexes, the contribution of van der Waals interactions to the binding energy was lower than electrostatic and non-polar solvation energies. To understand protein-ligand associations, the total binding energies were decomposed into the contribution made by each residue. For 3CLpro complexes, H41, C145, and M165 were found to strongly interact with both hesperidin and lupinifolin, (Figure 10 ). For RdRp-hesperidin complex, residues S561 and T565 surrounding the active site as well as D703 were part of those contributing negatively to the binding energy (Figure 11 ).In silico ADMET analysis is used to predict the pharmacokinetic profile of compounds, before experimental procedures (Jayaraj et al., 2020) . The bioavailability of any compound is highly influenced by its physicochemical properties of the compound. According to Lipinski's rule, a poor absorption and a low permeation are more likely when the molecule meets the following properties: the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 g/mol, there are more than 10 H-bond donors and more than 5 H-bond acceptors, and the logarithm of octanol-water partition coefficient (Log P) is greater than 5 (Benet et al., 2016) . Whereas the values for lupinifolin lie between the ranges, hesperidin violated molecular weight and number of H-bond acceptors ( Table 2) . The low lipophilicity of hesperidin (Log P ¼ À0.72) and poor water solubility of lupinifolin (Log p ¼ 4.38) implying a low oral bioavailability can be overcome by using oral drug delivery systems or intravenous administration.The analysis of distribution took into consideration both the permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and whether the compounds could be substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Prachayasittikul & Prachayasittikul, 2016) . Since the inability of hesperidin and lupinifolin to permeate across the BBB (Table 2) , the central nervous system is protected from their action. Importantly, the distribution of hesperidin could be limited by the P-gp-mediated efflux.Metabolism of drugs is carried out by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. Among the analyzed CYPs (Table 2) , whereas hesperidin might not inhibit any of these enzymes, lupinifolin could inhibit CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, but not neither CYP1A2 nor CYP2D6. Because of these inhibitions, lupinifolin may affect the metabolism and clearance of the potential drugs resulting into bioaccumulation (Terao & Mukai, 2014) , so optimal drug doses must be defined.Excretion analysis considered the total clearance (CLtot) because it influences the half-life and bioavailability of drugs. Moreover, CLtot provides a framework for the initial dose for first in human studies (Berellini et al., 2012) . The CLtot of lupinifolin was higher than hesperidin (Table 2) . Neither hesperidin nor lupinifolin was found to be carcinogenic or to present hepatotoxicity. However, hesperidin revealed weak inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene II (hERG II) potassium channel.ADMET: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity; Log P: logarithm of octanol-water partition coefficient; BBB: Blood-brain barrier; P-gp: P-glycoprotein; Log CLtot: logarithm of total clearance; hERG: human ether-a-gogo-related geneFrom the combination of molecular docking to score binding poses, molecular dynamics to evaluate the interaction and stability of protein-ligand complexes, and MM-PBSA to estimate binding energies, among 92 phytochemicals, hesperidin was found to be a promising multitarget antiviral against SAS-CoV-2. More specifically, this flavonoid rutinoside showed high affinities and stability in complex with the 3CLpro and RdRp in their active sites. Structurally, hesperidin is constituted of the flavanone hesperitin (aglycone) and the disaccharide rutinoside (rhamnose linked to glucose), and it is mainly found in citrus fruits. Pharmacological effects of hesperidin include antimicrobial, antiviral, antihyperlipidemic, cardioprotective, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antiinflammatory activities (Man et al., 2019; Zanwar et al., 2014) . By performing cell-free and cell-based assays, hesperitin was found to significantly inhibit the cleavage processing of SARS-CoV 3CLpro while being less toxic to Vero cells when compared to other phenolic compounds (Lin et al., 2005) .Considering that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is 96% identical with its SARS-CoV ortholog Zhang et al., 2020) , the estimated binding energies, and the stability with both 3CLpro and RdRp revealed by molecular dynamics simulation, hesperidin becomes a remarkable candidate to act as a multitarget antiviral, inhibiting two essential enzymes of the causative agent of COVID-19.Lupinifolin was found to be a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 because of its affinity and stability in complex with 3CLpro. This prenylated flavonoid has been identified in several medicinal plants belonging mostly to the family Fabaceae. Other sources include plants in the family Rutaceae and Apocynaceae (Ganapaty et al., 2006; Joycharat et al., 2016; Lin et al., 1991; Mahidol et al., 1997; Smalberger et al., 1974; Soonthornchareonnon et al., 2004) . The wide range of pharmacological effects of lupinifolin includes antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant enterococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Sianglum et al., 2019; Soonthornchareonnon et al., 2004) , cytotoxicity against breast cancer, human small-cell lung (NCI-H187) and oral human epidermoid carcinoma (KB), with limited or not determined cytotoxicity against Vero cells (Soonthornchareonnon et al., 2004; Sutthivaiyakit et al., 2009) , and antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Soonthornchareonnon et al., 2004) . Lupinifolin was found to inhibit bacterial growth via cell membrane disruption, increasing its permeability while decreasing salt tolerance (Sianglum et al., 2019; Yusook et al., 2017) . On the other hand, its antiviral mechanism has not been studied yet.Protein-interacting residues taken from molecular docking and during the simulation at 100 ns and 200 ns were annotated in order to obtain deeper insight into the interaction pattern. In the 3CLpro complexes, residues forming the catalytic dyad, C145 and H41, were found to interact with hesperidin and lupinifolin (Figure 8 ). In the stable RdRp complex, residues of the catalytic site (759SDD761) as well as the divalent-cation-binding residue D618 interacted with hesperidin ( Figure 9 ).It is worth mentioning that the oral bioavailability of flavonoids is restricted by the extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine and liver (Gonzales, 2017) . For instance, flavonoid rutinosides such as hesperidin are metabolized via methylation, demethylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, and sulfoglucuronidation in the intestine and liver, and hydrolyzed by microbial enzymes in the large intestine (Boyle et al., 2000; Nectoux et al., 2019) . Moreover, the transport of prenylated flavonoids to blood circulation is lowered by prenyl groups and a long-term dietary intake can derive in tissue accumulation (Terao & Mukai, 2014) . Hence, the route of administration and delivery are crucial to consider. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo assays are required to evaluate the efficacy of these natural compounds.Using a virtual screening approach, the present study aimed to elucidate natural compounds as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp which are enzymes that play a key role in the virus replication cycle. After performing molecular docking to estimate the binding affinities and molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, hesperidin (estimated binding affinities, DG bind ¼ À15.18 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and DG bind ¼ À9.46 kcal/mol to RdRp) was identified as a lead candidate because of its potential to efficiently inhibit both 3CLpro and RdRp. Furthermore, lupinifolin exhibited potential to inhibit the main protease showing a higher affinity than hesperidin (DG bind ¼ À20.93 kcal/mol) while displaying suitable pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties. Based on the safety and low toxicity to normal cells reported in the literature, the predicted ADMET profile, and its affinity and stability when forming complexes with these SARS-CoV-2 enzymes, hesperidin becomes an attractive multitarget drug candidate to treat COVID-19. However, further in vivo/in vitro assays are required to evaluate the proposed therapeutic use.","Ecuador","first author","2020-10-21",10

The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that usually causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is why it is part of the SARS taxonomy [19, 20] . Surprisingly, there have been warnings that coronaviruses are potential causes of a pandemic, as had been previously demonstrated by the occurrence of the SARS-CoV epidemic in [2002] [2003] , and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic arising in 2012 [21, 22] .In summary, the two pandemics of the 21st century originated from different viruses, but they have some points in common, such as the fact that they were both caused by enveloped RNA viruses, usually of spherical morphology (see Fig 1) [23, 24] . Other points that call attention are related to the frequent mutations and diversity of the hosts that can be infected [19, 25, 26] . Thus, due to the importance of epidemiological knowledge of the two recent pandemics, this study was carried out to review and synthesize the epidemiological aspects while showing the particularities that differentiate between the pH1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics regarding clinical findings, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention/treatment.The pH1N1 began at the end of March 2009 and continued until August 2010. The first cases were recorded in Mexico, with subsequent spread to the USA and then the whole world. Thus, after three months, the number of confirmed cases by the WHO was 94,512 in 110 countries, with at least 429 deaths registered [27] . Later, with nine months of influenza A (H1N1) virus circulation, the number of detected cases increased significantly, as can be seen in Fig 2A [28] . At the end of pH1N1, 18,500 deaths were confirmed by WHO [29] . However, the study by Dawood and colleagues suggests that these numbers were underestimated and suggested the total number of deaths was actually between 151,700 and 575,400 [30] . Currently, the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has continued to circulating in human seasonally since the end of flu pandemic [31, 32] .During the pH1N1, it was observed that the most affected age group comprised of children and young adults. Dawood and colleagues found that out of hundreds of confirmed cases of influenza, a total of 40% of patients were aged 10 to 18 years, while only 5% of cases were adults over 51 years of age [33] . One explanation for this age distribution suggests partial immunity to the virus in the older population [34] .The comorbidity was a risk factor for swine flu. Although some studies only show that about half of deaths from the disease have other cofactors, it is important to note that the incidence of comorbidity increases with age, but the incidence of influenza tended to be higher in young groups. The most common comorbidities identified in patients who died of A H1N1 influenza were hypertension (23%), diabetes (5.7%), obesity (4.2%), neurological diseases (4%), renal failure (3.8%), and pneumopathy (3.7%) [35, 36] .An epidemiological study in the USA, it was observed that the swine flu hospitalization rate decreases according to age of patients increases. Thus, the hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 117, 84, 70, and 90 for peoples with aged 0-17 years, 18-64 years, over 65 years, and all ages, respectively [37] .The current COVID-19 pandemic began in the middle of December 2019 after several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology had been reported in Wuhan, China. It is possible that the outbreak started in early December or November, with the number of cases increasing rapidly in the coming months, eventually spreading to more than 203 countries and territories (Fig 2B) . As of September 20, 2020, a total of 30,835,922 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed worldwide, with 957,790 deaths [17, 18, 38] .The causative agent of the outbreak was quickly identified, and its genomic sequence was made available on January 12, 2020. Because the genomic sequence was closely related to the 2003 SARS-CoV, the novel CoV was identified as SARS-CoV-2 [19] . Besides, studies have found that this virus probably originated from bats but may have been amplified in an intermediate host before transmission to humans [39] . Thus, pangolins have been proposed as a potential intermediate host; however, the zoonosis of pangolins-SARS-CoV-2 needs to be clarified [40] . In addition, although much has been learned about COVID-19 in the nine months since this outbreak began, but there remain significant knowledge gaps in understanding COVID-19 at current stage [41] .The age group most affected by COVID-19 has been adults over 40 years old (~73%), while only 10% of cases are under 30 years old. Thus, COVID-19 hospitalization rate increases according to age of the patients. This positive association shows that individuals over the age of 85 years have the highest rate of hospitalization (833 positive cases in each group of 100,000). Soon after, the hospitalization rates are 460/100,000, 116/100,000, and 17/100,000 for patients over the age of 65 years, 18-49 years, and 0-4 years, respectively. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 170 per 100,000 population in the USA [42] [43] [44] [45] .The prevalence of comorbidity is high in people hospitalized with COVID-19. It is noteworthy that a large proportion of patients aged 60 years and older presenting multiple chronic diseases. The most common conditions contributing to deaths involving COVID-19 were influenza and pneumonia (42%), respiratory failure (34%), hypertension (21.7%), cardiac arrest (12.3%), diabetes (16%), ischemic heart (11%), and vascular and unspecified dementia (11%) [46] .One of the key factors in the epidemiology of infectious diseases refers to the transmission efficiency of the pathogen. In this regard, the influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 are both efficient in causing respiratory disease because they easily spread among humans through oral and nasal droplets.Additionally, they can also be transmitted via indirect contact (see Fig 3A) [47] [48] [49] .The course of an epidemic is defined by several key factors, some of which are represented by the effective reproduction number R0 (also called the basic reproduction number), defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical case in a particular population [50] . Based on this epidemiological concept, the COVID-19 transmission patterns have been better identified. Consequently, it is known that the R0 of COVID-19 has been approximately 3 (95% CI 2.65-3.39), which is superior to that of influenza A (R0=1.3-1.7) [51] [52] [53] [54] .Regarding the pre-symptomatic transmission of pH1N1, few studies have documented about infectiousness during the pre-symptomatic phase. Consequently, only three studies had this purpose, with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f two of them finding evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission of the virus among close contacts [55] [56] [57] .On the other hand, it appears that pre-symptomatic transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 infections could be somewhat common and would have a significant contribution to the overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate. In this context, highlight the study by He et al., which inferred that 44% of secondary cases were infected during pre-symptomatic stages of disease [58] .Referring to preliminary data on the overall case-fatality ratio, calculated from total numbers of reported deaths by the number de reported cases, in the first three months of each pandemic, the casefatality ratio were 0.45% and 4.7% for pH1N1 and COVID-19, respectively [27, 38] . Subsequently in the pH1N1, the values were 0.15-0.25%, while during the COVID-19 pandemic; the overall case-fatality ratio was estimated to be 3.1%, which was calculated by using different populations (Fig 3B) . For the two pandemics, the case fatality rates vary widely, and over time, possibly because of adequate/inadequate healthcare, coinfections, comorbidities, and patient demographics (i.e., older patients), which suggests considerable uncertainty over the exact COVID-19, and pH1N1 case fatality rates [11, 27, 59 ].Among the pH1N1 and COVID-19 cases, there are similarities in the clinical spectra. However, COVID-19 cases tend to be more severe as they often evolve to SARS, with these patients needing hospital care for several days [60], mainly because they need mechanical ventilation support.For pH1N1, the incubation period was 1.5-3 days, but sometimes it extended to 7 days [61] . For COVID-19, the incubation period is usually longer (2-14 days), with an average of 5.2 days. The clinical picture usually tends to start with fever and cough that is sometimes accompanied by a sore throat and myalgia (see Fig 4) [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] .For the laboratory diagnosis of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, clinical samples including a swab of the throat or nasopharynx, a saliva sample or aspirate of the lower respiratory system are indicated, with the collections being representative of the acute phase of the disease [64] . Additionally, samples of whole blood or serum/plasma can be collected in the acute and convalescent phase to be paired with other samples and provide evidence of serological conversion. Rapid techniques for detecting the influenza virus include immunofluorescence and immunoenzymatic assays [66] [67] [68] . For both viruses, real-time RT-PCR represents the gold standard technique [69] . Rapid immunochromatographic tests will be extremely important for mass screening of individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic [70, 71] . Another option for detecting SARS-CoV-2 includes diagnostic imaging, which is obtained by computed tomography of the chest, but this technique is limited by its low specificity [72] .For infectious diseases of epidemic potential, several mitigation measures are indicated to reduce transmission and delay the spread of the infectious agent. These measures are extremely important when the transmissibility of the disease is high and when a high proportion of cases require hospitalization [73] .These measures to contain the rapid viral spread are even more important when there is the emergence of a new highly contagious disease for which there are no drugs or vaccines available. There are ten J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f measures to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases: 1) frequent hand hygiene with soap and water/or disinfection with 70% alcohol gel; 2) periodic disinfection of surfaces with 70% alcohol or 1% sodium hypochlorite targeted at different segments of society and public places; 3) social distancing to keep a distance of approximately 2 meters between people and instruction to avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth; 4) isolation of sick people; 5) contact tracking; 6) quarantine of exposed people; 7) school closing; 8) changes in the workplace (home office, delivery works); 9) prohibition of all types of gatherings; and 10) restricted travel [74] .In 2009, pH1N1 was combated with the dissemination of daily reports by the media. In these reports, proper handwashing procedures and avoiding close contact among people were highlighted.However, some regions of the countries most affected by pH1N1 adopted other measures to contain the virus, including the social isolation of some segments of society. In this scenario, the United States, Mexico, Singapore, Canada and China (Hong Kong) adopted measures of social distancing in the workplace and in schools [75, 76] . Additionally, school closures were one of the main pillars of the response to prevention of pH1N1 because the age group most affected was children and young people [30] .In the pH1N1, Mexico was one of the few countries that adopted the most stringent measures of social isolation from April 23 to May 11, 2009 . Initially, these measures were implemented in the metropolitan region of Mexico City, with social isolation persisting for approximately two weeks, including forced school closures and the closure of all economic activities considered nonessential for approximately ten days. Subsequently, part of these measures was adopted across the country [77] .However, for the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown was adopted with the closing of companies, schools and public places, and social isolation and travel restrictions were intensified in various regions of the world to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [78, 79] . Consequently, due to these factors adopted in several countries, the current pandemic will plunge the world into a serious economic crisis.The vaccine against H1N1 infection was the most effective prevention and control measure, as it prevented the virus from spreading and mitigated the severity and impact of the disease. Thus, the experience with vaccines against seasonal influenza allowed for small adjustments and the addition of the representative pH1N1 strain to the vaccination. The result was immediate, and approximately five months after the first cases started, China was the first country to start mass vaccination [80] .Another factor that mitigated the impact of pH1N1 was the existence of guiding principles for the treatment of the disease. Thus, due to the knowledge generated from combating the circulation of different strains of seasonal influenza, antiviral treatment was already well established, such as the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). Therefore, in the first cases of pH1N1, safe and effective antiviral drugs were already available for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of H1N1. This was extremely important, as it contributed to reducing the length of hospital stay, reducing the risk of disease progression to a severe clinical condition and reducing the rate of contagion [81] .In contrast to pH1N1, the COVID-19 pandemic does not have an antiviral drug or vaccine available. Thus, given the high number of hospitalized and severe cases of the disease, added to the high contagiousness of the virus and the entire population being exposed to infection, it is extremely urgent to establish treatments and vaccines against the current pandemic. Consequently, a rapid search for potential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated a few months ago [82, 83] . The most practical way to obtain antivirals is to test other known antivirals or other established drugs. This contributes to a time gain, since some safety parameters of the medication are already known, for prompt availability of the medication on the market. Initially, remdesivir, (hydroxy)chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, nitazoxanide and nelfinavir were proposed as antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 [84, 85] . Many of them have been tested in compassionate therapies, including the use of convalescent plasma, in patients with severe COVID-19 [86, 87] . However, for a better understanding of their effectiveness, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are required.It is believed that the humanitarian and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will contribute to new platforms for the next generation of vaccines aimed at accelerating the development of vaccines. Following this path of producing something with unprecedented speed, the first candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine entered human clinical trials on March 16, 2020. Since then, 78 vaccine candidates have been confirmed as active. Some of these are already in the clinical development phase (Phase I) and include 1) an encapsulated mRNA vaccine encoding S protein; 2) an adenovirus type 5 vector that expresses S protein; 3) a DNA plasmid-encoding S protein delivered by electroporation; 4) dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigene based on domains of selected viral proteins of selected proteins; and 5) artificial antigen-presenting cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigene of selected viral proteins. Given the emergence of the pandemic, it is estimated that a vaccine will be available in early 2021 [88, 89] .Funding: VGC was supported by scholarships from Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior-Brasil (CAPES).

Comorbidities were present in 110 (60. 8% [18.2%] ). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111The novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 [1], was first detected in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, China, in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to many other countries worldwide becoming an unprecedented astounding and devastating pandemic in a short period of time.Following an exponential upward trend, the increasing number of cases and death toll remain to concern the scientific community around the globe. Currently, more than 13.8 million cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 593,000 deaths [2] . The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was detected on February 26, 2020. Standing out worldwide for having one of the steepest epidemiological curves, the country has 2.04 million confirmed cases and more than 77,800 deaths so far [3] . As the most populous areas, the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have predictably concentrated the highest numbers of cases and deaths. Thus far, Brazil has been considered the new epicenter of the global pandemic [4] .In general, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients develop mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic over the course of the disease. An intermediate group of patients have moderate symptoms requiring hospitalization and some noninvasive intervention. Another group of patients have a more severe course of the disease with desaturation, dyspnea, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction leading to life-threatening consequences or death [5] .Patients with cancer are more likely to have severe complications and even death when affected by COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] , mainly due to the effects of the immunosuppressive anticancer treatments, frequent use of corticosteroids, advanced age, comorbidities and pulmonary involvement (primary tumors or secondary lung metastases). Particularly in low-and middleincome countries, COVID-19 has brought a heavy burdening to the public health systems and induced new planning and adjustments in the clinical approach to cancer patients [9] .Based on a few series previously published around the world, data evaluating the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in management and survival of patients with cancer are still very scarce, incomplete, with heterogeneous outcomes and descriptions [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Brazilian data in this specific field are still unknown due to the lack of publications.The aim of this report was to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory abnormalities of cancer inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital ward of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), exploring factors associated with death.This retrospective cohort was performed through a search on electronic medical records and compiled data of cancer inpatients admitted to INCA with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 30, 2020 and May 26, 2020. The hospital admission occurred for various medical reasons, including COVID-19 symptoms or any other clinical condition (for those cases with onset of symptoms throughout hospitalization or cancer inpatients who had contact to other COVID-19 cases). Outpatients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients with only non-invasive cancer (or pre-malignant conditions) were not the object of this study.COVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the WHO interim guidance [16] , in which confirmation was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal-and oropharyngeal swab specimens using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reagents and protocol [17] . Specimens were collected right after the hospital admission from those patients with COVID-19 symptoms and immediately after clinical suspicion from those admitted to hospital for diverse reasons unrelated to COVID-19.The study was approved by the National Commission of Ethics in Research (CONEP) and conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective design and the emergency feature of the research. Only anonymized data were analyzed.The demographic and clinical characteristics, including tumor site, histological subtype, staging, site of metastases, cancer treatment within the last 60 days, the presence of comorbidities, COVID-19-related clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory tests at diagnosis and throughout hospitalization were obtained from the electronic medical records. COVID-19-specific clinical treatments were also collected. The variables analyzed in order to feature disease severity were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, renal failure, hemodialysis, septic shock, and death. Patients transferred out from INCA to another hospital were censored on the date of transfer. Patients who had not been discharged from hospital were censored in the date of the last follow-up on May 31, 2020.The statistical software package SPSS, version 21.0 (São Paulo, Brazil) was used for the analyses performed by accessing the database between June 1st and 6th, 2020. All continuous variables were evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality. Categorical variables were shown in percentages or absolute values. The study endpoint was COVID-19-related mortality. Time of follow-up was calculated from the date of swab collection to hospital discharge, death, or censorship of patients who were transferred or still hospitalized at the end of the study.Risk factors for death were assessed using logistic regression. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Variables with a P-value < .20 at the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model by stepwise forward selection with the entry order based on their level of significance. All P-values < .05 were considered statistically significant.A total of 181 patients had the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed at INCA and were considered eligible for this study. The median follow-up for the general population was 5 days (interquartile range, IQR 2-10.3).The demographic and clinical characteristics are described in detail in Table 1 . The mean age was 55.3 years (standard deviation, SD ±21.1) and 92 (50.8%) patients aged 60 or older. Female gender was more prevalent (110 [60.8%]) and 40 patients (22.1%) were former or , and 21 (11.6%) patients had three or more comorbidities. Long-term use of corticosteroids was seen in 21 (11.6%) cases. ) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. A more detailed list of the frequency of cancers by site is detailed in the supporting information section (S1 Table) . Patients with metastatic disease accounted for almost half of the cases (90 [49.7%]) and 32 (17.7%) patients had lung metastases. More than a third of the cases (63 [34.8%]) had recently undergone cytotoxic chemotherapy within the last 60 days before the COVID-19 diagnosis, 32 (17.7%) were in best supportive care and 27 (14.9%), in post-treatment clinical surveillance. Only nine patients (5%) were receiving targeted therapy or immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors as the current treatment line (Table 1) .Information regarding the conditions of hospital admission and clinical evolution of patients are summarized in Table 2 -1488) , the mean C-reactive protein levels were 19.4 mg/ dL (SD ±15.0) and median D-dimer levels were 2099 ng/mL (IQR 909-5948).Under the clinical diagnosis of a severe acute respiratory syndrome, where influenza infection was considered one of the causative hypotheses and before the final RT-PCR result was confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection, oseltamivir was administered to 41 (22.7%) cases. During the course of COVID-19, more than half of the patients (98 [54.1%]) received corticosteroids, 148 (81.8%) were treated with antibiotics (including those against bacterial coinfections), and therapeutic anticoagulation was prescribed to 39 (21.5%) patients. Eight (4.4%) patients received chloroquine and 36 (19.9%), ivermectin.At the time of analysis, a total of 60 patients (33.1%) had died due to COVID-19. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52/138) and for hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma) was 23.5% (8/34). Four out of seven (57.1%) patients with lung cancer died from COVID-19, as well 52.5% (21/40) of breast cancer patients (Fig 2) .As shown in Table 3 , mortality related to COVID-19 was significantly associated to older age (P < .001 for patients between 60 to 74 years and P = .002 for patients aged 75 years or older), metastatic cancer (P < .001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02). Isolated or combined comorbidities and elevated D-dimer levels did not demonstrate increased risk of dying from COVID-19.Different modalities of cancer therapy, including systemic agents (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy), surgical procedures or radiotherapy within 60 days before COVID-19 were not associated with mortality. Also, specific therapies during the COVID-19 course, such as oseltamivir, therapeutic anticoagulation, corticosteroids, ivermectin and chloroquine did not influence the risk of death (S2 Table) . According to the multivariate analysis patients admitted due to COVID-19 symptoms (OR 2.3, 95% CI-1.1 to 4.9, P = .027) and with two (OR 10.0, 95% CI-3.6 to 28.3, P < .001) or more metastatic sites (OR 14.8, 95% CI-4.1 to 53.2, P < .001) showed a significantly higher risk of COVID-19-specific death.The findings of this cohort highlight, in detail, several significant aspects of the COVID-19 course in patients already diagnosed with cancer. Although the emergency period for case selection was considerably short, due to the large number of cancer patients admitted to INCA with COVID-19, 181 patients were successfully included for analysis. Women had greater representation, more than half of the patients aged 60 years or older and almost a quarter of the patients had also reported smoking. Patients with two or more comorbidities accounted for more than a quarter of the study population as well, in which hypertension and diabetes prevailed. Almost half of the patients (83 [45.9%]) were hospitalized due to conditions unrelated to the SARS-CoV-2 infection which can be explained by patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 having been admitted to hospital for other cancer-related clinical complications. An intra-hospital transmission may also be considered, raising an important issue about the remarkable risk of infection to patients admitted for elective procedures. As for the symptoms present at diagnosis, similarly to data of other series [7, 8, 10, 12, 14] , in the current cohort, dyspnea, cough and fever were all highly frequent.The odds of some COVID-related complications were quite similar to the findings reported by Kuderer et al.(14) in an international prospective series in which more than 928 patients were analyzed. The rate of ICU admission of 14% (versus 17.7% in the current study) and the mechanical ventilation requirement rate of 12% (versus 19.3% in the current study) were also alike in proportional terms. Zhang et al. [6] also showed paralleled data with respect to other variables such as the demand of supplemental oxygen in 78.6% of cases (versus 71.8% in the current study).Early data from non-cancer patients suggested that 14-19% of cases progress with severe complications, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and multiple organ failure [5, 15, 18] . In the present study, these rates were much higher, ranging from 18.2 to 38.7%, highlighting the increased likelihood of severe complications in cancer patients. Conversely, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events were less frequent.In total, 69 (38.1%) of 181 patients died. Herein, COVID-19-related mortality was considered as the endpoint. Consequently, nine patients who clearly have recovered from COVID-19, and died due to other cancer-related reasons, were excluded from this mortality analysis. Therefore, the overall COVID-19-related mortality rate reached almost one third of the cases (60 [33.1%]), which was higher than that reported by other series with cancer patients [7, 8, 10, 12, 14] , and far exceeding the mortality reported for non-cancer patients [5] . It is important to point out that some patients had the definition of non-invasive support after or even before the diagnosis of COVID-19 due to the severity of their advanced malignancies, which may have overestimated the mortality rate. In addition to this, a noticeable number of the analyzed patients (103 [56.9%]) were under non-curative treatment or best supportive care at the time, reflecting the advanced stage of their respective diseases. Unlike in the multicenter studies recently published by Mehta et al. [10] and Dai et al. [15] , the mortality rate was higher in patients with solid tumors than in patients with hematological malignancies, possibly due to the small number of hematological patients in this cohort. But likewise, lung cancer, breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer stood for the highest numbers of cases progressing to death.In line with the results published by Kuderer et al. [14] , the characteristics associated with clinical fragility, such as being elderly, having advanced stage, a greater number of metastases, pulmonary metastases, non-curative treatment or supportive treatment and symptomatic patients at hospital admission were significantly associated with a higher risk of death. In this same context, the type of anti-cancer treatment received by patients within the previous 60 days did not influence survival outcome.Except for the association of C-reactive protein with mortality (OR 1.04; p = 0.002), none of the laboratory markers were likely to predict a higher risk of mortality. Other laboratory exams, including inflammatory markers such as lactate, ferritin, fibrinogen, and lactate dehydrogenase were not regularly collected in this cohort, preventing related analyses. A prospective study in order to evaluate the immune response markers in our cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19 is being currently conducted. As in the study performed by Kuderer et al. [14] , none of the specific therapies prescribed such as antiviral oseltamivir (used for the initial suspicion of influenza infection), therapeutic anticoagulation, ivermectin or chloroquine influenced the risk of death in the current cohort. The strong association between the use of antibiotics and the outcome of death can be explained by the fact that these patients showed a more serious condition than COVID-19, including coinfections.Lastly, finishing on a positive note, some strengths of the current study can also be recognized. The Brazilian National Cancer Institute is the most important national reference center for the treatment of cancer patients through the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS), with a high admission charge, enabling a quick inclusion of patients for this study.This was one of the largest series ever undertaken to explore the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically in cancer patients. Throughout the analysis, many variables were presented, allowing us to explore the possibility of their association with risk of death. Ultimately, this is the first set of Brazilian data in this field, ever.Some important limitations are also worth mentioning in this study. As a single-center cohort in a country of continental proportions, such as Brazil, a selection bias may well exist, hindering an external validity. The missing data rate for some variables was considerably high due to the retrospective design of the study. There was no paired sample with non-cancer patients with COVID-19 or cancer patients without COVID-19 to provide a better comparison between the outcomes of morbidity and mortality. Due to the in-hospital follow-up only, there was no report of long-term morbidity. Finally, the general population of the study was very heterogeneous with several types of neoplasia and anti-cancer treatment, making it difficult to design a more reliable portrait by tumor site.Like other comorbidities, cancer is suggested to be an important prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19, probably due to the greater clinical fragility and the negative impact of immunosuppressive treatments. Despite having formulated early institutional emergency measures, since the onset of the pandemic in Brazil, to reduce the exposure of this group of patients to SARS-CoV-2, INCA had a considerable burden of infected patients in need of hospitalization. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high.Supporting information S1 ","Brazil","first author","2020-10-26",10

It is caused by several etiologies such as: (influenza A, dengue, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, hantavirus and coronavirus), and other agents (pneumococci, other bacteria, Legionella sp., leptospirosis, etc.) [2] .Regarding viral etiologies, they have been shown to be capable of causing major epidemics in the world, such as those caused by two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV characterized in 2003 by SARS in China, which spread to 29 countries and regions, and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The transmission of both was through respiratory droplets in a direct and indirect way and most of the cases proved to be mild [3] .Coronaviruses are single tape RNA viruses with envelope. The glycoprotein (S) peaks around the spherical verion give the virus its characteristic ""halo appearance"", i.e., a crown in electron microscopy. Six [16] .with an average age of 53 years (59.48%), being similar to a study [17] in non-indigenous patients hospitalized for SARS/COVID-19, however the average age was 62 years, but approaching the results of two other studies with patients hospitalized for SARS by in non-indigenous patients, in one the average was 55 years, and in the other 50 years [18, 19] .Therefore, there are no discrepancies between the average age and sex, between indigenous and non-indigenous people in SARS by COVID-19.In relation to sex, it was significant in the deaths the male (66.80%) with a mean age of 64 years. A large study with 17,278,392 cases, and in relation to the deaths that were 10,926, identified the male gender and higher age as a predictor for mortality by COVID-19 [20] .Another survey compared the deaths by COVID-19 from Italy 1,625 and China 1,023, and both were significant in individuals over 70 years, however the lethality in Italy was higher (7.2%) because the infected were older, already in China was (2.3%) [21] . In these studies, cited were not specifically with indigenous people, but it is observed the similarity in the variables associated with death by COVID-19.The most evident signs and symptoms in this study were fever (74.23%), cough (77.71%,) sore throat 35.62%), dyspnea (69.34%), respiratory discomfort (62.80%), O2 saturation <95% (56.42%). These results were similar in several studies [22] [23] [24] [25] , showing the classical picture of SARS associated with pulmonary involvement, evidenced by imaging examination, such as chest tomography [26] . This was also evident in this study the radiographic alterations in 36.53% of the cases. The Brazilian Ministry of Health established criteria for the definition of clinical diagnosis-imaging, in the impossibility of performing the molecular test or epidemiological link, and thus associated with the clinical characteristics the tomography should evidence by one of these changes: opaqueness in bilateral, peripheral frosted glass, with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines (""paving""), or opaqueness in multifocal frosted glass of rounded morphology with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines (""paving""), or sign of reverse halo or other findings of pneumonia in organization (observed later in the disease) [1] .The presence of risk factors and comorbidities (45.89%) of the cases was also evidenced, as well as associated to the deaths (54.04%). The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic heart diseases (18.97%) and diabetes (18.97%). However, the only significant comorbidities separately associated with deaths were chronic heart diseases (24.46%). Being corroborated by several researches [33] [34] [35] , However, the studies also showed not only heart disease as a factor of complications and deaths, but also diabetes, obesity and chronic lung disease, specifically the most significant comorbidity in these studies was hypertension and diabetes. A meta-analysis with 1,527 cases, showed that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases, were evident two to three times more in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 in Intensive Care Unit, than those who were in the ward, as they also highlighted the systemic complications, the most evident being the acute cardiac injury in 8%, directly associated to mortality [36] . In this way the results meet the literature.For the variable ""to be vaccinated against the flu"" there was significance in the survivors (26.18%). A research in Italy over 65 years old with high vaccination coverage of influenza, detected the association with a reduced spread and a less severe clinical expression of COVID-19 [37] . A study highlights that mass immunization against influenza in the COVID-19 pandemic aims to minimize cases of co-infection that can be a factor of severity and mortality, as well as protecting risk groups that are similar in both diseases [38] . Thus, a similar result is shown in those vaccinated against influenza as a protection factor for severity of COVID-19, however there are no studies explaining this mechanism.It was possible to evidence the clinical characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Indigenous Brazil, from the data of SIVEP-GRIPE. They are mostly male, both in cases and deaths, in cases of adults and older deaths, the most common signs and symptoms being fever, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort and O2 saturation <95%, however the signs and symptoms associated with the deaths were dyspnea and O2 saturation <95%. The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic heart disease which was associated with deaths and diabetes.Another relevant finding was that those vaccinated against influenza died less than those not vaccinated, showing a possible relation of protection in influenza vaccine, however there is no scientific explanation so far.It is emphasized that Brazil's public and health policies are directed towards controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the indigenous populations, since it has been shown that the disease evolves in the same intensity in this group, however the indigenous have vulnerabilities that can potentialize the impact of this pandemic on this population.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-27",10

COVID-19 Therapies in Brazil: Should We Be Concerned with the Impacts on Aquatic Wildlife?","in comparison to 2019. In a country where only 46% of domestic wastewater is treated, what can we expect from the effects of these drugs and their metabolites on aquatic wildlife? The environmental fate and ecotoxicity data for IVM indicate varying degrees of toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and the potential to accumulate in several aquatic organisms. The CQ compound was classified as harmful to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment. As for HCQ, it has been tagged as posing insignificant environmental risks in the pre-pandemic scenario despite its environmental persistence.Fragile Brazilian biomes, such as the Amazon (North region), Caatinga and coastal region of the Northeast and the Atlantic Rainforest (Southeast region) are of particular concern given the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in these areas. The large-scale use of unproven drugs in response to the pandemic may add undue weight to the increased volume of pharmaceuticals entering the environment, leaving the local biota vulnerable to the harmful effects of these contaminants. A nationwide coordinated response is urgently needed to monitor the levels and investigate the impacts of these emerging contaminants.Keywords: aquatic toxicology, contaminants of emerging concern, pharmaceuticals, risk assessmentBrazil is currently the Latin American epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, whose impacts have permeated the economic, social, and healthcare spheres. Amidst its worst sanitary crisis, the country has also been struggling with anti-science political narratives that promote the widespread use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and more recently the antiparasitic ivermectin (IVM). As a result, an increased demand for these pharmaceuticals has been observed across the country with sales increase by more than 50% in comparison to 2019 (CFF 2020).This steep increase in the use of such drugs, however, may pose risks to Brazil's highly biodiverse biomes -an issue that overlaps with the country's precarious wastewater treatment situation. Data from 2018 indicated that almost half of the Brazilian population does not have access to sewage collection; the Northern and Northeast regions (historically at economic disadvantage) are particularly vulnerable since only 10.49% and 28.01% of their inhabitants have access to adequate sanitation ( Figure 1) . Nationwide, 46% of collected sewage is treated, but high treatment rates (above 80%) are observed in only 21 of the 100 largest cities (Instituto Trata Brasil 2019). Such poor sanitation conditions have detrimental effects on human health and the environment.Many contemporary pollutants are pharmaceuticals, which are concerning due to their toxicity to aquatic organisms, ever increasing amounts, and relative chemical stability.Organ damage, reproductive toxicity, hormonal disruption, behavioral changes, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity are some of the reported effects of widely used drugs on various amphibian, fish, and invertebrate species (OECD 2019). In Brazil, pharmaceuticals are particularly important as emerging pollutants due to selfmedication, inappropriate disposal of unused or expired medications in the toilet or common garbage and the lack of efficient wastewater collection/ treatment to remove chemical wastes, as well as lack of regulations establishing environmental acceptable concentrations (Quadra et al. 2017) .A wide variety of pharmaceuticals for human or veterinary use (e.g. analgesics and anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, hormones, caffeine, etc.) and personal care products (triclosan) have already been found in Brazilian water bodies (mainly rivers, reservoirs, and potable water) (Quadra et al. 2017) . These water samples, mostly obtained from the Southeast region of Brazil, indicates the looming threats of these compounds since this region has the largest rate of sewage collection and treatment ( Figure 1) . Thus, with a massive increase in the use of CQ, HCQ and IVM in Brazil This article is protected by copyright.

Environmental fate studies on IVM have shown that this hydrophobic compound may persist in soil and sediment, as well as accumulate in various aquatic organisms leading to various degrees of toxicity, with larval instars of invertebrates being particularly vulnerable (Mesa et al. 2017 ).In turn, CQ and HCQ are aminoquinoline drugs widely used in the prevention and treatment of malaria despite the gradual reduction of their use in regions with reported resistant Plasmodium strains. HCQ is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite the limited data on CQ toxicity to aquatic wildlife, Zurita et al. (2005) were able to classify this compound as ""R52/53 Harmful to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment"". For HCQ, data on its environmental effects are even more scarce; the available information tagged this compound as an insignificant environmental risk in the pre-pandemic scenario despite its persistence (Health and Medical Care Administration -Region Stockholm 2015).In Brazil, efforts to identify and mitigate the effects of these drugs on ecosystems are compromised due to the absence of a robust regulatory framework for emerging contaminants. The current legislation sets limits for some herbicides and agricultural products in surface waters, but largely ignores pharmaceuticals. In the absence of regulations to establish monitoring practices or maximum contaminant levels for these Bubble sizes represent the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (x100,000) registered until August 6, 2020 (The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University database).","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-02",10

The disease is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , (1) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 .The transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets and close contact, or in aerosol generating procedures, (1) leading to a rapidly progressive einstein (São Paulo). 2020;18:1-7 spread of the virus. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Local cases have been reported in almost all countries. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Radiology plays an important role since chest computed tomography (CT) has proved to be a useful tool for evaluating the disease in the lungs, its extent, differential diagnoses and complications. Although its widespread use in screening is not recommended in a non-resource-constrained environment, (6, 7) it may also be used for suspected cases in different clinical scenarios. (7) Chest radiography, although less sensitive, (8) can be used for patient follow-up. The same applies to lung ultrasound, which emerged as an auxiliary tool for point-of-care follow-up of severe cases of COVID-19, in critical care units. (9) Radiology departments embrace a wide range of activities and had to find some innovative solutions to face the demands of the pandemic, while maintaining their essential routine operations. (10) (11) (12) Reorganizing processes in a radiology department to face a pandemic, considering quality and safety, has been a new challenge, and an organized and detailed description of the measures required was not available in the literature.We describe our department policies for COVID-19 preparedness focusing on the necessary solutions, distributed into five main topics, as follows: preparing for the increased demand of imaging examinations; quality of care and safety of COVID-19 patients undergoing tests; safety of the healthcare team involved in examinations; the ordering physician; other patients and hospital environment.Our Radiology Department is part of a not-for-profit private hospital. In 2018, the hospital had 579 beds and performed 5,131,194 diagnostic laboratory and imaging tests.Initially, our main concern was the capacity to meet the increasing demand for CT ordered by the emergency department. Our current capacity for CT in this setting is 180 exams per day, performed in three different scanners (one dedicated to the emergency department and two shared with inpatient units). We predicted to reach full capacity within two months after our first COVID-19 case, when the peak of cases was expected. In order to be prepared, we decided to work in phases, in which a new CT scanner (a positron emission tomography/CT -PET/CT -and the single photon emission/CT -SPECT/ CT) machine was located in the nuclear medicine area, and the devices of the outpatient's clinic could be also be used (outpatients' scheduled exams had been canceled at this point). A CT scan protocol was setup and staff were trained in all these locations anticipating their recruitment. By implementing these measures, our capacity would increase from 180 to 504 exams per day. Distant control capability was enabled in case of shortage of technicians due to infection, so that one professional could remotely operate the equipment, if necessary.After 2 months, our experience showed the number of chest CTs ordered by the emergency department for COVID-19 infection increased at a rate slower than what was initially projected. The peak of demand reached 51 tests per day (mean of 32), demanding less than 30% or our current capacity ( Figure 1 ).For hospitalized COVID-19 patients we initially predicted low usage of imaging resources, and that was confirmed during the first days of the pandemic. The initial experience showed one CT every 14 days of admission at the intensive care unit or stepdown unit, and one CT every 22 days of admission in inpatients units. Table 1 summarizes the CT usage for inpatients during the first two weeks of our experience. The most important task in performing outpatient imaging tests during the pandemic has been to identify suspected or positive patients as soon as possible, preferably before arriving at the radiology department, to apply the correct safety measures. That was accomplished by means of an electronic self-service queue token (Figure 2 ), which asked simple questions regarding signs or symptoms of respiratory infection. In case of positive answer, the administrative team was automatically activated, and the following procedures were implemented: a surgical mask was offered, hand hygiene was recommended and the nursing team was activated. The nurses wore personal protective equipment (PPE) and assessed the symptoms in more detail. When respiratory symptoms were identified, the team employed a series of precautions: to ensure the patient kept a surgical mask throughout the stay at the organization; to ensure a private space for the patient, apart from the general waiting room; to implement contact, droplet and aerosol precautions for the professional team involved in patient's care, including the correct use of the PPEs, such as safety glasses, N95 mask, gloves and gown ( Figure 3) ; at the end of the exam, the nursing staff, after changing gloves and gowns, cleaned the equipment and contact surfaces; if suspected or positive COVID-19 patients remained without a mask during the exam, and if an aerosol generating procedure was performed (in the radiology department the most relevant procedure is orotracheal intubation for tests under anesthesia), the exam room was isolated for two hours for passive air ❚ RADIOLOGIST PREPAREDNESS Although our Radiology Department counts with specialized thoracic radiologists, all medical staff were trained to recognize the typical imaging findings for COVID-19 pneumonia, and a set of confirmed case images were provided for review and self-assessment. A structured report was developed to optimize the workflow (Appendix 1). (13) To improve knowledge about the typical radiological findings of COVID-19, online lectures were prepared by thoracic radiologists using digital platforms, including question and answer sessions. Classes were presented online, to avoid crowding. These education innovations are necessary in pandemic scenarios, as observed in past outbreak experiences. (14) The number of radiologists working at the hospital was reduced and home office was implemented. All educational and administrative meetings were adapted to be held remotely. Special care was taken to provide home office for the staff over 60 years of age, and for employees with health conditions that could be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 infection.Ultrasound of COVID-19 patients were carried out on the bedside to avoid their transportation. All staff involved, including radiologists who perform all ultrasound examinations at our organization, received specific training for donning and doffing and use of appropriate PPEs. All COVID-19 patients were allocated in negative pressure rooms and were oriented to use surgical masks at all times ( Figure 4 ). to request CT only for patients with severe symptoms and requiring hospitalization. Clinical signs and symptoms for indicating CT comprise oxygen saturation <93%, respiratory rate >24 breaths per minute, as well as dyspnea and abnormal lung auscultation.To facilitate communication, our department provided a telephone list for direct contact with each radiologic specialty, available 24 hours/seven days a week. Ordering physicians were oriented to no longer visit the reporting room for case reviews, thus avoiding possible contamination of the room and radiology staff. Screen sharing and Web conferencing were strategies adopted for case discussion. Audiovisual reports sent by messenger applications were another strategy used to enhance the clinical discussions with no in-person meetings.The thoracic radiology staff prepared an assertive structured report focused on the pandemic (Appendix 1). Of special note, the subjective evaluation of lung parenchyma involvement of more or less than 50% was included, since our physicians considered this piece of information important in the algorithm for decision making regarding hospitalization. (15) (16) (17) We created a special flag in our reporting system to prioritize imaging studies performed with the clinical indication of suspected or confirmed COVID-19, aiming to optimize report release and streamline decision-making process.Also, an unexpected finding suggestive of COVID-19 infection in chest CT ordered for other clinical indications is considered a critical finding, and follows the same algorithm created to meet the Joint Commission International quality and safety standards, since our organization holds its accreditation. Technicians were trained to recognize suspicious findings on chest CT and promptly call radiologists.All radiologists were also oriented to contact ordering physicians as soon as possible, within 1 hour. The same process applies to other CT exams that incidentally find signs of COVID infection (e.g. abdominal or spine CT).We created different paths throughout the organization to receive patients testing positive (or suspected) or negative for COVID-19, who were submitted to imaging tests, using almost exclusive staff, equipment and waiting rooms for each group of patients. Extreme care The imaging modality of choice to assess COVID-19 patients is chest CT. (7) Ordering physicians were instructed einstein (São Paulo). 2020;18:1-7 was taken to perform imaging tests in separate location for inpatients to prevent hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection. Now the peak of infectious cases is passing, providing a safe and reliable environment is crucial for patients who require exams for indications other than COVID-19-related evaluation.Like ultrasound, almost all radiographs are performed on the bedside. The same decontamination protocols must be used after examining patients infected with coronavirus, and PPEs are crucial. Specific ultrasound machines and portable X-ray machines were assigned for exclusive use in COVID-19 patients (Figure 4 ).To ensure safety of patients who need hospital care in this pandemic, the organization adopted some measures to reduce patient visits, and postpone outpatient examinations and surgical procedures. Medical consultations by telemedicine were encouraged.The hospital offers a special clinic for all health professionals involved in care of COVID-19 patients, who present respiratory symptoms, with rapid testing and isolation, whenever necessary. It is important to note that in addition to therapeutic measures to treat positive cases, psychological support is available to all those engaged in the fight against COVID-19. Keeping communication channels open with the leadership is very important to identify staff under stress.Since there is community transmission of the infection, all staff, including administrative team, were advised to use a surgical mask to avoid transmission among workers and patients. Additionally, the temperature of every worker is measured upon arrival to work, by means of a forehead thermometer or a fully automatic artificial intelligence assisted facial thermal imaging (developed in-house). Table 2 summarizes the recommendations for radiology department preparedness. The diagnostic process of individuals with COVID-19 directly involves the radiology department. In the context of a highly contagious disease, measures to protect the healthcare team and patients must be taken. In addition to minimizing the potential risks of contamination of contacts, rapid diagnosis can be decisive for prognosis. Tan et al. had suggested labeling the suspected COVID-19 studies with 'high alert' for easy identification and rapid communication of results. (18) Some studies have already recognized the effect of complications of healthcare-associated infections, including increased morbidity and mortality of patients and healthcare staff, longer length of stay, and requiring additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. (19, 20) Of note, this organization protocol is dynamic and has been improved daily, as new information about COVID-19 becomes available. We hope this pandemic context raises awareness for the adoption of continuous infection control practices.We detailed the quality and safety innovations of our Radiology Department to meet the demands of a new reality during a pandemic crisis. Our aim is to assure quality of health services provided and safety of our patients and employees. Describing our experience, we expect to provide useful information and examples of innovations that can help other radiology departments. Some of the newly applied measures will certainly remain in practice once the outbreak is over.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-09",10

Human coronaviruses represent a major problem for human health and impose a tremendous economic burden (Keogh-Brown and Smith, 2008; Paules et al., 2020) . These viruses are considered a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide, as seen with the past SARS and MERS outbreaks (Kim et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2018) and the current COVID-19 global pandemic (Peeri et al., 2020) . Globally, as of 10:52am CEST, 24 September 2020, there have been 31,664,104 confirmed cases of including 972, 221 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020). Viral respiratory infections are known to be spread by contact (direct or indirect) with secretions expelled by the infected person, or through air via droplets and aerosols (Kutter et al., 2018) . Contact transmission can happen when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person (direct contact) or surfaces (fomites) where viruscontaining droplets expelled by an infected person have been deposited (indirect contact) (Morawska and Cao, 2020) . Transmission of viruses through air can happen via droplets or aerosols generated during coughing, sneezing, talking, singing or breathing (Jones and CoV-2 is that most studies performed only focused on the detection of viral RNA and do not correlate to the infectivity of these viral particles. There is an inherent high technical complexity that also hampers the confirmation of the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, requiring viral replication to differentiate viable from non/viable virus and including a number of particular methodological requirements, namely proper specimen selection, collection, transport, and storage that preserve viral infectivity (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) .provided recent guidelines recommending that handling of material with high concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, such as when performing virus propagation, should be performed only in laboratories capable of meeting strict containment requirements and practices (Biosafety Level-3), limiting the number of institutions capable of assessing aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viability (Blacksell et al., 2020; CDC, 2020) .Considering the many structural and genetic similarities between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Petrosillo et al., 2020) , and taking into consideration previous studies about SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that point out the potential for airborne transmission of these viruses (Eissenberg et al., 2020; Kutter et al., 2018; Olsen et al., 2003; Pyankov et al., 2018; Qian and Zheng, 2018; Ramanathan et al., 2020; Tellier et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2011) , the likelihood for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very high (Morawska and Cao, 2020; Tellier et al., 2019) . However, to date, only five studies have provided information on SARS-CoV-2 viability in air (Binder et al., 2020; Lednicky et al., 2020; Lednicky et al., 2020a; Santarpia et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Thus, there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. An opportunity for advancing research in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof is by comparison to the viability of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, in this systematic review, the viability/stability of aerosols containing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses will be discussed to provide information on potential mitigation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission.The present review includes studies published in the past 18 years (1 january 2002 to 25 september 2020), since the emergence of SARS-CoV (WHO, 2002) and MERS-CoV (WHO, 2012) , in the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus. No language restrictions were imposed during the search, retrieving only one article in Chinese. With no prior review articles on this topic, an exhaustive search was made, and published research articles were included.The following search terms were used: -SARS‖, -MERS‖, -airborne‖, -viability‖, -stability‖, -virus‖, -aerosol‖, -coronavirus‖, and -air sample‖. A total of 27 articles were found with potential interest from the initial search and their titles were screened based on their context of research. From those, 20 articles remained, and their abstracts were appropriately reviewed. After this, exclusions were performed based on the following criteria: i) if the virus studied was SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2; and ii) if the viability of the virus sampled from air was assessed. Using these criteria, 18 articles were excluded and 10 additional relevant articles were found while reading the selected articles, with 1 article being excluded. Summarizing, 11 articles were reviewed in detail. Figure 1 shows the flowchart with the number of studies identified and included/excluded following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al., 2009 ).The databases were independently screened by all authors, and relevant information J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was extracted. Differences on opinions about whether to include an article or not were solved by consensus between all the authors.The selected articles evaluated concerning the objective of the research, sampling site/methods and main conclusions are compiled in Table 1 .Viral infectivity is defined as the capacity of the virus to attach and enter the host cell and use its resources to ultimately produce new infectious virions (Rodríguez et al., 2009 ).In the case of enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses, viral entry is initiated by the interaction of the viral particle with specific proteins on the cell surface. After initial binding of the receptor, these enveloped viruses fuse their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their capsid to the target cell (Belouzard et al., 2012) . The capsid also confers protection to the viral genome by preventing its degradation by nucleases and other abiotic stresses. Therefore capsid integrity is a critical attribute for the virus to successfully infect a host cell (Cliver, 2009 ).Among the reviewed literature, only a few papers explored viral viability in air samples (Agranovski et al., 2004; Binder et al., 2020; Booth et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2016; Lednicky et al., 2020; Lednicky et al., 2020a; Pyankov et al., 2018; Santarpia et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2013 van Doremalen et al., , 2020 Xiao et al., 2004) . Remarkably, the majority of the literature focuses exclusively on the detection of viral RNA in air samples (Cheng et al., Aiming at simplifying the determination of viral infectivity, alternative strategies to cell culture and TCID 50 determination have been explored. These strategies resort typically combining RT-PCR with a pre-processing step aiming at deconvoluting viable from non-viable virus particles prior to amplification (Goyal and Cannon, 2006) . A few examples of these methods are (1) enzymatic pre-treatments (such as ribonuclease) (Escudero-Abarca et al., 2014; Monteiro and Santos, 2018; Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002; Rönnqvist et al., 2014) ; (2) pre-treatments with intercalating dyes for detection of damaged capsids (Leifels et al., 2015; Moreno et al., 2015; Parshionikar et al., 2010; Randazzo et al., 2018) ; (3) porcine gastric mucin binding (Dancho et al., 2012; Kingsley et al., 2014) ; (4) antibody binding (Ogorzaly et al., 2013) ; and (5) integrated cell-culture PCR assays (Blackmer et al., 2000; Dunams et al., 2012) . Overall, developments in these alternative viral infectivity analytical strategies, largely unexplored in the context of current and past coronavirus pandemics, is of paramount importance to enable not only routine fundamental insights into the effective spread of the virus and its societal impact, as well as enabling effective biosensing strategies for on-site determination of viral infectivity. Both these currently unpaved avenues are critical to uncover the true impact of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2. Lednicky et al., 2020; Razzini et al., 2020; Santarpia et al., 2020; Santarpia et al., 2020a Santarpia et al., , 2020b Zhou et al., 2020) .Previous work with SARS-CoV showed that viral RNA, as well as viable virus, were found in air samples (Booth et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2004) . Several other studies have reported that SARS-CoV airborne transmission was the main transmission route in indoor cases studied in Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital Xiao et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2005) , health care facilities in Canada (Booth et al., 2005) and in aircraft (Olsen et al., 2003) . These results suggest that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be transmitted by aerosols and cause disease, therefore supporting potential airborne transmission.The presence of MERS-CoV was also confirmed by RT-PCR of viral cultures of 4 out of 7 air samples from two hospitals in South Korea (Kim et al., 2016) , and showed to be very stable in aerosol at 20°C and 40% relative humidity (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Furthermore, the virus demonstrated relatively high robustness in the airborne form under controlled laboratory conditions (Pyankov et al., 2018) , suggesting that MERS could also be transmitted by aerosols.Although not investigating SARS-CoV-2 viability, some studies suggested that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f airborne transmission might occur (Buonanno et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Hamner et al., 2020; . reported that up to 73% of infected patients reported having had no contact with a person with respiratory symptoms or exposure to relevant contaminated areas, which could be explained by a possible airborne transmission of the virus. Ong et al., (2020) also showed that air outlet fans located high on the wall behind the bed of one infected patient were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that virus-containing aerosols produced by the isolated patient were displaced by airflow and deposited on the vents.Moreover, sampling methods and environmental conditions are very important factors to consider when studying viral viability and stability in aerosols because air sampling techniques can also affect the viability of virus recovered from air (Tseng and Li, 2005; Verreault et al., 2008) . Problems such as inefficiency at the collection of fine particles, dehydration of viruses during the collection process, damage of the viruses during collection due to impaction forces resulting in the loss of viability of some or all the collected viruses, re-aerosolization leading to the loss of viruses from the collection media, and losses due to viruses being trapped by the inlet or the samplers' wall should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of experiments involving air sampling. Noteworthy, samplers based on technologies such as the water-based condensation are considered more suitable for these studies (Pan et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018) .Physical characteristics of the environment such as ultraviolet light (UV), temperature, relative humidity, as well as wind currents and ventilation systems, are critical environmental factors that will determine the settling time of airborne particles (Alonso et al., 2015) .There are three types of UV light: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (280-320 nm), and UVC (200-280 nm) . UVC is known to be absorbed by RNA and DNA bases, resulting in the photochemical fusion of two adjacent pyrimidines into covalently linked dimers, which in turn lose the ability to pair with each other (Perdiz et al., 2000) . Previous studies have shown that UVC is able to inactivate aerosolized coronaviruses (Darnell et al., 2004; Walker and Ko, 2007) , with more recent studies on the subject reporting that simulated sunlight is also able to inactivate airborne SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the hypothesis that persistence and exposure risk to airborne viruses might vary between indoor and outdoor environments Schuit et al., 2020) Temperature is another significant factor for virus survival because it can affect the state of viral proteins and the virus genome (Price et al., 2019) . Temperatures above 60 °C for more than 60 min are thought to be sufficient to inactivate most enveloped viruses, and depending on the presence of any surrounding organic material such as saliva, the virus might be insulated against extreme environmental changes (Tang, 2009) . In a study by Pan et al. (2019) , it was reported that artificial saliva could better protect infectious viruses from deactivation by preventing viruses of reaching the air-water-interface, possibly due to the complex structure of the mucin component. In a similar study, Woo et al. (2012) reported that the inactivation efficiency of droplet and aerosolized viruses under different humidity levels and UV irradiation at a constant intensity were low in artificial saliva, indicating that solids present in it might exhibit a protective effect.The relative humidity is also significant for virus survival and stability because phospholipid-protein complexes in enveloped viruses are usually more likely to denature in the air at medium to high relative humidity. In contrast, the protein coats of nonenveloped viruses denature easier at low relative humidity (Sobsey and Meschke, 2003) , which explains why most enveloped viruses tend to survive longer at a lower relative J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f humidity (Tang, 2009 ). In addition to that, when faced with high humidity, such as in tropical regions as the Amazon rainforest where relative humidity values can get close to 100% during the rainy season, viruses are associated with larger droplets that settle down much faster, which can be a limiting factor to transmission (Yang and Marr, 2011) .In an attempt to study the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the SARS-CoV, a study found that low temperature and low humidity was able to prolong survival of virus on contaminated surfaces (Chan et al., 2011) . The same was found to be true for MERS-CoV. A study reported the stability of MERS-CoV at 20°C and 40% relative humidity; 30°C and 30% relative humidity; and 30°C and 80% relative humidity, and concluded that MERS-CoV was more stable at lower temperature and lower humidity conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . In another study, two sets of climatic conditions were used in order to establish the inactivation of MERS-CoV: one represented the common indoor office environment (25°C and 79% relative humidity) and the other represented the climatic conditions of the Middle Eastern region where the virus outbreak started (38°C and 24% relative humidity) (Pyankov et al., 2018) . Authors found that the virus had a better survival rate at a lower temperature, with virus decay being higher in hot and dry air.In a recent study, atomic force microscopy was applied to investigate the topographical changes of SARS-CoV-2 virions exposed to high-temperature treatments, reporting that after the treatment, the virus had much fewer less distinct spikes, their trigonal shape not being able to be resolved, suggesting heat-induced inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (Kiss et al., 2020). Another study reported that the virus was stable at 4 °C in virus transport medium, but sensitive to heat, and that at 22 °C and 65% relative humidity had a negative effect on viral survival on smooth surfaces (Chin et al., 2020) .Other studies have reported the effects of humidity and temperature on SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f transmission based on meteorological data and statistical analysis (Auler et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Méndez-Arriaga, 2020; Meo et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020; Yao et al., 2020) . Although all of them have reported a correlation between temperature and relative humidity and the number of new COVID-19 cases, there is still some controversy regarding whether one or both variables have a positive, negative or no effect on the number of new cases. The main outcomes of these studies are presented on Table S1 (supplementary material).Given the genetic and structural similarities between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, one might suggest that higher temperatures and relative humidities could have an impact on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual (Meyer et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed.Moreover, it should be noted that although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can give us an idea of how SARS-CoV-2 might behave, using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to predict the behaviour and spread patterns of SARS-CoV-2 is not advisable, as these three viruses are different, and SARS-CoV-2 might not necessarily follow the same patterns as the aforementioned viruses and more studies are needed in this subject to determine how these environmental variables might impact the virus transmission.Other factors, such as human mobility patterns and contact rates, should also be taken into consideration as contributing factors to the different transmission rates in different countries (Badr et al., 2020) . In developing countries such as Brazil and India, other transmission routes (e.g., the contact and droplet routes) may account for the increasing number of cases rather than the airborne route, as these countries are very densely populated, have overcrowded accommodations and lack of access to basic services, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f therefore enabling the contact and droplet routes of transmission and spread of the virus.These individual and collective factors such as political, social, economic and cultural conditions should be considered when analyzing the spread of the virus in these countries, as they may play a more significant role than temperature and relative humidity (Auler et al., 2020) . Specific measures such as quarantines and lockdowns can also affect the incidence of the virus, as different countries have different approaches and mitigation strategies to deal with the pandemic.Among the reviewed literature, only a few papers explored viral viability in air samples, which is probably due to the difficulty and limitation of many research groups regarding BSL-3 facilities. Nonetheless, efforts should be directed towards the development of novel or adapted analytical methods to reliably and systematically determine the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as this would enable not only routine fundamental insights into the effective spread of the virus and its societal impact, as well as enabling effective biosensing strategies for on-site determination of viral infectivity as previously mentioned.Currently, there is still debate about whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through aerosols produced by infected people during talking, singing sneezing, coughing and breathing, and further studies regarding this route of transmission are needed in order To explore the feasibility of a new personal bioaerosol sampler for monitoring of viable airborne SARS virus.PC4 facility with HEPA filters installed in the pipeline connecting sampler and vacuum pump to prevent the equipment contamination.Contaminated air was bubbled through porous medium submerged into liquid and subsequently split into multitude of very small bubbles.The particles are scavenged by these bubbles, and, thus, effectively removed.Natural decay of the virus in the collection fluid was around 0.75 and 1.76 log during 2 and 4h of continuous operation, respectively. A much higher decay rate (2.58 log) was observed for the bubbling through viral suspension in sterile water.Yes. The device filled with virus maintenance fluid was capable of providing a relatively low level of microbial decay and can be evaluated for monitoring of such microorganisms in the air. W. Xiao et al., (2004) SARS-CoV-1To assess the risk of aerosol transmission in SARS patients admitted to a hospital through testing the air samples.Air samples were collected from 7 wards and 1 balcony of the hospital, 3 times a day for 3 continuous days.The bioaerosol sampler type FA-2 was used. RT-PCR was used to amplify the N protein gene of the SARS-CoV.The residual solutions were inoculated into prepared cell cultures to isolate live virus. The positive samples were then identified by indirect immunofluorescence assay and sequence analysis of the PCR products. Air sampling was performed using a high-resolution slitsampler system and samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV by RT-PCR and cell culture isolation.PCR-positive viruses were collected from wet and dry air samples but results of viability assays of the samples for infectivity in Vero-E6 cell culture were negative.No. Not specified.Kim et al.,To study the possible contribution of contaminated hospital air and surfaces to MERS transmission. A suspension containing virus was prepared and aerosolized aerosolised to the experimental aerosol chamber by a 3-jet Collison nebulizer nebuliser at the flow rate of 6 L/min of HEPAfiltered compressed air over 2 mins time. Then the nebulizer nebuliser was switched off. The experiments were performed for two sets of parameters of the air. On completion of sampling at each time interval, the bioaerosol samplers were disconnected and aliquots of collecting liquid were acquired and analyzed analysed by end-point titration in Vero E6 cells.

Aerosols (<5 μm) containing SARS-CoV-2 (10 5.25 50% TCID 50 per milliliter) or SARS-CoV-1 (10 6.75-7.00 TCID 50 per milliliter) were generated with the use of a three-jet Collison nebulizer nebuliser and fed into a Goldberg drum to create an aerosolized aerosolised environment. All samples were quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells. SARS-CoV-2 nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) and SARS-CoV-1 Tor2 (AY274119.3) were the strains used.SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of the experiment (3 hours), with a reduction in infectious titer from 10 3.5 to 10 2.7 TCID 50 per liter of air.Yes.

This is something that is happening in Peru, in which preliminary findings reported by the Ministry of Health showed that among people who died from COVID-19, 85.5% had obesity as assessed by BMI.Overweight and obesity continues to be a major public health problem in Peru. It varies with sex and geographic regions. It is known that obesity is more prevalent in Peruvian women (26%) than Peruvian men (19.3%). Currently, 22.7% of Peruvian population have obesity, and the individuals with weight excess, including overweight and obesity, reached 60%. 2 These two conditions are strongly related to prediabetes and diabetes, which exhibit a prevalence of 22.4% and 7%, respectively, in the Peruvian population. 3 All the risk factors mentioned above are part of an entity that is currently termed metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and the proposed criteria are based on histological, imaging or blood biomarker which evidence of fat accumulation in the liver in addition to one of the following three criteria: overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. 4 The worldwide prevalence of MAFLD is estimated to be 24% 5 ; however, this prevalence may be underestimated because Currently, national programmes have been implemented in Peru focused only on reducing malnutrition, which can broaden their scope and objectives to consider these increasingly prevalent health problems, with primary educational preventive strategies and timely diagnosis in vulnerable populations. 7 In conclusion, because of the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, the implementation of effective health strategies focused in health promotion and primary prevention in developing countries is important to help decrease the rates of these diseases and establish a diagnostic protocol for MAFLD, as preliminary studies have highlighted the association between this pathology and its risk factors and the mortality and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Currently (25 September 2020) , there are 32,110,656 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the world, with 15,987,906 million cases in the Americas and 4,624,885 million in Brazil [2] . However, this scenario is dynamic and changes every day. The highest number of cases have been observed in the United States of America, India, Brazil, the Russian Federation, Peru and Colombia [2] .In Latin America countries, especially in Brazil (with 138,977 confirmed deaths on 25 September 2020), which is an emerging country with a high level of social inequality, and in urban and densely populated areas, the health and economic effects will be even more harmful and deleterious [2, 3] .COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which mainly affects the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems [4] . Factors linked with an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 include comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and a lower functional capacity [5] [6] [7] [8] . Poor lifestyles such as physical inactivity could worsen this scenario as it is related to impaired immune function and the increased risk of illness [9] [10] [11] .Conversely, physical activity could be an important tool in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases associated with increased COVID-19 mortality [10, 11] . Moreover, moderate levels of physical activity could improve the health status and quality of life and prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19 because it meliorates immunity and health-related physical fitness [5, 12] . Nieman et al. [8] showed that higher levels of physical fitness reduced days with an upper respiratory tract infection and the severity of symptoms during the winter and fall, which are common cold seasons.Maintaining an active lifestyle during social isolation is very important for general health but especially for those with risk factors and morbidities such as elderly people [6, [13] [14] [15] . Physical activity might be essential because the elderly is the main risk group and needs to maintain social isolation. In order to maintain the levels of physical fitness and good physiological functioning to preserve most organic systems including the immune system and to face the mental and physical consequences of COVID-19 [6, 16] , regular physical activity practice is essential.The COVID-19 pandemic brought up the discussion of the importance of having healthy habits because social isolation could have a negative impact on physical activity levels, quality of life and health-related physical fitness [17, 18] . In this regard, an international online survey found that the sitting time increased in the range of 5-8 h/day as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak [19] . Goethals et al. [20] showed the number of seniors attending physical activity programs during the COVID-19 outbreak decreased significantly and concluded that public health campaigns are necessary to communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain adequate physical activity levels at home. Constandt et al. [21] showed that self-reported physical activity levels decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown among Belgian people. This was associated with having less time available, sitting more and missing a familiar environment. A demographic cross-sectional study in Portuguese adults showed that strategies for promoting well-being during periods of social isolation should consider lifestyle habits according to the gender or age [22] . It seems important to understand the impact of these changes in the population in order to support public health policies and decisions.Additionally, understanding the profile of sociodemographic variables is important for health and public authorities to make decisions to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [23] . The assessment of sociodemographic variables (such as sex, age, income and education level) will allow the analysis of the negative impact of social differences and inequality on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [24] mainly in a country with serious social inequalities such as Brazil.For these reasons, the aim of the present study was to present the sociodemographic profile (age, sex, state and city of residence, marital status, religion, income and education level) of a convenience sample of Brazilian people according to physical activity levels and the relationship with COVID-19 aspects. Our hypothesis is that lower levels of physical activity place people at greater risk for presenting symptoms and infection by COVID-19.This study was an online survey designed and applied via Google Forms. Data collection was carried out in May 2020 from day 1 to day 31. It was at the moment when the scenario in Brazil was with 374,898 confirmed cases and 23,473 deaths and under rigid social isolations measures such as the closure of schools, gyms and places that could induce agglomeration as well as restrictions for public gathering, social distancing and the mandatory use of face masks [2, 25, 26] . When this article was written (September 2020), Brazil ranked second in the world in terms of the number of deaths due to COVID-19, with the USA in the first place [2, 27] .Our convenience sample consisted of adults (women and men) from different regions of Brazil (n = 1726 respondents). The average age of our total sample was 40.5 ± 11.2 years, the mean of the group <60 years (37.2 ± 8.7, n = 1521) and ≥60 years (65.7 ± 3.9, n = 205). The inclusion criteria were to be Brazilian, over 18 years old and to accept the study terms:""You are being invited to participate, as a volunteer, in the study ""Evaluation of the knowledge of the Brazilian population about COVID-19 through an online survey"". We believe it is important to know about the population's knowledge in order to develop preventive measures and try to contain the spread of the virus"".The exclusion criteria were not answering all of the research questions and not completing the questionnaire according to the proposed aims. An online questionnaire (https://forms.gle/ vzWqCCJ5dD4UYFVDA) was created with closed questions about the participant's individual and sociodemographic characteristics, which were (1) age, (2) sex, (3) state and (4) city of residence, (5) marital status, (6) religion, (7) income, (8) education level and (9) physical activity levels. Multiple choice questions about COVID-19 were also included, which were (10) presence of symptoms of COVID-19, (11) diagnosis of COVID-19 and (12) health professionals (yes or no); if yes, (13) worked with people affected by COVID-19. Our questionnaire was created from the verification of issues listed from scientific literature and practical experience mainly in the field of epidemiology and public health associated with the pandemic of COVID-19.The physical activity level profile during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated according to the following question: ""On a scale of 1 to 5, being 1 (I am very little, not very physically active) and 5 (I am very, very physically active) that would be given today-in this exact moment-regarding your level of physical activity?"" The questionnaire (with 13 questions) was prepared and made available on the online platform Google Forms and disseminated through social networks in order to reach the largest number of people possible in a short period of time. Our questionnaire was published on Facebook and Instagram and was shared in personal and professional profiles.All participants read and agreed with the research procedures. The research was evaluated and approved by the university's ethics committee and followed Helsinki's principles for human studies (CAAE-31540620.9.0000.5505).For the descriptive analysis of categorical variables, frequency (n) and percentage (%) were calculated. To compare the level of physical activity with the variables of interest, the chi-squared test was used. When necessary, the Likelihood Ratio test was used. A significance level of 5% (p-value < 0.05) was used. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 19 (Chicago, IL, USA). Table 1 shows sociodemographic data (present by absolute (n) and relative (%) values) categorized by physical activity levels. More than one third of participants referred to level 1 (lowest classification according to the classification criteria used) of physical activity and only 6% referred the highest classification (level 5). The same pattern was observed with regard to questions, the answer (No) being the most prevalent: Have you experienced symptoms of COVID-19? 84.5%; Did you have a confirmed diagnosis for COVID-19? 98.2%; Are you a health professional? 64.4% but ""yes"" was also expressive (35.6%); and If so, are you assisting people with COVID-19? 67.9% but ""yes"" was also expressive (32.1%). Table 2 shows the comparison of sociodemographic variables regarding COVID-19 in relation to the level of physical activity. The results in bold presented the highest absolute (n) and relative (%) values in the different categories and possibilities of answer. It was observed that participants who showed symptoms of COVID-19 had a higher percentage of level 1 (36.6%) of physical activity when compared with participants who did not show symptoms of COVID-19. Participants who did not show symptoms of COVID-19 had a higher percentage of levels 2 (21.1%) and 3 (25.8%) of physical activity than participants who showed symptoms of COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to present the sociodemographic profile of Brazilian people according to the current level of physical activity (n = 1726) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our main results were that the majority of participants who showed symptoms of COVID-19 were those who presented level 1 of physical activity (36.6%), which, according to our classification criteria, was the lowest level of physical activity. Most participants who did not report symptoms of COVID-19 were those who reported a higher percentage of level 2 (21.1%) and 3 (25.8%) of physical activity; that is, from low to moderate level. This preliminary result, despite having to be better understood, may point out that the maintenance of some level of physical activity is associated with a lower presence of symptoms of COVID-19.One possible explanation for the association of COVID-19 symptoms and physical activity level is that the regular practice of physical activity, as well as high levels of physical capacity, are related to an improved immune function and a decrease in immunosuppression and chronic inflammation associated with the aging process and subsequently lower risk of illness and pulmonary infections [8, 28, 29] . The lack of protection for COVID-19 symptoms in those with higher levels of physical activity might be explained by the J shaped curve that reflects the association between physical activity and immune function and risk of illness, with increased risk for both those who have very low and very high levels of exercise [7] .However, we should highlight that our study was not able to establish a causal relation; therefore, it might also be possible that people with COVID-19 symptoms were less prone to perform physical activity due to functional limitations or fear.Notwithstanding, our results suggest that regular physical activity might be recommended by health professionals and health authorities. In this regard, previous studies presented suggestions of how to perform physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic with special attention paid to resistance training [15] , exergames [16] and interval training [14] . These protocols usually involved home based activities and also highlighted their use on special populations [13, 30] , which allows the respecting of the measures of isolation and social distance.Dowd et al. [23] pointed out that understanding the profile of sociodemographic variables is important for governments to make policy decisions rapidly and mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, through sociodemographic studies it was possible to verify that the most serious cases and deaths were concentrated in people aged 60 years or older as well as with morbidities. It should be noted that 11.9% (n = 205) of our sample was people aged 60 or over and with low levels of physical activity. This is very important information for health systems around the world.This information becomes even more interesting because physical inactivity is a pandemic by itself and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [10, 31] ; a problem that was probably accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic [32] . Hall et al. [32] pointed out that the world is confronted with two pandemics at the same time: COVID-19 and physical inactivity. In this sense, aggressive efforts need to be taken to get people physically moving during and after COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] [16] 32] . After all this chaos it is important that humanity learns lessons and improves health outcomes under normal conditions and resiliency and material and human infrastructure in the context of health and education to future pandemics.A fact that was clear in our sample was that for almost all sociodemographic variables and the questions associated with COVID-19, the answers focused more on level 1 of physical activity, which was the lowest level of classification in our sample. We observed, in a statistically significant way and in a large sample (n = 1726), that participants who presented symptoms of COVID-19 were also those who reported a higher percentage of level 1 of physical activity (36.6%) and those who did not present were those who reported levels 2 (21.1%) and 3 (25.8%) of physical activity. This information per se can help public managers in the construction of public health policies that reinforce the importance of moderate levels of physical activity for a healthier society. Currently, there is nothing more powerful than the acquisition and processing of information, including sociodemographic data, to assist in coping with situations such as this. As Subramanian and James [33] pointed out, using an existing rich data-science infrastructure, countries can provide vital data and insights to guide appropriate health actions to COVID-19 and to prepare for the next pandemic.As in all questionnaire (and cross-sectional) studies, the answers involve subjective and personal perceptions and are only a ""snapshot of reality"". In a scenario such as this of collective and individual social insecurity it is possible that perception is altered. We also did not use a validated questionnaire to assess the level of physical activity. We used only one question in order to classify levels 1 to 5 (i.e., from very, very little to very, very high). Our intention in doing so was to increase adherence and facilitate people's understanding because, in general, questionnaires to assess the level of physical activity are long and often require the assistance of trained professionals. Despite being an important limitation, it is not a fatal concern because we applied the questionnaire on a large scale. With this study, a large sample was able to understand and provide important sociodemographic data related to some aspects of COVID-19 in relation to the levels of physical activity despite the possible regional differences in Brazil. This could help to cope with the current scenario as well as in future pandemics. Other important limitations are the impossibility of establishing causal relations between variables and the limitation of reaching only people that have access to internet and are familiar with online questionnaires.In addition, with the assessment of sociodemographic variables it is possible to see how much social differences and inequality influence the scenarios such as those provided by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of adequate social protection and welfare programs aimed at people in a state of social vulnerability during the pandemic, countries in situations such as Brazil need to implement flexible and effective policies and legislation in order to minimize any harmful effects. These impacts may vary according to sex, age, income and education level as well as access to public and private health services [24] . This whole scenario has a significant impact on the state of health and quality of life individually and collectively.Our next and prospective steps are to understand the impact of age, socioeconomic status and social inequality, which is unfortunately very serious in Brazil and has a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity of patients who have been infected by the disease and living in different regions, in terms of the level of physical activity and the effects of social isolation on mental health and level of physical activity and different exercise types [34] in health, risk groups, and people aged 60 or over.In our view, to improve health outcomes regarding the multiple negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, public managers should be guided by scientific data for political decisions. This should also extend to the post-pandemic of COVID-19. It is likely that the pandemic of physical inactivity has worsened even more and that social isolation will have harmful effects on the mental and physical health of the Brazilian population. In addition, Brazil's brutal social inequality only further aggravated this scenario. Our main result was that people who had symptoms of COVID-19 were those who also had the highest prevalence of level 1 of physical activity (lowest) and those who did not show symptoms were those who had the highest percentage of levels 2 and 3 of physical activity. Thus, it is possible to assume that higher levels of physical activity could positively impact individual and collective health and be a tool in the field of public health to cope with scenarios such as the one we are experiencing. This cross-sectional study in the Brazilian population provided important sociodemographic data and COVID-19 aspects regarding the level of physical activity, which could help in facing the current and future similar scenarios.

As of 30 June 2020, this disease still continues to take its toll and has led to a major tragedy with 10 185 374 confirmed cases and 503 862 deaths in more than 200 countries, areas or territories [1] . The disease evolves rapidly and has a notable dynamic structure. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that COVID-19 may still show a rising trend with around 80 000 new notifications per day in the near future [1, 3] . Importantly, the confirmed cases and deaths of this disease vary greatly owing to the differences in disease surveillance and detection capacities among countries, thus causing an obvious underestimation in some countries severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak [4] . Regrettably, there is a current lack of the determined clinical treatment method and available vaccines for this serious disease [5] . Therefore it is necessary to formulate effective planning for the health infrastructure and services under dynamic demand in order to curb and harness the continued spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accurate forecasting of the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality is essential to manage and instruct the demand to the health system [6] [7] [8] .Time-series analysis is of great value in developing hypotheses to understand the past and current epidemic patterns of infectious diseases and to predict the dynamics in the upcoming future [4, 6] . Model-based mathematics and statistics have emerged as useful tools to analyse and estimate time series [9, 10] . For public health officials, such an estimate plays an important role in allocating limited health resources rationally and in directing when and which health interventions should be adopted to alleviate the disease outbreak [4, 6, 11, 12] . Recently, a great number of mathematical and statistical techniques have been deemed as policy-supportive tools to model the prevalence, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in different countries [10, 13, 14] . For example, Saba et al. used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARNN) to forecast the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt [11] . Ceylan et al. constructed several suitable ARIMA models to estimate the COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain and France [4] . Chen et al. built a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network method to model the potential transmission processes of COVID-19 from bats to humans [7] . Sotgiu et al. proposed a new third-degree polynomial curve to simulate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related mortality in Italy, Germany, Spain and New York State [8] . Sarkodie et al. developed five dynamic statistical techniques to assess the COVID-19 prevalence across China [15] . Cássaro et al. constructed a simple approach of growth to model the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in various countries [16] . Wan et al. used a susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) method to analyse the epidemic dynamics and trends of COVID-19 in Wuhan [17] . Al-qaness et al. developed an optimisation method based on the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China [18] . Bekiros et al. built a stereographic Brownian diffusion epidemiology model (SBDiEM) to track the outbreak trends [19] . The epidemiological trends of COVID-19 are driven by many various factors (such as climate change [20] , government interventions [21] , virus variation [22] etc.), which intimated that the spreading mode of the COVID-19 pandemic is characterised by secular tendencies and irregular fluctuations. For this reason, the above-mentioned methods have a limited ability to consider the tendencies and randomness simultaneously due to their linear or nonlinear assumption, which affects the extrapolation of the results [4] .More recently, a new technical indicator, α-Sutte Indicator, is proposed by Ahmar [23] , which was originally developed to analyse and estimate the stock movements by taking the opening price, the closing price, the highest price, the lowest price and the volume of transactions on the stock into consideration [23] [24] [25] . The α-Sutte Indicator may have the potential to accommodate the problems encountered in the above-mentioned models as it has been demonstrated that the α-Sutte Indicator can be employed to predict the trends in change of not only the stock movements but also all-time series data [23, 26] . Furthermore, the α-Sutte Indicator is relatively easy to evaluate and interpret in that it does not involve complex mathematical or statistical theories. Hence, the decision makers can have an idea of how the forecasting indicator is constructed and can depend more on this predictive tool during the decision-making process. Currently, some countries in the Americas have been hit the hardest with the COVID-19 outbreak and this disease still spreads rapidly, particularly in Brazil, Peru, Canada and Chile [1] . Given the advantage of α-Sutte Indicator and the current epidemic status of COVID-19 in the mentioned countries, this study aims to describe the epidemic situation of COVID-19 and to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in the abovementioned countries and worldwide using this advanced α-Sutte Indicator. In the meantime, the predictive ability of the α-Sutte Indicator was also compared with that of the most common use of ARIMA model in the COVID-19 outbreak forecasting [4, 11, 14, [27] [28] [29] [30] .The prevalence and mortality time-series data of COVID-19 used in this study corresponded to the period between 27 February 2020 and 30 June 2020, all these data were collected from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/ COVID-19) and the WHO website (https://www.who.int/ emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), and Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was utilised to collate database. Typically, to obtain a robust and effective model in practice, at least 50 observations and preferably 100 observations or more should be used [31] . Consequently, during the model-development process, the data samples from 27 February 2020 to 5 June 2020 (100 observations) were used for the training set, and the remaining 25 samples were taken for the testing set.The study protocol was approved by the research institutional review board of the Xinxiang Medical University (No: XYLL-2019072), and it was exempt from the institutional review board assessment since all the data analysed in this study were obtained in an anonymous format and any non-essential identifying information were not accessed. In addition, this study meets all the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki.Time-series prediction aims to use a statistical technique to nowcast and forecast future unknown series by identifying the internal rules between the past and current series. Often, time series displays correlations between successive observations. The ARIMA model is designed to make forecasts by taking correlations existing in the time-series data into consideration [32] . ARIMA model types are listed using the standard notation of ARIMA (p, d, q), herein, p signifies the order of autoregression (AR), d refers to the order of integration and q represents the order of moving average (MA). The ARIMA method is defined for stationary time series. Hence, the stationary conditions of the targeted time series should first be judged by inspecting the time-series plots and by performing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) statistic, if the time series displays a trend in change over time and the ADF statistic shows no statistical difference, indicating a non-stationary time series [33] . In this case, the time series requires to be differenced until a stationary series is obtained [34] . Afterward, the values of p and q can roughly be identified by examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial ACF (PACF) graphs of the differenced time series [34] . The 'Expert Modeler' in SPSS software and 'auto.arima()' in R software have an ability to automatically identify the best-performing ARIMA model by considering the goodness of fit measures such as a larger value of R-squared (R 2 ), a lower value of normalised Bayesian information criterion (NBIC) and the appropriate ACF and PACF graphs of the errors [35, 36] . In this study, both these two tools were used to determine the best model. After that, statistical tests were conducted for the resulting best ARIMA model. The estimated key parameters of the AR and MA should be statistically significant under the t test [37, 38] . A Ljung-Box Q test was then applied to the residual series produced by the best-fitting ARIMA model, if this statistic provided a P-value greater than 0.05, suggesting that the residuals behaved like a white-noise series [37, 38] . At this time, the best ARIMA model passed all the required checking, and then it can be used to implement out-of-sample forecasting. The general forms of the AR process, the MA process and the ARIMA process are given in Eqs. (1), (2), and (3), respectively, belowwhere ϕ and θ represent the key parameters of AR and MA, respectively, p and q correspond to the orders of AR and MA, respectively, Y t refers to the observation at time t andε t is the residual series that is assumed to be uncorrelated in the final ARIMA model.Yongbin Wang et al.α-Sutte Indicator is a novel technical analysis based on the Sutte Indicator method that was initially proposed in 2017 by Ahmar [26] . As known, the stock movements failed to be always consistent, sometimes suddenly descended and sometimes suddenly ascended, which caused less accuracy in the domain of stock forecasting using the common technical indicators such as simple moving average (SMA), moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), stochastic and Bolinger Band [23, 26, 39] . Hence, the development of α-Sutte Indicator is expected to overcome the weakness of the mentioned methods in predicting the stock movements by considering five elements of the stock movements, namely price at the time of opening, closing, highest and lowest, along with the volume of transactions [24] . Paralleling the advance in methodology, the α-Sutte Indicator is found to be not only limited to forecast the stock movements but can to perform prediction for the time series of data as it can track the dynamic dependence of certain data reasonably well [26, 39, 40] . The formula of α-Sutte Indicator can be in the form as belowwhere α t denotes the observed value at t time and α t−k signifies the observed value at (t−k) time.The forecasting reliability level between two models was assessed by different measurement metrics, including the scale-dependent measurement metrics (e.g. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)) and the measurement metrics based on percentage errors (e.g. mean error rate (MER), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square percentage error (RMSPE)). A smaller value of these measurement metrics corresponded to the best model and this optimal model was then constructed to produce the out-of-sample forecasting.In the process of predicting data, the 95% confidence limits (CL) of the out-of-sample forecasts were generated by forecasting the in-sample counterparts.where Y i refers to the original observations,Ŷ i is the prediction values, denotes the average of the original observations and N signifies the number of original observations. In this research study, we used SPSS software (version 17.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and R software (version 4.0.0, R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) to construct the ARIMA model and the α-Sutte Indicator. The statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05.Between 27 February 2020 and 30 June 2020, the overall confirmed cases were 10 By comparing the best models identified by running the 'Expert Modeler' function in SPSS software and auto.ARIMA code in R software, the ARIMA(0,2,(1,7)), ARIMA(0,2,4), ARIMA(0,2,2), ARIMA(1,2,2) and ARIMA(1,2,1) models were considered as the best specifications for forecasting the prevalence time series in the world, Brazil, Peru, Canada and Chile, respectively, as they provided a greater value of the stationary R 2 and R 2 , as well as a smaller value of the NBIC in all potential models. Also, as evidenced by the augmented Dickey−Fuller (ADF) test and the ACF and PACF plots for the differenced prevalence series (Supplementary Table S1 and Figs. S1 and S2), it appeared that these selected models are suitable. Further statistical checkingsuggested that the key parameters of these best models were indicated to be statistically significant under the t test (Table 1) , and the residuals were indicated to behave like a white-noise series because of a P-value greater than 0.05 at different lags under the Box−Ljung Q test and the sample ACF and PACF lying inside the estimated 95% uncertainty limits (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. S3 ). These results demonstrated that the chosen best ARIMA models are appropriate and adequate for simulating the prevalence data in these regions. Similarly, we could determine the best-fitting ARIMA models for the mortality time series in these five regions according to the modelling steps, and the resulting results of the identified key parameters and the statistical tests for the best ARIMA models are summarised in Table 2,  Supplementary Tables S1 and S3 , Figs. S4 and S5. Subsequently, these derived best ARIMA models can be employed to the testing sets to produce out-of-sample projections (Fig. 2) .Applying the α-Sutte Indicator to the prevalence and mortality time series of COVID-19, the resulting forecasts for the testing sets are provided in Figure 2 .To see the forecasting accuracy levels of the α-Sutte Indicator method and the ARIMA model, then the comparison of the performance measurement metrics of MAE, MAPE, RMSE, MER and RMSPE from the resulting forecasting results on the testing data using these two models was done. Looking at Table 3 , the values of the above-mentioned five indices from the α-Sutte Indicator were smaller than the counterparts from the ARIMA models in both the prevalence and mortality testing sets except for that from the prevalence testing set globally, similar results are also illustrated in Figure 2 . In the sense that the reliability level in forecasting, the α-Sutte Indicator is more appropriate for estimating the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality as compared with the ARIMA model in the study regions with an exception of the prevalence around the globe. Consequently, the next 20-day total confirmed cases and deaths from 1 July 2020 to 20 July 2020 in the study regions were predicted using the α-Sutte Indicator on the basis of the data from 27 February 2020 to 30 June 2020 besides the total confirmed cases around the globe, which were done with the ARIMA model (Supplementary Tables S4-S6 The eruption of COVID-19 has left extensive and profound impacts around the globe. In view of the current serious challenges raised by the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide, feasible and effective countermeasures are required to prevent and control the rapid increases in the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths. Early nowcasting and forecasting the spreading dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak are significantly vital for defining strategic choices not only in controlling the transmission of this disease, but also in reducing the outbreak-related deaths, moreover, it benefits for national economic development [4, 8, 41, 42] . As a result, it is necessary to construct the mathematical and statistical models with strong robustness and good reliability to estimate the duration and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak in the most affected countries. Time-series analysis is considerably helpful in forming hypotheses to analyse the epidemiological trends of different diseases and to forecast the epidemic dynamics of the target disease, and subsequently developing a quality control system based on the modelling results [4, 6, 35, 43] . As far as we are aware, this is the only study to perform time-series forecasting for the ongoing trend and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak in the world, Brazil, Peru, Canada and Chile using the advanced Chile. Worth noting that manycountries, areas or territories recently reconciliated the reported prevalence and mortality data of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus the prevalenceand mortality data used to build the ARIMA and α-Sutte Indicator models were retrospectively updated on the basis of the additional detailsprovided by WHO, so that we can develop a reliable model for estimating the epidemiological trends of the prevalence and mortality of the COVID-19 outbreak in the upcoming days or weeks. Here the forecasts for testing data are plotted as gray shaded area. As seen above, it seemed that the forecasts for the testing sets of both the prevalence and mortality from the α-Sutte Indicator yielded more sufficient prediction accuracy compared with that from the ARIMA model in the five regions except for the result from the testing sets of the COVID-19 prevalence around the globe. 6 Yongbin Wang et al. α-Sutte Indicator, and its predictive performances on the different prevalence and mortality datasets were compared with the ARIMA model which was recommended as the most frequent and powerful tool in the domain of time-series prediction [37, 38] . Our experimental results indicated that α-Sutte Indicator has priority over the ARIMA model for forecasting the epidemiological trends of the prevalence and mortality of the COVID-19 outbreak in the mentioned regions except for the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 prevalence around the globe. Furthermore, the α-Sutte Indicator produced a highly accurate prediction as a value less than 10% in all data was presented in the tested forecasting reliability measure of MAPE that is often used to assess the predictive accuracy level [44] . In summary, the satisfactory results from a series of comparative investigations confirm that the α-Sutte Indicator has an ability to track the dynamic structures of the prevalence and mortality of the COIVD-19 outbreak, which can help policymakers to determine which and when emergency macroeconomic strategies to be formulated and how to allocate the limited medical and health resources. Meanwhile, this prediction model can also be beneficial in estimating when public health interventions take effects in the study population. For example, the actual prevalence and mortality are beginning to recede, whereas we estimated a higher level using this model, implying that the measures are playing a positive role. Otherwise, additional measures may be required. Besides, given its simple structure, good flexibility and excellent potential to evaluate the data of the α-Sutte Indicator, it seems that this method may be transferable to make time-series forecasting for the trends of the epidemiological indicators (such as prevalence, morbidity and mortality) in other countries, territories or areas during the pandemic period or other types of data (such as the data with notable seasonality and periodicity). However, future studies on the additional topic are still required to verify its suitability for the application of the α-Sutte Indicator. The COVID-19 pandemic has been placing an intolerable burden on the health system capacity worldwide [45, 46] . Currently, there is a great concern on whether the countries severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have an ability to provide the sufficient number of materials and resources under dynamic demand for the infected people, such as the increased intensive care unit (ICU), the adequate medical supplies, the eventual vaccine and the like [4, 8, 47] . In this study, the upcoming 20-day total cumulative cases and deaths due to the COVID-19 outbreak were estimated using the ARIMA and α-Sutte Indicator. The resulting results show that the confirmed cases and deaths may still remain high levels around the globe with a daily average of 181 313 and 4229 cases, respectively, in the next 20 days. Brazil, the second-worst-hit country globally, may still witness an exponential trend with daily 38 687 estimated cases and 847 estimated deaths in the future 20 days. The prior experiences from some countries such as China, Republic of Korea, Italy and Germany have demonstrated that, in the absence of vaccines available, were there no strict control actions such as the lockdown and social distancing measures that have been instituted at the national levels, never would we make the outbreak under control well. Thus, given the current outbreak patterns of COVID-19 in Brazil, the government should continue to implement strict preventive and control strategies, and even more strict interventions, such as continued lockdown, keeping social distancing, an optimisation of the current tools, increasing the numbers of the mobile cabin hospitals, avoiding hospital-related infections, increasing medical personnel, increasing ICU availability, preparing isolation wards, enhancing the awareness of the general public etc. [4, 30, [47] [48] [49] [50] . Similar prophylactic measures are also expected to be carried out in Peru and Chile because the daily confirmed cases and deaths have still been noticeably rising in these two countries with daily 3676 and 4321 confirmed cases, coupled with daily 196 and 144 deaths, respectively, and seemingly they required more days to reach the plateau. Contrary to the ongoing trend of the outbreak in the above-mentioned countries, the confirmed cases and deaths are decreasing in Canada with the next 20-day estimates of 218 cases and 6 deaths per day. In all, facing the drastic threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, only under the strict intervention strategies can we hope to tackle such a wide-ranging issue.Forecasting the epidemiological trends of the prevalence and mortality of the diseases forms the basis for response to epidemics. In this time-series analysis, we focused on exploring the potential of the advanced α-Sutte Indicator and its suitability for the application to the epidemiological trend forecasting of the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality through a series of experiments. Our research suggests that this advanced model can get a more clear perspective of the trends of the epidemiological indicators of the COVID-19 outbreak in the five study regions except for the prevalence data around the globe than the most frequently used ARIMA model. The advanced α-Sutte Indicator can be recommended as a useful tool to nowcast and forecast the prevalence and mortality time series of COVID-19, which will be a useful aid for policymakers to plan and prepare health resources effectively, including medical personnel, medical protection facilities, isolation wards and ICU in response to the epidemic patterns of COVID-19 over the upcoming days or weeks. In addition, under the current outbreak trends, feasible and effective strategies are warranted to mitigate the continued spread of COVID-19.Supplementary material.

(1) (2) (3) (4) The clinical presentation spectrum is wide, from asymptomatic patients to critically ill cases. Most pulmonary infections are mild, but severe and critical cases have been described, especially in the elderly, developing with dyspnea, hypoxia, major lung involvement in imaging, respiratory failure, shock and multiple organ failure. (5) Chest computed tomography (CT) can help to diagnose the disease, mainly in the current pandemic scenario, in which real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results from nasal and oropharyngeal swabs can take a few days, although its use as a screening method is not recommended. The most frequently observed CT findings in cases of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ground-glass opacities and consolidations in lungs, with a predominantly peripheral distribution, sometimes associated with fine reticulate (forming the so-called crazy-paving pattern), vascular thickening and inverted halo signal. Central parenchyma involvement, nodules, cavities, pleural effusion or lymph node enlargement are not frequently observed. (6, 7) Cases of heart involvement by the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), developing with acute myocarditis have also been described, mainly in severe cases. (2, 8) Chest CT, however, is limited in terms of heart assessment. (9) Thus, these patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 myocarditis have been assessed by other imaging methods, such as echocardiography and cardiac magnet resonance imaging (CMR). (10) We describe the case of a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac involvement.An 81-year-old male patient came to the emergency room presenting fever (38.8°C), dyspnea and a 91% oxygen saturation at home, one day before. Real-time polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 identification was positive on a nasal and oropharyngeal swab sample. Polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens was performed and did not reveal signs of coinfection. Given the clinical presentation and risk factors for progressing to a severe case, such as age, hypertension, and history of ischemic stroke, management chosen was admission and performing chest CT. The CT study revealed ( Figure 1 ) small round ground-glass opacities, with multifocal distribution on both lungs, more evident on the left peri-hilar region, which corroborated the possibility of COVID-19 among differential diagnoses. Admission lab tests revealed high troponin T (33pg/mL; normal if <5pg/mL). An electrocardiogram was then performed (Figure 2 ), but did not show signs of ischemia, and the echocardiogram presented a reduction in the ejection fraction in relation to a previous study performed 7 months earlier (from 45% to 35%). The diagnosis of myocarditis of viral etiology by SARS-CoV-2 was considered, and an CMR requested for confirmation one day after hospital admission. The CMR revealed the presence of late enhancement areas with an ischemic pattern on the left ventricle base septum wall, along with pronounced diffuse hypokinesia, and global systolic function involvement, confirming the presumptive diagnosis of myocarditis related to the new coronavirus ( Figure 3) . The patient was treated with antibiotics, steroids and hemodynamic monitoring with increasing improvement of clinical symptoms and progressively normal laboratory tests, after 3 weeks of therapy. He was discharged on anticoagulant treatment (40mg/day), for 5 more days.COVID-19 cases with cardiac involvement, developing acute myocarditis have been described. (2, 8) Heart failure has been appointed as one of the sources of secondary complications in these patients. (8) The analysis of 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan pointed out cardiovascular complications, such as myocarditis (10% of cases), myocardial injury (20%), arrhythmias, (16%) and heart failure and shock (5%). (11) (12) (13) The mechanisms of cardiac involvement observed in COVID-19 are possibly due to direct viral infection to the myocardium or by the indirect toxicity caused by the systemic infection, and can trigger vasculitis or hypersensitivity reaction. (14) Inciardi et al., (15) reported a patient with COVID-19 and myocarditis diagnosed by CMR, who presented increased troponin, changes in segmental contractions and left ventricular dysfunction on the echocardiogram. The patient was treated with inotropic support, having improved clinically as of the first week after initiation of treatment. Another more severe case was reported by Hu et al., (2) who described a patient with the diagnosis of a fulminant myocarditis, along with diffuse myocardial edema and major ventricular dysfunction. The patient received hemodynamic support, steroids and human immunoglobulin, having completely recovered ventricular function and attained normal myocardial lesion markers after 3 weeks.In the scenario of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to consider the hypothesis of cardiac involvement, mainly in patients with abrupt deterioration of symptoms despite respiratory support measures, those with unexplained increase in myocardial necrosis markers and in patients with a new dysfunction documented by echocardiography. In face of such a possibility, CMR can be used to search for signs compatible with myocarditis, such as the presence of non-ischemic late enhancement pattern.Moreover, in suspected arrhythmia and/or myocarditis, lung fields should be carefully assessed, even by CMR, given respiratory asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals can be infected by the new coronavirus, and suspicion can be considered as of this exam. (10) The infection by SARS-CoV-2 can present cardiac manifestations, such as acute myocarditis, and monitoring and follow-up of acute heart failure are required. Complementary tests such as echocardiogram and cardiac magnet resonance imaging can help diagnostic investigation. Control of progression is indispensable, given there is still no evidence in the literature on the late development of myocardial dysfunction in these patients.","Brazil","first author","2020-10-20",10

COVID-19, a disease caused by Sars-Cov-2, started in Wuhan but rapidly spread across Asia, Europe, and America 1 . Brazil, which had its first confirmed case on February 25, 2020, almost two months after the announcement of the outbreak of the disease in China, is now the country with the second highest total number of confirmed cases 2,3 . By July 14, 2020, we accounted for 1,888,000 cases and 72,000 deaths 1 .As a new disease, despite all advances in technology and rapid genome analysis, there are no scientifically proven treatments, such as drugs and vaccines, to protect people or cure infected patients. Thus, the main recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the general population are to maintain social distance and hygiene habits such as the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and face masks, measures intended to slow the spread of the virus 4 .Furthermore, social inequalities in Brazil highlight the importance of higher isolation rates since the public health system cannot withstand high pressure. SUS, the Brazilian Public Health System, is responsible for the support of 80% of the population and could collapse if a considerable number of people contract the disease in a short period of time 5 .Moreover, people's confidence in the government is referenced as one of the critical points in handling the pandemic successfully. Nevertheless, Brazil is going through a hard time in the political sphere. As examples that directly impacts the COVID-19 battle, the health minister was replaced twice in two months and the country's president has been frequently seen in groups not complying with the medical community's recommendations, thereby influencing the population 6, 7 .Understanding data is essential for the proper care of the population. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the situation of the pandemic in other countries to explore how they dealt with the disease and under which conditions they decided to resume non-essential services 8 . By understanding the evolution of each country and the statistics in Brazil, the goal of this study is to evaluate whether the tropical country is gathering knowledge from other regions and easing restrictions according to certain metrics such as the decrease in daily cases and deaths.This article is a descriptive observational study using classical statistical metrics, such as frequency and percentage. The analysis is divided into two parts. First, the aim was to characterize how Brazil is evolving in the COVID-19 war. For this, the Brazilian data at the federal level were compared with data from other countries regarding three types of information: the number of new cases, the number of new deaths, and active cases. For this analysis, we collected data from John Hopkins 9 , which allowed us to obtain the daily and total cases, deaths, and recovered patients, along with the evolution of the pandemic. Active cases are not directly obtainable from the Hospital database; thus, we computed them using the following equation: active_cases(x) = total_cases(x) -total_deaths(x) -total_recoveries(x), where total_cases(x), total_deaths(x), and total_recoveries(x) are the total number of positive cases, deaths, and recovered patients, respectively, until day x. The measure is a good track to understand how many patients are currently transmitting the viruses or might require hospitalization, which is important for public health policies.Furthermore, we also compared the total number of cases in each country according to their size. The relative comparison is essential because countries with different sizes probably have more cases compared to smaller regions. Therefore, by dividing the cases by the population size, one can understand the proportion of inhabitants of each country that contracted COVID-19 and the differences and similarities among couples of countries. Besides Brazil, seven countries are evaluated: South Korea, the United States of America, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Germany, and China.Along with the comparison of countries, we also compared the first and second positions in the worldwide rank of case numbers provided by 1 . To do this, we used the epidemiological knowledge that virus propagation within the population can fit an exponential model 10 . Thus, we used computational simulations in Python to fit the total number of cases of Brazil and the US as an exponential curve. To perform this analysis, we used the data from the previous two weeks, the approximate period of time Sars-Cov-2 remains in an individual organism 11 , to obtain the exponential parameters. Then, we projected the data for the next 15 days.Another statistic is the testing rate for each confirmed case. Testing suspected cases reduces the under-detection probability and enhances the reliability of the data. Data were retrieved from Our World in Data 12 for each country. The results are shown in Section 3.1.Finally, in Section 3.2, we seek to understand how COVID-19 performed within the Brazilian territory. Disaggregating geographically by state, the analyses aimed to characterize the number of cases, the number of deaths, and their influences on population rates over the time that the virus disseminated throughout the country over 5 months (from February to July). The behavior of dissemination and danger of the virus was characterized by the contamination rate, which describes the speed of spread of the virus through the number of cases normalized by the population of each place per 100 thousand inhabitants, and the lethality rate, which describes the proportion of people who die among all those infected 13 .Data were obtained from the State Health Secretaries' databases and along with information of absolute and relative cases for each of the main states in Brazil, we also evaluated the spatial evolution of the pandemic in the state of São Paulo, the most populated location in Brazil. Finally, we discuss the evolution of reopening measures in Brazil, showing a map with coping policies for each country. The coping information was retrieved from the news and collected from https://ciis.fmrp.usp.br/covid19/.As previously mentioned, it took two months for Brazil to have its first confirmed case of COVID-19, which gave the country a foundation of information and knowledge to better understand the evolution of the disease, as well as the opportunity to see how other countries proceeded with reopening.First, one can start by understanding the situation in Wuhan, the breakpoint of the pandemic that previously suffered from SARS and the Avian flu 14 . Despite the recent history of respiratory diseases, COVID-19 is a new challenge that is not yet fully described by science, and the prognosis of patients can be unpredictable. In order to contain the spread of the disease and a high number of deaths, the Chinese government ordered a lockdown in Hubei, applying severe restrictions regarding social isolation which were widely obeyed 1 . Furthermore, the culture of using face masks as a routine probably helped to decrease the rate of transmission 15 . By the beginning of March, China had already less than 100 new cases per day, and, by mid-June, there were under 10 new cases per day 1 . The country was one of the first to reopen and is currently tracking new cases by applying social distancing in workplaces, constant disinfection, and temperature measuring more than once a day 16, 17 . These actions appear to be effective, considering the number of new cases shown in Figure 1f .New Zealand is another country that has succeeded in beating COVID-19. After 24 days with no detection of COVID-19, a patient was diagnosed on June 16, having contracted it in the United Kingdom, meaning no local transmission had occurred in three weeks 18 . The reason for such success? Travel restrictions and quarantine measures with a low level of confirmed cases 19 . Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has demonstrated strong leadership, convincing almost five million people to respect the stay-at-home guidelines 20 . Furthermore, testing and tracking were applied all over the country with the support of mobile applications that use QR codes to scan buildings and alert possible infected people 21 . After one week with zero new cases, New Zealand began to ease its restrictions 22 . South Korea also used technology, isolation restrictions, and extensive temperature measuring 23, 24 . In Europe, Germany also applied consistent rules and strategies to fight the virus, such as intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring, testing, and patient tracking 25, 26 . Italy was one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 due to a delay in establishing restrictions in many points of the country. The 'Milan does not stop' campaign, for example, ignored the isolation instructions from WHO in an attempt to prevent the economy from collapsing 22 . After losing control of the disease spread, a lockdown began on March 9 and lasted until May 18 27, 28 .Although these countries may have established different strategies, most of them relied on WHO instructions, scientific evidence, and strong leadership. Figure 1 shows that almost all countries are on the downside of the curve of new cases. The database of the graphs was retrieved from the John Hopkins Hospital 9 . The number of active cases in Italy, around 13,000, is still high, which requires intense observation of health services capacity since isolation restrictions are being loosened. With no drug or vaccine, all countries must keep monitoring its cases to understand whether it is time to re-apply restrictions or if one proceed to new phases of reopening.However, one can see that Brazil and the United States, the second and first countries, respectively, in the number of confirmed cases, do not follow the same patterns in the new cases/deaths and active case graphs, as shown in Figures 1g and 1h . Furthermore, the graph of active cases shows a steep incline, while new cases and deaths are increasing. This is also evident in Figure 2a , where most countries' curves are flattening and Brazil and the United States curves continue to increase. As the US and Brazil rank as first and second in numbers of active cases 1 , we compared both exponential projections in an attempt to predict the future. In Figure 2b , it appears that Brazil will overtake the US in numbers of active cases by the end of August. Such analysis considers the relative number of cases in both countries to remove population size influence. This means that besides being the country in South America with the most COVID-19 cases, Brazil will also have the highest number of cases worldwide.The situation is even more worrying, as Brazil has a low test rate and, consequently, a high likelihood of under detection (Figure 3 ) compared with countries that are coming out of lockdown. Furthermore, several places in Brazil are easing isolation rules and opening non-essential services, such as malls, which are usually environments with low air circulation and, therefore, conducive to the spread of the virus.It should be taken into account that Brazil is a very heterogeneous country with high social inequality. The pandemic is affecting the public health system and the population in a non-uniform way, as approximately 11.4 million people live in shanty houses. The following section highlights these differences and shows more in-depth features of this enormous country.Brazil, with 26 states and one federal district, is the seventh most populated country, and the fifth with the greatest territorial extension worldwide 29 . Therefore, the country is inconsistently dealing with the coronavirus epidemic. Each Brazilian state behaves like a small country, and the segregation of analysis aims to strengthen the action plans. The following analyses considered the five Brazilian states with the highest numbers in each indicator. Figure 4a shows the accumulated number of cases over time. In order, the five states with the highest number of cases were São Paulo, Ceará, Rio de Janeiro, Pará, and Bahia. At the end of May, they recorded approximately 880,000 cases, 47% of all Brazilian cases. São Paulo has been the leader in the number of cases since the beginning, with approximately 173% more cases than the second ranked state, Ceará. This is because São Paulo is the industrial center FIGURE 3: Besides the high number of cases in Brazil, the country is known for its lower testing rate. This has direct consequences on the under detection COVID-19, meaning that Brazil possibly has more cases than those noted by health care centers. Conversely, South Korea and New Zealand are among the countries with the highest rates of testing and are considered successful cases in the pandemic. and the most populated area of the country, with approximately 45 million people.However, the absolute number of cases alone does not provide a complete picture of the severity and speed of dissemination. Thus, Figure 4b shows the contamination rate. The latter four states did not have a large accumulated number of cases, but showed high daily growth in relation to the other Brazilian states.A different scenario is observed when analyzing the contamination rate, as shown in Figure 4b . The measure refers to the number of cases normalized by the population of each state per 100 thousand inhabitants. Since the end of April, the states of Amapá, Roraima, Amazonas, and Acre have presented high community transmission of the coronavirus. This has resulted in a new focus on the North region of Brazil. None of these regions were even mentioned in previous analyses. This negative impact of this statistic was clearly seen in mid-April when the state of Amazonas became the first Brazilian state to be on red alert, asking for international support due to the collapse of the funeral and health system 30, 31 . With the diversity and immensity of the country, Brazil has several areas and different needs that require attention. Thus, it is essential to explore different indicators to capture these needs as quickly as possible. Figure 4c presents the death analysis. It is expected that the number of deaths will be proportional to the number of cases. Four of the states with the highest absolute number of deaths have already been mentioned as critical in previous analyses; however, the state of Pernambuco is unprecedented and had more than 2,500 deaths by the end of May. Together, the five states with the highest number of cases have reported almost 20,000 deaths and represent 75% of total Brazilian deaths.Regarding daily case information, the highest number in the country occurred in São Paulo on June 3 when 609 deaths due to COVID-19 were recorded in 24 hours. Hospital morgues located in Rio de Janeiro, which also has a high number of daily deaths, are dealing with overcrowding and accumulating bodies day after day 32 . The last indicator explored in this subsection is the lethality rate, as shown in Figure 4d . The lethality rate is the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of cases of a disease in a given period; it represents the risk that people with the disease have of dying from the disease 13 .Brazil has a high rate of COVID-19 transmission. Within 15 days, its number of cases had doubled, which translated to 500,000 new cases 9 . The heterogeneity and extensiveness show a burdensome scenario within the decision-making process and the need for protective measures. Social inequalities enhance the necessity of deep analysis prior to easing restrictions based on intensive care units, infrastructure, and infection rates presented in Section 3. For instance, the North region required significant medical support and structure in order to prevent a worse collapse in the health system. The Northeast also showed high lethality and death rates, mainly in Ceará and Pernambuco. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro appear in almost all COVID-19 analysis indicator rankings. Both states represent the main economic poles in the country, and the high density of people in both areas highlights the importance of continuous tracking and testing.The Brazilian government does not seem to be learning lessons from other countries, such as those referenced in Section 3.1. As previously mentioned, all of them, except for the United States, only eased restrictions after intensive tracking, testing, and a descending curve in the number of daily cases was shown. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, along with other states in Brazil, do not follow the same approach (see Figure 3a ). In addition, the number of active cases is still high, along with all other indicator analyses concerning each state. This is an urgent issue and must be addressed in all public spheres so that we can improve our response to the pandemic. In public health, prevention is always the least costly option, especially in this case, where an individual's response to the infection could be death. Supported by the quantitative information in Figure 2b demonstrating that Brazil is expected to overtake the US in total number of cases (proportionally by population size), the current low isolation rates, low population testing percentage with consequently high under detection, high daily cases, and death rates all suggest that Brazil has eased its restrictions prematurely and may face severe consequences in the near future as a result, such as becoming the next global epicenter of the pandemic.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-21",10

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, has spread across Brazil and since the first recorded case in February 26, (Brasil 1 , 2020 . Contrary to places as China and parts of Europe, Brazil never achieved a true decline in new cases incidence, and the country has plateaued at a high rate of about 32.058 new cases every day (OMS, 2020) . In Brazil, there have been over four millions documented cases of COVID-19 and more than 140 thousand deaths at the end of September 2020 (Brasil 2 , 2020) across all its territory, but numbers of cases are probably underestimated due to testing limitations.The search for markers of immunity and diagnosis with serology has led to development of different assays, but specificity and sensibility issues have been reported (Castro et al., 2020) . Along with the unknown nature of a protective immunity and the fact that antibodies emerge at the end, or after, infectiousness phase of the disease, has hamper the use of serology as a diagnostic clinical tool. However, it remained valid to evaluate population exposure to the virus, guiding public health policies and may provide a general framework for understanding virus exposure.at a population level. The performance of systematic and comprehensive tests to identify the infection in health professionals (HP) and other key areas is important, even if they are not in direct contact with patients, and available to estimate the prevalence of infected and virus transmission in within health services. A meta-analysis of eleven studies showed that almost 10% of COVID-19 positive patients are health professionals (Sahu et al., 2020) .The Adolfo Lutz Institute, the Central laboratory of public health of State of São Paulo, has increased its activities to fight COVID since early in the pandemic.This study was performed among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute in São Paulo, Brazil and administrative personnel of the Secretary of Health that shares common work buildings.2.2.2. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was offered to participants at the time of this survey. Some individuals tested for SARS CoV-2 2 in other laboratories using swab collections and those were also counted as RNA tested in this analysis. RNA was obtained from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions either by regular swab collection method (Brasil 3 , 2020) , or throat wash (López-Lopes et al., 2020) , used for most in-site collections due to swabs sort supply, Briefly, participants received a 5 mL chilled sterile 0.9% saline in a 50 mL falcon tube The contents of the gargle were returned to the tube after approximately 5+ seconds. Participants were instructed to perform the procedure outdoors, at a safe social distance. The tubes were kept at approximately 4-8º C before and after collection, and were processed in the same day. TNA was extracted with a RNA extraction method (Quiagen, USA, Bio Gene, Quibasa, or by automated extraction at Abbott M2000) more recently Quick Extract TM Solution, Lucigen) was used. COVID-19 RNA was retrotranscribed and amplified using the commercial Allplex kit (Seegene, Corea), which is based on the Charité protocol (Corman, et al., 2020) . The samples with amplification in the three viral targets (E, RdRP and N) were considered positive.As recommended for the Influenza assay, human RNAse P was used to assess the quality control of the sample and the presence of inhibitors, and human RNAse P cycle thresholds (CTs) up to 37 were considered valid.The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee CAAE: 31924420.8.0000.0059 and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.A total of 406 individuals participated in the survey. Volunteers were mostly female, 296 (72%) with a median age 50 (IQR 40-57), and 53 (13%) over 60 years old but only 4 over 70. that reflected the composition of institute workers overall.Professionals were classified according to the area of activity as (i) Administrative 82 (20%), (ii) BioMedical laboratories 224 (55%), (iii) Chemistry laboratories 68 (17%) and (iv) 32 (8%) Outsourced workers (including security guards, car valets, cleaning assistants and other support areas). Exposure to individuals symptomatic for COVID-19, or diagnosis was reported by 272 (67%) of the participants.Three hundred and eighty-eight (97%) disclosed home address and the median distance between the workplace and the home of the interviews was 15 km . Considering only those that live in the metropolitan area (circa 50 km from the institute), there was a strong correlation of living far from the institute and doing outsource work (23 km, IQR 16-33) vs (14 Km IQR 10-21) (p=0.0001). Longer distance traveled show some association to seropositivity (p = 0.041). Using public transportation (bus, train and/or subway) to get to the workplace was associated to seropositivity (p=0.3). Table 3 show unadjusted and adjusted logistic analysis of demographic variables associated to COVID-19 seropositivity. The institute is a research and diagnostic reference service of the São Paulo State Health Department kept many working activities during the restriction of nonessential activities, at the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo, fromFew studies on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence are available in Brazil. The larger is a nationwide seroprevalence survey at households, showing much lower of seropositivity, with estimates of 1·9% (95% CI 1·7-2·1) for May to 3·1% (2·8-3·4) for June (Hallal et al., 2020) . For the São Paulo area, this study estimated a prevalence from 2% to 4.9% (Hallal et al., 2020) . The national estimates included some cities in the amazon basin with prevalence up to 25%, associated to a high case fatality in this period. Another study in southern State, that were not so much affected in this initial phase, showed lower estimates, around of 0.05% to 0.2% (Silveira et al., 2020) . Both studies used the same rapid test of our study, but contrary to our study, that used serum, both surveys used blood drops from finger prick that have been documented to underestimate the seroprevalence (Santos et al., 2020) .Surveys that include health workers are more limited in Brazil. In a study with health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19 at North of country, the prevalence of antibodies were 21,5% [Melo et al., 2020] . A blood bank detected 4% seropositivity to COVID-19 (Amorim Filho et al., 2020) .A large study in Denmark showed an overall seroprevalence of 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%) among health care workers. The rates varied from as high as 29.7% among those with contact with patients to as low as 2.2% in those that not involved in direct contact (Jespersen et al., 2020) , which is more close to the characteristics of our study population. Studies in other countries with healthcare workers show prevalence ranging from 1.07 -17.14% (Lahner et al., 2020; Jeremias et al., 2020; Psichogiou et al., 2020; Pallet et al., 2020; Korth et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Garcia-Basteiro et al., 2020) , but laboratory workers were not specifically evaluated.We observed in our study that the presence of symptoms was more reported in those in which RNA was detectable (groups 1 and 2). Cough, myalgia, fatigue, and fever were the most frequent symptoms among participants with detectable RNA.Particularly the presence of cough was also more frequent in-group 4 (negative results in RT-PCR and LFIA) than in group 2, which suggests that presenting this symptom is a criterion for conducting an investigation for COVID-19. Anosmia or/ and dysgeusia and shortness of breath was observed more frequently in the group in which serology was positive (group 1 and 3), suggesting that this symptoms may be correlated with the induction of humoral response (Makaronidis et al., 2020) . The median time reported among participants who had anosmia and / or dysgeusia in these groups (1 and 3) was 17 days and 60 days respectively) .The minority in our study did not report having symptoms before positive serology (14, 40%) and rt-qPCR positive (16, 34%) diagnosis.Beyond the usefulness of serology to understand the pandemic, the professionals had the opportunity to know their diagnosis, favoring a decrease in the anxiety associated to the pandemic. Moreover, RNA detection allowed swift isolation from colleagues and limited local spread, especially for those asymptomatic.Transmission is more likely in indoor than outdoor environments (Nishiura et al., 2020) and that home confinement and isolation measures influence due to economic and social aspects, and vary between regions in a country that is heterogeneous like Brazil (Nadanovsky et al., 2020) . Our data indicate that living with diagnosed or symptomatic people was more relevant in domestic environment than in the workplace, which can be justified by more intimate contact and extensive sharing of areas, in spite the guidelines advising family members to distance themselves.We recognize some limitations in our study, as : 1-we used the LFIA method as a preliminary assessment and although confirmed most cases with a second, high throughput ECLIA method, false negative cases would not be identified and we can be under estimating the true prevalence, however, the use of serum instead of finger prick drops may have improved sensibility. 2-Despite our efforts, not all employees joined the study and the prevalence does not reflect the actual SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of the institute, but more than half of the workers did contributed to this work. 3-The collection of blood samples was in some cases performed in parallel with the gargle / oropharyngeal smear samples, so we cannot exclude that professionals with a detectable RNA result with a negative LFIA test may have become positive over time.4-some of the questionnaire were not completed by participants limiting the interpretation of some of the results, but the associations reported were very strong and possibly results were not influenced by missing data.We documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in this population, with higher rates among outsourced workers and those residing with COVID-19 patients. COVID samples handling was not related to increased seropositivity. Some symptoms how strong association to COVID-19 serology and may be used in scoring tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited settings.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-21",10

In Brazil, a total of 630,708 cases with 34,625 deaths were described, which occurred in all Brazilian states and Federal District.The COVID-19 pandemic started at a time when Brazilian government is seeking to develop the Amazon for mining, logging, farming, and reviewing the protected status of the tribal lands. At the same time, malnutrition, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and diabetes as well as the lack of access to health care could mean that these tribes would be particularly vulnerable to the virus outbreak. Indigenous groups are urging intruders, miners, loggers, poachers, drug traffickers, land grabbers, missionaries, and tourists who can be vectors of transmission to expel from their lands outsiders who could introduce the disease, according to the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon.Indigenous tribes have already seen their communities ravaged by exogenous diseases in the past. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, their death rate was 4.5 times higher than the rest of the Brazil's general population [3] .Moreover, vaccination as management against H1N1 failed to protect an Indigenous community in 2016, and hundreds of Indians, mainly from Guaraní tribe in the south of Brazil, have died [4] . Presently, respiratory diseases cause approximately one-third of Indigenous deaths in Brazil, which can be a complicating factor during the COVID-19 pandemic.To safeguard the vulnerable Indigenous from Brazil, the COVID-19 data needs to be disaggregated by ethnicity, since the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 analysis has showed that the genome sequences of the virus from different patients are very conserved [5] . Thus, the aim of the present study is to discuss the epidemiologic and social characteristics of indigenous population aiming to protect them from COVID-19 pandemic.In 2010, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) has conducted the last population census in Brazil [6] . In this context, some peculiarities in relation to the Indigenous population who live in Brazil and the possible devastating effects of COVID-19 on this population are described in the present study. The Indigenous population has been reported in all Brazilian states and Federal District. Thus, 896,917 (517,383 in Indigenous lands and 379,534 in urban areas) Indigenous individuals were censured in 2010, in accordance with their traditions, customs, culture, and ancestry. In addition, 505 Indigenous lands and territories were described, representing~12.5% of the Brazilian territory, which there was a wide variation in the number of Indigenous inhabitants per land [6, 7] . Thus, six lands presented more than 10,000 Indians, 107 presented between more than 1000 and less than 10,000 Indians, 291 between more than 100 and less than 1000 Indians, and 83 up to 100 Indians. The land with the largest indigenous population was Yanomami in the Amazonas and Roraima States with 25,700 Indigenous individuals. In brief, Table 1 shows the number of inhabitants, number of Indigenous individuals by living at indigenous lands or in urban areas, demographic density, and area distributed by Brazilian states and Federal District.Despite the identical gender ratio inside all Indigenous population (~50%), Indian females are more prevalent in urban areas and Indian males in Indigenous lands. In the Indigenous population, high fertility and mortality rates have been described, which characterizes an age pyramid with a broad base. The Indigenous population is currently divided into 305 ethnic groups according to linguistic, cultural, and social affinities (250 on Indigenous lands and 300 outside their lands), being the largest one known as Tikúna (6.8% of the indigenous population). The ethnicities' concentration in Indigenous lands occur from 251 to 500 individuals by community, contrasting with outside Indigenous lands that occur from 50 to 10,000 individuals. In relation to cultural diversity, an important marker is the language, which totalizing 274 different ones. The percentage of Indigenous population who speak Portuguese, the national language of Brazil, is extremely variable between ethnic groups.Interestingly, 12.6% of the indigenous' homes are known as hollow type called as ""Oca or maloca,"" while the rest as ""house"" type, predominately. In Indigenous lands, ""Ocas"" type is also not common, only 2.9% contrasting with 58.7% of ""house"" type. In addition, 36.1% of Indigenous' homes have no bathroom, and in Indigenous lands, there are highest sewage deficits with a predominance of the use of the rudimentary cesspool (65.7%). Moreover, access to water supply, electricity, and garbage collection was more precarious for individuals living on Indigenous lands than in urban areas.Among the Indigenous population, 52.9% has no income whatsoever and it is observing a greater proportion in Indigenous lands (65.7%) compared with urban areas. It is possible also to verify that many jobs are carried out collectively according to their culture. In the Indigenous population structure, recreation and work are not easily separable and the relationship with the land is wide broad, not having an association with private property.In Brazil, the Indigenous community fears the COVID-19 pandemic [8] , and although containment measures have been taken, it was not possible to prevent the contagion of the Indigenous population. Currently, according to the Ministry of Health by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health [9] (05th June 2020), among the Indigenous population are as follows: (i) 420 suspected cases; (ii) 1737 confirmed cases being 934 active cases; (iii) 715 recovered cases; (iv) and 70 deaths ( Table 2 ). The deaths occurred in 18 special Indigenous health district (dSEI) from a total of 34 dSEIs, mainly affecting Alto do Rio Solimões (23 deaths), Guamá-Tocantins (11 cases), and Alto Rio Negro (5 cases). Possibly, the data presented does not represent the total number of cases, and it is not updated daily [10] . As historical marks for COVID-19 in Brazil and its prevalence in the Indigenous population, we have: The doctor has consulted ten patients before the COVID-10 diagnosis. After these period of time corresponding to the first month after the first case of COVID-19 among Indigenous [9, 10] , a total of 70 Indigenous deaths were described in 05th June 2020. The deaths occurred mainly among older Indigenous or with comorbidities.The Indians are the natural holders of the lands that make up the Brazilian territory. However, during the colonization, there was a drastic reduction of the Indigenous population. In the colonization period, Indigenous totalized~2 millions of inhabitants. In the current context, there is~75% reduction in that number, in part due to the pandemic cycles that played a role. The indigenous people do not form a single social and cultural structure, but rather a socially and culturally diverse group, which can be evidenced by the number of languages among different ethnicities. The loss of indigenous ethnicities, in addition to characterizing the loss of life, reflects cultural and social loss that are irreparable.It is possible to determine the route of SARS-CoV-2 in the presented Indigenous cases, mainly in the dSEI Alto Rio Solimões -Amazonas. The first case had previous contact with a doctor who, in the latency phase, had access to an Indigenous group, and among them, an Indigenous woman was infected. When the indigenous woman returned to her ethnic group, she spreads the virus, and after~1 month, numerous cases occurred among the members of her ethnic group.Indigenous characteristics are important to describe and, among them, the fundamental role of older individuals. Senior individuals represent the knowledge and culture of the Indigenous population. However, some traditional culture habits have been mixed with modern society habits. COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of death in older patients and comorbidities. Evaluating the Indigenous cases described here, the age ranged from 0 months to 88 years, being one of the oldest an Indigenous leader and an invaluable loss for their Indigenous ethnic group. Still, among the cases, many Indigenous presented comorbidities associated with a greater severity of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on tribal chief (Cacique) or village Elder can lead to the extinction of their cultures, because the traditions are passed on orally by the elders [11] .At the time of the pandemic, it is important to minimize contact with Indigenous groups to limit the contagion, which is a crucial measure to be taken [8] . However, in addition to the Indigenous socialization outside their lands, especially in the Southeast region, they have contact with health professionals and other individuals as loggers, miners, and squatters, who often trespass on the Indigenous lands and have taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to optimize their profiteering in areas previously preserved and destined to Indigenous people by law. Despite the social struggles to minimize the devastation of the forest and reduce the proliferation of infectious diseases [12, 13] , the current Brazilian political scenario did not create a protective environment and deforestation has increased exponentially [14] . As described by Ferrante and Fearnside (2020) , the Indigenous community should be considered as a risk group, especially if considering the impact that other pandemics have had on this population, forcing the governmental actions as to highlight the isolation and protectionism position [15] . However, as described by the authors, the Brazilian authorities are trying to minimize the possibly catastrophic effect of COVID-19 pandemic for the Indigenous group. However, it is crucial to understand the effects of territorial invasions in the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly as a risk factor to promote the infection by SARS-CoV-2 [16] .An important factor is to obtain the epidemiological data regarding ethnicity, such as Caucasoid or Negroid, and the application of the same data to understand the progression of the disease in communities such as Indigenous population [17] .Regardless of life quality on Indigenous territories as other regions, Brazil have low rates of access to drinking water and basic sanitation, both of which can optimize the progression of the COVID-19 virus. Another important fact is that in the Northern region, where there are the largest number of Indigenous population mainly in the state of Amazonas, 100% of the beds in the intensive care units were already occupied [11] . Thus, there was a health service collapse due to COVID-19 pandemic [11] . Besides, death numbers due to the respiratory illnesses exceeded the expected values for the time of the year compared with previous years. Finally, the limited access of Indigenous population to health services are often dependent on doctors and other health professionals visiting their lands.Possibly, many Indigenous individuals who had contact with the first cases will die and will not be statistical counted due to the lack of knowledge about the disease and the possibility of its diagnosis. In the current scenario, it is difficult to have hope and believe that all Brazilians with COVID-19 will have the ideal medical support and recommended by the World Health Organization. Probably, many Brazilians have died and will die from COVID-19 without proper diagnosis and/or management. In the Indigenous population, the scenario can be even more tragic, since, unfortunately, it is a COVID-19 vulnerable and at-risk population. Historically, Indigenous population has been devalued and discriminated against by the Federal Government. Politics [18] and technical support [19] , mainly associated with the diagnosis, should be better implemented in Brazil to provide support to all individual during the pandemic, mainly the more vulnerable to COVID-19.In conclusion, our data reveal the importance of social isolation, especially for Indigenous population that were described as vulnerable and at-risk for COVID-19, highlighted by the identification of community infection. An individual of the Kokama ethnicity was infected after contact with a doctor with the disease, and both, the Indigenous and doctor, were responsible for transmitting the disease to other Indigenous in the Alto Rio Solimões and in Parintis, causing some of the confirmed deaths. The impact of COVID-19 may be an unprecedented tragedy for the Indigenous population, and the Brazilian government must take emergency measures to encounter the tragic outcomes of the disease.Author Contributions All authors have approved the manuscript and agreed with its submission to the journal.

[1] [2] [3] [4] In Brazil, Black and Indigenous people are expected to be at higher risk for COVID-19. 5 However, there are limited data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous communities.In this nationwide register-based study, we estimated the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in Brazilian Indians according to the five macro-regions (Northeast, North, Central-West, Southeast and South) in the country. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were extracted from the microdata catalogue and o cial bulletins for each Brazilian state between 26 February and 28 August 2020. Estimates of Indigenous population were obtained from the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI, acronym in Portuguese) (http:// www.funai.gov.br). COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) (%) was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of COVID-19 cases.A total of 29 008 cases and 532 deaths of Brazilian Indians from COVID-19 were analyzed. The national incidence and mortality rates were 3546.4 cases and 65.0 deaths per 100 000 population, respectively; and the CFR was 1.8%. The Central-West had the higher estimates of disease burden among Brazilian Indians (incidence rate: 3135.0/100 000; mortality rate: 101.2/100 000 and CFR: 3.2%) followed by the North region (incidence rate: 5664.4/100 000; mortality rate: 92.2/100 000 and CFR: 1.6%) ( Table 1) .From these findings, some explanations can be o ered. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, miners and lumbermen continued to explore Indigenous lands, especially in North and Central-West regions in the country. There are numerous highways cross Indigenous lands and the contact between Indigenous people and truck drivers for commercial exchanges is frequent, 6 which may facilitate the contamination of Indigenous communities. Additionally, because of commercial relations, many Indigenous people need to contact non-Indigenous people in proximal cities where the SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating. 7, 8 Once the disease is present in a tribe, cultural factors and typical behavioral aspects, such as sharing household items, community housing and some hygienic practices, may have facilitated its spread. 8 Moreover, many Indigenous communities have di culty to access primary health facilities, basic medicines and hospitals equipped with ventilators and intensive care unit beds that would be needed to treat severe cases of COVID-19. 7, 9 Unfortunately, this situation has been exacerbated by reduction in the investments of the More Doctors Program JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Our findings showed a high, but disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on the Indigenous population in Brazil. Governmental actions should guarantee the isolation, monitoring and testing capabilities of Indigenous people and rapidly to provide social protection and health facilities.The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.All authors contributed equally to the manuscript.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-12",10

AvCoV belongs to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, genus Gammacoronavirus, and subgenus Igacovirus [16] . The viral genome is single-stranded RNA, positive sense, with 30 kb, which comprises two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5′ and 3′ ends [19, 28] , two overlapping open read frames (ORFs) encoding the polyproteins 1a and 1ab (15 nonstructural proteins) , and eight ORFs that codes for structural proteins (S, E, M, N) and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a, 5b) [7, 23] .The spike protein is a glycoprotein responsible for binding to host receptors and determines the tropism and host range of the virus [30] ; this glycoprotein has two subunits, S1 that is anchored to viral membrane by S2 subunit [1] . Subunit S1 contains the epitopes involved in the induction of serotypespecific neutralizing antibodies, but cross protection is poor and most of these serotypes differ from each other by 20-25% at amino acid level in S1 subunit [1, 26, 29] . Nucleotide heterogenicity is more prevalent in the S1 portion of the S gene and is largely contained in three different hypervariable regions (HVR) (aa 38-67, 91-141, 275-287). The analysis of complete or partial S1 gene nucleotide sequence has been conventionally used to determinate viral genetic types, and more than 50 different antigenic and genetic types of AvCoV have been recognized [13, 17, 23] .In Colombia, where the only IBV strain used in vaccines belongs to the GI-1 lineage ""Massachusetts,"" few studies have been conducted on AvCoV. In 1963, this virus was isolated from samples from two geographical regions in embryonated eggs for the first time, from broilers and layers with respiratory signs [20] ; in 2003, field isolates from broilers and layers of five different regions were studied based on spike gene S1 (HVR 1-2), and showed the presence of genotypes GI-1, GI-16, GI-20, and GVI-1 [2] . Serological studies were conducted in two regions of Colombia: Santander, in which antibodies were detected in fight roosters in 2005, 42.4% of which were positive without vaccination [14] ; and in Cundinamarca, where two studies were carried out on farms with previously molecular detection of AvCoV [3, 10] , when 85.72% of samples were positive in poultry with respiratory signs and vaccinated against AvCoV. In 2016, AvCoV samples from four cities in the central region of Colombia (Tolima) were isolated and sequenced, and the study reported a low nucleotide identity between South American strains (< 75%), and high Responsible Editor: Fernando R. Spilki. identity with Cuban strains (82 to 99%) [8] . In Colombia, there are very few molecular studies of AvCoV circulating strains. Thus, the aim of this study is to report the emergence of the GI-11 lineage in Colombia, which has been reported only in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay [21, 22, 25] .A total of 36 samples from broilers (twelve per farm) were collected from three farms that had been showing an increased mortality up to 10%, located in three different geographic regions of Colombia (Cundinamarca, Santander, and Valle del Cauca). Samples were collected using Whatmann ® FTA® cards, between December 2018 and January 2019, from broilers vaccinated at days 4 and 14 with a GI-1 strain. From the three farms, three FTA cards were collected/received per farm, sampling 10 birds/farm; as each FTA card used had 4 spots (for one sample/spot), a total of 12 samples were collected from each farm, making a total of 36 samples, pooling lungs, tracheas, kidneys, and cecal tonsils from 2 to 3 birds in each respective spot, and from each farm samples of ten broilers collected, due to a recommendation for the use of FTA cards with pooled samples (three or four birds per card). These samples were from lungs (four, L), trachea (two, T), kidney (three, K), and cecal tonsils (three, CT) per farm. Total Screening real-time PCR was made using the method developed by Callison et al. [6] to detect region 5′ UTR of AvCoV. Positive samples were subjected to a nested PCR for partial amplification of S1 subunit gene of the spike protein of IBV (nt position 677-1097 Z83979) using the primers reported by Worthington et al. [27] for the amplification of HVR 3. Amplicons were sequenced bidirectionally using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit™ (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI-3500 Genetic Analyzer™ (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions. Positions with Phred scores ≥ 20 were assembled with BioEdit 7.0.5.3 (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the final sequence was used to build a maximum likelihood tree (Tamura-Nei model and GTR+G) with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 7 [18] , with a dataset from complete genome available of AvCoV using the classification suggested for Valastro et al. [23] , but aligned for HV3/S1 region of virus.From the tested samples, 10 were positive (Cundinamarca L+T: 1 Ct 34.52, CT: 1 Ct 27.7, and K: 1 Ct 37.13; Santander L+T: 1 Ct 32.32, CT: 1 Ct 31.28; and Valle del Cauca L+T: 2 Ct 31.91 ± 0.43, CT: 2 Ct 30.05 ± 1.74, and K: 1 Ct 30,82) with mean Ct 31.81 ± 2.9, and a partial S1 sequence was obtained for one of them (cecal tonsil/Cundinamarca Ct 27.7) (GenBank accession number MK896657) which was assigned to genotype GI lineage 11 (Fig. 1) using a [23] ; nucleotide identities showed a variation between 58.1 and 85.9%. Since bootstrapping was less than 75%, another phylogenetic tree was constructed following the same method for the first tree and using the phylogenic analysis proposed by De Wit et al. [12] , in which MK896657 was located close, but outside the cluster Brazil I (Fig. 2) , and the nucleotide identities ranged from 0.778 to 0.929. Fourteen amino acid residues changes were observed: S255D, S257L, R261K, D282Y/H, F288L/P/ S, Y303H/C, C321V, V323K, F332Y, W347L, G348W, F352L, I354V, and F156L with references to Brazilian strains (Genbank access KP202366-372, AF093793-4, AF169859-860, M21970, AY561713, AY851295, X15832, and KY626044).GI-11 probably emerged in the 1960s and was believed to be restricted to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay [21] . GI-11 represents 74% of AvCoV types in Brazil [11, 15] and was implicated in nephrosis, orchitis, respiratory, and enteric diseases [12, 24] .Regarding the farms sampled in this study, increased mortality was the sign reported for the broilers; AvCoV is a known cause of mortality in broilers [4] and GI-11 has been shown to cause a significant economic burden in broilers [9] , showing that this lineage is more widespread than previously considered.The first full genome of AvCoV GI-11 was published in 2016 [5] , showing a 27,615-nt genome with a gene arrangement similar to other AvCoVs, but with a phylogeny that confirmed its divergence from the other lineages. Obtaining the full genome for the strain reported herein will allow for an in-depth understanding of the phytogeography and evolution of this lineage in South America.It is important to highlight that Alvarado et al. [2] based their study on portion of S1 gene that corresponds to HVR 1 and 2, while the sequence obtained herein maps to HVR 3, impairing a comparison between both studies. On the other hand, the sequences reported in 2016 [8] are not yet available on GenBank, but only their phylogenic relationships were mentioned in that report.Whether GI-11 is to become a concern for the poultry industry in Colombia still remains to be determined, as additional data is needed regarding its distribution in this country and its pathogenic consequences, as well as robust scientific data, before changes in vaccine strains are seriously considered.In summary, the present study indicates that Avian coronavirus be widespread in South America, with few countries that have yet reported it, which makes it necessary to clarify how this subtype has spread throughout most of the continent, taking into account the poultry trade between the South American countries and their sanitary protocols.Funding This work was funded by CNPq (Brazilian National Board for Scientific and Technological Development) grant numbers 307291/2017-0 and 400604/2016-7 and CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, Brazil) Finance Code 001, which had no role in the study design, collection, analysis and interpretation of data, writing of the report or decision to submit the article for publication.Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Colombia","abstract","2020-10-26",10

A systematic review Do hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes have a virucidal effect? A systematic review Running title: Virucidal effect of hydrogen peroxide","Coronaviruses were responsible for three major respiratory diseases in the past decades. The third one began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, giving rise to a pandemic caused by a new virus termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2] . SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by direct contact with infected people through respiratory or salivary droplets, and at a lower degree, by indirect contact with contaminated surfaces [3] .The virus has tropism for cells whose membrane contains a specific receptor -the angiotensina conversion enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is present in countless human tissues other than the lung, which is the main target organ for the virus infection [4, 5] .The identification that ACE2 is present in the oral mucosal epithelial cells, particularly the dorsum of the tongue [6] , and the description of SARS-CoV-2 oral shedding [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] has brought more fear to health professionals, especially those working in close contact with patients and who are exposed to aerosols.In an attempt to prevent patient-to-practitioner transmission by means of contaminated saliva, opinions on how to proceed with patients began to emerge in the literature in order to reduce the risk of cross-infection through aerosol generation [14] [15] [16] [17] . One of the presented solutions is the use of antiseptic mouthwashes. But it is important to understand that antisepsis (i.e. to destruct or to inhibit micro-organisms in a living tissue) is not the same as disinfection (i.e. to destruct or to inhibit micro-organisms on inanimate objects) [18] . These two processes require types of chemical compounds that must be tested in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f through respiratory or salivary droplets, and at a lower degree, by indirect J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f through respiratory or salivary droplets, and at a lower degree, by indirectThe virus has tropism for cells whose membrane contains a specific J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe virus has tropism for cells whose membrane contains a specific receptor -the angiotensina conversion enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is present in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f receptor -the angiotensina conversion enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is present in countless human tissues other than the lung, which is the main target organ for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f countless human tissues other than the lung, which is the main target organ forThe identification that ACE2 is present in the oral mucosal epithelial cells,The identification that ACE2 is present in the oral mucosal epithelial cells, particularly the dorsum of the tongue [6] , and the description of SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f particularly the dorsum of the tongue [6] , and the description of SARS-CoV-2 oral shedding [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] has brought more fear to health professionals, especially J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f oral shedding [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] has brought more fear to health professionals, especially those working in close contact with patients and who are exposed to aerosols.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f those working in close contact with patients and who are exposed to aerosols.In an attempt to prevent patient-to-practitioner transmission by means of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn an attempt to prevent patient-to-practitioner transmission by means of different ways for approval by the competent agenciesaccording to regulatory norms.According to Saddik and Pappan (2018) , mouthwashes are considered cosmetics in Europe while in the USA they can also be registered as drugs, depending on their therapeutic properties (or its intended use declared by the manufacturer) [19] . In the latter case, they should be submitted to a drug approval process involving pre-clinical studies (in vitro, with cultured cells and in vivo with laboratory animals) and clinical trials. The last one involves 4 phases: phase 1-involving fewer than 100 healthy or diseased volunteers; phase 2 -several hundreds of volunteers with the majority being patients with the disease; phase 3 -a few thousand volunteers requires at least a few years for completion; phase 4 -post-market phase in which the drug is actively monitored by the consumers [19] .Although it is easier to put a cosmetic product on the European market those products are also subjected to regulations placed by the local law of all the member countries of the European Union. After being made available in the European market those products are subject to efficiency evaluation in official laboratories [19] . There are some standard tests to determine virucidal activity, but almost all are for surface disinfection and a few are aimed at antiseptic capacity for external surfaces (e.g. skin), which invariably do not have viral replication. None demonstrate how to verify virucidal effect in non-standardized samples from nasopharyngeal or oral cavity [20] .The use of mouthwash containing 1% hydrogen peroxide has been proposed to reduce viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva [18] . This relationship seems to be demonstrated by studies assessing the use of mouthwash for reduction of oral microbiota, especially bacteria, meaning that the oxidative properties of hydrogen peroxide would also enable the degradation of viral particles. Nevertheless, there is no citation of a study supporting such statement [21] . Only studies assessing the virucidal effect of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash were selected. In order to reduce the publication bias, these studies were included regardless of publication date restrictions.Reviews, letters to the editor, personal opinions, book chapters, case reports, congress abstracts, studies with animals and studies on mouthwash containing other compounds other than hydrogen peroxide were excluded.Individual search strategies were developed for Cochrane, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE databases. The following keywords were used in the search: ""hydrogen peroxide"", ""mouthwash"", ""mouth rinse"", ""rinse"", ""oral rinse"", ""mouth bath"", ""mouth wash"" and ""mouth washes"" (further information is provided in Appendix/ Table I) . Additionally, the grey literature was also searched by using ProQuest, Open Grey and Google Scholar, in which the last was limited to the first 120 articles published. The lists of references on this theme were also searched. The above-mentioned databases, including the grey literature, were searched on 30 th May, 2020. environment through aerosol following treatment of an infected patient [30] , or even shorten the patient's hospitalisation [31] .The routine use of mouthwash prior to dental procedures is aimed at decreasing the formation of biofilm, minimising transient bacteraemia in the patient undergoing invasive procedures and preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia [32] .The dental practitioner would also be benefited with the decreased bacterial load during aerosol generation. However, despite being a well-established routine, there is little scientific evidence on the effectiveness of pre-operative mouthwash for control of bacteraemia and contamination through aerosols [33] [34] [35] . These analyses considered the action of these products on bacteria only, since nothing is mentioned about viruses.There are a few in vitro studies demonstrating the virucidal action of Listerine® and chlorhexidine on HIV and herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) [36, 37] .Only one in vivo study assessed the efficacy of Listerine® in decreasingHSV-1 in the saliva of patients with active lip lesions, thus evidencing an effective control for 30 minutes [38] . It is important to remember that this effect may be related to the replication cycle of the virus itself and/or to the mechanical removal of viral particles with the use of mouthwash, rather than to an alleged virucidal effect of the active principle. A recent publication shows a variable viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva depending on the period of the day analyzed [39] .Other in vitro studies, showing anti-viral efficacy by analyzing viral titers in cell culture, reported positive results for the efficacy of Listerine® against respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza A and rotavirus) [40] and of povidone iodine against influenza H1N1 virus and coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, SARS-CoV-2) [20, 41, 42] . Nevertheless, there is no clinical study demonstrating these findings in vivo.A limited clinical study with no placebo controls or in-vitro antiviral efficacy data using saline mouthwashes has recently been reported [43] .The small number of published studies on virucidal effect of mouthwashes may be related to different regulations of this product observed worldwide [19] . The current scenario of a pandemic, where transmission also results from contaminated saliva particles, highlights that the classification of mouthwashes as a therapeutic agent is the more appropriate and could provide more robust clinical studies for market registration purposes. Moreover, it is worth pointing out that none of these studies assessed the action of hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes [43] [38] [40] .Hydrogen peroxide is a substance which is degraded into oxygen and water when in contact with catalase -an enzyme present in almost all living beings, including microorganisms within the oral microbiota -and this oxidative process would be capable of eliminating bacteria and fungi [44] . Peng et al assumed that this process of oxidation might also be effective against SARS-CoV-2 by reporting that this virus would be sensitive to oxidation [30] .The work in question has been cited countless times in the literature since its publication (Appendix 1), becoming source of information and basis for attitudes during the period of COVID-10 pandemic in several dental specialties [30] .Taking into consideration the chemical reaction on which the antimicrobial properties of hydrogen peroxide are based, this degradation occurring almost instantaneously would not be capable of impeding an immediate re-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f worldwide [19] . The current scenario of a pandemic, where transmission also contamination of the oral cavity, since the particles of a virus (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) can potentially come from various sources such as respiratory secretions, oropharynx, salivary glands and gingival crevicular fluid [6, 10, 11, [45] [46] [47] .Therefore, it would be necessary that any substance to be used as preoperative mouthwash had a high substantivity, that is, the capacity to interact with structures of the oral cavity to allow a slow release of this agent, thus increasing the duration of its virucidal effect.A systematic review demonstrated that effect of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash in preventing formation of oral biofilm was poorly effective and short, thus showing its low substantivity [48] . Most of the studies included in this review were published between the 1970s and 1990s, which reflects the discontinuation in the indication of hydrogen peroxide as an effective mouthwash for controlling oral microbiota, precisely because of the lack of substantivity [48] .In view of the lack of scientific evidence supporting any virucidal activity of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, associated with its lack of substantivity, its indication in dental care protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic should be revised.

Following the appearance of the first COVID-19 cases in the province of Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1] , SARS-CoV-2 has infected most of the countries in the world, with over 26.6 million confirmed cases, and just under 876,000 deaths as of September 5, 2020 [2] .Several studies have identified comorbidities and clinical variables associated with higher risk of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Increasing evidence shows that patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, lung and renal diseases, hypertension, and older age are especially at risk of succumbing to this viral infection. Additional reports have pointed to racial and ethnic differences in outcomes [16] [17] [18] . In New York City, death rates among black/African American COVID-19 patients (92.3 deaths per 100,000 population) and Hispanic/Latino (74.3) have been significantly higher than those of white (42.5) or Asian (34.5) patients [19] . In addition, an analysis of the largest integrated-delivery health system in the state of Louisiana suggested a longer wait to access care among black patients [17] .Although racial and ethnic disparities have emerged as a central topic in the conversation about COVID-19, most studies to date have assessed data from minority populations within the United States. Moreover, because data on socioeconomic status are seldom available in electronic medical record systems, the connection between socioeconomic/racial/ethnic disparities and health access inequality has yet to be investigated. It is clear, therefore, that further research on the underlying causes of COVID-19 disparities and their complex social and structural determinants is needed in order for the international scientific, public health, and clinical communities to implement interventions that alleviate excess mortality and economic disruption related to COVID-19. Because targeted public health and resource allocation policies are more effective than standard approaches [20] , the design of such interventions should leverage patient subgroup-specific information, such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and be adapted to local contexts and community characteristics.In particular, factors that differentiate underserved populations may be geographically distinct, meaning that findings from recent U.S.-based studies may generalize poorly to low-and middle-income countries located, e.g., in Africa or Latin America. Underserved populations in urban settings in these countries typically live in more densely populated areas, both by neighborhood and household assessments; rely mainly or exclusively on crowded public transportation to get around; tend to be employed in public-facing occupations; and have limited access to private health insurance.Our goal is to contribute to the discussion on COVID-19 disparities by assessing the role of socioeconomic factors in predicting patient outcomes in Brazil, a low-and middle-income country (LMIC). At the time of this report, Brazil presented the second highest number of total confirmed cases and deaths worldwide [2] . We use a highly representative dataset of COVID-19 patients from Brazil to derive machine learning models that predict in-hospital death and ventilator usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of non-clinical factors, including patients' self-reported race and education level, access to private hospitals, and geographic location of the hospital, on COVID-19 mortality and resource use. Moreover, this is one of the largest datasets used to date, with over 159,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 54,000 deceased.To develop the predictive models, we leverage both interpretable machine learning (ML) methods and others which form ensembles of a large number of decision trees and, thus, are not easy to interpret. We find that the simpler interpretable models, coupled with optimized feature selection, perform just as well as the complex non-interpretable models. This contributes to the discussion on using interpretable ML models for high-stake decisionmaking [21, 22] .The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil was reported on February 26, 2020 in the state of São Paulo [23, 24] . Starting in March 2020, control measures were implemented in the country in a decentralized manner, with each state being responsible for the adoption and enforcement of its own set of social distancing measures. The states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were the first to shut down non-essential services, including shopping and fitness centers, and to cancel all public events [25] . At the time of this report, just over six months after confirmation of the first case, the total number of cases in Brazil surpassed the 4 million mark, with over 125,500 deaths [1] , albeit with an estimated reporting rate of only 9.2% [26] .In 2009, the Brazilian Ministry of Health established a nationwide surveilance program for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following the H1N1 Influenza outbreak. The program maintains a publicly available database repository [27] in which all health care institutions must report confirmed ARDS cases. For reporting purposes, Influenza patients are classified as those who present fever or a fever sensation accompanied by one or more of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, dripping nose, difficulty breathing, and nose running down throat. If the condition of a flu patient develops into one or more of the symptoms below, they are classified as ARDS: dyspnea/respiratory distress, persistent chest pressure, oxygen saturation less than 95% in ambient air, bluish color of the lips or face.In 2020, the ARDS program was extended to include COVID-19 surveillance. Data used in this study was extracted from the ARDS surveillance database repository (accessed on July 2, 2020), and included information on demographic characteristics, symptoms and comorbidities, resource usage, x-ray thorax results, and COVID-19 outcome (recovered, deceased, ongoing). Because our goal is to generate predictive models for mortality and ventilation need, we filtered the dataset and retained only cases pertaining to hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and had either recovered or were deceased between March 1 and June 30, 2020. We removed outliers in the dataset which are easily identified, for example, repeated rows, empty entries, and the pregnancy of male patients. After this cleaning process, the number of patients left was 113,314 including 50,387 deceased. A description of the patient features in the dataset with corresponding counts is provided in Table 1 . Note that the sum of the categories of a variable may not total 100%, e.g., in the Race variable. This means that the rest of the observations have unknown values for this variable. In addition to Table 1 , Fig 1 shows the fraction of deceased patients across different characteristics and age groups, e.g., in the upperright box, 0.7 is the ratio of deceased patients who are 65-100 years old and have ARDS over the total number of 65-100 years old patients with ARDS (deceased or not). The study analyzed publicly available data that have been fully de-identified, so additional ethical approval was not required. The primary objective in learning a classifier is to maximize prediction accuracy (or minimize a loss function). In light of the discussion on favoring interpretable models, we will examine our models from two aspects: prediction performance and interpretability.We are interested in defining two prediction tasks, mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation. For each task, we build five classifiers using Logistic Regression (LR), sparse versions of LR and Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests [28] , and Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost [29] ). We choose to construct the SVM and LR classifiers given their ability to provide quantifiable associations with specific variables driving the predictions, which is critical in our setting. Conversely, we use state-of-the-art algorithms: Random Forests and XGBoost, to compare their performance with LR and SVM. A brief discussion of these methods is provided in the S1 File. Evidence has shown that sparse classifiers, i.e., the ones which use a parsimonious set features, offer higher interpretability and they perform better out of sample [30] . To that end, we develop a fully automated pre-processing procedure to select a smaller subset of variables to be used in the classification task. The steps we employ are as follows.First, we (i) remove unknown or missing entries: After performing one-hot encoding for categorical features, we discard all the new variables corresponding to unknown or missing entries, given that these do not add any new information to our predictive task and harm interpretability. Then, we (ii) remove correlated variables to avoid collinearity. In particular, we calculate pairwise correlations among variables, and remove one variable from each highly correlated pair (those with an absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.8). Next, we (iii) remove low influence variables: we separate observations in two classes, the positive (e.g., deceased, or ventilated) and the negative class. Then, for each feature we test whether the two cohorts have the same mean by performing a two-sided t-test. To keep the variables with the higher impact, we retain the ones for which we have a 95% confidence that the mean for the two samples is different. Finally, we perform (iv) Cross-Validated Recursive Feature Elimination [31] : this procedure begins by learning a classifier (we use LR) using all features and computing an importance score. For LR, the importance score is the (absolute) magnitude of the linear coefficient β i of feature i. After this step, the least important feature (the one with the smallest |β i |) is deleted, and this process is repeated iteratively until a single variable is left. At each iteration, we report the performance of the model by using a ten-fold cross-validation, and we pick the set of features that maximize this value. A summary of this feature selection procedure is presented in Fig 2. Note that normalization is not needed given that we are using only binary variables.For all models, we split patients into a training (70%) and test set (30%). We train the models on the training test, and report performance metrics on the test set (out-of-sample). Fig 2  sketches the full approach employed in this paper. To evaluate the performance of the trained classifiers we use two metrics: the false alarm (or false positive) rate and the detection rate. The false alarm rate is the fraction of the patients predicted to be in the positive class while they truly were not, among all negative class patients. The term specificity is often used and it equals 1 minus the false alarm rate. In turn, the detection rate measures the number of patients predicted to be in the positive class while they truly were, divided by all positive class patients. In the medical literature, the detection rate is often referred to as sensitivity or recall. A single metric that encapsulates these errors is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The ROC plots the detection rate over the false positive rate. A blind random selection (assigning patients to classes randomly) has AUC of 0.5 while a perfect classifier an AUC of 1. In addition to the AUC, we report the accuracy of the classifier which calculates the ratio between the number of correct classifications over the total number of predictions. Moreover, we report the weighted F1-score to summarize the precision and recall for both the positive class and the negative class. The weighted F1-score (F1w) computes the weighted average (using the number of samples per class) of the harmonic mean of precision and recall per class. This metric is of interest to this work because it is as important to accurately predict who is likely to, or not to, have a specific outcome. For example, one can lessen physical distancing restrictions based on those who are predicted to have lower risk.We train two classifiers using 70% of the observations to predict (1) mortality and (2) need for a mechanical ventilator for a COVID-19 patient based on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and some clinical information (e.g., x-ray findings). For each model, we compare the performance of five different predictors, which include interpretable and non-interpretable state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results suggest that LR and SVM achieve comparable performance to the non-interpretable methods, as can be seen in Tables 2 and 3 , and provide insights about how different features affect the outcome. Observe that the more complicated methods, RF and XGBoost, do not provide any improvement in performance compared with LR for both tasks. As mentioned earlier, interpretability is desired in this application to identify the main variables used to classify an individual as high (or low) risk. This information can be obtained through the coefficients of the LR model, the odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding confidence intervals (CI) obtained for each variable. Specifically, the Odds Ratio (OR) indicates how the odds of observing the outcome are scaled when the variable takes the value 1 (vs. 0), while controlling for all other variables in the model. Once we identify the features to be used from our feature selection procedure, we use ℓ 2 -regularized LR to compute the coefficients, ORs, and the corresponding confidence intervals. Some of the main features that predict mortality and the need for a mechanical ventilator are related with socioeconomic characteristics rather than with prior medical conditions or symptoms (see Table 4 and Figs 3 and 4) , which can motivate further investigation in this direction. We observe that for predicting mortality, geographic location of the hospital (Northeast OR = 2.2, North OR = 2.0, Midwest OR = 0.8, South OR = 0.6), education level (No education OR = 1.1, Elementary 1-5 OR = 1.0, Medium 1-3 OR = 0.9, Superior OR = 0.6), hospital type (Public OR = 1.24, Private OR = 0.65), and race (Indigenous OR = 1.2, Yellow OR = 1.2, White OR = 0.9) are key variables for classifying the outcome of a patient. Furthermore, to predict the need for mechanical ventilation, geographic location (Northeast OR = 0.53, Midwest OR = 0.45, South OR = 0.33, Southeast OR = 0.33) and education level (Medium 1-3 OR = 0.77, Superior OR = 0.71) are relevant variables. From a clinical perspective, the results of the coefficients are consistent with recent studies highlighting the importance of variables such as age, chronic renal insufficiency, hypoxia, diabetes, and obesity. Figs 3 and 4 depict the ORs with their confidence intervals for the mortality and ventilator models respectively.In addition to these two models, we train more advanced models for predicting the events of interest. These advanced models are provided with more information about the evolution of the disease. For mortality, we include information on whether a patient is in an ICU and on a ventilator. When these data is provided, the accuracy and AUC of the model increases by 6.8% and 8.0%, respectively, compared to the ones presented in Table 2 and Fig 3. Conversely, for the advanced ventilation model, we include the variable ICU which improves the accuracy and AUC of the model by 8.7% and 24.6% respectively. The specific results of these models are provided in the S1 File of this manuscript.We generated moderately to significantly accurate predictive models of mortality and ventilator use for COVID-19 patients that are sparse and interpretable based only on demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and socieconomic variables. Our results confirm previously described clinical presentations and outcomes of COVID-19-related hospital admissions, but also suggest that additional non-clinical features, in particular sociodemographic information, are important explanatory variables. The following comorbidities were found to be highly predictive of mortality: renal (OR = 2.0) and liver chronic disease (OR = 1.7), immunosuppression (OR = 1.7), obesity (OR = 1.7), chronic pneumopathy (OR = 1.4), neurological (OR = 1.6), hematologic (OR = 1.2) and cardiovascular (OR = 1.1) disease, diabetes (OR = 1.4), and immunosuppression (OR = 1.3). Respiratory symptoms, ranging from respiratory discomfort (OR = 1.4) and dyspnea (OR = 1.32) to oxygen saturation less than 95% (OR = 1.7), were also significantly associated with mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Of note, cardiovascular disease includes hypertension, history of myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and other forms of heart disease. Its low effect on predicting mortality is consistent with the observations in [32] .Unlike previous studies, we assessed the relationship between socioeconomic factors and mortality and resource utilization in a low-and middle-income country (LMIC), and found low patient-reported level of education to be significantly associated with mortality (See Table 4 ). We observe that OR for mortality is inversely proportional to self-reported education level, which is suggestive of disparity on health outcomes for different population subgroups. A 2017 census revealed that 7% of the population aged 15 years or older in Brazil was illiterate [33] ; this corresponds to approximately 11.5 million inhabitants. In addition to education, we found that geographic location of the hospital in which a COVID-19 patient was admitted was also a strong predictor of outcome. Based on postal code, we mapped hospital location to one [34] , 80% of which are of self-reported black race [35] . Although Brazil has a mixed delivery system of public and private hospitals, only 24.2% of the population has private insurance [36] . As in many LMICs, SUS is underfunded and overstretched, and resource availability in public health care institutions is limited in comparison with their private counterparts [37] . In contrast, large public hospitals serve as the entry point into the health care system for many severe and/or urgent patients, including those who have access to private insurance and are frequently transferred to private hospitals following initial assessment. Interestingly, our results indicate that COVID-19 patients hospitalized in public hospitals have higher risk of mortality, irrespective of the geographic location of the hospital (as we are controlling for this variable).Taken together, our results highlight the predictive power of socioeconomic information in assessing COVID-19 mortality. From a practical perspective, our findings suggest that decisions on medical resource allocation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic could be guided by local patterns of patient demographics within a LMIC. Moreover, our study suggests that the definition of vulnerable subgroups, for the purposes of targeted policy design, encompasses not only individual patient features (such as race and education level), but also an understanding of the structure of the health care system by which these patients are served. First, we do not claim our results to provide a complete causal-effect analysis, as this task requires a more sophisticated analysis. However, we do think that given all the controls in our models, these results shed light and motivate further investigations of social disparities in health care access in LMICs. Second, from a clinical point of view, it is relevant to highlight that the dataset lacks important information (such as lab results) to provide a clinical assessment of COVID-19. Such information is hard to obtain at the scale we consider. Rather, the focus of this work is to open the discussion about socioeconomic disparities in health access, as well as to help inform decisions on how to best allocate limited medical resources and design targeted policies for vulnerable subgroups which might not have access to clinical and lab assessments. Third, we note that the dataset might be biased towards assessing the risk of high-risk patients given that we are observing only COVID-19 cases which have been hospitalized. for this study dataset does not include specific dates at which hospitals discharge patients, which is of high importance to assess the utilization of medical equipment. to prioritize the use of resources, we understand that medical risk is not the only factor in making such decisions. Nevertheless, in order to quantify medical risk one can leverage the models presented in this work.Classifying the medical risk of COVID-19 patients is relevant for low-and medium-income countries in order to assign limited medical resources more effectively, as well as to help design targeted physical-distancing and work accommodation policies that will assist in reducing economic loss during the current pandemic. In the future, this model could help prioritize vaccine distribution to the more risk-vulnerable and to those who need to interact with them.To facilitate further work, and for the sake of reproducibility, our models and results are available on a public repository [38].

Stressors can increase the risk of exacerbation and fatal outcome in people with pulmonary morbidity. 3 It was hypothesized that COPD patients would present more considerable psychological distress than asthma patients based on disease features. 4 The study aimed to compare the prevalence of depression, perceived stress related to COVID, posttraumatic stress, and insomnia in asthma and COPD patients at a pulmonology clinic in Santa Marta, Colombia.A cross-sectional study was designed; it was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia (Act 002 of March 26th, 2020). Asthma and COPD adult outpatients gave informed consent and participated in the study, as stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki.The patients were contacted by telephone. An electronic link was sent to those who accepted. The questionnaire asked for demographic information and completed four scales: Perceived Stress Related to COVID-19 (a ¼ 0.87), cut-off point 25 for high perceived stress 5 ; Brief Davidson Trauma Scale (a ¼ 0.81), cut-off point 12 for post-traumatic stress risk 6 ; Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9 (a ¼ 0.87), cutoff point 7 for depression risk 7 ; and Athens Insomnia Scale (a ¼ 0.84), cut-off point 6, insomnia risk. 8 Crude odds ratios (OR) were calculated, and after ORs were adjusted for age and gender.Three hundred seven patients was contacted, and 227 (90.2%) accepted to participate in, 148 asthma patients and 144 COPD patients. The ages were between 18 and 96 years (M ¼ 60.4, SD ¼ 17.6); COPD patients were significantly older than asthma patients (M ¼ 70.8, SD ¼ 11.4 versus M ¼ 50.4, SD ¼ 16.7; t ¼ 12.2, df ¼ 290, p < 0.001). By gender, 189 women (64.7%) and 139 men (35.3%); the female group was over-represented in the asthma group (71.6% versus 57.6%, p ¼ 0.01). The prevalence of high COVID-19 perceived stress was 10.6% (n ¼ 31); post-traumatic stress risk, 11.3% (n ¼ 33); depression risk, 31.5% (n ¼ 92); and insomnia risk, 57.7% (n ¼ 169). See Table 1 presents no significant differences between asthma and COPD in indicator of psychological distress.The present analysis was observed a similar frequency of high COVID-19 perceived stress, post-traumatic stress risk, depression risk, and insomnia risk among asthma and COPD patients during the Colombian COVID lockdown. This finding is comparable to a previous study before the COVID pandemic; it was observed that scores for psychological distress were similar among asthma and COPD patients. 9 Conversely, other researchers reported that COPD patients reporting frequent mental distress because it was related to more common physical distress, disability, limitations, or requiring special equipment. 4 It is essential to evaluate and manage psychological distress among asthma and COPD patients. It can reduce the risk of exacerbation and improve the quality of life. 10 This research compares patients with COPD and asthma of the frequency of some psychological distress indicators during the Colombian lockdown; nevertheless, there are some limitations. First, COPD and asthma patients had no control group from the general population. Second, the results cannot be generalized due to the sampling strategy.In conclusion, asthma and COPD patients present similar frequencies of depression risk, COVID-19 perceived stress, post-traumatic stress risk, and insomnia risk during the Colombian lockdown.","Colombia","abstract","2020-10-01",10

The virus has quickly spread across the world, becoming a pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020 (2) . As of July 2020, more than 10 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) across five continents and over 500 thousand deaths have been reported (3) . While respiratory symptoms are the main presentation of COVID-19, such as dry cough and dyspnea gastrointestinal manifestations have also been reported (4, 5) . As the number of cases has increased, so too has our knowledge grown about various symptoms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.SARS-CoV-2 is known to affect host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (ACE2), which in addition to being highly expressed in pulmonary AT2 cells, are also found in the gastrointestinal system such as cells in the esophagus, pancreas, hepatobiliary tract, small bowel, and colonindicating that in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal system is a possible means of infection by COVID-19 (6) . Several studies report patients with COVID-19 presenting with concomitant or isolated gastrointestinal symptoms; however, there remains a paucity of data from the continent of South America (7) (8) (9) . Although the United States has become the new epicenter of COVID-19 with 2.84 million confirmed cases, Brazil has become an emerging hot bed of SARS-CoV-2 infection with 1.54 million cases reported to dateapproximately 13.5% of all confirmed cases (10) . As disease prevalence, presenting symptoms, and outcomes have varied from reports in China to those in the United States and Europe, examination of COVID-19 specific characteristics is highly relevant for the population of Brazil and South America. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and examine gastrointestinal-specific health outcomes in a quaternary referral hospital exclusively treating COVID-19 patients in São Paulo, Brazil (11) .This is a single-center cohort study in a quaternary hospital specifically treating patients with COVID-19 in São Paulo, Brazil. Out the outset of the pandemic, this quaternary university referral center instituted a protocol to exclusively care for COVID-19 patients. This hospital and institution is comprised of the largest public hospital in South America (11) . The hospital is designed to care for patients presenting with moderate and severe disease and receives patient referrals following local government protocol. A total of 400 consecutive, adult patients underwent complete hospitalization from May 1 to June 20, 2020, and were included in this analysis. All patients were followed to hospital discharge or death. Inclusion criteria for hospitalization and study enrollment comprised of only patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase-chain reaction (PCR). Patients with suspicion for COVID-19 based upon symptoms alone or imaging with computed tomography (CT) without PCR confirmation were excluded from this analysis.Demographic patient data (age and gender), and symptoms at the time of presentation were recorded. Symptoms were stratified initially as general symptoms (fever, fatigue, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, or diaphoresis), respiratory symptoms (cough, productive cough, dyspnea, pharyngitis, or rhinorrhea), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, or constipation), as well as other non-specific symptoms including anosmia/ageusia. Additional data abstracted through manual chart review included past medical history including pre-existing comorbid medical conditions, chronic use of angiotensin converting enzymeinhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotension receptor blocker (ARB), chronic use of immunosuppressant medications, clinically relevant laboratory data at time of presentation, and relevant hospitalization characteristics (hospitalization days, intensive care unit [ICU], admission, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors support, and mortality). All data was abstracted manually from electronic medical records using a structured abstraction tool.The primary outcome was the to evaluate the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms among COVID-19 patients and clinically relevant health outcomes including need for ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary analyzes included assessment of prevalence of any gastrointestinal symptoms among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at initial presentation, associations between gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical manifestations, comorbidities, and laboratory results.This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital das Clínicas -University of São Paulo Medical School (HC-FMUSP).Baseline patient characteristics, COVID-19 manifestations, laboratory data, as well as hospitalization outcomes were summarized as means ± standard deviation for continuous data and frequencies and proportions for categorical data. Continuous data were compared using the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test and categorical data were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate (12) . Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine significant predictors of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes and were reported as standardized b coefficients as well as odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). With regard to gastrointestinal symptoms, a regression analysis was performed based upon the 3 most common manifestations while key hospitalization outcomes included need for ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital mortality. Variables for regression analyses included age, gender, obesity, chronic use of ACE-I or ARB and use of immunosuppressant medications, with additional variables determined based upon significant findings on univariable analyses. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p value o0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the Stata 15.0 software package (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX).This study included 400 patients with COVID-19 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Of these patients included in this analysis, 56.25% (n=225) were male, with an average age of 56.4 ± 16.07 years. The most frequent comorbid medical conditions among this population included hypertension (54.64%; n=218), diabetes mellitus (35.93%; n=143), and obesity (21.55%; n=86). A complete breakdown of demographic information and comorbidities is summarized in Table 1 .A total of 133 (33.25%) patients reported at least one gastrointestinal symptom at the time of presentation, with diarrhea (17.25%) being the most prevalent. Other common gastrointestinal manifestations included nausea (13.75%) and anorexia (11.5%), followed by vomiting and abdominal pain observed 7.50% and 6.0% of individuals, respectively.A complete list of gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of presentation among patients is summarized in Table 2 .Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher rates of constitutional symptoms, including fatigue (59.40% vs 44.57%; p=0.0051) and myalgia (42.11% vs 29.96%; p=0.0157). In addition, ageusia was a more common among these patients (22.56% vs 11.24%; p=0.0027). The occurrence of respiratory symptoms did not predominate in a group with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (90.98% vs 93.26%; p=0.4158). Further breakdown of constitutional, respiratory, and other symptoms as stratified by the presence of absence of gastrointestinal manifestations is described in Table 3 .Among included patients, 117 (29.62%) were chronic users of an ACE-I or ARB medication. Forty-five (11.28%) patients were prescribed and taking immunosuppressive medication. Regarding the use of specific medications, there was an association between gastrointestinal symptoms and the use of ACE-I or ARBs (38.46% vs 25.28%; p=0.0069). Patients using immunosuppressants also had a higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms (15.79% vs 9.02%; p=0.0441). Patients with chronic kidney disease had a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (22.56% vs 12.41%; p=0.0087), while patient with previous cerebrovascular accident had lower prevalence (0.75% vs 4.89%; p=0.034). Other comorbidities were not significantly different between groups (Table 1) .Although some laboratory tests were altered such as lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms at time of presentation. Hematological parameters as well as other inflammatory markers were also similar between groups (Table 1) .Main outcomes related to COVID-19 such as length of hospitalization, need for ICU admission, ICU length of stay, need of mechanical ventilation, and need for vasopressor support did not differ between patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (Table 1 ). There was also no significant difference for in-hospital mortality rates between the two groups (21.05% vs 22.85%, p=0.6896).A multivariable logistic regression analysis was then performed for the 3 most common gastrointestinal manifestations to determine their impact on clinically relevant health outcomes ( In this single-center study of quaternary referral care center in São Paulo, Brazil, we found approximately onethird of the patients (33.25%) presented with at least one Interestingly, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (33.25%), most notably diarrhea, has been highly variable worldwidewith our results approximately 3-times higher (5, 13, 14) . However, a recent multi-center study in the United States, not included in those meta-analyses, has reported a prevalence as high as 61.3% (7) . A plausible explanation may be that hospitalized patients have a more systemic disease and thus, would have a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, the 10% to 13% prevalence reported in these meta-analyses is based upon inpatient and outpatient populations. While this may vary on a global scale, the referral natural of this hospital caring for moderate-to-severe disease may result in a greater prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations. This is supported in this study by the observation that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had more general symptoms than patients without gastrointestinal. Anosmia and/or ageusia also had a higher prevalence among patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, similar to an association previously highlighted in a United States study (7) .While baseline demographic and laboratory data were not different between patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, history of a cerebrovascular accident was less prevalent among patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (p=0.0344). This is a new negative association found in this study though difficult to truly explainand may be difficult to determine given the few patients with gastrointestinal manifestations. On the other hand, chronic kidney disease was more prevalent among patients with GI symptoms (p=0.0087), which could potentially be explained by chronic use of ACE-I/ARB among those patientsalso more common among patients with gastrointestinal manifestations. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via cell receptor ACE2 (6) . ACE2 is highly expressed in the respiratory tract cells but also in the gastrointestinal tract cells (6) . That may explain the high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms among patients with COVID-19 and the association with ACE-I/ARB chronic useusually taken by patients with chronic kidney disease , which could upregulate natural receptors for the virus on those cells (15, 16) .In this study, after a multivariable logistic regression, diarrhea was associated with use of ACE-I/ARB [OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.04 to 3.36); p=0.036]. However, the role of ACE-I/ ARB and COVID-19 symptoms remains controversial. Initial concerns were raised about ACE2 upregulation in patients in chronic use of ACE-I/ARB and its impact on severity and mortality of COVID-19 (17) . At least one study supposed a higher mortality among these patients (18) . Two metaanalyses have reached different results: one demonstrating no association between ACE-I/ARB chronic use with disease severity (19) while the other one showed a possible protective effect with lower mortality among ACE-I/ARB users (20) . Our study reported that chronic use of ACE-I/ARB is a protective factor for mechanical ventilation and associated with a lower mortality. A Randomized Clinical Trial comparing suspending or continuing use of ACE-I/ARB in chronic users is currently under way and should aid in understanding the role of those drugs among COVID-19 patients (21) .The main outcomes related to COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization days, ICU admission, ICU days, endotracheal intubation, and need of vasopressor support did not differ between patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. Although gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent and may be associated with specific constitutional symptoms, this finding suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms are not associated to severity of disease nor worse outcomesa finding consistent with other literature (7, 22) . Two metaanalyses found relation between abdominal pain and severe disease, but this did not significantly impact mortality. Severe disease was reported with high heterogeneity between those studies, including oxygen saturation parameters, pulmonary involvement on image exams, and ICU admission, which may lead to imprecision on analyses (13, 14) .On multivariable logistic regression, myalgia and anosmia/ageusia were associated with a decrease in need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Myalgia was even associated with lower mortality among hospitalized patients. Classically, myalgia and anosmia/ageusia are reported as early symptoms in COVID-19 (23, 24) which may translate in our study to mean earlier diagnosis and possibly result in an improved prognosis. Although myalgia is commonly associated with generalized inflammation and cytokine response, a meta-analysis showed that myalgia is not relate with severity or mortality (24) . With regards of anosmia/ageusia, a systematic review that included 42 studies showed an inverse relation with severity and hospitalization, suggesting that anosmia/ageusia are more frequently associated with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (25) .Among patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, obesity and male gender were associated with a higher rate of ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation. Studies, including one meta-analysis, have shown obesity and male gender are associated with more severe disease and poorer outcomes in general population (25, 26) . Fatigue was also an independent factor associated with more ICU admission among patients (25) . Our study demonstrated that fatigue was also associated with more severe disease (i.e., ICU admission). This is an important finding that should prompt attention to the possibility for more severe disease or a prolonged hospital course should patients report fatigue on presentation. With regards to increased mortality, older age, male gender, and immunosuppressed patients were predictorssimilar to what is known in the general population and for a variety of other illnesses (25, 26) .Despite this is the largest single-center Western study related to patients with COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms, our study is not without limitations. First, the retrospective study design and manual chart review may introduce the possibility of biasincluding possible missed or incomplete data, poor medical documentation, and potential for under or over appreciating symptoms at time of hospital presentation. Furthermore, the referral based nature of the hospital may introduce selection bias and inclusion of only hospitalized patients. Yet despite these limitations, our study possesses several strengths. Notably, this study provides important insights regarding COVID-19 from the largest hospital in Brazil, a nation with the second most confirmed cases in the world. As the rate continues to skyrocket, increasing faster than that of the United States, examination of this unique population may prove exceedingly important to determine next steps in identification and understanding of the disease in a South American population.' CONCLUSION Gastrointestinal symptoms are prevalent among patients with COVID-19, with diarrhea being the most common manifestation. Patients in chronic use of ACE-I/ARB are more likely to present with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as the concomitant presentation of myalgia or anosmia/ ageusia with gastrointestinal symptoms. Based upon this analysis, gastrointestinal symptoms do not appear to impact key COVID-19 associated hospitalization outcomes including the need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or all-cause inpatient mortality. Older age, male gender, and immunosuppressed patients were the only conditions associated with higher mortality.Dr. Christopher C.

Although nightmare content differs between cultures, it generally includes attempts to escape an imminent threat, often replicating menacing situations (2, 3) . The year 2020 is being marked by the expansion of the ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID- 19) pandemic, a new disease with high potential for transmissibility and morbidity (4) , forcing many countries to implement extreme measures to restrain its dissemination. One of these global strategies is the establishment of the lockdown (5) (6) (7) (8) , which is generating profound changes on personal and working relations of millions of people-beyond a health crisis, a real economic threat, particularly in Brazil, one of the five largest countries worldwide in both geographical and populational sizes.We believe our multiculturalism and diversity reflect on our current state of disagreement regarding measures to restrain the pandemic, and perhaps amplify this global context that has already caused suffering and fear to too many. The imminent threat of being contaminated by the unknown virus is real, particularly to those closely exposed to it, as is the case of healthcare professionals; besides the grief of hundreds of families who have lost their beloved ones (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . One could name the COVID-19 pandemic as a ""collective mental violence, "" involving great emotional impact and a context of potential ""collective trauma"" of global extension. No precedent data addresses behaviors or mechanisms involved in the metabolization of negative feelings in such a scale of global collectivity, as well as how they might reflect on people's dreams and nightmares.Most theories dedicated to explaining the origin of dreams and, therefore, nightmares, argue in favor of episodic and autobiographical memory participation, although this is not a consensus (3, (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Since the beginning of the twentieth century, authors analyze dream content as a response to waking experiences (17, 18) . Levin and Nielsen (17) , for instance, propose that a dysfunction in affective processes leads to conditioning and to repetition of fear memories, producing nightmares through neural networks associated to limbic (hyperactivated) and prefrontal (hypoactivated) areas (17) . This becomes more evident among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, such as those experiencing periods of war or torture, whom recurrently report repeated nightmares"" (11, 22, 23) .We believe that the experience of a pandemic as COVID-19 may be generating a series of potentially traumatic memories. Reasons are countless, the speed in which real time information travels the globe, their morbid content, the consequences and severity of this new disease without treatment, added to the experience of physical distancing, economic impact, interrupted education, changes in working and familial relations, in ways we obtain food, among others. These memories are in the making and they can modify the occurrence of mental disorders in several ways (21, 22) . For many of these disorders, their first manifestation is trouble sleeping, particularly nightmares. This becomes even more important when we analyze current evidence demonstrating an association between bad dreams and an increase in suicide and self-injury (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) ; beyond the development of medical diseases (29, 30) .We hypothesize that social distancing and the perception of risk of acquiring COVID-19 impact on the occurrence of nightmares and how they associate to health-risk behaviors and suicidal ideation during this unprecedented moment in time. In order to provide current data to healthcare organizations and policy makers, considering the need for innovative psychosocial interventions in the near future, and stressing the relevance of such threats to public mental health, we designed an online survey aimed at identifying changes in the frequency and content of nightmares and their associated factors. Participants were invited to complete an online survey entitled ""Mental Violence: the COVID nightmare."" Link access to the structured survey, along with an informed consent form, was spread through social media, for 7 days, between May 25th and June 1st, 2020. Initially, the research access link was launched for groups of family members, students, Church members, multidisciplinary health groups, teachers, groups of engineers, artists, parents from nursery schools, and several other groups asked to replicate the link through Facebook and other social media. The survey included questions about nightmares, sociodemographic characteristics, occupational status, healthrisk behaviors, and clinical antecedents. Participation was voluntary and anonymous, via an online Google Form. Individuals could participate and invite others in an active way, by individual or collective call (transmission groups).This is an exploratory cross-sectional study including a structured survey elaborated by the researchers, focused on determining the occurrence of nightmares and related events before (until December 2019) and during the pandemic (after January 2020 onwards), analyzing associations with risk perception and self-protection measures.The survey was structured with the following sections: (1) sociodemographic data-age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, state of residence, and religion; (2) occupational status and exposure to the COVID-19-professional category, occupation, exposure and threat related to coronavirus, as well as social isolation and the use of facial mask; (3) personal and clinical antecedents-health-risk behaviors, sleep, and previous medical and psychiatric conditions, including suicidal ideation related to the pandemic; and (4) nightmares assessment-frequency of nightmares before and during the pandemic (""no nightmares, "" ""less than once a week, "" and ""once a week or more""), along with specific content related to the pandemic.We used two questions to define pandemic and non-pandemic nightmares, based on the literature (31) . The first question was close ended and included 10 pre-categorized items based on previously described nightmare contents (violence/aggression, venomous animals, screaming, or seeing blood), as well as on pandemic related situations, such as dying, people dying, or having relatives dying from COVID-19, difficulty breathing, lung failure, and other symptoms. The second question was openended and asked for brief examples of nightmares during the pandemic. The answers were analyzed and grouped according to the presence or absence of elements related to the pandemic context, after a series of team discussions.Pandemic nightmares included contents such as: ""being confined and not being able to see anyone, "" unexpected and premature deaths, being contaminated or having a family member contaminated, ""being chased by infected people, "" suffocation or respiratory symptoms, ""forgetting to use individual protection equipment, "" facing conflicts with medical decisions and inpatients, having COVID-19 symptoms (such as anosmia, loss of taste), hospitalization because of COVID-19, funerals, financial struggle because of the pandemic, ""noise from fans and alarms in the ICU, "" among others.Non-pandemic nightmares included: being chased, physical aggression, screaming, family fights, being haunted, extraterrestrials, childhood nightmares, miscarriage, work related conflicts, ghosts, conflicts with family and friends, ""being alone and looking for a destiny and not finding it, "" having a house destroyed, accidents, failing tests or exams, assaults, robberies, getting lost in strange places, among others.Independent variables included health-risk behaviors, clinical antecedents, and COVID-19 related variables. Participants were asked whether they were following social distancing and selfprotection measures, for how long, whether they needed to isolate from family members due to risk of contamination, or for interacting with coworkers with a high risk of exposure to other infected individuals. Usual frequency and amount of alcohol consumed before the pandemic, as well as changes in consumption during the pandemic were also assessed, along with average sleep duration in the past month, use of sleep medication, and previous psychiatric care for insomnia, depression, or anxiety. We also asked whether participants were having suicidal ideation (or a desire to die) during the pandemic.Descriptive statistics include absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviation for continuous variables. To compare proportions and test association between groups we used the Chi-square test. To compare the proportion of nightmares before and during the pandemic we performed the McNemar's non-parametric test (32) , used for comparison of paired samples. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the strength of association between the independent variables and the occurrence of nightmares during the pandemic. Analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25 (33) .A total of 1,057 participants from 21 Brazilian states, with a mean age of 38.1 ± 13.7 years (ranging 18-79) and 78% women, responded the questionnaire and were included in this study. Most were white (77%), married (45%), from either the South (55%) or Southeast (36%) regions in Brazil, and declared being Catholic (42%). Over 1/3 of the respondents were healthcare professionals (38%). We observed nearly a 3-fold increase in the frequency of nightmares during the pandemic. Whilst 8.9% (n = 94) of the participants had nightmares more than once a week until before the pandemic, during the outbreak this number raised to 25.5% (n = 270). Table 1 shows sample characteristics. *Eight participants reported having nightmares during the pandemic but did not describe an example of such nightmares.In Table 2 , we show associations between sample characteristics and groups defined by the frequency of nightmares during the pandemic. Women, younger, and single individuals were found to report more nightmares, as Less than once a week Once a week or more well as participants without religious affiliations. We observed no differences in the frequency of nightmares by ethnic groups, regions of Brazil, or occupational status. Of all the participants, 32.9% (n = 348) reported nightmares with a pandemic content; 42% having these pandemic nightmares less than once a week and 57% once a week or more. Four participants (1%) answered they had no nightmares during the pandemic but did describe a pandemic nightmare in the open-ended question ( Table 1) .Drinking generally over two doses of alcohol once a week or more was associated with more nightmares during the pandemic. Both increasing and decreasing alcohol consumption had an effect in the occurrence of nightmares during the pandemic ( Table 3) .Respondents who slept fewer hours and were taking sleeping pills reported more frequent nightmares during the pandemic, as well as those with a history of psychiatric disturbances. Onethird of the participants with more frequent nightmares during the pandemic reported having experienced suicidal thoughts and ideation ( Table 3) .Measures During COVID-19 Table 4 shows associations between the frequency of nightmares during the pandemic and variables related to COVID-19. ""Perceiving high risk of contamination"" and ""isolation from family members"" were associated with more frequent nightmares. Positive COVID-19 diagnosis, judging it dangerous, contacting exposed individuals, following isolation measures, and the use of facial masks were not associated. We also checked whether the frequency of pandemic and non-pandemic nightmares would be different between healthcare professionals and individuals with other occupations, and we observed no effects.In the multiple regression analysis, we applied the Backward stepwise selection method to retain variables and found the following independent risk factors for the occurrence of nightmares during the pandemic, independently of their frequency: being woman, of younger age, having previous psychiatric conditions, use of sleep medication, perceiving a high risk of contracting COVID-19, increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, and suicidal ideation. The later with the strongest effect, that is, individuals reporting suicidal ideation during the pandemic were almost 3 times more likely to be experiencing nightmares. In a second model, we excluded individuals without nightmares and compared between those reporting or not nightmares with a pandemic content. Previous psychiatric conditions, the use of sleep medication, and younger ages were the variables that remained significant and with independent effects on pandemic nightmares ( Table 5) .This is one of the first studies to analyze nightmares in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the frequency of nightmares seen before the pandemic, we observed nearly Results are based on non-empty rows and columns in each innermost sub-table. *The Chi-square statistic is significant at the 0.05 level.a 3-fold increase in the number of participants reporting nightmares ""once a week or more"" during the pandemic. Over 2/3 of these participants also described nightmares Results are based on non-empty rows and columns in each innermost sub- with a pandemic content. These findings are supported by previous theoretical conceptualizations reporting dreams and nightmares as adaptative biological responses with an adjustment function (18) . According to epidemiological data, ∼6-16% of the general population report having nightmares at least once a week (3, 34, 35) . The prevalence of nightmares is generally more frequent among younger individuals, particularly children and adolescents as compared to adults (1, 2, 23, 35) . Women are more likely to complaint of nightmares, also individuals with other psychiatric conditions, such as those with post-traumatic stress disorders (2, 22, 23) . Logistic regression models using Backward stepwise variable selection method. Variables entered on step 1 of both models were: Previous psychiatric conditions, suicide ideation during the pandemic, sleep duration, sleep medication, occupational status, smoking, frequency of alcohol consumption, change in alcohol consumption during the pandemic, following social distance measures, use of facial mask, positive COVID-19 diagnosis, perceived danger of the COVID-19, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, contact with exposed individuals, isolation from family members, gender, and age. Model 1 stopped at the 11th step, whereas model 2 at the 15th step.Several theoretical studies indicate that not all recent daytime experiences will turn into oniric experiences, but rather, those with emotional content (36, 37) . The significant high frequency of nightmares may reflect the anxiogenic context experienced during the unprecedented pandemic, emphasizing the status of ""mental violence"" or ""collective trauma."" Nightmares are REM parasomnias; which role seems to be linked to consolidation of memories processes and emotional memories (38) .In this context, with a significant proportion of participants reporting nightmares during the pandemic, and most of them have pandemic content, this becomes particularly relevant given the anxiogenic new condition, in which people tend to have negative interpretations of reality. The exposure to pandemicrelated stressors and the emotional content of daily memories could corroborate to explain some aspects of nightmares disorders and REM parasomnia (39, 40) . Thus, experiences with intense emotional content, whether positive or negative, would be more easily stored and, consequently, processed during REM sleep, by the activation of cortical regions related to recognition and emotion confrontation, such as amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortices and the anterior cingulate gyrus (38, 41) .As previously noted, dysfunctional affective processes may lead to a repeating reprocessing of fear memories (17) . Neural networks associated with limbic areas (hyperactivated) and prefrontal (hypoactivated) are related to this repetitive activation of fear memories, which would generate the nightmares, and whose frequency increases when the emotional charge or stress level elevate (17, 35) . This would happen in patients with mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (17, 35) . Indeed, having previous history of psychiatric disorder increased the risk of nightmares in our study. We have also found that women are more likely to have nightmares than men and that the frequency of nightmares decreases with age. It might be expected, since anxiety, depression and insomnia are also more prevalent among women (42) . With regard to age, the prevalence of nightmares is higher among children and younger individuals and tend to lower with aging (1, 2, 23, 35, 43) .We have not found significant difference between the frequency of pandemic and non-pandemic nightmares, when comparing the results of health professionals to that from the general population, although we found a greater chance of nightmares among those who had a perceived increased risk of contamination. Interestingly, when pandemic-related content nightmares were regarded, only age, previous psychiatry condition, and taking sleeping pills.Another possible explanation for this result, may rely on the fact that even though the health professionals spend more time in contact with the new COVID-19 disease reality, the general population is over-exposed to real-time information of great emotional impact, especially through the media and social networks. Gao et al. (44) made an association between the prevalence of mental health issues and the social media exposure during the pandemic, in a sample of 4,872 participants, demonstrating the high prevalence of mental health issues associated to the ""infodemic"" during the COVID-19 outbreak.Another relevant result refers to the significant association between the frequency of nightmares during the pandemic and the 2.6-fold increase in the chance of suicidal ideation. Tae et al. (45) reported, with a sample of 909 adults the correlations between sleeping problems and suicidal ideation, associated or not with depressive disorders, finding out that more than 94% of the participants with suicidal ideation also had sleeping problems. However, another study demonstrated that insomnia and nightmares are associated with an elevated suicide risk as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviors among a sample of young adults (24) .Regression results also showed a dose-response association between alcohol consumption and the presence of nightmares. This is in agreement with previous report that compared a group of 37 patients with alcohol addiction to a group of 35 non-addicted patients, and found that the quality of sleep was lower among the alcohol addicted individuals and the subjective experience of dreams was more negatively toned in this group, improving after 4 weeks of abstinence (46) . Similar result was found among sleeping pills users. Drugs acting on GABAergic receptors, as well as with sedative hypnotic effects are likely to induce nightmares in some patients (47) .Potential limitations of this study refer to selection bias. We describe a non-probabilistic sample including mostly women who responded to an online survey about nightmares during the pandemic. It is possible that a larger proportion of individuals suffering from nightmares responded and men are underrepresented. Nevertheless, participants were from 21 out of 26 Brazilian states, half had no nightmare complaint whatsoever, and the prevalence of frequent nightmares before the pandemic-occurring at least once a week and as described in diagnostic manuals-was similar to that described by epidemiological studies (3, 34, 35) . Moreover, we were particularly interested in seeing the frequency of pandemic contents among individuals with and without previous nightmare complaints. The other potential limitation is that nightmare frequency was assessed at a single point in time, and therefore relied on participant's long-term memory from the pre-pandemic period. People might be more likely to recall nightmares that happened in the recent past rather than nightmares that happened a while ago. As aforementioned, however, nightmare frequency reported for the pre-pandemic period is similar to general nightmare frequency reported in the literature. Future research could evaluate whether nightmare frequency changes if measured with a dream-log that participants fill in everyday for a period.In summary, our findings suggest the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting people's lives and dreams, what is evidenced by the significant increase in the frequency of nightmares and in association with suicidal ideation, as well as with changes in health-risk behaviors. High frequency of nightmares whether related or not to pandemic contents, should be inquired by healthcare professionals, as it is associated with significant mental health morbidity.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-30",10

It presents limitations such as incorrect collection and processing of samples, the need of expensive equipment and reagents, trained operators and the delay in releasing the results [1, 2, 6, 7] .The immunochromatographic (IC) assay is a feasible and low-cost alternative for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population in general and specially in low and middle-income countries which lack of structure. Contact-tracing, population survey including health workers, teachers and students on resuming classes are situations that may be useful to use serology since the sensitivity of RT-PCR in asymptomatic is low and ranges from 8 to 10% [1, 2] .Likewise COVID-19, Dengue is also an emerging disease, especially in tropical and subtropical countries transmitted by Aedes mosquito, and both diseases are similar regarding clinical and laboratory features hampering the diagnosis [8] [9] [10] . Another matter is the temporal dynamic of both diseases in Brazil. The spread of Dengue usually increases between March and April due the rainy seasons, the same period when respiratory diseases are most common, and period in which the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases started to rise [10] .Despite the high number of IC assays available, the readiness to perform the diagnosis and advantages involving its use, here we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different IC assays in serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests.This study was approved by the Brazilian national ethics review board (CONEP), protocol number 30701920200000068.The validity of tests was measured through sensitivity (true positive / true positive + false negative = %) and specificity (true negative / true negative + false positive = %) calculations [11] . The concordance analysis was performed by the Fleiss's Kappa method comparing the agreement between the gold standard (RT-PCR) and each one of the eleventested IC assays, the confidence interval was 95%.Altogether 198 serum samples were collected for this study, among them, 98 samples were collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients through RT-PCR, 74 of these patients' samples were collected before the 10 th day since the onset of symptoms and 24 samples were collected after 10 days since the beginning of symptoms. In addition, as negative control were used 100 samples collected from blood donors on early 2019. The sensitivity and specificity as well as agreement ratio of eleven commercial qualitative IC assays were evaluated; the results were obtained through tests performed between May/2020 and July/2020.A panel containing 74 positive samples and 100 negative samples was used to evaluate the sensibility of eleven IC tests. As summarized in table 2, among the tests, ten of them describe separately the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies and one of them Wondfo (China) evidence the presence of total immunoglobulins. The greater sensitivity for detection of only IgG antibody among ten IC tests was observed in TBG (Taiwan) IC test at 93.3%, followed by Ecotest (Brazil) and Lepu (China) IC test at 90%, Bioclin (Brazil) at 81%, MedTest (China) and Thermogenesis (China) presented equivalent results (80%), followed by MedNet (China), Advagen (Brazil) and Luxus (China) at 77.5%, 75.2% and 75% respectively. The Camtech (Singapore) presented the lower sensitivity among the tests at 70%.In this study, we evaluated eleven IC colloidal-gold qualitative based assays and analyzed the quality measurements of each one of them. According to our results, most of IC assays provide high sensitivity and specificity compared to the gold standard RT-PCR, especially after 10 days since the onset of disease with an excellent agreement ratio compared to the gold standard using Wondfo test evaluating total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world health system in an unprecedented way. In Brazil the first reported case occurred on February 27 th , 2020, since them more than 1 million Brazilian people tested positive for COVID-19 [4, 12] . Besides COVID-19, Brazil also faces an endemic situation regarding to Dengue, and considering the importance of both diseases, here we evaluated the cross-reactivity of Dengue and COVID-19 using different tests.The IC assay is based on the detection of antibodies secreted by B lymphocytes against the viral pathogens using serum, plasma or whole blood samples from patients and a specific buffer on an immunochromatographic cassette [1, 2, 14, 15] . The cassette is composed by plastic backing involving the strip where reaction occurs, sample pad for sample addition, conjugated pad containing antigens bound to colloidal nanoparticles, absorbent pad for waste reservoir, and the nitrocellulose membrane in which by capillary attraction the antigenantibody reaction occurs, evidenced through a colored band (red color for colloidal-gold nanoparticles and blue color for colloidal selenium nanoparticles) in about 15 to 20 minutes [1, 2, 14, 15] .Immunochromatographic is an easy and affordable method for diagnosis enabling prompt results in large scale. According to our results, the agreement ratio for detection of only IgG antibodies before the 10º day of symptom using IC technique in comparison with RT-PCR was moderate in the majority of used tests (50%), followed by strong agreement (40%) and weak agreement (10%). In contrast, for only IgM detection the agreement ratio between IC and RT-PCR was strong in the majority of tests (40%) followed by a moderate (30%), weak (20%) and minimal (10%) agreement. The evaluation of total antibodies using Wondfo test demonstrated better results using samples collected after the 10º day of symptoms (almost perfect agreement) than before this period (moderate agreement) compared to RT-PCR, the increase in sensitivity was also observed using MedNet test in samples after 10 days since the onset of symptoms.In the literature, it is possible to find the detection of immunoglobulin on the 5 th day since the onset of disease. However, this detection is greater from the 8 th day on [15] . Our results are in accordance with literature, demonstrating an increase in sensitivity levels especially using the combined assessment of IgG and IgM antibodies.Our study has limitations such as sample size; however, to our knowledge it was the first study that analyzed several SARS-CoV-2 IC tests and cross-reaction with Dengue. Thus, our findings can be useful in countries with high prevalence of Dengue to alert to the possible cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IC assays, mainly IgM, with Dengue antibodies.We found in general high sensitivity and specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. Our results also evidenced the importance in evaluating total immunoglobulins to increase sensitivity and specificity of IC assays. On the other hand, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 demonstrating the need for better studies and improvements in diagnostic techniques for these diseases.In this study, a small number of samples was tested due to the availability of tests that we had at the beginning of COVID-19 in Brazil. Studies with more samples are needed to ensure validity of the results. Both authors contributed equally in the development of the study.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-13",10

The assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used to assess antibody titers for clinical trials and therapies across the country. Here, we demonstrate the importance of providing a robust and specific serologic assay for generating new information about antibody kinetics in infected individuals and mitigation policies to cope with pandemic needs.The development of robust and specific serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the pandemic evolution and to stablish mitigation strategies. Here, we report the emergency development, production and application of a versatile ELISA test for detecting antibodies against the whole spike protein and its receptor binding domain. Over half million tests have been freely distributed in public and private health institutions of Argentina for evaluating immune responses, convalescent plasma programs and for large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods and health care workers. We are still learning how and when to use serologic testing in different epidemiological settings. This program allowed us to produce large amount of high quality data on antibody levels in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and generate relevant information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics. We also present standardized protocols for antibody quantification as guidance for convalescent donor plasma selection in hospitals throughout the country for compassionate use and clinical trials. Here, we provide a framework for generating widely available tools, protocols and information of antibody responses for pandemic management.The Americas have been profoundly impacted and have become the epicenter of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , as in October 13th more than 18 million infections and more than 550,000 deaths have been reported in the continent.Surveillance and testing are fundamental in controlling viral spread and understanding pandemic evolution. Detection of viral RNA by qPCR is the gold standard for diagnosis of acute infections. Measurement of humoral responses has been used as a complement to nucleic acid testing, for diagnosis of suspected cases with negative qPCR results, and for detection of acute or past infections in asymptomatic cases [1] . However, serology became an essential tool for the management of the pandemic, including seroprevalence assessment of immunity in the population, measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent patients and antibody response upon vaccination [2, 3] .Antibody mediated immunity is thought to protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection by interfering with viral entry and/or viral replication. Antibody responses appear within the first week of symptoms onset in about 30 to 40 % of infections and, in most cases, simultaneous or close seroconversion for IgM and IgG were observed [1, 4] . Antibodies have been detected in more than 90% of infections after the third week of symptoms onset [5] . However, the duration and degree to which recovery from COVID-19 disease, or asymptomatic infection, confers prolonged immunity from reinfection is still unclear, even among individuals with high antibody titers [6, 7] . We are still learning about the dynamic nature of antibody response linked to severe, mild, and asymptomatic COVID-19 manifestations and, as the pandemic progresses, algorithms and strategies to implement serologic testing in different epidemiological settings are under evaluation. For understanding this complex process, it is essential to have highly specific and sensitive serologic assays [8, 9] . Based on the urgent need to attain reliable tests that measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we redirected resources of a basic molecular virology laboratory, as part of a national task force for the emergency, for the development and production of an affordable and robust serologic assay for Argentina and neighboring countries. COVIDAR serologic test was generated early after the first COVID-19 case in Argentina, and over half million tests have been already produced and distributed for free in the country.Studies using SARS-CoV-2 in plaque reduction assays or pseudotyped particle-based systems indicate that plasma derived from convalescent patients has potent neutralizing activity related to IgG molecules recognizing the spike protein, suggesting that IgG antibodies against spike have high potential to fulfill neutralizing functions in vivo [18] [19] [20] [21] .We developed standardized protocols for antibody quantification using COVIDAR IgG and provided data showing a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody measurements. This information allowed the implementation of protocols in hospitals throughout the country assessing plasma donors for compassionate use (https://www.groupcpc-19.com/) and for randomized multicenter clinical trials [22, 23] .Samples were grouped according to days of symptoms onset (SO). In the early phase, within 7 days of SO, the IgG sensitivity was 35% ( Figure 1A ). The sensitivity for IgG detection increased from 72% to 74% between 2 and 3 weeks, and seroconversion increased up to 90.4% after 3 weeks. In addition, within 100 samples with >45 days of SO, 5 did not show presence of IgG, indicating that 5% of the patients displayed undetectable levels of IgG or they were non-responders up to 45 days. Regarding IgM, within 7 days of SO, sensitivity was 46%. IgM levels were highest between 15 and 21 days, and although IgM positivity increased after 3 weeks, the antibody level observed by optic density (OD) at 450 nm clearly decreased ( Figure 1A ).Assessment of 277 pre-pandemic samples, including acute infections of other pathogens (dengue, HCV, HIV and seasonal coronavirus), were performed. The cut off for IgG and IgM were defined to maximize specificity, ensuring no false positives. Thus, the cut off was defined as the mean of negative control plus 10 or 5 standard deviations for IgG and IgM, respectively ( Figure 1B ). High specificity of COVIDAR IgG has been supported by baseline seroprevalence studies of heath care professionals (HCP). In this regard, seroprevalence in HCP at region VIII of Buenos Aires Province, performed in June 2020, showed 0.74% of IgG positivity [25] .Well-designed serosurveys are essential to determine how prevalent COVID-19 is in the general population, in selected subsections of the population (such as health care workers), or in specific risk groups. Highly specific and sensitive assays are desirable for accurate seroprevalence studies; however, it is also necessary to have methods that are suitable for simple and fast sample collection. ELISA assays use venipuncture, and require refrigerated storage of samples during transportation, making the assay incompatible with massive testing. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the COVIDAR IgG and IgM assays to work with whole blood samples obtained by finger prick. A selfcontained Serokit was validated for storage and transportation of whole blood using a glycerin based preservation system [26] . Similar methods have been extensively used in serosurvey studies of Chagas disease conducted in rural areas of Argentina [27] .To validate the process, 68 paired serum and whole blood samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 qPCR positive patients were used. All serum specimens were kept at 4°C, while whole blood samples collected from the same individuals were divided as follows.The validation of finger prick capillary whole blood sample application with Serokit storage widened COVIDAR use to field serosurveys. Until now, seroprevalence studies in nine slums of Buenos Aires, and surveillance studies among HCP in 30 hospitals have been conducted [28] [29] [30] .An important limitation to evaluate the quality and quantity of antibodies present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the lack of tests that can be easily performed in each institution for possible therapies and clinical studies. Previous analysis using serologic test assessing IgG titers directed to RBD and/or spike have shown a positive correlation with antibody neutralization [7] . Due to the urgent need for tools, we validated an IgG titration protocol using COVIDAR and performed correlations with neutralizing antibody titers. Protocols and COVIDAR kits for IgG titration were freely distributed in private and public institutions in 20 out of 23 provinces of the country, in which more than 100,000 tests have been already performed.Five hundred and sixty-one convalescent donor plasma samples were tittered in our laboratory for standardization. A distribution analysis of the amount of donors and IgG levels indicate that more than 80% of the samples displayed spike specific end point IgG titers above 1/400. Hyper-immune plasmas with titers as high as 1/400,000 were observed ( Figure 5A ). A significant difference of IgG titers was observed between donors that experienced mild symptoms and those that experienced moderate or severe symptoms, median of 1/800 and 1/6400, respectively (p=0.0001) ( Figure 5A ). Full titration curves are shown in heat maps to illustrate this distribution ( Figure 5B ).The development and appropriate application of serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are essential to determine the pandemic evolution and stablish mitigation policies. Here, we developed and produced a widely available serologic tool to assist health authorities for pandemic management. Protocols and reagents were distributed to evaluate immune status of hospitalized patients, surveillance of at risk groups, seroprevalence studies in different populations and evaluation of plasma from convalescent donors for possible therapies. The biggest challenge still stands regarding how to deploy this tool in a strategic manner to bring communities out of the current suffering.of whether IgM and/or IgG seroconversion time indicates the end of infectiousness or whether early antibody appearance may overlap with active infection and possible transmission. Although this is an issue that requires further attention, periodic serology testing has been useful for guiding focused qPCR testing, asymptomatic case identification and contact tracing.The fraction of asymptomatic but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates pandemic potential. Viral load and antibody responses in asymptomatic individuals are both important to understand transmission and pandemic extension. It is still unclear how many people carry SARS-CoV-2 infection asymptomatically. It has been shown that the ratio symptomatic to asymptomatic cases changes in different settings. Ratios from 2:1 to near 1:8 symptomatic to asymptomatic cases have been reported [28, 32, 33] . The factors that influence this large variation are still unknown. One concern is that the low level of antibodies found in asymptomatic cases may lead to their underestimation [34] . Our studies show wide individual variations in the antibody response and kinetics in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. We found that asymptomatic individuals displayed lower overall antibody levels than those observed in COVID-19 symptomatic patients (Figure 3) . A positive correlation between disease severity and levels of IgG and IgM in acute and convalescent stages was also observed ( Fig 1C and 5A ), in agreement with previous studies [6, 35] . Another important issue is the duration of IgM antibodies. Our longitudinal study using 93 infected individuals showed that IgM levels wane in 60% of the cases within 30 days of SO (or first qPCR detection for asymptomatic cases). However, IgM levels were still detected after 30 or even 60 days in 40% of the cases, suggesting that IgM detection does not necessarily reflect a recent infection.Factors that affect the spread and dynamic of the virus in different geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic areas are still unclear. Reliable reagents to perform large and periodic serosurveys are urgently needed. Here, we provided a tool for using whole blood by finger pricking, followed by IgG and IgM tests, to facilitate large sampling together with a robust ELISA assay. This approach has been used in different neighborhoods and defined at-risk populations in Argentina with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence from less than 1 to more than 50% [28, 29] , supporting the convenience and utility of the application.It is important to stress the relevance of widely available quantitative serologic assays.Passive antibody transfer is a treatment strategy that has been used for COVID-19, including plasma and purified immunoglobulins derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors. Although the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment remains uncertain, recent reports indicate a clinical benefit associated with high-titer units administered early in the course of the infection [16] . In this regard, an important limitation has been to obtain harmonized antibody titers information used in different clinical trials and therapeutic applications. By tittering more than 500 convalescent plasma samples, we showed a diversity of titers, which correlated with donor disease severity ( Figure 5A ). We provided a standardized protocol, widely distributed and used in Argentina for quantitative IgG measurements. A positive correlation between IgG quantitation, using COVIDAR, with neutralizing activity measured by a pseudotyped virus was shown ( Figure 5C ). This protocol has been useful to normalize quantifications at hospitals and heath institutions using plasma for compassionate therapies and for different clinical trials [22, 23] . Although IgG titers correlated with neutralizing activities, the relevant open question is how they correlate with protection [38, 39] .Culture supernatants were applied using a peristaltic pump to HisTrap excel columns (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 2-3 ml/min, using 1 ml of media for each 100 ml of supernatant. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of buffer A (NaH2PO4 57,5mM, NaCl 300 mM, pH 7.8) and next with 60 volumes of buffer A with 10 mM imidazol. Then, columns were connected to an HPLC system (Kanuer) and washed at 2 ml/min with the last buffer until absorbance at 280 nm reached a value below 0.005. Proteins were eluted with a 12 minute linear gradient from 10 to 1 M imidazole in buffer A. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Buffer of fractions containing protein was exchange to PBS with NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) and pooled. Typical yields were around 6 and 45 mg/l for spike and RBD, respectively, with a purity level of at least 98 %.Human plasma and serum samples were obtained from a number of different sources following the subsequent inclusion criteria: people aged over 16 years, of any sex who Longitudinal studies were performed using samples from de-identified patients from Sanatorio de La Trinidad Mitre and Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín (n=118).Samples were taken every 2 to 4 days until the patient was discharged from the hospital.The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was reviewed and approved by the Bioethics Committee of Fundación Instituto Leloir (HHS IRB # 00007572) (CBFIL Protocol #35). All participants provided written informed consent prior to the study. As for participants under 18, informed consent was not obtained since samples were de-identified.Sample collection and processing were performed from April 2020 to September 2020.Neutralization assays were carried out with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp), generated in Benhur Lee's laboratory [31] .

The promise of island epidemiology is that transmission can be more closely monitored, and therefore the dynamics of transmission and the effect of interventions can be more effectively explored. This is especially critical in Brazil, until recently, the country with the second largest number of COVID-19 cases in the world 2 . Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FNA) are 21 islands about 350 kilometers off Brazil's northeast coast. The official population of the islands is about 3000, all living on the main island that covers 17 km 2 . The total territory of the archipelago is 26 km 2 3 .FNA is managed by an administrator-general appointed by the Pernambuco state government. Most of FNA was declared a National Park in 1988. In 2001, UNESCO declared FNA a World Heritage Site, boosting tourism, the main economic activity of the island 4 . In 1942, the United States Army Air Force built an airport on the island to support the Allied campaign in Africa. At the end of the war FNA was returned to Brazil. Fernando de Noronha Airport is served by daily flights from Recife and Natal. In January and February 2020, Fernando de Noronha received 38 weekly flights, carrying an average of 452 passengers per day. Between April and June, frequency dropped to one per week, carrying an average of 4 passengers per day 5 .Pernambuco is especially hard-hit by COVID-19, registering 132,152 cases (1382.8 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and 7,702 deaths (80.6 deaths/100,000 inhabitants) by September 6 . FNA initiated prevention activities in the first half of March 2020, before the first official COVID-19 case was reported in the state. These included imposing a lockdown, promoting physical distancing and providing emergency assistance to the neediest families; enhancing testing for Sars-Cov-2, including monitoring of arriving travelers, restricting access to the island and the initiation of the cohort study described here to estimate the incidence and prevalence of Covid-19. In spite of special attention, before the beginning of this study at the end of May, 2020, there were 28 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in the archipelago 7 2020b . In addition to conventional measures the Government of Pernambuco and local authorities implemented a series of prevention measures unique in Brazil, such as active case detection and contact tracing, and movement regulation for all islanders.The potential to control the pandemic on this island, and better understand the uptake and effectiveness of control measures motivated our team to focus on Fernando de Noronha. The objective of this article is to discuss these control activities and report the results of the first round of the cohort study.We implemented the study in FNA in two ways: 1) documenting pandemic-related events and documents, including epidemiological bulletins; and 2) a prospective cohort study.First we reviewed data extracted from the following sources: 1) demographic and socioeconomic data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 8 ; 2) state and district decrees and 4 ordinances; 3) number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 reported by the Pernambuco State Health Department; 4) flights and passengers from the National Aviation Agency 5 ; and 5) information provided by local authorities and residents. The data were systematized as per the Center for Disaster Studies, FIOCRUZ 9 . The second method is a cohort study including questionnaires and biological testing that began on May 22, 2020 and will be repeated at 60, 120, 180 and 360 days from baseline.All individuals residing on the island of any age were eligible to be included in the study. Names and addresses were drawn at random from a current list of all residents. Residents were excluded if not found at home after a second visit and replaced with another randomly selected. 10 . However, the situation of the AFN is unique, given exclusion of visitors since March 20. Thus, we estimate that there are about 4 unknown cases for each known case (112 cases), yielding an incidence of 2.7%.Participants were interviewed with appropriate hygiene measures to record: 1) demographic characteristics; 2) socioeconomic status (SES) and housing conditions, 3) clinical, epidemiological and health services variables; 4) measures adopted to prevent COVID-19; 5) mental health; and 6) food insecurity. To measure SES we used the Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria (BC). BC uses kind and number of possessions, employment status, housing characteristics and education of the household head to characterize SES. Questionnaires were entered using SurveyMonkey® and exported to STATA® v.16 for analysis.Samples of venous blood were collected for Rapid Serological Test (RST) 11 and a nasopharyngeal swab collected for RT-PCR. The RST used the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test Kit (IgG / IgM) by Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co., Ltd. The viral RNA was extracted using the QuickExtract ™ RNA Extraction Kit (Biosearch. -Ref.: QER090150) according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR tests were conducted using primers and probes to detect 3 target regions of Coronavirus (N1, N2, N3) and to detect RnaseP. The primer and probe sequences have been validated by the CDC (USA).Analysis A table, listing type and date of intervention and events was prepared. Data from epidemiological bulletins were compared to these measures to explore their effects. For the cohort study, the prevalence of the variables included were calculated using Stata® v.16 with their respective 95% confidence intervals. The findings were compared to national estimates and with experience on other islands of similar size.The government of Pernambuco and the FNA administration reorganized the response to COVID-19, opening State and District COVID-19 Offices. The offices promulgated WHO (2020) and PAHO (2020) recommendations concerning social distancing, testing, isolation and other measures. They published state and district epidemiological bulletins about COVID-19 and presented plans and control measures using radio and print. They implemented strict border controls for the island, with drastic reductions in flights. They prohibited entry to the island for almost all civilians, including the re-entry of residents off-island (March 20-May 31).State Decree (SD) 48,809 / 2020 (03/14/2020) banned events with more than 50 people. SD 48.955 (4/20), quarantined the archipelago, and required authorization for traffic from the district administration. This was restricted to the purchase of food, medicines and health care. Authorization was requested and obtained electronically via cellphone and the administration responded within 24 hours. Evidence of the success of these measures is the registration of 206 permits/day. Using anecdotal information, much of the population remained at home. School activities were canceled on March 18, 2020 (Appendix 1).The island had no secondary or tertiary care facilities, so primary health care was reinforced, including staff training, measures to reinforce urgent emergency care, and the hiring of additional health professionals. Given the transportation difficulties, a 6-bed Field Hospital was constructed on the island. Surveillance protocols for cases of COVID-19 were established and bulletins and health education materials published. The first case of COVID-19 in FNA was registered on March 27, 2020. Cases detected are placed in quarantine and the evolution of disease monitored daily. The active search of contacts before initiation of the cohort study had been effective in identifying cases. By 04/05/2020, 173 PCR tests were performed in the FNA. By this date, the island had 28 positive cases with three being quarantined and 25 recovered. Another 145 cases were discarded after negative test results (PCR).In the first week of June, 42 more cases of COVID-19 were identified through the cohort study, totaling 70 cases. During the months of June and July, 17 more cases of COVID-19 were identified by the Health Surveillance System, all of them among essential workers and residents who were returning from the continent, and all were quarantined. By July 30, FNA reached 88 confirmed cases, of which 79 were recovered and 9 were kept in isolation 7 .6 On July 25, entry requirements were modified (ATDENFN, 2020a). As a consequence, from July 26, in order to enter the island, passengers must present a negative RT-PCR test performed no more than 7 days before departure or a positive IgG and negative IgM serological test carried out not exceeding 90 days from the date of mainland departure. In addition, they must comply with the guidelines, such as mandatory use of a mask, maintaining minimum distance, and regular hand washing or use of alcohol gel. Except for those who have presented IgG (positive) and IgM (negative) tests for COVID-19, the quarantine starts from the date of the first test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) on the continent, until the authorization by the Health Superintendent, which occurs after a second test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR). If this second RT-PCR is negative, the entrant is released from quarantine, if positive, they must remain in quarantine for at least 14 days.Half of the patients positive for COVID-19 (50.0%; 95% CI: 35.8 -64.2) and 17.7% (95% CI: 15.2 -20.4) of the negatives reported that they became ill. All symptoms investigated were more prevalent in the participants who tested positive for COVID-19. More than 40% (95% CI: 28.6 -57.1) of positive cases lived with someone positive for COVID-19 in the same household, while only 7.1% (5.5 -9.0) of negative cases reported the same (Data not shown).This study demonstrates that the measures taken in FNA successfully interrupted community transmission of COVID-19 on the island about three months after the first detected cases. This was the case even though the epidemic was raging on the mainland, especially in Pernambuco. While Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly around the world, infecting more than 30 million people and causing the death of almost 1 million (Sept 19, 2020), some islands have been ""spared"" the pandemic's advances. Islands attached to the United States in the Caribbean, specifically Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have not been successful in controlling the epidemic 12 or controlling air access to the island. On the other hand, 12 nations in the world, 10 in the Pacific, report they have not had a single case of COVID-19 13 . Part of this is due to geography and the abrupt interruption of flights around the world, providing some isolation, as was the case with the FNA.However, if we take into account the official population of the island 3 and the 5.1% prevalence reported in our survey of the island, we would estimate 158 cases of COVID-19 (95% CI ranging from 118 to 208 cases) actually occurred on the island, although only 28 had been reported, that is, 5.6 times more cases than those identified in routine health surveillance. Comparing the prevalence of COVID-19 in Fernando de Noronha with the results of the national survey of 133 cities (EPICOVID19-BR) released on May 20, 2020, the FNA would have had the ninth highest prevalence rate 10, 14 .The FNA employed several exceptional public health measures that were not used elsewhere in Brazil, such as: 1) contact tracing and testing for all positives identified on the island; 2) for travelers, testing (RT-PCR) within seven days before departing for FNA; 3) RT-PCR testing on arrival to the island and quarantine until authorization to leave (if negative) or extended for 14 days if positive; 4) use of a wrist band to identify positives that could only be removed by the island's health surveillance system; 5) and travel restrictions on the island for residents, with the use of a cell-phone app to request authorization to leave the house, similar to the card used in China 15 . The measures adopted in the archipelago were a good example of a more restrictive social distancing policy at the beginning of the country's pandemic 16 .We found that unemployment and informal work increased on the island after COVID-19. An important proportion of those who worked lost their jobs and others had to resort to informal work, without rights or benefits. When the COVID-19 pandemic started, Brazil already had 41% of its workers in informal positions and since the pandemic unemployment rates have increased in 12 Brazilian states, half in the Northeast, including Pernambuco 18 . The situation of the FNA is peculiar and aggravated by the strong dependence on tourism as an economic activity. It is estimated that 100 million jobs were lost as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world 19 and the impact has been greater on islands. For one example, the British Virgin Islands report that 92% of its GDP is linked to tourism 19 . Even with a rebound expected in the future, the ability of the FNA economy to recover may be affected by many factors: low levels of tourism, availability of flights, vaccine efficacy and availability, declining or rising case numbers and other determinants of visa restrictions for tourists.The situation of joblessness and work in the informal sector are associated with rising food insecurity , with more than half of the residents reporting food insecurity in our study. The results of the Family Budget Survey conducted by IBGE in the 2027-2018 biennium, when the government that assumed the presidency implemented profound reductions in expenditures, shows that, at that time, more than a third of Brazilian households presented some degree of food insecurity, the highest index registered since 2004 when the survey was conducted for the first time 20 . Of the 68.9 million households in Brazil, 36.7% had some degree of food insecurity, affecting 84.9 million people. In addition, the worst situation was recorded in the North and Northeast regions, where more than half of the households reported food insecurity. This correlates with our results on the island, where only 46.4% reported food security. The pandemic could only make the situation worse, especially in the absence of a national government that acted strongly in meeting these socioeconomic needs 21, 22 . Other studies in Brazil have shown a positive correlation between low family income per capita and unemployment with the incidence of COVID-19, which reinforces the importance of cash transfer programs 23 . The aid proposed by the federal government, at the beginning of the pandemic, was around US $37 per month, that 9 when pressured by the Brazilian Congress, was raised to US $111, which is still considered too little to support families.An important editorial highlighted damaging reactions and inadequate responses from leaders of countries, as in Brazil, who denied the seriousness of the disease and subsequent deaths. 24 Studies have evaluated the uninformative role of many opinion leaders in Brazil about COVID-19 on social media 25 , demonstrating the negative impact on social distancing and other recommended measures. 26 This illustrates one effect of the fragmentation of policy and program among the federal government, state and local levels and helps explain the difficulties faced during the pandemic in Brazil 17 .Part of FNA's success in controlling COVID-19 could be attributed to the isolation provided by its geography, but we believe that it was largely due to a series of measures taken by local authorities that led to the control of community transmission. The FNA is a successful example of disease control in Northeastern Brazil -contrary to what has occurred in other states in the country. Among the strategies that deserve to be highlighted are the tracking and early identification of cases, extensive testing, isolation of positive and suspected cases, and the travel protocol for landing on the island, practices not systematically implemented in any part of the country. These are activities that can be continued on the island during the next phases of the epidemic. However, sustaining this example of success will be a challenge after the opening of the island to unrestricted travel and tourism. The population of the island, due to its' dependence on tourism and the serious situation of unemployment, underemployment and food insecurity, continues to pressure local authorities to reopen tourist activities on the island.The future of controlling the disease will depend on how well current practices can be ramped up to control new cases during the reopening of the island as well as how well the global, regional and national economic recovery can respond to the worsening social and economic situation on the island. The cohort study presented in this article will continue to monitor the island response and provide information for local decision-makers.","Brazil","abstract","2020-10-27",10

As a result, daily activities of children and adolescents outside their home were prohibited, such as attending classes, circulating in public environments, and even hanging out with friends, restricting the social space of individuals to the home environment.Despite laws and advances in the development of assistance and care strategies, the numbers on violence in pre-pandemic Brazil were already worrying.Data from the Informatics Department of the Unified Health System (DATASUS) reveal that in 2017 there were 126,230 cases of violence against children and adolescents up to the age of 19 (corresponding to 42% of the total cases reported that year). The record of 21,559 deaths from external causes, accidents, and violence up to the age of 19 shows that many did not resist the abuse. Of these cases, a quarter died before the age of 10, and more than 10% (2,309 children) were up to 4 years old. 2 In 2019, the Dial Human Rights (Dial 100), a telephone tool provided by the Brazilian government to receive, analyze, and forward complaints of human rights violations, including cases of violence, revealed 159,063 complaints of maltreatment -an increase of 15% compared to 2018. Of these complaints, 86,837 were violence against children and adolescents (55%), distributed as follows: 38% linked to negligence, 23% to psychological violence, 21% to physical violence, 11% to sexual violence, 3% to exploitation/child labor, and 3% associated with other violent injuries. The most frequent place of occurrences was the victim's home. 3 In the state of Santa Catarina, from 2015 to 2019, 65,672 notifications were registered in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). Of these, 38.4% occurred in the age group of children and adolescents. 4 Intrafamily violence is difficult to unravel, as it occurs in the private sphere, in the domestic environment, within homes and is protected by the law of silence, by the fear, and impunity of its agents -people who should support and protect children and adolescents. This violence covers five types: physical, sexual, psychological, neglect, and specific forms, which are expressed in the forms of Münchhausen syndrome, chemical violence, and filicide. 5 Paradoxically, the home, the safest environment for people to be protected from contagion by the new coronavirus, while there is no vaccine available, can be the most unsafe place for many children and adolescents. 6 The concern about a regrettable and well-known wound in our society emerges from this situation: domestic violence against children and adolescentsoften at home and perpetrated by family members.This study aimed to present data on compulsory notifications on cases of violence against children and adolescents in the state of Santa Catarina, in the months after the emergence of the new coronavirus, and how the establishment of sanitary measures of social isolation influenced the increase in domestic violence against children and adolescents when comparing this information to that of the pre-pandemic, to alert health professionals, public institutions, and society to the need to reinforce actions to prevent injuries, protection, and adequate care for victims.This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of violence against children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19 years old) notified by health professionals, by filling out and inserting into the SINAN the Notification Forms for Individual Investigation of Interpersonal/Self-inflicted Violence, 7 between January and May 2020, in the state of Santa Catarina. The age limit is because the WHO defines this age range for children and adolescents. 8 Santa Catarina has 295 municipalities, distributed over 95,730,921km 2 . According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2012, the Brazilian state was the 11th in size of the population, with 6,248,436 inhabitants. The estimated population in 2019 was 7,164,788 inhabitants, with 971,034 being the population of children and adolescents. 9 The study analyzed the data using descriptive statistics.From January 1 to May 31, 2020, 136 of the 295 municipalities in Santa Catarina made 1,851 notifications in SINAN of suspected or confirmed cases of interpersonal or self-inflicted violence in the 0 to 19 age group. These events were characterized as: neglect or abandonment, physical, psychological, sexual, and other violence, and child labor (Table 1) . 10 At the time of data collection for this study, only 46% of the municipalities had included cases of violence in SINAN. The data request was sent to all municipal health departments in the state of Santa Catarina. The response of less than half of them may be due to the need for restructuring health facilities and adapting their facilities to the service demands of the pandemic. Table 2 shows the percentage differences in the number of notifications of child and adolescent violence accumulated in Rev Paul Pediatr. 2021;39:e2020267 the weeks before and after the decree that established the measures of social isolation in Santa Catarina.For 30 years, the Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA), under Law No. 8,069/90, made children and adolescents ""subjects of law"" in Brazil. It delegates to society the duties to protect and care for these developing Brazilian citizens and emphasizes the obligation to ensure full compliance with the rights necessary to promote their full potential, removing any form of oppression or discrimination. In its Article 13, ECA determines the obligation to report all cases of suspected or confirmed physical punishment, cruel or degrading treatment, and maltreatment of children to the local child protection councils, without damage to other legal measures. 11 In 2001, the notification of suspected or confirmed cases of abuse against children became mandatory and directed to municipal epidemiological surveillance and the child protection council. 12 In 2011, this notification became computerized, through compulsory filling for all health services, both public and private, of the SINAN Notification Form/Individual Investigation of Interpersonal/Self-inflicted Violence. 13 Data from social organizations and non-governmental institutions published in the media report an increase in violence against children and adolescents in the pandemic, such as the 7.4% increase in the Federal District, 14 8 .5% in Paraná, 15 73% in Rio Grande do Sul 16 , and 32% in Pernambuco. 17 SaferNet, a civil association governed by private law, with national operations, focused on the promotion and defense of human rights on the internet in Brazil, in partnership with the National Committee to Combat Sexual Violence against Children and Adolescents, registered a 108% increase in complaints on child pornography during the country's pandemic; in April 2020 alone, there were 9,995 complaints. 18 The state of Santa Catarina has provided data on the number of cases of domestic violence against children and adolescents since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on SINAN notifications from 136 municipalities in Santa Catarina that released data (out of a total of 295) for 2020, there was a progressive decrease in the total number of notifications since the beginning of social isolation, the absolute numbers in January, February, March, April, and May are, respectively, 469, 506, 434, 273, and 169 ( Table 2 ). 10 When comparing January with April, for example, we found a 42% decrease in the number of notifications of child and adolescent violence, the percentage of which is higher (64%), if we compare January to that of May.Does this data mean that violence has decreased? We believe it has not. Several factors can justify the significant reduction in notifications. The need for restructuring and adapting health services to the pandemic reality, directing employees and health units for the exclusive care of cases of acute respiratory syndromes, and overload of the teams of health workers due to the increased demand for care may have made it difficult for users to access services usually available to the population. Added to this, we have the interruption of public transport services, which imposed difficulties in traveling and accessing health services. The fear of contamination, the social isolation imposed, the limitations for leaving home, added to the financial difficulties resulting from the pandemic, may have constituted barriers to reporting violence and seeking assistance and the consequent decrease in notifications. 14 For many women, the health measures adopted to cope with the new coronavirus demanded more domestic work, greater care for children, away from daycare centers and schools, besides greater assistance to the elderly and sick family members. It is inferred that movement restrictions, financial limitations, and generalized insecurity encourage abusers, giving them a greater sense of power and control. 19 Confinement also brings different changes in the routine of family members, leading to stress, which, if not well conducted, can lead to consequences for the entire family dynamics. These consequences can affect the physical and mental health of children and adolescents, especially young children, who do not have the necessary tools to adjust to stress or to overcome it, which can make it especially harmful.Family stress is closely associated with uncertainty/insecurity in the near future, the possibility of falling ill and experiencing the illness of a family member/loved one, fear of not getting adequate access to health, not promising news in the media, economic problems related to job loss and/or reduction of monthly family income. Added to these facts is the increased time spent with children and adolescents, now almost 24 hours, both due to the need for social isolation and the closing of schools, parks, and leisure areas in the condominiums.Stress is also associated with the absence of other components of the family support network, such as the interaction with grandparents, uncles, neighbors, domestic workers, and even institutions such as churches and social projects. This tension experienced and expressed by parents is reflected in children and adolescents, who start to adopt the same behavior: tension, demotivation, and aggression, which can be intensified by the excessive time on screen.This whole range of factors favors a violent domestic environment, which, associated with the distance from the protection agencies, the fear of losing the only provider of the family, of not being able to leave the house, for example, to stay at their parents' house (grandparents of the children), even because of the fear of rupturing the relationship, thus enabling the maintenance of the pact of silence inside the house, making everyone vulnerable to suffering violence. 20 Family violence has a strong historical-cultural connotation: parents who were educated in a violent manner reproduce this form of education, resorting to physical and psychological violence, manifested by beatings, hair pulling, spanking, shouting, and the most diverse threats as a way to impose discipline to their children.The protective role of the school is recognized as paramount, identifying in the teacher often the confidant, the professional with a watchful eye on the students under their care, the one who can be the trigger for the protection and care network and guarantee the rights of children and adolescents. However, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), about 1.5 billion children and adolescents worldwide are out of school because of the closure of educational institutions as an initiative to contain cases of COVID-19. 21 Therefore, children no longer have an important space to manifest and expose the violence suffered.Still, much of the state's child protection structure, such as child protection councils and police stations, is providing virtual assistance only. Additionally, public transport is absent in many regions and greater consumption of alcohol and other drugs, as well as psychoactive medications. 19 A recent publication was assertive when it was titled ""The pandemic paradox"", as this pandemic creates a paradox concerning security at home: a place where we should be protected and safe is where violence occurs for the most vulnerable groups. The authors emphasize that we must all pay attention to this issue: ""Governments around the world have asked all of us to participate in the fight against COVID-19 by staying at home, but it is also important to pay critical attention to what this means for many women and children"". 6 Given this, specific and regional regulations were developed, initiatives to be thought and reproduced by states and municipalities, such as the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, dictating recommendations for the full protection of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, 22 and those of the state of Minas Gerais, through Law No. 23,643, of 2020, 23 which requires residential condominiums to inform security agencies about episodes or signs of domestic violence in their common and private facilities, and the Law No. 23,644, also from 2020, 24 which deals with the registration of this type of occurrence through the virtual police station system, during the pandemic.On June 10, the National Council of Justice and the Association of Brazilian Magistrates launched the Red Flag Against Domestic Violence campaign. The initiative focuses on helping women in situations of violence to ask for help in pharmacies in the country, offering a silent channel of communication and assistance: with a red X in the palm of the hand, which can be done with a pen or even lipstick, the victim indicates she is in a situation of violence. With the woman's name and address in hand, pharmacies and drugstore attendants who join the campaign should immediately call 190 and report the situation. At the time of its launch, the project had a partnership with 10,000 pharmacies and drugstores across the country. 25 In the same direction, the Military Police of Santa Catarina and the National Council of General Commanders of the Military Police and the Military Fire Brigade joined forces, dispatched and disseminated, through the internal network, normative instruction with the addition of standard operating procedures for the specific handling of incidents involving domestic violence against women. 26 In the same state, Technical Note 012/2020, from the State Department of Health, dated May 19, 2020, deals with measures to combat domestic violence in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It warns of the importance of notifying suspected or confirmed cases and referring them as soon as possible to protection agencies and multiprofessional care as recommended in the care protocols. The note also lists suggestions for protective actions for victims and informs contact phones of entities in the protection network. 27 Law no. 14.022 was recently published in the Federal Official Gazette of Brazil (Section 1, p. 3, of July 8, 2020), which ensures the full functioning, during the COVID-19 pandemic, of entities assisting women, children, adolescents, the elderly, and citizens with disabilities who are victims of domestic or family violence. According to the law, assistance to victims is considered an essential service and cannot be interrupted while the state of public calamity caused by the new coronavirus lasts. 28 We chose to study data on domestic violence in children and adolescents under COVID-19, considering the current concern of society for the risk of its intensification during home confinement imposed by the pandemic. The small number of municipalities that provided the notification data and the short period analyzed can be mentioned as limitations of this study. Nonetheless, we understand that these limitations are minimized by the relevance and urgency of the topic.It is possible to conclude that the reduction in the number of complaints of violence against children and adolescents does not encourage, nor does it seem to reflect a decrease in the incidence of this condition. On the contrary, it can demonstrate difficulties that people may be facing in making the complaints and using existing social resources to care for the victims. Initiatives, although specific, are understood as beneficial, which warn of the need for attention to the problem. In this pandemic moment, with the confinement of children in potentially violent homes and spaces, it is essential that their surroundings and the whole society be alert to the suspicion and evidence of cases of violence and that accessible, effective, and safe ways are provided so that complaints, notification, and prompt response to cases occur, aiming at protecting victims, minimizing damage and, thus, preventing the perpetuation of violence.This study did not receive any funding.
