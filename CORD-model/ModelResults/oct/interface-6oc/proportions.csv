In its first ever Human Development Report in 2018 that was devoted entirely to education, the World Bank (2018) announced a global learning crisis that, among many other things, amplified educational inequalities because ""it severely hobbles the disadvantaged youth who most need the boost that a good education can offer"" (World Bank 2018, p. 6) . The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 found out that the performance difference on average across the OECD countries between the 10% most socio-economically advantaged and the 10% most disadvantaged students in reading literacy test was 141 points, that is equivalent to more than three years of schooling (OECD 2019). OECD concluded that ""there has also been no real overall improvement in the learning outcomes of students in OECD countries, even though expenditure on schooling rose by more than 15% over the past decade alone"" (OECD 2019, p. 5). UNESCO's Global Education Monitoring Report 2020 stated that according to the estimates before the COVID-19 pandemic, globally, one-sixth, or 260 million children, adolescents and youth were not attending school (UNESCO 2020a) . Only three quarters of 15-year-olds in middle-income countries are still in school, and even those students achieve just half the basic level of proficiency required.In August 2020, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said, ""Now we face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities"" (UNESCO 2020b). One reason is that those children who need school more than others for learning and well-being can't go to school or have insufficient access to teaching support in other ways. According to the UN's predictions, 24 million learners are at risk of dropping out of school. Another reason that has been common in every country to some extent is limited access to the digital learning from home or lack of capacity of schools to integrate digital technologies in remote teaching and learning.We don't know yet exactly how the disruption of normal schooling has affected children's education. Early results published in different parts of the world have revealed two important issues. Shift to remote teaching and learning when children were not able to go to school has (a) exposed and often amplified the existing social and educational inequalities, and (b) underlined the importance of ongoing individualised support to children with special educational needs as part of teaching (Australian Academy of Science 2020; Graham and Sahlberg 2020; Finnish Education Evaluation Centre 2020; Noble 2020) . It is understandable that there are notable differences between and even within education systems, in terms of how teachers and schools adjusted to that disrupted schooling. It is too early to say how education systems have managed to cope with these new arrangements and how these different remote learning arrangements have affected students' learning and well-being.According to the evidence around the world, income inequality is a growing social phenomenon in many countries (Piketty 2017; Wilkinson and Pickett 2018) . This means that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. It also means that having an education system that would provide each child fair and inclusive opportunity to good school is becoming increasingly difficult. The proportion of children living in poverty that is strongly associated with income inequality ranges from about 5 per cent in the Nordic countries to over 20 per cent in the USA and Israel, according to the OECD database. At the same time, growing evidence base shows that equity and quality of student outcomes at the level of education systems are positively related to one another (OECD 2018; Parker et al. 2018) . In other words, most successful education systems are those that combine equity and excellence in their education policies and practices. This is why growing inequality in education is bad news not just to those who suffer from the lack of fairness and inclusion, but to the entire society.Public institutions have a paramount role to play in preventing and coping with the negative consequences of socio-economic inequalities. Public schools have been critically important in providing equal educational opportunities to children from the wide range of social classes in Finland, Australia and the rest of the world. There are many children in these countries who need their school and teachers more than others to succeed in learning and life. There are also those who learn well and perhaps even better without going to school. What is good for one student may not be good for some others. What the COVID-19 pandemic has made clear is that some children need teachers more than others do. The inability to understand this and effectively respond to these individual needs is one big reason for the current inequities in education.How these inequalities affect educational achievement requires an understanding of how much schools matter in what students are supposed to learn there. No doubt schools are very important. As we have seen during interrupted face-to-face teaching in many countries, there are many students who struggle to keep going on learning without being taught by teachers at school. An important question, however, is how much of the variation of student academic performance is due to these in-school factors, such as teachers, leadership, curriculum, schedules and educational facilities. Since the landmark study by James Coleman and colleagues in 1966, research on school effectiveness has shed light on this question in different education contexts (Coleman et al. 1966) . The common view is that in-school factors explain up to onethird of that variation and that the influence of all factors outside the school gate is estimated to be about 60 per cent (Haertel 2013) . The rest is what could be called unexplained variation. If it is true that schools account for about a third of the variability in student test scores, then the best opportunities for improving the quality of education outcomes are in developing the system-level conditions, including those in other public sectors that can positively affect the lives of children.Equitable education often means that differences in learning outcomes in school ""are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions"" (Australian Government 2011). UNESCO (2018) sees equity in education as the means to achieving equality by making sure that all students have best possible opportunities to grow into their full potential. Similarly, OECD states that education is equitable when ""differences in students' outcomes are unrelated to their background or to economic and social circumstances over which the students have no control"" (OECD 2018). It has been well known prior to the pandemic that inequalities related to socio-economic status, education attainment, access to adequate education, gender, domicile and student characteristics have been some major causes of differences in student achievement in school. In brief, the more inequalities there are in the education system, the less equitable that education system becomes.Various inequalities in school systems that have been exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic are often due to a complex set of social, cultural and economic conditions rather than educational factors alone. Good teachers will continue to be the most important in-school solution to address these inequalities in systematic ways in post-pandemic schooling. But since the pandemic has also amplified the implications of socio-economic inequalities in students' opportunities to learn successfully, interventions by other public sectors to support these children are essential. These solutions and actions after the pandemic to combat unfairness and exclusion in education will need to be different from country to country and even within countries. Let's look at two examples from different sides of the world and how the disruption caused by the COVID-19 has affected teaching and learning.In other words, Australia is fire, Finland is ice. These cultural distinctions make education in these two countries and how each react to external shocks such as the current pandemic, very different from each other. Here is how.Most school facilities were closed for majority of primary and secondary school students in Finland starting March 18 until May 14 this year due to the government's measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early childhood and care centres (kindergartens) remained open and children of essential workers and those with severe special educational needs in first three grades of primary schools had an opportunity to attend school if parents so preferred. During the remote learning phase, one-third of children were in kindergartens and less than 10 per cent of all basic school (grades 1 to 9) students went to school as usual. Since education governance in Finland is decentralised and 310 local authorities run and, to a large extent, also fund the schools, these authorities were responsible for the practical execution of the transition from face-to-face teaching in schools to remote distance learning mode from homes. After the remote learning period in mid-May was over almost 90 per cent of school children returned to school and more than half of children in early childhood education and care were back for the last two weeks of May before their summer holidays.The speed and scale of disruption came as a surprise to Finnish schools as it did to others around the world. Before March some schools had prepared emergency strategies for minor situations, but no one was prepared to such a massive external crisis as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Finnish schools had two particular positive features on their side in shifting literally overnight from contact teaching at school to remote learning from home. First, according to the Finnish National Agency for Education (2020), three quarters of Finnish schoolteachers at the time of the (partial) school closures had digital teaching and learning facilities available in their schools. Vast majority of teachers were also familiar with using these facilities in teaching, although the confidence to do that well varied from school to school.Second, the National Core Curricula that is the foundation for schools' own curriculum planning have emphasised self-directed learning through projects and real-life problemsolving that have made many students familiar with independent study and self-assessing their own learning (Sahlberg 2021) . Again, there are differences from school to school in how successful this practice has been. Teachers have been mostly concerned about those children who require more direct support in their learning that has been not so easy to arrange through virtual arrangements.Early research findings shed light on how children, teachers and parents or guardians have experienced interrupted schooling in Finland. A large national study that is currently underway by the Universities of Helsinki and Tampere is exploring how remote teaching and learning in Finnish schools went from principals', teachers', parents' and children's perspectives (Ahtiainen et al. 2020 ). The first findings in this study confirm the anecdotal evidence gained during April and May, as well as trends found in other surveys. According to about half of 860 principals and little less than half of over 5000 teachers who took part in this study, students with special educational needs were not receiving appropriate support from teachers and schools during the remote learning period, compared with normal times previously. Approximately a quarter of students (N 56,000) and over 40 per cent of parents ( N 36,000) believed that they received less support from their school while they were learning from home, than what they would have received in school previously. About one in five lower secondary school students said that they had difficulties with technology or internet connectivity, and the same proportion of students confessed they stayed up too late every night with digital gadgets or social media.A closer look at how students have experienced the school closures reveals an important finding. Whereas authorities and other adults are afraid that children will stop learning or that there will be losses in their lifetime earnings, not all children seem to think like this. In Finland, for example, over 60 per cent of 10-to 16-year-old students said that they enjoyed learning remotely most of the time and that most of them learned at least the same ""amount"" or even more compared to what they thought they had learned at school (Ahtiainen et al. 2020) . If these tens of thousands of students are right, then perhaps we need to rethink what we mean by learning and how it should be measured and recognised at school.The COVID-19 pandemic has affected Australian education systems in different ways. School buildings were closed for varying periods of time after the first school term break in April. Remote learning arrangements lasted from one week in Northern Territory and South Australia, to nine weeks in Victoria (that has the second interruption of schooling at the moment of writing). School education in Australia is, in general, more centralised and governed by common standards compared to Finnish education system. Teaching and learning are influenced by frequent standardised tests (such as NAPLAN) and school-leaving examinations that often narrow the role of teachers and students, when it comes to the assessment of student learning. Not surprisingly, one prominent discourse in the media and among many parents has been the question of how the negative impact of remote learning on students' test score and examination results could be mitigated. Various ""catching up"" measures have been suggested to do that, especially for disadvantaged students who are thought to lose the most in these measurements.Compared to Finland, Australia's education system as a whole has two interrelated features that makes it more fragile to sudden external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. First, one-third of students in Australia attend non-government schools that are independently governed and often better resourced than many government schools. Vast majority of at-risk students attend government schools. Second, inequality is more prevalent in Australian school system compared to Finland and many other OECD countries. For example, performance gap between the highest and lowest deciles in OECD's PISA 2018 survey was significantly wider in Australia (OECD 2019). Furthermore, disadvantaged students are often concentrated into disadvantaged public schools that is harmful for equitable outcomes at the level of the education system.Early results of a large national survey of 10,000 teachers in Australia reveal similar but also different reactions in schools to disrupted teaching and learning, compared with what has been reported in Finland (Wilson et al. 2020) . Similar to Finland, four of five teachers were worried about their students with special educational needs. Just about a quarter of teachers thought they were confident that students were learning well under remote learning arrangements and just over 40 per cent were confident that the majority of their students were positively engaged with online learning. Only one-third of Australian teachers felt satisfied with assessment during remote learning compared to 95 per cent of teachers in Finland who said they were able to assess students' learning when they were learning from home.The Grattan Institute in Australia concluded that the most disadvantaged students suffered the most during school closures (Sonnemann and Goss 2020) . ""Disadvantaged students often have a home environment that is not conducive to learning and get less help from parents compared to their advantaged peers"" (p. 9), according to their report on the impacts of COVID-19 on school education. Poorer internet access, fewer digital devices and lack of quiet place to study at home were often the common factors in disadvantaged homes.The culture of schools in Australia is much more about conformity where schools often are compliant rather than creative in responding to sudden changes in their environments. National assessment programme for literacy and numeracy (NAPLAN) in primary and sec-ondary schools serves as a yardstick to compare schools' performance with one another. But it also amplifies the existing educational inequities when parents who can afford to pay for education can choose the school with higher NAPLAN scores (and often more affluent student socio-economic make-up) for their children. Interestingly, when NAPLAN tests were cancelled this year due to school closures, some parents were concerned about how they would know what their children have learned at school. Most teachers, however, according to Wilson et al. (2020) , were more worried about students' health and well-being. Uncertainty of the future of national assessments in Australia raises questions of whether schools should focus on ""catching up"" to be prepared for the next year's tests, or care more about children's well-being and health during the pandemic, even though their learning progress may be affected.The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and often amplified the existing inequalities in education system across the world. It is common knowledge that not all children have access to educational online resources and that how children are taught to study with digital technologies varies greatly from one school to another. Most importantly, research has shown that only a minor part of the variation of measured student achievement in school is associated with in-school factors, such as teachers, principals or curricula (Haertel 2013) . Therefore, if most of that variation can be explained by factors outside the school gate, should the efforts to strengthen equity in education target more on fixing inequalities that affect children outside the school?No doubt there will be piles of studies that will show how different education systems managed to navigate through the current global pandemic. There will be those that struggled and those that did much better than others. First, comparative lessons revealed that education systems that are built on trust-based professionalism, that have flexibility and autonomy to adapt curriculum to local needs and strengths, that can adjust teaching and learning to changing circumstances, and that rely less on externally measured standards seem to have had an easier time during the first wave of the pandemic (OECD 2020). Time will probably also tell that more equitable societies and education systems go through these difficult times with less harm to students and their families.Prevention is always a smarter strategy than cure. This will hopefully be another lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic. A one-off ""catch-up"" intervention for disadvantaged students for six months from July to December 2020 in Australia was estimated to cost 1.2 billion Australian dollars, or 900 million US dollars (Sonnemann and Goss 2020) . The cost of educational inequality can be huge, and another catch-up may have to be implemented again if the root cause is not addressed. Now will be a good time to think how educational equity could be better achieved. One way to do that is to take a closer look how more equitable education systems have done it. Here are three principles to consider.Addressing inequalities early. One of the most powerful ways to strengthen equity in education is to avoid inequalities in early childhood. Preventive healthcare and high-quality early childhood education and care are the most common ways to make sure that more children will be ready to learn at school. Early intervention policies to help children ""catch up"" during teaching and learning can effectively reduce performance gaps between students.Trusting teachers as professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed an interesting dilemma in many countries: Should teaching during remote arrangements focus more on core subjects, i.e. literacy and numeracy, and prepare students for future tests and examinations, or should it address more social and emotional well-being and holistic learning of competences needed in real life? In exceptional and uncertain circumstances, the best answer to this question comes from those who are closest to the action, in this case the teachers. Schools can better include policies and action into their work when teachers and principals are treated as trusted professionals in deciding what is best for all children.Building self-directedness. Schools are often at the bottom of educational food chains. They comply with dozens of rules and regulations to satisfy a range of external expectations. Teachers and students often follow similar modus operandi in classrooms. An important lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that schools and students who are more self-directed in their own teaching and learning often do better in both normal and crisis situations, than those who haven't learned to do so. Self-directedness strengthens student engagement, brings about authentic learning and helps schools respond better to emerging inequalities.This global pandemic has shown that school is more than a place of knowledge acquisition. School is part of the social fabric that has reciprocal relationships with social, health, cultural and economic aspects of life. Making education systems more equitable requires a better understanding of the complexity of schooling as part of our increasingly fragile societies.Does the pandemic help make education more equitable? It is most likely that the pandemic will cause huge dents in national budgets around the world and make any change in education that requires more money unrealistic. Governments will probably switch to the austerity mode that will force schools to do more with less. That will probably keep the old ways of measuring schools' performance as they were before the pandemic, rather than actively reform the education system with better ways to monitor educational progress.There is a chance, however, that something else would happen instead. That requires both government leaders and parents to understand what equity in education is and why it is an important feature of inclusive and high-quality schooling. That also requires everyone in the society to understand that we don't need to accept inequality in education in order to achieve excellence, as many might have done before. Finland is a good example of a country where educational excellence has been achieved through greater equity (Sahlberg 2021) . Only when the society in general accepts this view and realises that equitable education can benefit all, not just some, of us, will there be significant and sustainable improvement in our school systems. One of the early champions of educational equity Ron Edmonds (1979, p. 23 ) said, ""We can, whenever and wherever we choose, successfully teach all children whose schooling is of interest to us. We already know more than we need to do this. Whether we do it or not must finally depend on how we feel about the fact that we have not done it so far"".","Australia","abstract","2020-10-31",10

Their use in public spaces and healthcare settings is either recommended or mandatory in many jurisdictions internationally. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2020) recommends mask use to minimize droplet dispersion and aerosolization of the virus (Bahl et al., 2020) . Clinical trials and healthcare settings continue to assess speech production, which generates respiratory droplets while unrestricted exposure increases the likelihood of disease contraction (Stadnytskyi et al., 2020) . Risk of transmission increases through behaviors common in many speech assessment tasks including continuous and loud speech (Asadi et al., 2019) . At the same time, acknowledgement of the necessity of personal protective equipment to minimize virus transmission has increased internationally (Asadi et al., 2019; Stadnytskyi et al., 2020; Zaga et al., 2020) . Masks, however, alter the speech signal with downstream effects on intelligibility of a speaker. The use of personal protective equipment poses some unique challenges for speech assessment.We evaluated the impact wearing a mask has on acoustic output and speech perception. We examined how different face mask types (surgical, cloth and N95), in combination with microphone location variations (headset vs. tabletop), affect speech recordings and intelligibility.Four subjects, aged 29.0 ± 5.8 years, range 23-38; 2 males: 2 females, were included in the study.All speakers were English speaking with no dysphonia, cognitive or neurological impairments.One male and female had English as their second language.The speech battery was elicited by trained staff and consisted of sustaining an open vowel /aː/ for approximately six seconds reproduced ten times and reading a phonetically balanced text, the Grandfather Passage (Van Riper, 1963) , reproduced five times. The speech battery was repeated under four conditions in a randomized order: 1) no mask; 2) standard surgical mask (regulated under 21 CFR 878.4040); 3) cloth mask (2-layered cotton); and 4) N95 mask (disposable mask made from electrostatic non-woven polypropylene fiber containing a filtration layer). Subjects were instructed to speak in a natural manner at a comfortable pitch and pace. Speech samples were recorded using two standardized methods: 1) Using a head-mounted cardioid condenser microphone (AKG520, Harman International, United States) positioned 2 inches from the corner of the subject's mouth (minimum sensitivity of -43dB, near flat frequency response) and coupled with a QUAD-CAPTURE USB 2.0 Audio Interface (Roland Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan) connected to a laptop computer; and 2) Using a Blue Yeti (Blue Microphones, United States) tabletop microphone (sensitivity 4.5mV/Pa) connected to a laptop computer. The microphone was positioned 5 ft. from the subject to simulate physical distancing measures. Standardization of the recording environment was achieved by recording in the absence of traffic, electrical, appliance, or other background noise. All recordings were sampled at 44.1 kHz with 32-bit quantization.Speech intelligibility was evaluated using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthria Speech (ASSIDS) (Yorkston and Beukelman, 1984) . For each condition subjects read aloud a randomized list of single words (one and two syllables in length) and sentences (5 to 28 syllables in length).Two blinded raters transcribed ASSIDS words and sentences, with the percentage of correct items calculated for each condition.Audio files were screened for deviations and synchronized between microphones to ensure uniformity of length. Acoustic analysis of sustained vowel and reading tasks were performed using Praat software (Boersma, 2002) . Two groups of speech features were analyzed, one to describe responsiveness to speech and silence, and another to determine agreement between measurements taken by different microphone conditions. The speech spectrum was used to describe the impact of mask type on the complex voice waveform. The interaction between intensity and frequency was characterized using the power spectral density (PSD, dB/kHz relative 2x10 -5 Pa) in the longterm average spectrum on the reading task. PSD provides information on how ""each frequency"" contributes to the total sound power. Frequency bands were fixed at 1kHz. PSD was averaged across subjects for each mask condition and compared between masks not subjects.Center-of-gravity (CoG, in Hz) was calculated from the power spectrum to inform frequency responsiveness of the conditions. CoG is the mean power-weighted frequency, i.e. the frequency that divides the power spectrum in equal halves above and below CoG. The intensity of background noise (floor) was determined as equal to the average intensity during the quietest three seconds of each files (i.e., in the absence of vocalization). Floor intensity was subtracted from the average intensity (during vocalization) for each task (vowel and reading) to determine the speech intensity prominence per mask condition. Features of interest included cepstral peak prominence smoothed (CPPS), harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), local jitter and shimmer for the sustained vowel, and average and standard deviation of pause length for the reading task.Fundamental frequency was calculated through autocorrelation within a restricted range (70Hz -250Hz for males, 100Hz -300Hz for females) (Vogel et al., 2009 ). The analysis window was 43ms and 30ms respectively, and window shift fixed at 10ms. The maximum number of formants was set at 5 with a maximum of 5500Hz for formant detection. All other parameters were maintained at default software settings. The detection of silence-speech and speech-silence transitions was done using an energy threshold on the time domain (Rosen et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2017) . The threshold was set to 65% of the 95 th percentile, with minimum silence length set to 20ms and minimum speech length to 30ms.To examine differences of each acoustic parameter under each mask condition (no mask, surgical, N95, and cloth), a linear mixed-effects model analysis using restricted maximum likelihood estimation was applied. Mask type was modeled as a fixed factor, and subject and order of mask as a random factor. Bonferroni corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted to determine differences in mask type (surgical, N95, and cloth) compared to no mask. To investigate power spectral density, the interaction effect between mask and frequency band was investigated.Where the interaction was significant, planned comparisons were made for each 1Khz frequency band to determine differences between masks types compared to no mask. SPSS was used for all statistical analyses (IBM SPSS Version 26.0).Intelligibility varied between the speakers and across mask conditions. On average, intelligibility remained above 92% for all mask conditions, irrespective of single words (Figure 1a Frequency bands were collapsed into 1kHz slices to explore differences in PSD between mask type. There was a Mask × 1kHz frequency band interaction effect (F27,755=2.50, p=0.006). Post hoc comparisons showed power (dB/Hz 2 ) was significantly lower between 3-10 kHz for N95 mask and 5-10kHz for surgical and cloth masks when compared to no mask on recordings made using the head-mounted microphone (Figure 2a) . No significant differences were observed between mask conditions on recordings made using the tabletop microphone (F27,757=1.41, p=0.082; Figure   2b ).-Insert Figure 2 about here- showed that recordings produced with the N95 mask increased percentage of pauses (p=0.023) (Table 1) . Spectral tilt was lower in recordings produced with the surgical (p=0.016) and N95 masks (p=0.001). For recordings produced with the tabletop microphone, there was a significant effect of mask type for percentage of pauses (F3,7.87=8.17, p=0.008), and spectral tilt (F3,8.39=15.43, p=0.001) ( Table 1) . Post hoc comparisons revealed that the N95 and cloth masks yielded higher percentage of pauses (N95 p=0.022; Cloth p=0.029) no mask. As with the head-mounted microphone, recordings produced with the tabletop microphone yielded lower spectral tilt values with both the surgical (p=0.006) and N95 masks (p=0.002). No significant differences were observed in acoustic parameters extracted from the sustained vowel recorded using either the headmounted or tabletop microphone.-Insert Table 1 about here-The type of mask affected the speech signal. We observed significant differences in acoustic power distribution across relevant frequency bands for speech in all three mask conditions compared to no mask. The differences were not observed in frequencies below 3kHz. Differences in signal for higher frequencies led to altered acoustic outcomes including spectral tilt. The masks however did not significantly influence listener-perceived intelligibility or acoustic measures of perturbation (e.g., NHR, CPPS). Measures of speech rate were lower for N95 and surgical masks, possibly as speakers compensate when wearing masks to improve intelligibility. It is also possible that speech timing differences were related to how speech boundaries are identified in the analysis scripts (i.e., our timing analysis relied on identification of phoneme/word boundaries via intensity thresholds).Intelligibility scores varied between raters and between mask condition. Intelligibility remained above 92% for words and sentences. Anecdotally, it can be difficult to understand people when they wear a mask (Goldin et al., 2020) . Our small dataset suggests mask type does not systematically impact intelligibility in controlled environments. Our recordings were made with high-quality microphones in quiet environments. Raters listened to samples in ideal listening conditions away from distractions and background noise but without visual aid (lips and jaw movement) for all mask conditions. In loud environments, communication can be challenging with multiple distractors, background noise, and a lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Noise in ecological situations may further decrease speech intelligibility, when complementary visual cues blocked by use of face masks play a role in communication.It is clear that face masks change the acoustic speech signal, but some specific perceptual features remain largely unaffected (e.g., acoustic measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type.These results have implications for clinical assessments and speech research where PPE is required. It is easy to assume that subjects in a speech study will simply remove PPE during assessments; however, subjects and researchers may be reluctant to do so if it leads to potential exposure to airborne viruses. In longitudinal studies with data collection before, during, and after pandemics requiring PPE, researchers should consider how to mitigate against changes to protocols that affect speech (see Figure 3 ) (Redenlab, 2020) .

Today, more than ever, we require a centralised platform and collective approach to facilitate our collaborative research efforts in different scientific disciplines [2, 3] . Artificial intelligence, especially computer vision, has responded strongly to this challenge [4] . Various imaging modalities are being processed and analysed for COVID-19 control [5, 6] . These approaches vary from disease diagnosis and prognosis to disease prevention and management based on different imaging modalities like digital chest x-ray radiography (CXR), chest computed tomography (CT) and Lung ultrasound (LUS) [7, 8, 9] . An ethical study of imaging data requires the privacy, confidentiality and integrity throughout data analysis. However, it seems a tremendous task due to the existing vulnerabilities of traditional machine learning systems that heavily rely on shared datasets for their training. Similarly, new data protection regulation like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [10] in the European Union puts restrictions on the move of data outside of their regional territories. This situation requires a fundamental change in the ways machine learning systems can work collaboratively.Privacy by design (PbD) approach [11] ensures that privacy assurance is embedded into a system design lifecycle by default from the beginning to the end. Therefore, any system built without including privacy considerations as a core part of their design process often behaves poor privacy control. A post (GDPR) world requires a focus on privacy by design with data privacy at the core of system design [12] . PbD has a special place in the design of machine learning systems, especially deep learning systems that are going to share our digital future. Google introduced a collaborative machine learning system [13, 14, 15] with embedded PbD named as federated learning in 2016 that nullified the need arXiv:2010.06177v1 [cs.CR] 13 Oct 2020 for a centralised training data. The fundamental idea is to use different clients or nodes to train local machine learning models on local data samples without any exchange, and sharing of model parameters (e.g. the weights and biases) between these local nodes at some frequency to generate a global model by a process called federated averaging. All clients or nodes then share this global model. As no data sharing takes place between the nodes, federated design simplicity ensures data privacy. These systems are ideally suited for taring machine learning algorithms for COVID-19 control as sensitive COVID-19 health data will not be shared and would remain in the custody of their subjects. Figure  1 illustrates privacy by design approach to machine learning with a federated model design for COVID-19 detection using CXR. However, this process does not guarantee data protection and system robustness. Attackers can figure out individual data based on the global model [16, 17] . Differential privacy adds random noise to an individual's model, obscuring the results [18, 19] . This random data can be added before the model is shared with the server, without revealing the actual data. This process preserves the individual's privacy. However, this design approach has limited scalability and robustness. Additionally, this integration is hard to grasp for system designers due to its unreasonable complexity. Inspired from the preliminary empirical works on differentially-private federated learning, in this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework called differential privacy by design (dPbD) that can help to design scalable and robust federating learning systems for COVID-19data privacy. We address the following research questions in this paper:• How can we devise a theoretical framework that underpins all saliant and impeding factors that impact the design of differentially-private federated learning systems with scalability and robustness?• How can differentially-private federated learning systems ensure the privacy of COVID-19 imaging data without adversely harming the accuracy?The contributions of this paper are as follows: We extend privacy by design framework in the context of differential privacy and federated learning. We propose a theoretical framework called differential privacy by design (dPbD) that underpins saliant and impeding factors that impact the design of differentially-private federated learning systems with scalability and robustness. We discuss how the proposed framework can be used to model privacy of COVID-19 imaging data for training differentially-private federated learning systems.We have organised the paper as follow: Section 2 describes the related work. A brief introduction to preliminary techniques that have inspired the development of this theoretical framework is discussed in section 3. The proposed framework is presented in section 4. We discuss seven principles to implement this design in section 5. Embedding of the proposed principles into federated learning system design for COVID-19 data is discussed in section 6. It is followed by a discussion and concluding remarks.At an early stage of COVID-19, authorities recognised the importance of privacy and public trust to fight against the pandemic. Some data privacy experts also dubbed it as an unusual scenario like the European Data Protection Board that highlighted article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation. This article allows the processing of personal data ""for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health [2] . However, careful data-management practices in our data-intensive world require giving critical consideration to data privacy aspects. COVID-19 poses various challenges to the Biomedical Imaging (BI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Analytics (DA), Computer Vision (CV) and Machine learning (ML) as these disciplines require adequate access to big data to detect, diagnose, and predict the spread of the infection [5, 8, 9] . This article restricts its scope to data privacy of COVID-19 medical imaging data required by computer vision and machine learning approaches for COVID-19 control.Privacy by design is considered as an approach to embedding privacy directly into system design and introduced by Ann Cavoukian in 2009 [11, 20] . This design is incorporated into the European GDPR that shows its importance [10] . Privacy-preserving machine earning uses privacy by design approach in its framework [21] . Most recently, Google introduced a federated machine learning framework for preserving the privacy of the training data [13, 14] . Federated learning systems use distributed framework where model training is performed locally at the client-side, then the updated model parameters are sent to a central server for aggregation. Contray to the idea of data fusion [22] , a global model aggregation or fusion is used. Several works [17, 15] discuss design, challenges and future direction in the field of federated learning. We refer the interested readers to these articles. Federated learning systems inherently support privacy by design.However, PbD is criticised for being unclear, complex to enforce its implementation, and difficult to adapt to certain disciplines [12] . Anotherline of work in the privacy domain takes a huge interest in leveraging differential privacy into machine learning design for privacy-preserving AI. We refer review articles [18, 19] for the interested reader. With the increased popularity and enhanced performance of deep learning, difference privacy is proposed for deep learning models and federated learning [23, 24, 25] . The integration of differential privacy and federated learning leads future research directions in privacy preserving AI. However, this marriage is incredibly complex and lacks clarity in its design due to various competing factors. The complexity of the preliminary work in this direction inspired us to propose a theoretical framework called differential privacy by federated design. It is specially designed to provide differential privacy to COVID-19 imaging data using a federated machine learning system.3 Preliminaries:Federated learning is a powerful framework that is devised for machine learning scientists to work collaboratively with decentralised data with privacy by default setting. Google generated the initial idea as part of the series of works in 2015 and 2016 [13, 14] . The initial focus of the federated design was on on-device federated learning tailored to distributed mobile-user interactions. A sample example is G-board app that Predicts the next word to make typing effortless based on typed text using a Federated Ruccerent neural network (RNN) model [26] .Consider a scenario of n machine learning scientists {s 1 , ..., s n } working on COVID-19 imaging data, all of whom wish to collaborate to train a machine-learning model by sharing their respective imaging data {d 1 , ..., d n }. A federatedlearning system defines a distributed machine learning process in which the ML scientists collaboratively train a shared model Mf. However, this process ensures that any ML scientist s i does not expose its data d i to any other scientist s j during the local training process. Each of the data scientists, however, shares its local model m i to the server (centralised architecture) [27] or on a blockchain ( decentralised architecture) [25] . A federating averaging is used for model aggregation to get a shared model Mf that is then sent back to each ML scientist.Various improvements are proposed in the literature after the initial design [13, 14] . It includes horizontal and vertical federated learning architectures, federated transfer learning, federated domain adaptation, federated adversarial learning, improving communication protocols and security and making federated learning more personalisable. It is emerging as a promising research topic in machine learning. Interested readers, please refer to the topic reviews [17, 15] .Differential privacy (DF) defines a formal assurance of anonymity and indistinguishability in terms of a privacy budget ( )-the smaller the budget, the stronger the confidence on privacy [18, 19] . The topic has its roots in aggregate or adjacent databases. In the case of COVID-19 imaging datasets, each COVID-19 imaging training dataset is a set of image-label pairs for supervised learning. Any two of these datasets are adjacent if they vary in a single entry if one image-label pair is present in one image dataset and absent in the other. In other words, Two databases X and Y are neighbours or adjacent if A(X, Y ) = 1 where A is the distance. A randomized mechanism K : D → R with domain D and range R preserves ( , δ differential privacy, if for any pair of adjacent databases (X, Y ) belonging to D and set S of possible outputs:P r[K(X) ∈ S] ≤ P r[K(Y ) ∈ S] + δ.A randomised mechanism like Gaussian mechanism(GM) [28] approximates a real-valued function F for these neighbouring datasets, and differential privacy can be enforced by adding noise to the model to the scale depending on the sensitivity of this function function F . The global sensitivity GS of a function F is defined as:DF provides a mathematically provable guarantee of privacy protection against a wide range of privacy attacks (include differencing attack, linkage attacks, and reconstruction attacks), Decreasing in epsilon leads to a decrease inaccuracy. is a metric of privacy loss at a differentially change in data (adding, removing one entry). The smaller the value is, the better privacy protection while accuracy is defined to be the closeness of the output of DP algorithms to pure production. F (X) can be released accurately when F is insensitive to individual models [29] . Many natural functions have low GS like sample mean and covariance matrix. To achieve a small global sensitivity, the ideal condition is that all the clients use sufficient local datasets for training [24] .In privacy-preserving machine learning, we search for an algorithm that takes as input a dataset (sampled from some distribution), and then privately output a hypothesis h that with high probability has low error over the distribution.Our proposed theoretical framework is extending privacy by design framework [11] for federating machine learning design by using the notion of embedding differential privacy into its system design from end to end. Figure 2 provides a visual description of our proposed differential privacy by design (dPbD) framework.This framework is partially inspired by empirical studies [23, 24, 28, 25, 27] on the use of differential privacy for machine learning. From these empirical studies, two major dimensions consistently emerged. One dimension differentiates between privacy and utility and highlights their trade-off. Utility in machine learning can be taken as model accuracy or decrease in testing loss-the other dimensions design scalability and robustness. Here scalability means scalability of federated learning model and number of clients. Robustness indicates system performance against attacks.There are four quadrants and thus four important junctions of the proposed framework that define most important factors in defining differential privacy in federated learning design. These factors include level of privacy, level of randomised noise, global sensitivity and number of clients or nodes in a differentially private federated learning system.As differential privacy guarantees anonymity and indistinguishability in terms of a privacy budget (epsilon)-the smaller the budget, the stronger the confidence on privacy, and we call it a level of privacy. It is significant characteristics of differential privacy by design as it guarantees and provides a quantitative notion of privacy compared to the unclear concept of privacy in privacy by design framework. The level of privacy defines system robustness against attacks. Similarly adding more noise as part of differential privacy can reduce system utility and robustness. The amount of randomised noise is thus an important factor to balance the trade-off between privacy and utility.On the other hand, scalability requires an increase in the number of nodes and the effectiveness of robust aggregation. Robust aggregation depends on global sensitivity. A small value of global sensitivity requires that all the clients use sufficient local datasets for training, .and the type of aggregation function. Similarly, functions having low global sensitivity are preferred for better performance and utility like Sample mean and Covariance matrix.We advise these seven principles to accomplish proposed differential privacy by design framework for system design.• Privacy can be guaranteed in design: The system must ensure a meaningful privacy guarantee. For instance, choosing a smaller epsilon produces noisier results and better privacy guarantees in differential privacy. Privacy guarantee during system design will build trust.• Privacy can be quantified in design: Differential privacy can be used to quantify privacy. The strategy of using budgets, expenses and losses in terms of privacy is known as privacy accounting. The maximum privacy loss is called the privacy budget. This quantification leads to better privacy-preserving design.• Privacy by Modularity: Modularity is the Key to ensure privacy as it reduces complexity [31] . Modules can be removed, replaced, or upgraded without affecting other components. Privacy of the system should not be affected by removing, replacing, or upgrading any system component.sensitivity. The aggregated model should also be insensitive to local data at different nodes. • Privacy with Scalability :Privacy notion is unaffected by scaling the system. Any change in scalability for Federated Learning system and asynchronous or synchronous training algorithms should not degrade privacy. • Anonymity in Design Lifecycle: Original data is never shared. Only modified function or model parameters are transmitted. Data anonymity must be ensured in complete Design Lifecycle. • Optimising Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Design: we refer utility to certain system properties [32] . Increase in privacy often causes a decrease in utility. A design should optimise this trade-off by ensuring privacy without adversely harming system utility. The privacy of COVID-19 imaging data on a collaborative machine learning network (federated machine learning) can be taken as a case study of differential privacy by design framework. Its seven foundation principles can be applied to ensure privacy while designing collaborative machine learning systems. Here, we describe a brief view of the implementation of these seven principles in the scenario of the training machine learning model on federated learning systems.• Privacy-preserving federated learning design must control the level of privacy to control perturbation and noise for robustness. However, the design must provide equate level of privacy to prevent patients personal information embedding or related to their COVID-19 imaging data.• Privacy level must be quantified in federated design. There must be understanding and consensus between teams involved in federated learning setup about the minum and maximum level of privacy required for collaborative research.• Adequate privacy must be enforced during design at all system components like clients, federated server and communication channels. Addition or removal of clients and change in client side learning model should not affect data privacy promised by the system.• A robust model aggregation strategy must be adopted. A function with low global sensitivity be chosen while designing any federated system for COVID-19. The robust aggregation should be insensitive to local changes and changes in data on client nodes.• COVID-19 imaging data is never shared throughout the training lifecycle. Model sharing is protected and maintain the anonymity of patients information through the model up-gradation and communication rounds.• The system design must be flexible, and adding and removing clients and teams or increasing or decreasing COVID-19 data size should not adversely harm patient data and shared model privacy. Horizontal and vertical scalability be supported during design with features of robustness and resilience.• Accuracy is an important consideration in COVID diagnosis, and it should not be harmed. It is critical to reduce or sacrifice it for the sake of privacy as it can adversely affect system utility. An optimised trade-off be sought during the design.The proposed differential privacy by design framework is focused on the design of privacy-preserving federated machine learnng systems. This theoretical framework is developed by inspiring from various empirical studies about the use of differential privacy in federated learning. However, we discovered that while the majority of the proposed systems emphasise on the trade-off between privacy and utility, they often ignore scalability and robustness of the system. Our proposed framework fills up that gap and proposes a comprehensive framework that covers the majority of the design concepts. We argue that following the footsteps of privacy by design framework, differential privacy must be embedded throughout the design lifecycle, and it should provide overall coverage of protection and privacy to any proposed federated machine learning system. To pave the way of this embedding in design lifecycle, we defined seven foundational principles similar to seven principles of privacy by design framework.We use a case study of COVID-19 imaging data. However, our proposed framework should be applicable to all types of data on a federated learning system. In our future work, we would implement and validate these principles for designing a computer vision-based COVID-19 diagnosis system based on pathological imaging data available from various teams around the world. We hope that the proposed framework with impact designing a privacy-preserving federated learning system with reduced complexity and sufficient data protection for collaborative research to combat COVID-19 challenge.","Australia","first author","2020-10-13",10

With social distancing practices, there is an increased volume of online activities and also increased production of online information from both organizations and individuals. The use of social networking has increased dramatically as people use these tools as a substitute for in-person social gatherings (Koeze & Popper, 2020) . Social media has likely also become a substitute for person-to-person information seeking, which makes up half of all information seeking (Savolainen, 1995) , and is particularly important for disadvantaged groups (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005) . The use of these online tools has become particularly salient for migrant communities, who are no longer able to return ""home"" or who are watching closely both the situation in the country they live as well as in the country where their families are.Higher education is a clear example of the changes wrought by COVID-19. Universities and institutes have transitioned to virtual campuses, where all communication, teaching and learning, and support for students occur online.The impact of universities' transition to online mode is still in progress and hard to assess. While there is a general acceptance that this transition is inevitable under the circumstances, there is not a lot of sophisticated understanding about its impact on students. Generally, we know that information overload is in a feedback loop with anxiety: information overload produces anxiety (Bawden & Robinson, 2009) , and increased cognitive load decreases information seeking performance (Griffiths & Brophy, 2005) . Ko, Kua, and Fones (1999) found that information overload needed to be reduced in order to help first year medical and law students cope better. This was before the widespread use of the internet and before the virtual campus phenomenon. More recently Chen, Pedersen, and Murphy (2012) found that information overload did have a negative impact on some students' participation and engagement, but that other students had learned to manage information overload. Ha, Joa, Gabay, and Kim (2018) also found that there was heterogeneity in student behavior in coping with the range of DOI: 10.1002/pra2.289 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020. Author(s) retain copyright, but ASIS&T receives an exclusive publication license information from official university emails. Looking to student experience, there is significant evidence that social cohesion and orientation is important for student retention, particularly among minority students (Burgette & Magun-Jackson, 2008; Pitkethly & Prosser, 2001) . All these pre-COVID 19 studies point to the implication that there is diversity amongst the student body, in the way they use technology platforms and how they cope with information overload. There is certainly a need to understand the diversity of information behaviors amongst different groups of students but also to understand what they are going through during high stress contexts such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, where social distancing and isolation are in play.International students, while not the only group of affected students, have particular challenges around information: some are seeking information about their host country and their home simultaneously, and some are attempting to integrate into a university community without ever setting foot on campus. This group of students will also have to take on new information from the ""host institution"" very quickly. In addition, it is well documented that international students come from different home learning practices and this affects their approaches to education and communication (Moon, Zhang, Larke, & James, 2020) . International students' behaviors are also tightly linked to the digital journeys they make, transitioning from old, familiar platforms, information sources, and information seeking strategies to those used in their adopted countries (Binsahl, Chang, & Bosua, 2020; Chang & Gomes, 2017) . In many cases, international students are accessing information differently to domestic students, and are often potentially receiving information from their home countries as well. Therefore, in the case of emergencies and crisis, the potential for overload of information is very present for international students.While this panel focuses on international students and COVID, it will engender lessons likely to support all students, and in a range of crises. We use this intersection as an example and focal point to develop best practice recommendations for crisis information.People cross transnational borders for a range of reasons such as education, employment, humanitarian and/or lifestyle. While some migrants may be forced, others uproot themselves voluntarily. Likewise, some migrants are permanent settlers while others are transient, thus making migrant experiences varied according to agendas and experiences (Gomes, 2019) .Looking at transient migrants, the international student body is one of the most diverse that is ever categorized as just a single group. Gomes, Berry, Alzougool, and Chang (2014) clearly articulate the diversity of international students, not just based on their countries of origin but also the nature of their social networks. This diversity leads to different information behavior amongst this truly diverse groups of students. Chang and Gomes (2017) highlighted that part of the diversity in information behaviors of international students is directly linked to the digital journeys students may or may not make when they move across countries. Digital journeys refer to the transition international students make in the digital environment, taking on new sources of information, and adopting new digital platforms, rather than relying on old familiar sources and platforms. Chang and Gomes (2017) suggest that international students who are more connected to new social networks based in their new host countries are more likely to make the digital journey. Huang and Bilal (2017) point out a different kind of journey, from looking for experiential information to looking for authoritative information when choosing a university. Such digital journeys are not only reported amongst international students but also in older migrants (Caidi, Du, Li, Shen, & Sun, 2020) . As Caidi et al. (2020) pointed out, the information behaviors of many older migrants do shift over time because of the need and connections with local communities. Therefore, in both groups, local engagement is an important part of the transition to new information behaviors that are adapted to new host countries. During COVID-19, social distancing laws and policies are widespread, minimizing such social engagements. What does this mean for international students and new migrants? Chang, Gomes, and McKay (n.d.) pointed out that it is crucial for Universities to understand the information behaviors of their international students in order to engage effectively with this diverse cohort of students. Yet, in the current context, much communication is carried out from the perspective of the information provider. Understandably, at all levels, Universities are providing information in excess to try to reassure students and staff. With all subjects and student services moved online, the onus is on students to seek out the information. It can be argued that this excess of information in trying to help students, is causing the paradox of the information being ignored, forgotten, or just overlooked because it is a highly stressful and anxious period (Griffiths & Brophy, 2005) . Once ignored, the information becomes difficult to find, especially if students cannot describe their information needs in the same language as their institutions (Marchionini, 1997) . This information is seldom housed in a single browsable location, leaving search-notoriously poor for lightly specified information needs (Marchionini, 1997; McKay, Makri, Chang, & Buchanan, 2020 )-as the only option. For example, there are various reports from students indicating that they are not aware of available support despite all the information on said support. For international students, this is even more acute if they are new to the host country or are studying offshore with a foreign institution they have never physically attended due to travel restrictions.At the same time the changing nature of the pandemic is also leading to higher anxiety levels within the community, the threat of visas running out, changes in government policies and position on non-citizens, as well as the loss of part-time jobs. This means that information on health and wellbeing, community and family engagement, visa and government policies, part-time jobs which normally would not require high cognitive engagement every single day, suddenly requires the students' attention as the situation changes. Hence, it is important to understand the impacts on international students' information behaviors during the current crisis.The panel brings together researchers in the fields of information behavior, migration studies, and international students together to discuss the topics outlined. In addition, four panelists also have responsibilities for international student experiences within their institutions. Our panelists combine research, practice and lived experiences to provide insights into the information behaviors of international students. The panel will discuss how these insights might impact future information behavior research and methodologies. The panel will also involve participants in an interactive discussion by exploring all attendees' experiences of the challenges and opportunities for research in the field of information behaviors of new and transient migrants during a crisis situation.The aim of this panel is to foster discussion and potential research collaborations among participants. We have divided the panel into themed discussions, so that participants have the opportunity to interact even in an online discussion. Panelists are currently working on research proposals in this field, ultimately this panel could lead to publications not just for panelists, but also for participants.While our panelists are located in two cities, they are all migrants to those cities, and represent more than five countries of origin and four continents. Groups report back (3 min per group) 5 Shanton Chang, Nadia Caidi and Dana McKay will discuss how research agenda around pedagogy and internationalization of education might need to be re-examined through an information science lens (using the pandemic as a context) 5 Shanton Chang and Catherine Gomes will wrap up and outline next stepsThis panel is designed to be highly interactive, and provoke ideas, questions, and potential new collaborations for all participants. We anticipate an audience of 30-50 participants (Table 1) . This is an important panel not just because it discusses the issues of information behaviors of migrants; it also highlights the potential of digital access and equity challenges. If the communication strategies of governments, service providers and universities do not consider these needs, equity issues will arise. With the world moving the bulk of its activities online during a pandemic, digital access and equity and effective engagement need addressing more urgently than ever, particularly for vulnerable populations such as recent migrant groups or international students.Dr Shanton Chang is an associate professor in information systems.

One hospital was closed and had 1200 workers quarantined in one outbreak.The study shows that HCWs were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, healthcare workers are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous workers during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low, highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faces a resurgence of COVID-19 since late June 2020, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of healthcare worker infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for healthcare workers.What is already known about this topic: The absence of formal national reporting of HCW infections makes it difficult to inform work health and safety of HCW.As of 11 th July, over 12 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, causing more than 548,000 deaths 3 , with global COVID-19 healthcare worker (HCW) infections on the rise. By early March 2020, more than 3300 HCW had been infected in China alone, with reports of at least 22 HCW deaths 4 . In Italy, a country with a high burden of COVID-19, over 20% of responding HCW have been infected, with almost 200 HCW deaths 5, 6 . The International Council of Nurses (ICN) has reported that more than 600 nurses have died in the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate that over 450,000 HCW had been infected by June 3 rd , 2020 7 . The number of global HCW infections may be underreported due to many countries state health departments not tracking deaths and infections by occupation 8 .The precise dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 is unknown, but likely through a combination of droplets, aerosols and contact 9, 10 . Frontline HCWs, such as those working in emergency wards are at increased risk as HCW are often exposed to patients with high viral loads whilst providing care 11 and accumulated respiratory aerosols in the work-place may pose a risk to occupational safety. Hospitals are highly contaminated environments 11 and hazard controls including PPE are often compromised.. In the UK, where testing was done in two National Health System (NHS) trusts, almost one in five HCW were infected 12, 13 . Therefore, given the hospital as a site of potential outbreaks, infected HCW may be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, and unknowingly infect others at work. A study of HCW infections in Wuhan, China, found that the case infection rate of HCW was 2.0%, significantly higher than non-HCW at 0.43% 14 .An analysis of the COVID-19 HCW infections in China during the initial phase of the outbreak, found that a high number of HCW cases occurred through contact with asymptomatic patients or mildly symptomatic patients of COVID-19 and through direct contact between HCW 15 . A surgical patient in a Wuhan hospital infected 14 HCW before fever onset 16 . HCW may therefore unknowingly acquire and transmit infections to patients and other HCW around them. Many studies have also shown that hospitals not only present a high exposure setting for respiratory infections in HCW 17, 18 but that presenteeism is a key risk factor in disease transmission and extension of an outbreak 19 . An employee who attends work regardless of having a medical illness which prevents them from functioning optimally, demonstrates presenteesim 19 . Despite the serious public health risks of presenteeism 20 , HCW have been identified as a group that are very likely to continue to work when infected with diseases such as influenza and norovirus 21 . In addition, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection can result in nosocomial outbreaks as HCW may work without realizing they are infected.Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been described as a contributing risk factor for COVID-19 in HCW worldwide 5, 22, 23 . Initial recommendations from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were to use respirators, but following a shortage in supply of these, guidelines changed to the use of medical masks, or even cloth masks 24, 25 27 . Further to this, there is always the concern of the risk that demand could outweigh supply of HCW in hotspots that emerge during peaks in the pandemic 28 .Whilst COVID-19 HCW infections have been estimated at greater than over 19 000 cases in the United States of America and over 150 000 cases in Europe 1,2,12,13 , in the absence of national reporting of HCW infections, the impact of COVID-19 on HCW in Australia needs to be investigated 12, 13 . The aim of the study was to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australian HCW and the national health system using publicly available data.Although there is no national reporting of HCW infections, daily press releases from government sources and media reports have reported on hospital outbreaks and HCW infections. We collected publicly available data on Australian COVID-19 patients reported by National and state/territory Governments and the media between January 25 th , 2020 and July 8 th , 2020. HCW For the line list of outbreaks where an outbreak is defined as 2 or more cases of COVID-19 in a one week period, outbreak information was matched using date, location (state/territory and city), the name of the clinical facility, number of cases, patient age, number of deaths and occupation as an HCW. Matching criteria were used to match information from the media to relevant outbreaks and reports. Matched outbreaks included in this report were detailed in state media releases and thus were recorded in the line list.HCW cases from media reports were matched with HCW cases recorded in the line list based on the matching criteria matrix in Table 1 . A case is considered a high probability match if fulfilling at least one criterion from all groups (1, 2 and 3); a medium probability match if fulfilling at least one criterion from groups 2 and 3; and otherwise a low probability match. Only cases with high probability matching were included for the line list and analysis. For the purposes of this study, clinical facilities were deidentified in reporting the results. Rates of infections for HCW were calculated using reported cases and the remaining total cases as the numerator, and denominator data was obtained from the Australian Government 42 outbreak in Melbourne has also seen a rise in HCW infections since late June 2020. Out of 36 hospital outbreaks identified from the media, 2 (5.56%) started with a HCW that travelled interstate; 2 (5.56%) started with a HCW that returned from overseas; 4 (11.11%) started with a HCW that was a contact of a known case from a communityoutbreak; 5 (13.89%)were traced to contact with a patient that tested positive for COVID-19, and 22 (61.11%) did not have information to determine the source of infection. Based on the setting in which the first HCW case was working on when they acquired COVID- Descriptive information for HCW outbreaks is outlined in Table 3 in the Appendix.One way to measure the burden of COVID-19 infections on the health system is to measure the ratio of the number of HCW being quarantined because of contact with a known case, to the number of positive cases. facilities or wards were not shut down. The factors that might explain the disparity in the ratios include the type of acute care facilities such as emergency departments which may not be able to be shut down and availability of HCW to replace those in quarantine. In the absence of formally reported statistics on HCW infections, we estimated 536 HCW infections up to July 2020, and that HCW account for 6.03% of COVID-19 infections in Australia and have double the risk of contracting COVID-19 than the general community. The numbers we estimate are consistent with Federal government press releases that there were 481 HCW infections by April 2020, released well after national cases had significantly decreased 59 . The higher risk of infection is consistent with studies overseas which show a higher risk for HCW 12, 13 .A potential limitation of the risk analyses conducted for this study were based on open-sourced data for HCW cases, which may vary depending on each state's individual data publishing policies. We also used media reports, which have not been verified. In most cases, however, there were multiple media reports about each outbreak, often with quotes from health officials.There is also a potential effect of testing rates on the identification of COVID-19 cases. We accounted for this by representing the daily testing rates in conjunction with the daily HCW infections reported. The source of infection for 22 of the 36 outbreaks analyzed could not be identified. The occupational risk level for the 36 outbreaks is therefore uncertain. The study did not include a second wave of COVID-19 which occurred in the State of Victoria in June-July 2020, where over 3000 HCW were infected 60, 61 . Therefore, this study may not be generalizable to the period July-August 2020. It may not be generalizable to other countries or settings, with different COVID-19 epidemiology and health systems.Nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and SARS-COV-2 have been described 62 , showing hospitals to be a high risk setting for outbreaks. HCW may become infected from COVID-19 patients, coworkers or from outside the hospital, and may act as vectors for onward transmission to coworkers, patients and community members including household contacts. There are someHCWs who have continued to work while symptomatic and some may be asymptomatically infected and working. Our analysis shows that the source of hospital outbreaks can be from both COVID-19 patients and from infections imported into the hospital by HCW or others.Undiagnosed COVID-19 patients 63 or undiagnosed HCW may both cause transmission in the hospital setting.The largest COVID-19 HCW outbreak occurred during the first few weeks of the Australian pandemic when community transmission was low and testing of HCW was based on symptoms.

Such infections typically have zoonotic origins, with other notable examples being SARS-CoV in 2002 [1] , influenza A H1N1 virus in 2009 [2] , and the West African Ebola virus disease epidemic of 2013-2016 [3] .Emerging infectious diseases are increasing in incidence and expanding in geographic range due in large part to direct and diffuse anthropogenic pressure across ecosystems [4] . This is particularly true in areas with high wildlife biodiversity that are experiencing land-use changes such as deforestation [4, 5, 6, 7] , although the process of disease emergence is complex and cannot be attributed to any one driver.Morse et al. have developed a useful framework for conceptualising a staged process of pathogen emergence in humans [8] . In the first stage, potential pathogens circulate exclusively in reservoir hosts.While this stage precedes spillover, the stage is still highly influenced by human activities that place stress on animal populations, such as habitat destruction, population displacement, and nutritional insecurity, thereby altering pathogen circulation in affected non-human host populations [9] . Various researchers have hypothesized that certain animal taxa, such as bats [8, 10] , harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses. However, differential impact of specific taxa on spillover has been recently challenged by research showing that overall species richness within order is the primary driver of pathogen richness among mammalian and bird reservoir hosts, rather than shared biological study did show differences in viral richness between mammals and birds so hosts may still cluster within some taxonomic levels [11] .In the framework's second stage, activities that increase animal-human contact (such as forest management practices or raising domestic animals) create opportunities for spillover from reservoir hosts into human populations. The risk of spillover appears greatest both from generalist species that are highly abundant and adapted to human-dominated landscapes, and -conversely -from those specialist species that are threatened specifically due to habitat loss and human exploitation [11] ; both scenarios confirm the central influence of humans as a driving force behind spillover. Hassell et al. argued that wildlife-livestock-human interfaces emerging under urbanisation represent particularly critical points for cross-species transmission, noting an urgent need for better characterisation of periurban wildlife interfaces using transdisciplinary approaches [12] . Despite the critical influence of anthropogenic pressure, spillover is a complex process requiring that pathogens overcome many landscape and immunological barriers [13] , and even when successful, not all spillovers lead to sustained transmission. Most often this is due to a lack of efficient transmission in the new host populations.Occasionally, spillover into naïve human or domesticated animal populations does result in efficient transmission.The framework's final stage is marked by sustained onward transmission and widespread regional or global dissemination. At this stage, the capacity of local health systems to rapidly detect cases of a novel disease and control ongoing chains of transmission is key to preventing broader dissemination from the original focus [8] . In this work we distinguish wildlife-origin zoonoses with the potential to transmit efficiently between humans as impactful spillovers, and we further designate impactful spillovers with the potential to disseminate rapidly to regions beyond their origin focus as high-impact spillovers. Highimpact spillovers are therefore a function of the capacity of local health systems and the proximity of the initial spillover to conduits of broader global dissemination, particularly transportation hubs such as airports [8] . Consequently, in order to block emerging zoonoses with pandemic potential (high-impact spillovers), biosurveillance systems must simultaneously consider critical animal-human interfaces, the performance and reach of the health systems, and the biosecurity of proximate transportation hubs that can serve as conduits for rapid global dissemination.Despite the documented importance of animal-human interfaces for zoonotic transmission of pathogens, and the framework described above for understanding the staged transition from spillover through to human pandemic, we still lack a practical, data-driven and synthetic description of the geography of the critical intersection of animal-human interface and vulnerable points with low disease detection and rapid widespread dissemination potential. The aims of the current work were therefore to (1) describe and quantify the global geography of the interfaces between mammalian and bird wildlife and humans and their domestic livestock; and (2) to synthesize the geography of the wildlifelivestock/poultry-human interface, poor health system performance , and the global network of air travel to identify cities whose global connectedness and proximity to animal-human interfaces indicate significant potential to serve as conduits for high-impact spillover.Raster data for mammalian and bird species richness, livestock and poultry densities, and human population density were acquired to describe the intersection of their geographic distributions as landscapes of potential animal-human interface. Mammalian and bird species richness were used as a representation of total mammalian and bird diversity (ɣ-diversity), respectively, rather than distinguishing between taxonomic groups since it has recently been shown that overall species richness is the primary driver of pathogen richness among these vertebrate hosts [11] . A mammalian richness raster was acquired from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) repository [14] .Species richness was quantified using the geographic extents of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessment of mammalian species (5,488 species in 156 families). A total bird richness raster was obtained from the biodiversity mapping project [15] and was constructed from the Handbook of Birds of the World [16] , BirdLife International[17], and IUCN. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) provided livestock densities for cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and buffaloes, and poultry densities for chicken and ducks [18] . The GLW was updated in 2018 to more appropriately account for spatial heterogeneity within and between countries. Aggregate livestock and poultry rasters were created by taking the sum of the number of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and buffaloes per unit area, and chicken and ducks per unit area, respectively, since the current aim was to describe the geography of the wild mammal-livestock-human interface, and wild bird-poultry-human interfaces. Human population density was also obtained from the SEDAC repository and is derived from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project version 4 estimates for the 2015 population [19] . Finally, defining high-impact spillover potential requires a measure of the distribution of health system performance as an indication of the local capacity to detect and control the occurrence of cases of a novel zoonosis. The infant mortality ratio (IMR) was chosen as a proxy for health system performance because this has been recognised as a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof robust and widely used indicator of health infrastructure and health system performance and used extensively to compare health services between countries [20, 21] . The IMR has been shown to correlate very well with disability adjusted life expectancy (DALE) as well as the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) and strongly relates to structural issues that affect entire populations, such as economic development, general living conditions, social wellbeing, and the quality of the environment [20, 22] . The raster of the IMR was obtained from SEDAC [23] .Mammalian and bird richness, human population, and IMR rasters were aggregated to the spatial resolution of the livestock and poultry rasters such that all features were analysed with a granularity of 5 arc minutes, which is approximately 10 km. Finally, an adjacency matrix for the global airport network was acquired from WorldPop to compute the network centrality of individual airports within the global network [24] . This data product was constructed by WorldPop to model annual air passenger flows and comprises 1491 airports (network nodes) with 644,406 flight connections between them (network edges) [25] .The global distribution of each landscape feature is presented in the left column of S1 Figure 1 , with the corresponding top quartile of each distribution (75 th percentile) presented in the right column. The objective was to demarcate geographic zones based on the degree of intersection of each landscape feature, thus constructing proxy interfaces between humans, livestock, poultry, and mammalian and bird wildlife, and finally identifying where these interfaces intersect with poor health system performance. Wild bird-poultry and wild mammal-livestock interfaces were considered separately as there is evidence that interfaces arise largely from interaction between phylogenetically related and/or sympatric species [26] , and further evidence suggesting that zoonotic viral richness is higher overall among mammalian species than avian species [11] . Intersection was classified as the co-occurrence of the top quartile (75 th percentile) of each specified feature. The classification scheme was also reconstructed using the co-occurrence of the 50 th percentile for each landscape feature to examine how different distribution classifications affect the demarcation of interface and associated hazard.Three alert levels (yellow, orange, and red) were identified, as conceptualised in Figure 1 . All levels represent landscapes with both high anthropogenic pressure and high biodiversity, and thus have potential for impactful spillover. Alert-level yellow depicts two-way interfaces between mammalian/bird richness and human population or livestock/poultry densities. Alert-level orange depicts three-way interfaces between mammalian/bird richness, human population density, and livestock/poultry J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof densities. Alert-level red depicts the same animal-human interfaces as alert-level orange, but extends the intersection of these interfaces to include the top quartile of infant mortality. Therefore, the hierarchy of this classification system designates two-way interfaces with wildlife (yellow) as the minimum source requirement for wildlife-derived high-impact spillovers, whereas alert-level orange represents landscapes with maximal pressure on, and contact with, wildlife populations. Finally, alertlevel red depicts where the geography of maximum human-animal interface intersects with the geography of poor health system performance. The latter represents those areas that might be expected to miss detection of early cases of spillover to humans and thus presents the greatest risk for high-impact spillover. This scheme thus builds on the work by Morse et al. by 1) quantifying and mapping the degree of shared space between animals and humans, which they posit as driving the first 2 stages of their framework, and 2) quantifying and mapping the degree of health system capacity to intercept global dissemination of zoonotic pathogens that demonstrate onward human-to-human transmission, which defines the third stage of their framework.The validity of these animal-human interface metrics was tested using two case studies. The value of these metrics lies in how well they represent contact between wildlife, livestock/poultry, and humans, and the extent to which they intersect with poor health system performance. Therefore, the two diseases selected as case studies were chosen based on their representation of infection ecology at the relevant animal-human interfaces and not based on their potential to cause pandemics in humans. As such anthrax was selected because it is a model disease for the wild mammal-livestock-human interface [27, 28] , while highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) was selected as a similarly good representation of the wild bird-poultry-human interface [29] . The Food and Agriculture Organisation's Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) was used to capture reported occurrences of anthrax and HPAI H5N1 between 1 January, 2010, and 1 May 2020 [30] . The EMPRES-i system has a particular focus on transboundary animal diseases and emergent zoonoses. Only those occurrences for which the exact location, or the location of the centroid of the subdistrict of the occurrence, was known were included in the case studies to minimise spatial uncertainty. For the two cases studies, respectively, the anthrax (n = 194) and HPAI H5N1 (n = 3247) cases were considered as cities were within 50 km of the alert-level red zone for the wild mammal-livestock-human interface and wild bird-poultry-human interface (14.2% and 19.6%, respectively; Figure 4 ). The interface zones of highest potential spillover impact, and their adjacent cities, were predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia (Figure 4 ). All descriptive analyses were repeated at the next quartile (50 th percentile) for each interface and city centrality, at which 43% of cities in the top 50 th percentile of network centrality were within 50 km of alert-level red zone for each interface, while ≥ 81% of cities were within 50 km of alert-level yellow and orange for each distinct interface (supplemental material: S4 Figure 3 , S5 Figure 4 , and S6 Figure 5 ).This work has defined a hierarchical geography of potential high-impact spillover based on variable animal-human interfaces, human health system capacity and proximate cities of high global connectivity. This work was a descriptive geographical exercise intended to quantify and map a systematic representation of the global animal-human interface, and subsequently it showed that many of the world's most connected cities are adjacent to or within areas where wildlife share space with humans and their domesticated animals. Indeed, more than 40% of these cities were within or adjacent to landscapes of extensive animal-human interface, while approximately 14%-20% were located in landscapes of both extensive interface and poor health system performance, thus demonstrating the precarious positioning of many global transportation hubs. As a means toward preventing future highimpact spillovers of pandemic potential, we have highlighted those areas of the world that could most benefit from simultaneous investment in 1) conservation efforts to limit wildlife encounters with humans and their domesticated animals, 2) improved surveillance of animals, and 3) improved human health infrastructure to detect spillovers when they occur and prevent onward spread. Finally, defining a global geography of potential high-impact spillover offers unique value by locating those areas and cities that could most benefit from the development of composite, or at least coordinated, landscape and airport biosurveillance systems at local and national levels.In this study we identify areas where the sharing of space between wildlife and humans is high, health system performance is low, and critical interfaces are located adjacent to cities with high global connectivity. We thus provide practitioners in human and animal health with a geographical framework that applies a synthesis of epidemiological, ecological and health system research outputs to aid J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof evidence-based public health decision-making. We emphasize that this work is not presented as a prediction of global hotspots of spillover. Several well-conducted studies have been undertaken that provide useful results in this domain [4, 10, 38] . Moreover, previous efforts have clearly demonstrated the importance of increasing human and domesticated animal encounters with wildlife as a key driver of spillover [39] , as well as the potential modulation of wildlife-human encounters and subsequent spillover by climate change [40] . While these previous modelling studies have identified the importance of human pressure on wildlife for spillover, none have described the global distribution of animal-human interface as a data-driven construct of the degree of shared space between wildlife, domesticated animals, and humans. Nor have they considered the location of proximate transportation hubs, which are positioned to amplify impactful spillovers through rapid regional or global dissemination and thus transitioning impactful spillovers to high-impact spillovers with regional epidemic or global pandemic consequence. In other words, conduits of high-impact spillover have not been previously systematically mapped, nor have they been described using a practical hierarchy designating the degree of animal-human interface.The practical approach presented here will allow for a more targeted development of One Health surveillance and prevention programs, and provides considerable scope as a strategic tool for preventing future pandemics. For example, a preventive strategy can be designed to create barriers between the high-hazard landscapes and their adjacent points of global dissemination. Moreover, the closer an intervention is to the landscape generating the hazard (i.e. spillover) the broader would be its expected downstream prevention effect, whereas an intervention implemented farthest from initial spillover (e.g. at transportation hubs) is more permeable and would expectedly provide narrower effect.However, when integrated with upstream surveillance, enhanced monitoring at transportation hubs can contribute to robust, multi-tiered systems by providing a data-informed, critical last line of defense ( Figure 5 ).Some limitations with this work regarding proxy measures require further discussion. First, the animalhuman interfaces described here are based on the distributions of the species involved (wild mammals and birds, domesticated animals, and humans) rather than on direct observations of the species' interactions in the landscape. Therefore the metrics used to represent these interfaces are proxies for interspecific interaction. Nevertheless, the granularity of the species' distributions was relatively fine scale (10 km x 10 km) and, given the high percentile (75 th ) of species' distributions used to construct the primary risk zones, it is reasonable to assume that humans and animals do indeed share the spaces, either in whole or in part or directly or indirectly, within the interfaces we have demarcated. Second, the infant mortality rate was used as a proxy for health system performance. We recognise that health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f systems are complex coalescences of economic and social infrastructure, medical capacity and training, public health capacity and training, governmental organisation, and the general socioeconomic status of human populations. Moreover, it would not be possible to measure these individual components with the granularity required to synthesise a geographically meaningful new construct of health systems.However, the infant mortality rate has long been recognised as both a reliably measured outcome of health systems and a robust metric for comparing the performance of health systems between countries [20] [21] [22] . Finally, the validation case studies should not be over-interpreted with respect to anthrax or HPAI H5N1 or any other zoonosis. As described above, the current work is not intended as a predictive modelling study. The models used here were not trained with one set of outbreaks to identify some optimal suite of predictors, and then, once identified, tested and evaluated against an independent set of outbreaks. Rather, under the current framework specific hazard metrics for animalhuman interfaces were created by quantifying the extent to which humans share space with wildlife.The point process models were then used to determine how these metrics, data-driven and standradised but conceptualised a priori, actually fit against real-world outbreaks of important known zoonoses. It is also important to recognise that outbreak reporting as captured by the EMPRES-i system may not be geographically homogeneous, which is in fact reflected in the finding that red zone interfaces were a poorer fit to the case study outbreaks indicating that these areas may be more prone to missing cases.This investigation has shown that there are substantial animal-human interfaces in areas of poor health system performance, highlighting those areas of potential impactful spillover where health infrastructure may be insufficient to identify spillover cases early and block onward human-to-human transmission should this emerge. This work further showed that there are many cities with a high degree of global connectivity that are proximate to the areas at risk of impactful spillover, and thus has ","Australia","first author","2020-10-08",10

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a ~30 kb poly-adenylated genome 1, 2 . Complete genome sequences published in January 2020 1,3 enabled development of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that have served as the diagnostic standard during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 4 . Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 provides additional data to complement routine diagnostic testing. Viral WGS informs public health responses by defining the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks 5 . Integration with epidemiological data identifies transmission networks and can infer the origin of unknown cases [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Largescale, longitudinal surveillance by viral WGS may also provide insights into virus evolution, with important implications for vaccine development [12] [13] [14] [15] .WGS can be performed via PCR amplification or hybrid-capture of the reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Short-read sequencing technologies (e.g., Illumina) enable accurate sequence determination and are the current standard for pathogen genomics. However, long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offer an alternative with several advantages. ONT devices are portable, cheap, require minimal supporting laboratory infrastructure or technical expertise for sample preparation, and can be used to perform rapid sequencing analysis with flexible scalability 16 . The use of ONT devices for viral surveillance has been demonstrated during Ebola, Zika and other disease outbreaks [17] [18] [19] . Although protocols for ONT sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have been established and applied in both research and public health settings [20] [21] [22] , adoption of the technology has been limited due to concerns around its accuracy. ONT devices exhibit lower read-level sequencing accuracy than short-read platforms [23] [24] [25] . This may have a disproportionate impact on SARS-CoV-2 analysis, due to the virus' low mutation rate (8 ´ 10 -4 substitutions per site per year 26 ), which ensures erroneous (false-positive) or undetected (falsenegative) genetic variants have a strong confounding effect. In order to address concerns regarding ONT sequencing accuracy and evaluate its analytical validity for SARS-CoV-2 genomics, we have performed amplicon-based nanopore and short-read WGS on matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, allowing rigorous evaluation of ONT performance characteristics.Synthetic DNA or RNA reference standards can be used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of nextgeneration sequencing assays 27 . We first sequenced synthetic RNA controls that were generated by in vitro transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. The controls matched the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain at all positions, allowing analytical errors to be unambiguously identified. To mimic a real-world viral WGS experiment, synthetic RNA was reverse-transcribed then amplified using multiplexed PCR of 98 ´ ~400 bp amplicons that enabled evaluation of ~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eight independent replicates were sequenced on ONT PromethION and Illumina MiSeq instruments (see Methods).We aligned the resulting reads to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome to assess sequencing accuracy and related quality metrics (Fig. S1a-i) . Illumina and ONT platforms exhibited distinct read-level error profiles, with the latter characterised by an elevated rate of both substitution (23-fold) and insertion-deletion (indel) errors (76-fold; Table 1 ; Fig. S1d,e) . Per-base error frequency profiles showed clear correlation between ONT replicates (substitution R 2 = 0.67; indel R 2 = 0.82; Fig. S1f,g) . This indicates that ONT sequencing errors are not entirely random but are influenced by local sequence context. For example, indel errors were enriched (1.4-fold) at low-complexity sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (i.e., sites with homopolymeric or repetitive content; ~1% of the genome; Fig. S1d ). Illumina error profiles showed weaker correlation between replicates (substitution R 2 = 0.15; indel R 2 = 0.42), indicating that short-read sequencing errors were less systematic than for ONT libraries (Fig. S1h,i) .Despite their distinct error profiles, both sequencing platforms demonstrated high consensus-level sequencing accuracy across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We used iVar and Medaka workflows to determine consensus genome sequences for Illumina and ONT libraries, respectively (see Methods). We detected just two erroneous variant candidates in a single ONT library ( Table 1) . Both of these were single-base insertions occurring at low-complexity sites (Fig. S2) , with no erroneous SNVs detected in any replicate (n = 8). All Illumina libraries exhibited perfect accuracy (Table 1) . Therefore, the sequencing artefacts affecting both technologies had minimal impact on the accuracy of consensus-level sequence determination, with indel errors in ONT samples being a possible exception.To further evaluate the suitability of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomics, we conducted rigorous proficiency testing using bona fide clinical specimens. We performed ONT and Illumina WGS on matched, deidentified SARS-CoV-2-positive cases collected at public hospital laboratories in Eastern & Southern New South Wales and Metropolitan Sydney from March-April 2020 (see Methods; Supplementary Table 1 ). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was enriched by PCR amplification, using a custom set of 14 ´ ~2.5 kb amplicons that covers 29783/29903 bp (99.6%) of the genome, including 100% of annotated protein-coding positions 6 . Pooled amplicons then underwent parallel library preparation and sequencing on an ONT GridION/PromethION and an Illumina MiSeq instrument (see Methods). Short-read sequencing was performed according to a pathogen genomics accredited diagnostic workflow in a reference NSW Health Pathology laboratory, enabling direct comparison of nanopore sequencing to the established standard for pathogen genomics. In total, we obtained complete (99.6%) genome coverage with both technologies for 157 matched positive cases (Supplementary Table 1 ). By comparison to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, Illumina sequencing identified 7.6 consensus single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 0.04 indels, on average, per sample. A further 1.0 SNVs and 0.2 indels per sample were detected at sub-consensus read-count frequencies (20 -80%), indicative of intra-specimen genetic diversity (see below). Excluding positions with evidence of subconsensus variation, this provides an overall comparison set of 1201 consensus variants and 4,674,554 positions that match the reference strain in a given sample, against which to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nanopore sequencing (Supplementary Table 1 ).We used each of two best-practice bioinformatics pipelines developed by the ARTIC network to identify consensus variants with ONT sequencing data. The alternative pipelines differed primarily in their use of either Medaka or Nanopolish to call variants (see Methods). In general, ONT variant candidates identified by both pipelines were highly concordant with the Illumina comparison set. Illumina variants were detected with 99.17% sensitivity and 99.58% precision by Nanopolish, compared to 98.33% sensitivity and 99.24% precision by Medaka ( Table 2) . Undetected variants (false-negatives) were more frequent than erroneous candidates (false-positives), occurring in 14/157 (9%) and 9/157 (6%) of Medaka samples, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). Only 1/7 (14%) of consensus indels in the Illumina comparison set was detected by either Nanopolish or Medaka, while a further five and nine false-positive indels were detected by the respective pipelines (Supplementary Table 2 ). While the scarcity of consensus indels detected with either sequencing technology prevented a more thorough evaluation of indel accuracy, this indicates that ONT is inadequate for accurate detection of small indels in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In contrast, SNVs were detected by Nanopolish and Medaka with high accuracy: overall, we found 99.66% and 98.83% concordance between ONT and Illumina SNVs, as measured by Jaccard similarity, with identical results in 145/157 (92%) and 153/157 samples (97%), respectively ( Table 2) . Inspection of false-positive and false-negative variant candidates detected with ONT sequencing data showed that these tended to occur in low-complexity sequences, which are known to be refractory to ONT base-calling algorithms 23 . For example, false-negative and/or false-positive candidates were found within a 21 bp T-rich site in the orf1ab gene in multiple samples (Fig. S3a,b) . We identified fifteen problematic lowcomplexity sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ranging in size from 9 to 42 bp in length that showed elevated read-level sequencing error rates ( Fig. S1d; Supplementary File 1) . Exclusion of these positions (~1% of the genome) improved the fidelity of ONT variant detection, with consensus SNVs in the Illumina comparison set being detected with 99.83% and 99.40% sensitivity by Nanopolish and Medaka, respectively, and perfect precision for both. Consensus SNVs detected with the Nanopolish workflow were identical between ONT and Illumina data in 155/157 (99%) of samples ( Table 2; Supplementary Table 3 ). This suggests that the accuracy of nanopore WGS may be improved via the exclusion of a small number of 'blacklist' low-complexity sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome from downstream analysis. We next assessed the impact of sequencing depth on ONT performance. To do so, we down-sampled nanopore sequencing reads from a uniform 200-fold coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 genome and repeated variant detection across a range of coverage depths (see Methods). Both sensitivity and precision of variant detection were strongly influenced by sequencing coverage, showing a sharp decline below ~50-fold coverage depth, with minimal improvement observed above ~60-fold (Fig. 1a,b) . As above, excluding errorprone low-complexity sequences afforded consistent improvements to sensitivity and overall concordance across the range of depths tested (Fig. 1a,b) .To verify these observations and assess reproducibility, we re-sequenced twelve specimens to generate triplicate (n = 3) data on both Illumina and ONT platforms (see Methods). We measured reproducibility by performing pairwise comparisons of detected variant candidates between replicates for a given sample (Supplementary Table 4 ). No discordant variants were detected between Illumina replicates across any of the 36 pairwise sample comparisons (309 variants total), confirming the reliability of short-read WGS. ONT also showed high reproducibility, with 99.36% Jaccard similarity between Medaka replicates for consensus variants (310 total) and perfect concordance for SNVs (Supplementary Table 4 ).In summary, ONT sequencing enabled highly accurate and reproducible detection of consensus-level SNVs in SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates but appears generally unsuitable for the detection of small indel variants.Within-host genetic diversity is a common feature of RNA viruses, with divergent quasi-species present in a single infection. Within-host diversity may help infecting viruses evade the host immune response, adapt to changing environments and can cause more severe and/or long-lasting disease [28] [29] [30] . Resolving this diversity may also better inform studies of virus transmission than consensus-level phylogenetics alone [31] [32] [33] . Therefore, we next evaluated the capacity of nanopore sequencing to identify intra-specimen genetic variation by detecting variants present at sub-consensus frequencies (i.e. variants detected in < 80% of mapped reads). Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA controls (see above) showed that sequencing artefacts in Illumina libraries could be misinterpreted as variants at read-count frequencies below ~20% (Fig.  S2b) , effectively establishing a lower bound for variant detection. We therefore limited our analysis to variants detected at ³20% frequency, taking variants detected by Illumina sequencing above this level to be genuine. Overall, short-read sequencing identified sub-consensus variants (20-80%) in 54/157 samples, comprising 156 SNVs and 20 indels (Supplementary Table 5 ). Using Varscan2, we identified 154 sub-consensus SNV candidates in ONT sequencing libraries (Supplementary Table 5 ). We detected 119 SNVs (sensitivity = 76.3%) in the Illumina comparison set and 25 false-positives (precision = 82.6%; Supplementary Table 5 ). Read-count frequencies for variants identified with both technologies were correlated (R 2 = 0.69), indicating that these were bona fide variants, rather than sequencing artefacts (Fig. 1c) . While the overall performance of sub-consensus SNV detection was quite poor, most false-positives and false-negatives were confined to the lower end of the frequency range assessed here (Fig. 1c,d) . For example, SNVs at high (60-80%) and intermediate (40-60%) sub-consensus frequencies were detected with relatively high sensitivity (95.7%, 91.3%) and precision (100%, 97.7%), whereas low-frequency variants (20-40%) were detected with low sensitivity (63.2%) and precision (69.6%; Fig. 1d) . Unsurprisingly, the high rate of indel errors in ONT sequencing libraries meant that they were unsuitable for detecting indel diversity, with errors overwhelming true variants (Supplementary Table 5 ). In summary, ONT sequencing enabled detection of within-specimen SNVs at frequencies from ~40-80% with adequate accuracy but was generally unsuitable for the detection of indels or rare SNVs (< 40%).Large genomic deletions or rearrangements can have a major impact on virus function and evolution, however, there are currently just a few reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 specimens harbouring structural variants (SVs) 15, 34 . Therefore, we next evaluated the detection of SVs in SARS-CoV-2 specimens with ONT sequencing. We used NGMLR-Sniffles to identify potential SVs in ONT libraries and validated these with supporting evidence from short-read sequencing (see Methods). Across all SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens, we detected sixteen candidate deletions ranging in size from 15-1,840 bp (Table 3) , while no other SV types were identified. Of these, 13/16 were supported by split shortread alignments and/or discordant read-pairs in matched Illumina libraries ( Fig. S4a; Table 3 ). For 7/16 candidates, short-read evidence confirmed the presence of the deletion but indicated that the breakpoint position was not accurately placed by ONT reads (Fig. S4b; Table 3 ). Among the thirteen deletions detected by both platforms were examples in genes S, M, N, ORF3, ORF6, ORF8 and orf1ab ( Table 3) . Only one variant, a 328 bp deletion in ORF8 (Fig. S4c) , was detected in multiple specimens, although highly similar (but not identical) 28 bp and 29 bp deletions were also detected in S in two unrelated specimens (Fig. S4d) .Overall, this analysis demonstrates that large deletions can be reliably detected using ONT sequencing and suggests that structural variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more common and diverse than currently appreciated.Viral WGS can be used to study the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and is increasingly recognised as a critical tool for public health responses to COVID-19. Nanopore sequencing offers an alternative to established short-read platforms for viral WGS with several advantages. ONT devices: (i) are relatively inexpensive, highly portable and require minimal associated laboratory infrastructure; (ii) enable rapid generation of sequencing data and even real-time data analysis; (iii) require comparatively simple procedures for library preparation and; (iv) offer flexibility in sample throughput, accommodating single (e.g., Flongle), multiple (e.g., MinION/GridION) or tens/hundreds (e.g., PromethION) of specimens per flow-cell 16, 18 . Therefore, ONT sequencing could further empower SARS-CoV-2 surveillance initiatives by enabling point-ofcare WGS analysis and improved turnaround time for critical cases, particularly in isolated or poorly resourced settings 35 .Due to the relatively low mutation rate observed in SARS-CoV-2 26 , accurate sequence determination is vital to correctly define the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks. With ONT sequencing known to exhibit higher read-level sequencing error rates than short-read technologies [23] [24] [25] , reasonable concerns exist about suitability of the technology for SARS-CoV-2 genomics. Moreover, public databases for SARS-CoV-2 data (e.g., GISAID: https://www.gisaid.org/) already contain consensus genome sequences generated via ONT sequencing, potentially confounding investigations that rely on these resources. The present study resolves these concerns, demonstrating accurate consensus-level SARS-CoV-2 sequence determination with ONT data. We report that: (i) variants at consensus-level read-count frequencies (80-100%) were detected with >99% sensitivity and >99% precision across 157 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens, confirming the suitability of ONT sequencing for standard phylogenetic analyses; (ii) high accuracy and reproducibly was achieved by each of two alternative tools for ONT variant detection, with Nanopolish showing modest improvements over Medaka; (iii) a minimum ~60-fold sequencing depth was required to ensure accurate detection of SNVs, but little or no improvement was achieved above this level; (iv) falsepositive and false-negative variants were typically observed at low-complexity sequences, with fidelity improved by excluding these problematic sites; (v) in contrast to consensus SNVs, ONT sequencing performed poorly in the detection of consensus indels or low-frequency variants (such variants should therefore be interpreted with caution); (vi) while the high indel error rate in ONT sequencing impedes accurate detection of small indels, long nanopore reads appear well-suited for the detection of large deletions and potentially other structural variants. Although SNVs alone are sufficient for routine phylogenetic analysis, small indels and large structural variants can profoundly impact gene function and are, therefore, of interest to studies of virus evolution and pathogenicity 15 . As the first systematic evaluation of nanopore sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 WGS, this study removes an important barrier to its widespread adoption in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While short-read sequencing platforms remain the gold-standard for high-throughput viral sequencing, the advantages to portability, cost and turnaround-time afforded by nanopore sequencing imply that this emerging technology can serve an important complementary role in local, national and international COVID-19 response strategies.Synthetic controls used in this study were manufactured by Twist Biosciences and are commercially available (Catalog item 101024). The controls comprise synthetic RNA generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, representing the complete genome in 6 ´ ~5 kb continuous sequences. The controls used in this study are identical in sequence to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (MN908947.3), allowing sequencing artefacts to be readily identified. Synthetic controls were prepared for sequencing via a protocol established by the ARTIC network for viral surveillance (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Briefly, reverse-transcription was performed on aliquots of synthetic RNA (at 10 6 copies per µL) using Superscript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared cDNA was then amplified using multiplexed PCR with 98 ´ ~400 bp amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome (ARTIC V3 primer set). Amplification was performed with Q5 Hotstart DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with 1.5 µL of cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead ratio), quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by short-read and nanopore sequencing. We note that it is not possible to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in this way, since amplicons that span boundaries of the 6 ´ ~5 kb IVT products necessarily fail. Nevertheless, we were able to evaluate ~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.SARS-CoV-2-positive extracts from 157 cases, tested at NSW Health Pathology East Serology and Virology Division (SaViD), were retrieved from storage and included in this study. All specimens were nasopharyngeal swabs originating from patients in New South Wales during March-April 2020. Specimens underwent total nucleic acid extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure DNA and total NA kit on an automated extraction instrument (MagNA pure 96). Reverse-transcription was performed on viral RNA extracts using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), which contains both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared cDNA was then amplified separately with each of 14 x ~2.5 kb amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as described elsewhere 6 . Amplification was performed with Platinum SuperFi Green PCR Mastermix (Thermo Fisher) with 1.5 µL of cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead ratio), quantified using PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher). All 14 x amplicon products from a given sample were then pooled at equal abundance and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by shortread and nanopore sequencing. This strategy ensured that any sequence artefacts potentially introduced during reverse-transcription and/or PCR amplification were common to matched ONT/Illumina samples, so would not be interpreted as false-positive/negatives during technology comparison.Pooled amplicons were prepped for short-read sequencing using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were multiplexed using Nextera DNA CD Indexes and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Within each sequencing lane, a blank sample was also prepared and sequenced, in order to monitor for contamination and/or index swapping between samples. The resulting reads were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using bwa mem (0.7.12-r1039) 36 . Primer sequences were trimmed from the termini of read alignments using iVar (1.0) 37 . Trimmed alignments were converted to pileup format using samtools mpileup (v1.9) 38 , with anomalous read pairs retained (--count-orphans), base alignment quality disabled (--no-BAQ) and all bases considered, regardless of PHRED quality (--min-BQ 0). Variants were identified using bcftools call (v1.9) 38 , assuming a ploidy of 1 (--ploidy 1), then filtered for a minimum read depth of 30 and minimum quality of 20. Variants were classified according to their read-count frequencies as consensus (>80% reads supporting the variant) or sub-consensus (20-80%) variants, with the latter further divided into high (60-80%), intermediate (40-60%) or low-frequency (20-40%). Variants at readcount frequencies below 20% were considered to be potentially spurious and excluded on this basis. Nanopore sequencing ARTIC amplicons (~400 bp) from the synthetic RNA controls were prepared for nanopore using the ONT Native Barcoding Expansion kit (EXP-NBD104). The longer amplicons (~2.5 kb) used on SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens were prepared for nanopore sequencing using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004). Both kits were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Up to twelve samples were multiplexed on a FLO-FLG001, FLO-MIN106D or FLO-PRO002 or flow-cell and sequenced on a GridION X5 or PromethION P24 device, respectively. In addition, a no-template negative control from the PCR amplification step was prepared in parallel and sequenced on each flow-cell (Supplementary Table 6 ). The RAMPART software package 39 was used to monitor sequencing performance in real-time, with runs proceeding until a minimum ~200-fold coverage was achieved across all amplicons. At this point, the run was terminated and the flowcell washed using the ONT Flow Cell Wash kit (EXP-WSH003), allowing re-use in subsequent runs. The resulting reads were basecalled using Guppy (4.0.14) and aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using minimap2 (2.17-r941) 40 . The ARTIC tool align_trim was used to trim primer sequences from the termini of read alignments and cap sequencing depth at a maximum of 400-fold coverage. Consensus-level variant candidates were identified using each of two workflows developed by ARTIC (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019), using Nanopolish 41 or Medaka (0.11.5) to variants, respectively. Nanopolish variants candidates were filtered directly with the ARTIC artic_vcf_filter tool, while Medaka candidates were evaluated by LongShot (0.4.1) 42 before filtering. Sub-consensus level variant candidates were identified using Varscan2 (v2.4.3) 43 .For synthetic RNA controls, read-level quality metrics, such as sequencing error rates, were derived from read alignments using pysamstats, with any bases that differed from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence considered errors.The accuracy of variant detection by ONT sequencing was evaluated by comparison to the set of variants identified by Illumina sequencing in matched cases. To ensure consistent representation of variants across calls generated by different programs: (i) multi-allelic variant candidates were separate into individual SNVs/indels using bcftools norm (1.9) 38 ; (ii) multi-nucleotide variants were decomposed into their simplest set of individual components using rtg-tools vcfdecompose (3.10.1) and; (iii) indels at simple repeats were left-aligned using gatk LeftAlignAndTrimVariants (4.0.11.0). Variant candidates identified by Illumina/ONT could then be considered concordant based on matching genome position, reference base and alternative base/s. For a given case, variant candidates identified with ONT and Illumina were classified as true-positives (TPs), candidates identified by ONT but not Illumina as false-positives (FPs) and candidates identified by Illumina but not ONT as false-negatives (FNs). The following statistical definitions were used to evaluate results: Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) Precision = TP / (TP + FP) Jaccard similarity = TP / (TP + FP + FN)To identify structural variation, nanopore reads were re-aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using the rearrangement-aware aligner NGMLR (v0.2.7) 44 . Sniffles (v1.0.11) 44 was then used to detect candidate variants with a minimum length of 10 bp and ³ 20 supporting reads. To validate SVs detected with ONT alignments, split short-read alignments and discordant read-pairs were extracted from matched Illumina libraries using lumpy 45 . Variant candidates were then manually inspected to verify evidence from ONT and short-reads and assess break-point position resolution.Software used in this study is generally open source and all publicly available.

Public health responses have varied from country to country. Regarding alcohol sales, on-premise locations such as restaurants and bars have been closed in many countries along with most businesses that would involve people congregating together.In most of these countries, stores that sell alcohol for consumption elsewhere (referred hereafter as off-premise stores) remain open as usual with a few exceptions such as Greenland, South Africa and Thailand, where they have also been closed (3) . Meanwhile, in India a 70% ""corona-tax"" has been placed on alcohol in an attempt to reduce consumption during the pandemic (4) . In countries where such measures have not been put in place there are concerns about consumption in private homes increasing during social distancing (5, 6) .Overall, evidence is lacking concerning the effect of social distancing measures, legislation affecting the sale of alcohol, and all the other societal upheavals inherent to this pandemic on alcohol consumption. Early estimates of the impact of the pandemic on consumption are urgently needed to inform health promotion and policy-based responses.On March the 29th 2020, it was announced that Australians were only allowed to leave their homes for healthcare, exercise, shopping for essentials or essential work/education (7) , restrictions that remained in place until May 16. With all restaurant and bars closed and the population being asked to stay in their homes, consumption in licensed premises will decrease markedly.. This may be matched by a corresponding increase in consumption in homes. Before the pandemic, nearly two-thirds of alcohol was already consumed at home in Australia, with over 55-year-old drinkers consuming substantially more of their alcohol at home than younger drinkers (approximately 77% versus approximately 37% respectively) (7) . One could predict that consumption will decline more for younger drinkers who are no longer able to drink in places where they usually drink, notably other people's homes and licensed venues (8) .However, there is also reason to be concerned that harmful consumption may increase. In times of economic crisis, risky drinking in men is thought to increase as a response to stress, while overall consumption falls in response to financial constraints (9) . Indeed, a study on health risk behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in men who sleep with men found that more people increased consumption since social distancing was implemented than decreased (10) . Social distancing and/or lockdown type measures have led to increased stress (11) , which is directly associated with alcohol use (12) , and alcohol-related harms typically correlate with drinking to cope (13) (14) (15) . The stress of the pandemic, particularly among those who work and have caring commitments has led to increases in stress, particularly in women (11) . This prior work on stress and consumption suggests that we will see an increase in consumption, however this will presumably be somewhat counterbalanced by the closure of licensed premises and restricted social gatherings and face-to-face interactions. How much people will replace in-person social drinking occasions with virtual ones is unknown, but this presumably will not be consistent by age. Overall, there is little known about what changes we might see in alcohol consumption across different demographic groups.Therefore, predicting the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption is difficult. Timely and applicable research is required to inform health care profesionals and policy-makers working to limit the impact of potential harms. Internet-based convenience samples are an expedient way of collecting exploratory data during this crisis when traditional methods are either not possible due to distancing restictions and high cost and/or time demands (6) . The results presented here aim to provide early indicators of changes in consumption and harms among drinkers during social distancing. The first hypothesis is that young people will disproportionately reduce their harmful drinking compared to older drinkers. The second hypothesis is that men will increase their harmful drinking relative to women. The third hypothesis is that those who experience high levels of stress will increase their harmful drinking more than other drinkers.To assess alcohol consumption before and during social distancing and levels of stress, a national cross-sectional survey design was implemented. Adults aged between 18 and 65 years of age were recruited through Facebook and Instagram advertisements. Data was collected between the 16th of April, 2020 and the 11th of May, 2020. To participate in the study, potential participants were redirected to the survey. After providing voluntary consent, participants were first screened using three inclusion criteria and then asked to complete the survey..Online surveys were administered through http://www.qualtrics.com, which took about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. At the end of the survey, respondents were invited to enter a prize draw of ten grocery vouchers worth 50AUD. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at La Trobe University (HEC20052).In total, 2,630 people clicked on the Facebook or Instagram advert and agreed to participate. Of those, 695 (26.4%) did not meet the inclusion criteria (i.e. being Australian, aged 18-65 and consume alcohol once a month) and a further 251 participants (12.7%) did not complete the survey.Within the sample of 1684 participants 64.6% were female, 31.2% male, 3.6% preferred to self-describe as non-binary, gender-fluid, agender or an option not listed and 0.7% preferred not to say. Please note that all respondents are included in the results in Table 1 , however the combination of small sample size and the use of interactions in the model meant that only those who self-identified as men or women could be included in the analyses presented in Table 2 . The sample has a mean age of 48.9 (SD=13.3), with 79% completing a diploma or bachelor's degree. Comparisons between this sample and that of a nationally representative survey are shown in Table 1 .The survey, consisted of selected questions from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the stress subscale from the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and some demographic items.Demographics. Participants' age, gender and highest level of academic qualification were requested.Alcohol use and dependence. To assess alcohol use and dependence 8 items from the 10item AUDIT were used. The AUDIT is a screening tool that aims to identify hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption (16) . The first three questions focus on alcohol consumption and the next three make up a dependence subscale. Finally in the full ten item AUDIT there are four questions that address negative consequences of drinking, however as two of these items have response options that differentiate between harms that have happened in the past year and those that have happened in their lifetime, these items were deemed innapropriate for comparison between two time points that are only a month apart. Therefore, while the first two items of this subscale are included in the 8-item AUDIT, the negative consequences subscale has not been calculated. The total of the 8 AUDIT items has been included as an overall measure of harmful or hazardous drinking with the caveat that it is not the full scale that was designed for this purpose.To identify differences before and during social distancing, the AUDIT was administered twice. In the first iteration of the survey the following was included as a Table 1 .Response option scores from each question range from 0-4, meaning that subscale scores range from 0-12 and the 8-item total 0-32. Full item wording and response options can be found in the scales original publication (17) .Scale (DASS-21; (18)) was used to assess stress in the week preceeding completion of the survey. The DASS-21 is a 21-item self report instrument designed to measure depression, anxiety and stress with robust reliability (19) . Response categories ranged from 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much or most of the time) with scores ranging from 0 to 21. The stress scale has a excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's stress = .93) (19) .In order to facilitate examination of non-linear relationships and facilitate graphical representation of the findings, respondents were grouped into roughly equal low (7-10), medium (11) (12) (13) (14) and high (15+) stress groups.Data from the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey ((NDSHS; 20)) were used to assess differences in demographics and survey responses between a sample representative of the Australian population and those obtained in the convenience sample used in the current study. The NDSHS is collected every three years via drop-and-collect paper forms, computer assisted telephone interview, and online surveys using multi-stage, stratified random sampling (20) . The 2016 NDSHS had a 51.1% response rate. A total of 13,739 (males=6,319, females=7,420) respondents aged between 18 and 65 who consumed alcohol at least monthly were used for the comparison analysis.Respondents who had consumed any alcohol in the past 12 months completed the AUDIT. In the NDSHS, the AUDIT items are not asked together in one single section. Items 1 to 3 of the AUDIT vary slightly in the NDSHS, with slightly different wording and response options. The responses given in the NDSHS were recoded to reflect the responses available in the AUDIT (please see (21) for more details).Given the importance of quickly collecting data during an unprecedented time, these analyses were not pre-registered and results should be considered exploratory. As noted above, 251 respondents were removed for not completing the survey. No other missing data was recorded. Mean scores on all items, subscale totals, and total AUDIT scores were calculated for before and during social distancing measures following the pandemic.Paired t-tests were used to identify significant shifts in AUDIT scores. In order to provide some insight into the differences between our sample and a sample more representative of the Australian population, corresponding results from the NDSHS were also generated.Next, in order to ascertain which demographic groups experienced shifts in consumption, regression models predicting shifts in consumption during the first month of social distancing in Australia were conducted. The difference in scoresscore between time 1 and time 2 were calculated so that a positive number indicated an increase in score and was used as the outcome variable in regression models. Stress, education, age and gender and an interaction between age and gender were used as predictor variables. The interaction was included to allow for shifts across age and gender that were not uniform. Estimated marginal means in the shift in AUDIT scores by the age and gender interaction were graphed for ease of interpretation of results. Outcome variables included the total score, the two subscales with complete items and the three questions on consumption. These were selected because a) these three items account for the majority of AUDIT scores and correlate highly with the total and b) the three items in this subscale did not shift in unison.The scores on the AUDIT before and during the pandemic, along with the NDSHS comparisons, are shown in Table 1 . The sample recruited for this study was older, more often female and had higher AUDIT scores in 2019 than those in the national representative sample. As can be seen, there was a reduction in total AUDIT score in our sample during the pandemic. Similar reductions were found in the two complete subscales, the AUDIT-C and the AUDIT-D. At the item level, reductions were consistently found in all items and subtotals except for item 1, addressing frequency of consumption. This was also the only item in which more people reported a higher score during the pandemic. Please note that all figures in this manuscript represent scores on the AUDIT items rather than a specific number of drinks or drinking days. On all other items except for those on quantity per occasion and drinking first thing in the morning, more people reported a lower score during the pandemic. Overall, nearly half of respondents had a decrease in total AUDIT score of one point or more and nearly a quarter increased. Table 2 displays models predicting shifts in AUDIT scores during the pandemic. Given the importance of consumption in the study of harmful drinking the three items in the consumption subscale are included as outcome variables here as well as consumption and dependence subscale totals and the 8-item total. In order to facilitate interpretation of results, the estimated marginal means of these shifts in scores are shown by age and sex in were still significantly below zero indicating that this group also decreased their harmful drinking overall. In the other models, those in the high and medium stress groups reported relatively higher shifts than those in the low stress group for items 1 and 3 and the consumption subscale.This study aimed to identify groups that might have increased or decreased harmful consumption in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. In our convenience sample, we found a small downward shift in most alcohol indicators during the early stages of the pandemic. The first hypothesis was supported as younger drinkers did decrease their harmful consumption more than older. We found partial support for the second hypothesis: men's consumption did not increase; however it did decrease less compared to women in younger age groups. The third hypothesis was supported as higher levels of stress were positively associated with shifts in total AUDIT score.Decreases in harmful drinking in our sample were primarily driven by drinkers aged 18-25, particularly women. These relatively large downward shifts in harmful drinking masked a plateau or even a small increase in consumption in older drinkers. Conversely, drinkers aged 36-50 increased AUDIT scores during the pandemic, again this is being driven more by women as they showed increased scores in the consumption subscale and overall AUDIT score. Previous research has demonstrated that women but not men increase their alcohol consumption when confronted with conflicting work and family duties (22) , which may have become more prevalent or pronounced during social distancing; a worthwhile avenue of future research. Our finding that men also decreased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic is in contrast to the finding of Sanchez and colleagues (10), who found a sample of men who had sex with men reported increases in consumption. It is possible that this is due to our study's broader target population or it may reflect respondents being asked to assess their shift in consumption themselves -these respondents may be referring to the same increase in frequency of consumption that we found in the current study, rather than an increase in overall consumption or harm. -.The finding that more stress was linked with relatively higher harmful consumption during the pandemic is consistent with previous non-pandemic specific work on harmful drinking and stress within individuals (9) . However, overall, scores have decreased in what can be considered a stressful time. Therefore, it appears that the reduction of opportunities for drinking with people outside of an individual's household has outweighed increases attributable to stress, particularly in young people and at least in the first month of social distancing. It appears that the decrease of availability of on-premise drinking locations remains an important strategy to prevent young adults' harmful drinking. This is in line with work on availability and alcohol-related harm both in Australia and internationally (23) .Overall, the shifts in AUDIT scores that we found were quite small. Scores on most of the scores in most demographic groups have not significantly shifted. Early studies such as this one are less likely to detect shifts in consumption than those that are administered later on in the pandemic -future work assessing this is recommended. However, of potential concern here is that there is a sub-group of individuals that have increased their alcohol consumption during this stressful time, and that this could continue even after social distancing measures are eased. We recommend that health care professionals working with people dealing with increased stress during the pandemic ask about alcohol consumption.Further, particular attention could be paid to middle-aged women in this regard.The most important limitation of the current study is the sampling strategy. A convenience sample has been recruited via advertising on Facebook and Instagram and as indicated by the differences in demographics between our sample and the NDSHS, is not representative of the Australian population. Instead the sample is two-thirds female, significantly older, and drink more heavily than the average Australian population (aged 18-65) recruited for the NDSHS. However, this study can provide important early indications of how alcohol consumption might be changing as a result of this pandemic. Furthermore, the analyses that account for demographic differences provide insight into how different groups of Australians might be reacting to the pandemic in respect to their alcohol consumption. In addition, respondents were asked to estimate their monthly consumption since social distancing, but also for the year previous -which may be susceptible to a difference in recall bias (24) and would presumably be less accurate than a study in which respondents could give their consumption at the two time points (24) . Finally, questions on the economic and labour related disruptions subsequent to the pandemic were not included in this study, future work on these factors and their impact on consumption are recommended.To conclude, we found early indications from a large convenience sample that, overall, from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic Australians may have decreased harmful drinking, particularly among young adults. This is despite a slight increase in quantity of consumption.As would be expected the closure of licensed premises has resulted in a decrease in harmful alcohol consumption in young adults in particular, however there is no reason to assume that these decreases will not reverse when licensed premises re-open. Based on these early estimates, reductions in short term harms from alcohol in Australia during social distancing should be expected. A potential issue to be aware of is that respondents may become accustomed to more frequent drinking in the home. Given that home drinking is thought to be habitual (25) , higher levels of consumption might be difficult to reverse when coronavirus restrictions begin to ease leading to more drinking opportunities which are associated with more risky drinking. Research monitoring how consumption patterns shift when licensed premises re-open is recommended. ","Australia","abstract","2020-10-02",10

There are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines (2) . As a result, there is an urgent need to investigate, identify and repurpose small molecules with potential antiviral effects (3) . To date the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhibitor, remdesivir, is the only antiviral drug that has been approved; it has been granted emergency use authorisation for the compassionate management of severe COVID-19 (4) .In addition to the spike glycoprotein, the coronavirus main protease (M pro ) is an important target for antiviral therapy (5) . The replicase gene of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (5) (6) (7) . M pro is the enzyme that is predominantly responsible for the proteolytic processing of these polyproteins into functional polypeptides (5) (6) (7) . Thus, M pro plays an important role in viral replication and infection (6) . There is a growing body of literature on lead compounds that could be used to target the M pro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2.This includes peptidomimetics, such as -ketoamide inhibitors (6, 8, 9) . Aside from synthetic ligands, researchers are also investigating the antiviral properties of natural compounds and dietary polyphenols have been of particular interest (5, (10) (11) (12) (13) .Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), which is the primary source of dietary fat within the Mediterranean diet, is rich in phenolic compounds (14) . The OliveNet TM library, which was previously created by our laboratory, is a curated database of 676 compounds from Olea europaea and 222 phenolic compounds are divided into 13 subclasses (15) . Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme have been made available on the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) and can be used for in silico screening (6, 9) . Utilising a combination of targeted molecular docking and blind docking, we aimed to identify 'hit' compounds from a selection of 300 ligands that could potentially inhibit M pro . This included 211 phenolic compounds and 13 fatty acids from our OliveNet TM library, known protease inhibitors, several antibiotics for comparison and the -ketoamide inhibitor as a control (15) . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were subsequently performed to evaluate the top three candidates and ultimately determine the lead compounds.The crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro was obtained from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7, 6Y2G, 6M03) (9, (16) (17) (18) . 300 compounds were selected for screening against M pro .. This comprised of 211 phenolic compounds and 13 fatty acids sourced from the OliveNet TM Library (15) , and an additional 76 ligands based on known protease inhibitors and antibiotics, as well as compounds with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, antimalarial, antioxidant and anti-ageing properties (8, 11, . A full list of the ligands that were screened can be found in the supplementary information (Table S1 ). Ligand structures were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PubChem database (44) , or drawn using Chem3D 19.0 (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) if they weren't available.Structure preparation and molecular docking was performed using the quantum-mechanicspolarised ligand docking (QPLD) protocol of the Schrödinger Suite (version 2018-1 and 2020-2) molecular modelling package (45-49) as previously described (50) . A 20 x 20 x 20 Å receptor grid was generated centred around active site residues Thr24, Thr25, His163, Pro168 and Gly143 (6) .Compounds were also docked to the active site of M pro using AutoDock Vina (51), following the processing of protein and ligand structures using PyRx (52) to generate their corresponding pdbqt files. The protein structure was assumed to be rigid, and rotatable torsions of the ligands were activated. A receptor grid with dimensions of 25 x 25 x 25 Å was generated around the same active site residues. Docking was performed with an exhaustiveness of 128.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Docking calculations were performed on a Windows 10 workstation equipped with an Intel Core i7 (2.90 GHz) and 8.00 GB of RAM.As the SARS-CoV-2 M pro is known to function as a homodimer (16) , this complex was assembled using the Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PDBePISA) server (53) for blind docking to identify potential binding sites. Structures were processed in PyRx, and docking performed AutoDock Vina (51) using a receptor grid encompassing the entire protein surface at an exhaustiveness of 128. For selected top binding compounds, blind docking was also performed at an exhaustiveness of 2000 using cloud computing services provided by Galileo (Hypernet Labs).Classical MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 2018.2 software (54, 55) with the CHARMM27 force field (56, 57) using docked ligands as starting structures as previously described (50) . Ligand topologies were generated using SwissParam (58) . For cyanidin-3-Oglucoside, Lennard-Jones parameters for the oxonium ion were assumed to be similar to those for the ether group (59) . Simulations were performed with a time-step of 2 fs in triplicate for 100 ns. To confirm inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro in vitro, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was performed. The BPL 3CL protease (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit (BPS Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), was used, and the assay performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The internal positive control was the broad-spectrum antiviral determinations) into account. The IC50 values for applicable test inhibitors (hypericin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and SRT2104), were also calculated.Identification of key compounds with relatively high affinity to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe -ketoamide ligand (13b) was previously identified by Zhang et al. to inhibit M pro with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.67 ± 0.18 M (9). As a result, this compound was used as a control. Each protomer of the M pro enzyme consists of three domains and the active site is located between domain I and domain II (6) . When docked to the substratebinding site of the crystal structure, the -ketoamide ligand formed hydrogen bonds with the protein residues and this included Glu166, His164 and Gln189. The inhibitor was predominantly surrounded by hydrophobic and polar residues including Cys145, Asn142, Tyr54, Thr190 and Pro168 ( Figure 1 ). The binding affinities of this compound were -65.7 and -7.7 kcal/mol in Schrödinger and AutoDock Vina, respectively. Our lab has also recently verified the interaction of the ketoamide inhibitor with the active site of M pro from SARS-CoV-2 (50).The control compound was positioned in a similar site as the co-crystallised ligand (N3) (6).Previously, it has been found that the negatively charged residue Glu166 plays an important role in forming the S1 pocket of the binding site (6) . The hydrophobic residue Cys145 is also involved in the mechanisms of action of N3 and the -ketoamide inhibitor (6, 9) . The Cys145 and His41 residues in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease form a catalytic dyad (6) . The M pro enzyme is a cysteine protease and the inhibitors specifically interact with Cys145 covalently (6, 9) . Covalent docking tools have been made available however, the success of this screening approach depends on a number of factors (65, 66) . This includes the contribution of noncovalent interactions and the mechanism of covalent bonding (65, 66) . In the current study, conventional docking methods were used and there is evidence to suggest that noncovalent docking is successful in elucidating the interactions that are occurring within protein-ligand complexes at the molecular level (67-69).Drug repositioning has become one of the most important strategies for combating and virtual screening approaches continue to play a major role in this (70) . With this in mind, 300 compounds were docked to the catalytic core of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzyme. Binding to the active site of the protomer using the QPLD protocol in Schrödinger yielded Glide energies ranging from -16.3 to -82.0 kcal/mol. All 300 compounds were predicted to bind using AutoDock Vina and the binding affinities ranged from -3.7 to -10.7 kcal/mol. When examining the effect of molecular weight of the small molecules and when comparing the binding affinities from both programs, the correlation coefficients were found to be approximately 0. In regards to the 211 phenolic compounds from the OliveNet TM database, it was evident that the flavonoid, glucoside and secoiridoid subclasses were binding strongly to the active site (Table S1 ). Conversely, the simple phenols, hydroxyphenylacetic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids and methoxyphenols had weaker binding affinities (Table S1 ). The biological activities of flavonoids have been extensively investigated over the years and there are studies that have examined the inhibitory activity of certain flavonoid compounds against the M pro enzyme of SARS-CoV. This includes luteolin, tetra-O-galloyl--D-glucose and baicalin to name a few (13, 72, 73) . Since being declared a pandemic, several papers that have assessed the ability of natural compounds to target SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been made available (74, 75) . In a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recent study conducted by Ul Qamar et al. in silico techniques were used to detect lead molecules from a medical plant library and they highlighted how their study may contribute to the development of natural antiviral agents in the future (76) . Although there are hurdles that are yet to be overcome, Thomford et al. emphasise that advancements in predictive computational methods have made it possible for the properties of natural products and their derivatives to be explored and for novel therapeutic moieties to be discovered (77) .Saquinavir and ritonavir were the protease inhibitors that were binding more strongly than the -ketoamide ligand, while nelfinavir had a similar Glide energy as the control compound. This is in accordance with a paper published by Pant et al., as their molecular docking analysis revealed that these three antivirals scored well and interacted with important residues (78) . In addition to the phenolic compounds from OliveNet TM and the protease inhibitors, some of the other top binding ligands included (-)-epicatechin gallate, remdesivir, D,L-sulforaphane glutathione, SRT2104, SRT1720, hypericin, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, baricitinib and baicalin.Based on this initial screen, 30 compounds were selected for further examination. To select the 30 compounds from the initial screen of the 300 compounds, a number of criteria were applied.Firstly, we selected compounds on the basis of binding affinity; compounds that were significantly below the positive controls, in this case, α-ketoamide 13b, were the first group to be eliminated. We then took into account compound availability. Given that we are trying to identify potential lead compounds for the current ongoing pandemic, it is important that the compounds are at least commercially available, thus allowing potential further investigation in vitro and in vivo. Many of our compounds would require synthesis and a complete evaluation of bioactivity before they can used in further experiments. Therefore, the more obscure lesswell characterized compounds were the next group to be eliminated. It should be noted that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the screening data obtained for these less well-studied compounds would still be useful, for potential structure activity-related studies, and for potential synthesis and evaluation at a more appropriate time. Compounds with relatively high binding affinity for the active site, that have been studied in animal models, and preferably in humans were the first to be selected for further evaluation. A description of these compounds and their binding affinities can be found in Table   1 . The structures of the ligands not found in the OliveNet TM database are provided in the supplementary information (Table S2 ).In order to narrow down the list and identify lead compounds, blind docking was conducted on To assess the stability of the ligands in complex with the main protease dimer, classical MD simulations were performed. Each system comprised of two ligands bound to the active sites on each protomer, as shown in Movies S1-4. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis in In contrast to hypericin and SRT2104, residue energy contributions for cyanidin-3-O-glucoside demonstrates large fluctuations across the entire protein, regardless of the protomer to which the ligand is bound. Energy peaks were nevertheless present at active site residues Ser1, Asp187, and Arg188. Peaks for Glu166 across both protomers were conversely favourable contributions. While more rigorous free energy methods may be required for further investigation, the dominating favourable energy contributions yield a strong ΔG of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside to the active site of M pro , which is observed to remain stable throughout the trajectory (Movie S4).Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside belongs to the flavonoid subclass and is classified as an anthocyanin (80) . In general, anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments and they are present in a variety of plants and fruits (80, 81) . Their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties have gained the attention of researchers and different methodologies are being trialled to assess how the bioavailability of these compounds could be increased (12, 82, 83) . Pour et al. have also published a comprehensive review on the antiviral properties of anthocyanins and emphasised the need for novel drugs to be rapidly developed (12) . We also identified the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activator SRT2104 as a potential hit ligand (84) .Furthermore, hypericin is a compound that is naturally found in the perennial plant Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) and its mechanisms of action require further elucidation (85) (86) (87) (88) .Hypericin is considered to be a potent photosensitising agent and its potential use in cancer therapy has been investigated (88) . The antidepressant effects of St. John's wort have also been reported in the literature (86) . Likewise, the protective properties of hypericin against J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f enveloped and non-enveloped viruses have been explored and previous studies have focused on hepatitis C, infectious bronchitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) . It is important to note that drug-drug interactions have been described for hypericin and medications such as HIV protease inhibitors (95, 96) . Therefore, it is imperative that the pharmacokinetics of these compounds are taken into consideration. Hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were consequently identified as the lead dietary compounds in this study and this is also consistent with a recently published paper by Islam et al (97) .To confirm potential inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, we performed an ELISA using a commercially available 3CL protease (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit. The IC50 for the GC376 positive antiviral control used in this ELISA has been calculated to be 0.46 µM (as provided the kit supplier; BPS Bioscience). Our findings indicate that hypericin results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of M pro activity, with an IC50 value calculated to be 63.6 ± 5.7 µM ( Figure 6 and Table 2 Table 2 ). Notably, IC50 values for SRT1720, resveratrol and L-sulforaphane could not be determined (up to 128 µM, Table 2 ), consistent with the lower binding energies observed for these compounds in the in silico work (Table S1) . Similarly, the percentage protease inhibition at 50 µM GC376 was determined to be 97.9 ± 1.8% in our experiments (n = 9 determinations, Figure 6 ).

This has been identified to be Coronavirus Disease 2019 , caused by a new type of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The coronavirus quickly spread across people living in or having visited Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission was soon confirmed [1] . Figure 1 shows the outburst of COVID-19 in early days at the beginning in China, based on data taken from the past daily statements of National Health Commission, China [2] . According to Wu and McGoogan [3] , 81% Chinese patients with COVID-19 had mild symptoms, 14% had severe symptoms, and 5% were critically ill. Since then, the virus has been spreading rapidly and caused a pandemic across the world. As of 20 October 2020, it has been diagnosed in >40.3 million people globally, causing >1.1 million deaths. We studied the characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza, in terms of virology, etiology, epidemiology and virulence. Prevention and control strategies are analyzed and discussed in the following text. After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), COVID-19 is the seventh known member of the family of coronaviruses that are pathogenic to humans. The rest of the seven members (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) have been associated with mild clinical symptoms [4] . SARS-CoV emerged in China in November 2002, and resulted in more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries [5, 6] . MERS-CoV was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and was responsible for 2494 confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities, including 38 deaths following a single imported case into South Korea [7] [8] [9] . SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession MN908947) is a beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) of group 2B, and has been found to have the highest similarity (89%) to a SARS-related member of the Sarbecoviruses (GenBank accession MG772933), a subgenus within the β-CoV genus [10, 11] .Early patient data from Wuhan in China has shown similarities of clinical features between COVID-19 and previous β-CoV infections. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, patients have exhibited symptoms of viral pneumonia including fever, cough, difficulty breathing and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans [12] . However, the virulence of COVID-19 is far less than that of SARS, with Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 0.72% according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), Update 9 April (https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19case-fatality-rates/), whereas the case fatality rate is around 10% for SARS [13] and 37% for MERS [14] .Similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou in China, the initial COVID-19 outbreak was tentatively associated with a wet markets [1, 15] , suggesting that the virus originated from wildlife animals sold in the market [16] . However, a later The Lancet report claimed 13 of the 41 first reported patients with no epidemiological link to the marketplace [12] . The virus may have spread silently in Wuhan before the discovery of the cases, during its incubation period [17, 18] .All three aforementioned viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2) are believed to have natural hosts in bats [19, 20] . It is most likely that they are able to invade the human world only after a genetic mutation in an intermediate host animal. The intermediate hosts for SARS and MERS are civets [21] and camels [22] , respectively. Determining the intermediate host is crucial to our future efforts to prevent the return of coronavirus diseases. Unfortunately, scientists have only been able to detect the virus in the market environment, but not in time to collect wildlife samples before the market was shut down [16] . There had been various candidates proposed, such as Malayan Pangolins [23, 24] , but most of them have been discredited [25, 26] . In the meantime, the scientific community should be vigilant about the possibility of return of another coronavirus in another one or two decades [27] .During the previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS, human to human transmission was efficient through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar [28] .In terms of transmissibility, we previously estimated the reproduction number R 0 provided by eight different research groups, and found most of the R 0 value to lie in the range between 2 and 3 [1] . Back in January, Wu et al. published a comprehensive model for predicting the future spread of COVID-19 in The Lancet and estimated R 0 to be around 2.68 [29] . Most recently, based on 16 published estimates, the estimate R 0 (95% CI) by CEBM is 2.65 (1.97, 3.09) (14 April 2020, https://www.cebm.net/ covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/). This R 0 estimation is similar to or slightly less than that of SARS (around 3) [30] and larger than MERS, which is less than one [31] . To explain its transmissibility, we investigated RNA sequencing transcriptome profiling of human samples of airway and oral mucosa, and the expression pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the viral priming protease, TMPRSS2. We observed that ACE2 had medium levels of expression in both small airway epithelium and masticatory mucosa, and high levels of expression in nasal epithelium, and TMPRSS2 was highly expressed in small airway epithelium and nasal epithelium. These findings provided the molecular basis that the nasal mucosa is the most susceptible locus in the respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 infection [32] . In addition, the lack of effective immune responses to eliminate the infection also contribute to the high transmissibility, e.g., IgA responses to clear respiratory tract infection may be harmful in COVID-19 as shown by our recent study [33] .While SARS-CoV-2 is similar in transmissibility compared to SARS, it is much less virulent than SARS. Why, then, has the number of confirmed cases of the disease greatly surpassed SARS and continued to increase as a pandemic? There has been a variety of potential epidemiological reasons:(1) The occult nature of SARS-COV-2. SARS-COV-2 is not as virulent as SARS, and produces a large number of patients asymptomatic or with mild symptoms [34] . According to the study on passengers on board the Diamond Princess Cruises' ship, 50.5% of infected individuals were asymptomatic [35] . Similarly,~60% infected sailors on the U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt were asymptomatic. Compared with SARS patients, asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 are likely not to go to hospitals for testing for COVID-19. In US, people with mild illness are not suggested to do testing. Even if they do the testing, false-negative has been an issue to identify the cases [36] . At the same time, the incubation period of COVID-19 is longer than SARS, generally between 2-16 days (the 5th and 95th percentiles) [28, 37] . Furthermore, a risk of pre-symptomatic transmission was also suggested by Rothe and colleagues for the symptomatic patients [38] , although this finding has been met with criticisms [39] . Because of these reasons, a large number of SARS-COV-2 infected people has not been identified in time and quarantined, which enabled the wide spread of transmission. SARS on the other hand, exhibits serious illness, resulting in a lower chance of misreporting.(2) Detection, publishing, and warning measures lagged far behind in the early stages of the outbreak, which gave time for the virus to spread. As a result, before the large-scale national prevention and control measures in China were implemented, especially before the closure of Wuhan city, a large number of patients had been accumulated in the Wuhan area. The Lancet paper on 31 January estimates that as of 25 January, there were more than 75,000 patients in Wuhan alone [29] . After the Wuhan city was closed down, a few governments evacuated their citizens and performed thorough medical examination for each individual brought back. The authors searched available information on Wuhan evacuation released by governments of different countries on the public domain. Table 1 lists the citizens evacuated by each country in the last January and early February. Evacuation can be thought of as a random sampling of the population of the Wuhan area (11 million in total), and the prevalence rate is close to what the Lancet paper suggested. In other words, the infection rate in the Wuhan area may have reached one percent, or 110,000 people up to early February 2020. Those undiagnosed patients exacerbated the spread of the transmission of COVID-19. . Around January each year, a huge amount of population would leave major cities and travel back to their respective hometown to celebrate Chinese New Year, and come back around February. The total number of Chinese passengers were estimated to be 2.91 billion Person-Times in 2016. This is known as the Chunyun period, or Spring Festival travel season. The COVID-19 outbreak happened in late December and early January, albeit the low number of confirmed cases due to lack of detection. Before Wuhan closed its city, 5 million people had already left Wuhan during the Chunyun period [50] , which hindered any containment effort. At the same time, socio-economic globalization promoted the spread the COVID-19 across the world [51] . SARS on the other hand, although detected in 2002, the real outbreak did not happen until March 2003. The Chunyun period had by then ended, and the containment efforts were thus more effective.It was learned from the SARS outbreak-which started as animal-to-human transmission during the first phase of the epidemic-that all game meat trades should be optimally regulated to terminate this portal of transmission, to prevent the outbreak of another coronavirus pandemic [52] .For COVID-19, global experts and governments have been actively tracking the spread and virulence of the virus, and to provide advices to individuals on measures to protect health and prevent the spread of new outbreak. In response to the spreading virus, isolation strategy has been used. Many Chinese cities including Wuhan had been put on quarantine since 23 January 2020, and many countries have closed their boarder to people travelled internationally [1] .Since the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic, to systematically organize countries to combat COVID-19, WHO has developed a ""global strategic preparedness and response plan"" to support all countries to prepare for and respond to the outbreak. The goal is to stop further transmission of COVID-19 within China and to other countries, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak in all countries. They have outlined a list of public health measures, including rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness raising in the population, risk communication [28] . With the development of pandemic, stay-at-home orders have been issued in many countries, which have contributed significantly to contain the speed of transmission of COVID-19, thus to avoid straining medical resources.The understanding of the spread and features of the virus is still updating rapidly, but that does not prevent us from starting to think further about the problem of the future pandemic of new coronavirus and preparing plans for it, through international cooperation.Effectively and comprehensively isolating patients and their close contacts, cutting off their path to continuing transmission, and waiting for the incubation period to pass, was a very effective measure to eliminate SARS in a short period of time. This strategy may work on several premises:The total number of patients was small. Therefore, the administration was able to find and quarantine the close contacts of each patient; 2.Once becomes onset, the symptoms were obvious, critical and typical. Patients were quickly identified and treated; 3.There was no transmission capability during incubation period.COVID-19 however, does not satisfy these preconditions. Having a huge number of patients, as well as a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients, and highly infectious occult infection, has greatly increased the difficulty of prevention and control. We will not be able to identify every patient that exhibits mild symptoms for quarantine purpose, nor to put all their close contacts under isolation and observation.On the other hand, COVID-19 shares many similar characteristics of influenza. Here are the features of the seasonal flu, which kills 646,000 people worldwide each year [53] : it has low virulence, with case fatality rate of about 0.1% [54] ; its reproduction number R0 is around 1.3, which is less than SARS [55] ; the number of cases is much larger however, while about 10% of unvaccinated adults are infected each year; although influenza virus usually has a short incubation period of between 1-4 days, transmission can occur within the incubation period [56] ; flu symptoms are less distinct, with fever, cough, sore throat and other symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from other respiratory diseases prevalent in autumn and winter. Table 2 below compares different characteristics of the three coronaviruses, as well as influenza. Although COVID-19 is more similar to SARS in virology and etiology, its epidemiological impacts are less like SARS but more like a ""mega flu"". This could mean we may take historical experiences from the fight against influenza cautiously. However, we need to keep in mind not to downplay the complexity and severity of COVID-19. The majority of human population have some extent of immunity to influenza virus by natural exposure and/or vaccination. In addition, there are antivirals clinically approved for threating influenza. On the other hand, there is no effective antivirals for threating COVID-19. According to the most recent clinical trial by the WHO Solidarity trial consortium, Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens showed little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19 [57] .Closing schools during flu outbreaks has been shown to be an effective measure [58, 59] . However, when to shut down and how long to shut down are still indicators that need to be carefully considered [60] . Two studies from Australia and Japan showed that monitoring body temperature at airports was not effective in reducing the spread of the disease during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic [61, 62] . A similar question to consider is how much effort we need to put into monitoring passengers' temperatures in this outbreak, given that the incubation period for COVID-19 is much longer than for influenza and the large proportion of asymptomatic patients.Vaccines are the first choice against a pandemic of this magnitude. According to U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies from year to year, but overall it reduces the risk by 40 to 50 percent [63] . Vaccines need to go through many phases of development. The lead time to produce a vaccine lot ranges from several months (e.g., influenza vaccine) to three years [64] . Thanks to the rapid publication of the COVID-19 genetic sequence, a number of biopharmaceutical firms and academic research facilities around the world have launched programs and are racing to find an effective vaccine. Many are aiming to break the vaccine development record time [65] . As of 16 October, there were 11 vaccines under phase 3 trial [66] , each falls into one of three categories [67] . The first category is inactivated vaccine. It is the most traditional and sophisticated method of preparing a vaccine by growing the virus and then injecting it with a ""killed"" virus. Second, non-replicating viral vectors. It is the non-toxic adenovirus as a carrier, into the protein gene, and then injected into the body. The third category is RNA-based vaccine. Since vaccine development is not always effective, and the effectiveness will ultimately depend on trial data, the simultaneous development and implementation of multiple routes is expected to eventually increase the success rate of the vaccine.""Hierarchical management"" of influenza takes into account the fact that when influenza is endemic, outbreaks in different parts of the world vary from region to region, and the severity of illness varies from patient to patient. Cities with clusters of cases may take more drastic measures, from canceling public gatherings to closing schools and workplaces, while areas with fewer cases can adapt to local conditions. Patients with serious illness are given intensive treatment in hospitals, while most patients with mild symptoms can seek treatment in small clinics or even wait for the disease to self-heal.This strategy can certainly be translated to fight against COVID-19. During a full-scale pandemic, especially in underdeveloped regions as seen in the city of Wuhan, there will not be enough medical resources to attend every patient [68] . Medical needs should be given out to those with more severe symptoms or with high risk of fatal complications. The treatment of the large number of patients with mild symptoms can be home-based. What Wuhan was doing was to create makeshift hospitals using empty facilities such as sports stadium and exhibition halls [69] , although how to avoid cross secondary infection has been a challenge. Patients with less severe symptoms in Wuhan were gathered and assigned a bed and facemasks in the makeshift hospital, and less medical resource was needed for each patient in this way.What China has done was very different from the strategy taken by other countries. Looking back the management in China, the distribution of the disease was centered in Wuhan city, Hubei province (see Figure 2 to help understanding the strategy taken by China) and its surrounding cities, while cases in other cities were mainly imported. It has taken a long time and very harsh prevention and control measures until the outbreak in Wuhan was effectively controlled. In other areas however, the situation has been largely controlled in a few weeks, due to the isolation strategy in China after 23 January 2020. Within 14 days after the closure of Wuhan in Hubei Province, potential patients in other cities would have already developed clinical symptoms, with high probability of being quarantined and treated. At that point, it may be more important to consider putting the society back into normal operation and function as soon as possible, to avoid further damage to people's life as well as the economy. We might consider exercising specific disease control and management in different regions across the world, instead of a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. Governments around the world are doing their best in combatting and hopefully eradicating COVID-19, but we still need to be prepared for a long-term epidemic. The development of COVID-19 is closer to a ""mega flu"" that is more difficult to eradicate. That brings a possibility that this virus, like the flu, will persist in the human world for a long time to come, until the success of effective vaccine, or herd immunity achieved until large proportion of human population has been infected [71] . Currently, humans are still at a loss for influenza viruses that are less transmissible than COVID-19, and given the early accumulation of cases in the Wuhan area, it may be necessary to start embracing the possibility of long-term co-existence with COVID-19. In the meantime, the emergence of a more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2 with the mutation Spike D614G, which began spreading in Europe in early February, has been reported [72] .Many of the methods of prevention and control in China have been similar to wartime measures, such as rapid construction of new hospitals, extensive restrictions on the movement of people, delaying the start of school, high levels of martial law in communities, banning outsiders, and quarantining the residents of a building if a patient was found. Putting other considerations such as civil liberties aside, the extreme measures have achieved success in dealing with the pandemic, and China is becoming the first major economy to recover from the pandemic. However, the same policies and procedures cannot easily be replicated in western democratic systems. Other government should focus on developments towards more universal, milder measures for the control of new burst of COVID-19, such as public education, social distancing, rapid response mechanisms, tiered management, and regular disinfection of public appliances, etc.In our opinion, the media around the world is doing an excellent job in covering all aspects of COVID-19, and raising public awareness, however, this exerts enormous pressure on governments to make over-drastic policies [73] . Instead of proper alarm, the media portrait of a ""deadly/killer virus"" may cause panic and can harm efforts to implement a cost-effective and safe infection control strategy [74] . It may be time for the media and education to start adjusting their tone to reduce unnecessary panic. Instead, the emphasis should move towards the popularization of public health, such as wearing masks when sick, washing hands frequently, coughing and sneezing etiquette, etc.After SARS was contained through extraordinary efforts, much of the research and drug development related to SARS stopped because of lack of funding and market prospects. A simple bibliometric analysis from PubMed databases, using ""SARS"" as a search term, reveals around 800 articles in 2003, which dropped to 27 in 2019. Given that the new coronavirus invades the human body in a similar way to SARS, if many of the previous studies had persisted, we might have been better prepared scientifically and medically for the new coronavirus. Perhaps we should learn from this lesson and rethink whether our entire scientific system is paying enough attention to re-emerging coronavirus diseases.Through consolidating foreign citizen evacuation data, the early prevalence rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan population is found to be around one percent, or 110,000 infected people, which suggests that a large number of infected people have been neglected because of asymptomatic or mildly ill. It also explains the outburst of COVID-19 across the world after it has been contained in China. A large number of infected people in the origin city, plus the highly infectious and occult nature of COVID-19, made COVID-19 difficult to eradicate. The virulence and transmissibility of the new virus are somehow close to that of the influenza, and it would not be entirely unacceptable to tolerate some persistence. We need to contemplate the possibility of long-term co-existence with COVID-19, rather than allowing overly drastic measures to affect our normal lives and the normal social-economic activities of a country. It is worth emphasizing that the possibility of long-term co-existence with COVID-19 may not be as scary as it sounds. A recent study showed that the median infection fatality rate was 0.27% [75] for SARS-CoV-2, which is close to the approximate fatality rate of the flu of 0.1%. It is possible that over time with more general immunity in the population, the ultimate severity and mortality between the two viruses will be similar. While having a new pandemic flu-like pneumonia that occasionally flares-up is not a future anyone wants to be in, and indeed the pandemic so far has already caused massive damage to nations worldwide, it should not be a cause for social collapse.These conclusions are based on our current knowledge of the new coronavirus and COVID-19, which may change, as may the virus and the disease itself. We need to be very cautious in the face of an enemy we have never seen before. ","Australia","first author","2020-10-29",10

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors inhibit proximal tubular glucose reabsorption, leading to glycosuria [3] . These drugs have important cardiovascular and renal benefits [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , leading one expert to refer to SGLT2 inhibitors as ""cardiorenal risk reducing agents that have glucose lowering as a side effect"" [10] . Furthermore, the cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be largely independent of their glycaemic effects [9, [11] [12] [13] . This point is pertinent to the use of these drugs in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD where glycosuria secondary to SGLT2 inhibition is reduced, resulting in potentially limited anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy [14] [15] [16] [17] . Indeed, in two heart failure trials (DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced) and a CKD trial (DAPA-CKD) where the primary endpoint was met, the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor on the primary outcome was consistent in participants irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes [9, 18, 19] . There are a multitude of proposed mechanisms for the cardioprotective properties of SGLT2 inhibitors, including natriuresis and osmotic diuresis, inhibition of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger in the myocardium, potential use of ketone bodies for cardiac metabolism, and reduced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation [20] . These results suggest that the benefits may be independent of effects on glycaemia. Given the use of these drugs by not only endocrinologists and primary care physicians, but also nephrologists and cardiologists, clinicians need to become familiar with the physiology, efficacy, and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors [10, 21, 22] . Indeed, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a number of adverse effects, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is potentially life-threatening. Furthermore, adverse effects can occur very quickly. There have been many reviews exploring the efficacy of these agents in different population groups. Hence, this article examines the potential safety issues associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on the safety of these drugs in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. We highlight measures that clinicians can implement to minimise the risk of adverse effects, including DKA, which is of particular relevance during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic.The cardiovascular, renal and heart failure outcome trials to date have differed with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) cut-offs [4, 6-9, 18, 23, 24] . Importantly, there is limited available data specifically about SGLT2 inhibitor use in patients with severe CKD. Subgroup analyses from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials found similar adverse event profiles with respect to specific SGLT2 inhibitors among participants with different baseline eGFR levels (Table 1 ) [25] [26] [27] . In a subgroup analysis of the CREDENCE trial, severe adverse events were consistent among screening eGFR categories. There was a significant interaction test for volume depletion, with a higher risk with canagliflozin apparent in participants with screening eGFR 30 to < 45, but not eGFRs 45 to < 60 or 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Table 1 ) [28] . Of note, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin exposure increases with advancing renal impairment; however, the area under the concentration-time curve does not exceed by twofold that reported in subjects with normal renal function [14] [15] [16] [17] . Canagliflozin is the only one of these four SGLT2 inhibitors for which use of the lower dose (100 mg once daily) is recommended for patients with renal impairment (specifically eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [29] . However, in Australia, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and ertugliflozin are contraindicated in patients with eGFR persistently < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , largely due to limited anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy [30] [31] [32] . Diabetes, particularly with poor control and glycosuria, is a known risk factor for genital infection [33] . Diabetes may suppress the immune response to infection [34] . Glucose present on the genitalia due to SGLT2 inhibition is believed to aid growth and adherence of yeast and impair the local immune response [35] . A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two large population-based studies have demonstrated an approximate threefold increase in risk of genital infection with SGLT2 inhibitor use compared with placebo or other diabetes drug classes [36] [37] [38] . In the CREDENCE trial, the event rate for genital mycotic infection in the canagliflozin versus placebo groups for females was 12.6 versus 6.1 per 1000 person-years, and for men, 8.4 versus 0.9 per 1000 person-years [8] . A study of two large cohorts of commercially insured patients in the United States found that the elevated risk of genital infections was apparent within the first month of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment and remained elevated during the course of treatment [37] . Furthermore, the risk of genital infections with SGLT2 inhibitor use was greater in the subgroup of patients aged 60 years and over. History of prior genital infection (especially recent history) is a clear risk factor for the development of genital infection during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment [39] . Toyama et al. conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and found an approximate threefold increase in the risk of genital infections [40] . This suggests that the increase in the risk of genital infections in patients with CKD is similar to that in the non-CKD population. Most genital infections are mild to moderate in severity and are responsive to topical antifungals or a single dose of fluconazole [41, 42] . These infections do not necessitate cessation of the agent [42] . Clinicians should recommend good perineal hygiene to patients [43] . In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about the risk of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene) with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment [44] . There were 55 cases of Fournier's gangrene requiring surgical debridement associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between March 2013 and January 2019 [45] . All patients were severely ill, at least 25 patients needed more than one surgery, and three patients died. A number of patients had complicating DKA, sepsis, and/or acute kidney injury (AKI). The time between initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and infection was variable-5 days to 49 months. Large RCTs have not demonstrated an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, one patient in the dapagliflozin group compared with five patients in the placebo group experienced Fournier's gangrene [7] . However, RCTs are not designed or powered to demonstrate or refute an increased risk of extremely rare events such as Fournier's gangrene. The documented case reports submitted to regulatory and surveillance agencies need to be carefully considered.In 2015, the FDA issued a warning about the risk of serious urinary tract infections (UTIs) with SGLT2 inhibitor use due to 19 cases of urosepsis and pyelonephritis reported over an 18-month period [46] . In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors have generally not been associated with an elevated risk of UTIs in large meta-analyses and population-based studies [36, 38, 47, 48] . One of the four cardiovascular outcome trials to date, however, has demonstrated a significant increase in risk of UTIs with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy; in the VERTIS CV trial approximately 12% versus 10% of participants randomised to ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively, experienced a UTI [49] . In the CREDENCE trial, there was no significant difference in the rate of UTIs between the canagliflozin and placebo groups [8] . The exact rate of pyelonephritis and urosepsis was not reported. Whether there are differences in the risk of UTI based on the type of SGLT2 inhibitor is yet to be established. With respect to why SGLT2 inhibition may not increase the risk of UTIs despite causing glycosuria, Fralick and MacFadden have hypothesised that diuresis and polyuria secondary to SGLT2 inhibition counters potential bacterial growth due to glycosuria and/or prevents bacterial ascension of the urinary tract [35] . Severe CKD may lead to reduced urine output, and glycosuria secondary to SGLT2 inhibition is reduced [14] [15] [16] [17] . The influence of these factors on the risk of UTIs is uncertain as data regarding SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and < 15 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 or requiring dialysis, respectively) are limited. Also unclear is the risk of UTIs in higher-risk populations such as people with urinary tract structural or functional abnormalities or people who are immunosuppressed. With regard to post-transplant diabetes mellitus in renal transplant recipients, in one RCT (n = 49 patients), which compared empagliflozin or placebo treatment for 24 weeks, three patients in both the empagliflozin and placebo groups experienced a UTI [50] . However, two patients in the empagliflozin group had to discontinue treatment-one because of urosepsis and one because of repeated UTIs. The patient who experienced urosepsis had a history of recurrent UTIs, and clinicians should be cautious when considering prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with a history of recurrent UTIs.Given the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, these agents are not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia [4, 6, 7, 51] . These drugs lower plasma glucose by inducing glycosuria, resulting in a reduction in plasma insulin concentration and an increase in plasma glucagon concentration, leading to an increase in endogenous glucose production [51, 52] . The absence of hypoglycaemia risk was clearly seen in the DAPA-HF trial, where 55% of patients did not have diabetes [9] . However, if a patient is prescribed insulin and/or a sulfonylurea, the doses of these medications may need to be reduced, as SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.6-0.9% (Table 2 ) [53] . With regard to adjusting concomitant diabetes medications in patients with moderate to severe CKD, clinicians should note that SGLT2 inhibitors have limited anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy, due to reduced glycosuria [54] .In 2015/2016, the FDA issued a warning about the risk of AKI with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin based on 101 cases over an approximate 2.5-year period, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis [55] . In approximately half of the cases, AKI occurred within 1 month of SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. CREDENCE and the cardiovascular outcome trials have clearly demonstrated the important renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors [8, 56, 57] . In CREDENCE and the cardiovascular outcome trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program, and DECLARE-TIMI 58), there was a 25% lower risk of AKI with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment compared with placebo [57] . There is often a mild acute decrease in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation that is reversible on treatment cessation-the reduction in the CRE-DENCE trial at 3 weeks was −3.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [8, 58] . In the trial, the mean change in eGFR slope was lower in the canagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (−3.19 vs −4.71 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year) [8] . The mild reduction in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation does not represent AKI. This effect is thought to be due to increased tubular sodium delivery to the macula densa activating tubuloglomerular feedback, resulting in afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which is protective in the long-term because of the reduction in intraglomerular pressure [58] . This theory is partly based on data in young adults with type 1 diabetes and hyperfiltration [59] . However, the recent Renoprotective Effects of Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes trial questioned this theory [60] . In patients with type 2 diabetes without overt nephropathy, 12 weeks of dapagliflozin reduced GFR, filtration fraction, and intraglomerular pressure without increasing renal vascular resistance-suggesting that the acute eGFR decline is due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation rather than afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction [60, 61] . In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, the acute dip in eGFR with empagliflozin treatment was greater in users of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or any diuretic compared with nonusers [62] . However, in users of these medications, adding empagliflozin did not increase the risk of AKI compared with adding placebo [62] .SGLT2 inhibitors should not be initiated in patients who are hypovolaemic and/or hypotensive, because this could contribute to AKI. Further, patients prescribed loop and/or thiazide diuretics may need dose reduction of these medications to prevent volume depletion (Table 2) [63, 64] . Patients should be instructed when acutely unwell (for example, vomiting, diarrhoea, and reduced oral intake) to withhold their SGLT2 inhibitor (part of a sick day management plan) [43] .There has been a recent reported case of AKI secondary to osmotic nephrosis attributed to recent prescription Consider reducing dose of diuretic if systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg. If evidence of dehydration based on fluid balance assessment, recommend reducing dose or stopping diuretic and only starting SGLT2 inhibitor when dehydration resolved of canagliflozin, postulated to be due to increased tubular osmotic pressure secondary to glucose reabsorption inhibition [65] . The authors of this report recommend consideration of a kidney biopsy in cases of prolonged AKI despite SGLT2 inhibitor discontinuation. Furthermore, the issue of possible hypoxic medullary injury secondary to SGLT2 inhibition, due to increased distal natriuresis augmenting transport workload in the medulla and oxygen consumption, has been raised by Heyman et al. [66] . These authors caution against concomitant administration of agents that could worsen medullary hypoxia, and recommend cessation of SGLT2 inhibitors prior to radiocontrast studies.DKA is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy [67, 68] , estimated to occur in approximately one in 1000 SGLT2 users who have type 2 diabetes (although the precise incidence is unknown) [69] . The event rate of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA in the CREDENCE trial was higher compared with the cardiovascular outcome trials (2.2 vs < 1 event per 1000 patient-years) [8, 56] . This may be, at least in part, related to the higher use of insulin at baseline in CREDENCE; all except one of the 12 patients in CREDENCE who developed DKA had concomitant insulin treatment [4, [6] [7] [8] . In contrast, there were no reported DKA events in patients randomised to dapagliflozin in the DAPA-CKD trial; however, this trial included patients with and without diabetes [19] . The higher risk of DKA in insulin-treated patients is pertinent to nephrologists as patients with advanced CKD have relatively limited therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA is commonly referred to as ""euglycaemic"" DKA as the degree of hyperglycaemia is often lower than expected due to glycosuria [70] . However, in a review of 105 cases of SGLT2 inhibitorassociated DKA, 35% of cases had an admission plasma glucose concentration < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) [71] .A more precise term for this adverse effect is ""DKA with lower-than-anticipated glucose levels"", as recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology [70] . The duration of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment prior to the onset of DKA is highly variable (0.3-420 days) [69, 71] . With regard to the pathophysiology of DKA, SGLT2 inhibitor use leads to a reduction in plasma insulin concentration and an increase in plasma glucagon concentration [52] . Additionally, free fatty acid suppression post-meal is impaired [52] . This decrease in the insulin-to-glucagon ratio and increase in free fatty acids promotes ketogenesis [52, 72] . SGLT2 inhibitor treatment increases plasma ketone levels, and an elevated ketone level does not necessarily indicate DKA [72] [73] [74] [75] . SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA most frequently occurs in patients with one or more additional risk factor(s) for insulin deficiency and/or ketogenesis (Table 3 ) [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . In a recent Australian retrospective cohort study of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA cases, 22% of patients with presumed type 2 diabetes were subsequently diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes [69] . Fourteen of 37 cases of DKA related to SGLT2 inhibition occurred during hospital admission. Eleven of the 14 patients were fasting due to surgery, and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy was continued during admission in six of these cases. Eleven of the 14 inpatients were on insulin treatment prior to hospitalisation, and insulin was generally ceased prior to the onset of DKA. These findings highlight the need to employ specific strategies to reduce the risk of DKA, including educating patients to temporarily withhold their SGLT2 inhibitor when acutely unwell with reduced oral intake (Table 4) [67, 70, 71] .Treatment of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA involves rehydration and an insulin-dextrose infusion [70] . A higher rate of intravenous dextrose (10-20%) is often needed to enable sufficient dosage of insulin for resolution of ketoacidosis [67] . An endocrinologist should be involved in the management of DKA and decisions regarding subsequent diabetes pharmacotherapy. The CANVAS Program is the only cardiovascular outcome trial that has shown an increased risk of lower limb amputation with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy compared with placebo [6, 7, 76] . Approximately six versus three participants per 1000 person-years in the canagliflozin versus placebo groups experienced lower limb amputation; 71% of amputations occurred at the level of the toe or metatarsal [6] . Multivariate modelling revealed a number of baseline characteristics that were significantly associated with amputation during followup, including male sex, prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, albuminuria, and higher HbA1c [77] . However, the effect of canagliflozin on amputation risk did not vary according to any baseline characteristic or dose of canagliflozin (100 or 300 mg daily) [77] . Interestingly, there was no difference in the risk of amputation between the canagliflozin and placebo groups in the CREDENCE trial [8] . During the CREDENCE trial, there was a protocol amendment asking investigators to examine patients' feet and temporarily withhold the study drug if there was any active condition present that might lead to amputation [8] .A cohort study using nationwide health and administrative registers in Sweden and Denmark found that compared with new users of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, new users of SGLT2 inhibitors had an increased risk of lower limb amputation (incidence rate 2.7 vs 1.1 events per 1000 person-years, hazard ratio 2.3) [48] . Ninety-nine per cent of SGLT2 inhibitor users were taking dapagliflozin (61%) or empagliflozin (38%). These results contrast with safety results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and DAPA-HF trials [7, 9, 76] .In summary, whether there is a definite increase in risk of lower limb amputation with canagliflozin treatment is unclear. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying such a potential adverse effect are unknown. Postulated mechanisms include volume depletion secondary to diuresis, and an effect on calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D metabolism that may impair foot ulcer healing [78, 79] . Based on available evidence to date, we recommend that clinicians provide education to patients about preventive foot care and perform regular foot screening, as well as avoiding canagliflozin in patients with an acute heightened risk of amputation (as per the CREDENCE protocol-history of amputation within past 12 months, active ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, or critical leg ischaemia within 6 months) [8] .Blau et al. examined the acute effect of canagliflozin on mineral metabolism in healthy adults [80] . Subjects received canagliflozin 300 mg daily or placebo for 5 days, and later crossed over to the other treatment. Canagliflozin administration rapidly increased serum phosphorus, corresponding to an increase in urinary phosphorus reabsorption. Additionally, canagliflozin treatment increased plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The differences in mean serum phosphorus and plasma FGF23 between the canagliflozin and placebo groups were no longer significant by day 5. In contrast, differences in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH were still significant at this time point. There was no significant difference in serum calcium, but there was a significant decrease in urinary calcium excretion on day 4. de Jong et al. performed a post hoc analysis of the IMPROVE trial, a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial involving dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric CKD (eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [81] . Compared with the start of treatment, 6 weeks of dapagliflozin increased serum phosphorus (+ 11%), PTH (+ 15%), and FGF23 (+ 20%) and decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (− 19%). Importantly, these changes did not correlate with change in eGFR. The increase in serum phosphorus with SGLT2 inhibition is believed to be due to increased sodium in the proximal tubule driving sodiumdependent phosphate reabsorption [82] . This is postulated to increase FGF23, which decreases 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leading to an increase in PTH [80, 83] . In the study by Blau et al., the increase in serum phosphorus correlated with urinary sodium excretion, but not urinary glucose excretion [80] . In severe CKD, the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on urinary glucose and presumably also urinary sodium excretion are attenuated, perhaps resulting in a less marked effect Careful prescription of an SGLT2 inhibitor in light of a patient's risk factors for DKA (see Table 1 ) Reducing a patient's insulin dose cautiously when commencing an SGLT2 inhibitor, as excessive insulin dose reduction or cessation of insulin therapy can contribute to the risk of DKA Informing patients about the risk of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA, including when to withhold an SGLT2 inhibitor, including acute illness with reduced oral intake (part of a sick day management plan), symptoms of DKA (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, rapid breathing), and the need to seek medical attention if symptoms occur (provision of written information is recommended) Cessation of an SGLT2 inhibitor ≥ 3 days prior to an operation and only recommencing therapy when a patient is eating and drinking normally on serum phosphorus. However, more data are needed with regard to patients with stage 4 CKD, where control of hyperphosphataemia can be difficult.Changes to mineral metabolism secondary to SGLT2 inhibition may be relevant to the heightened risk of fracture evident in the CANVAS Program (15.4 vs 11.9 participants with fracture randomised to canagliflozin vs placebo per 1000 patient-years) [6] , although this is the only very large RCT to date with a fracture safety signal. Meta-analyses of RCTs of SGLT2 inhibitors have not demonstrated an increased risk of fractures compared with placebo [84, 85] . The increased risk of fracture with canagliflozin was only seen in one of the two trials that compose the CANVAS Program (CANVAS, not CANVAS-R). Furthermore, there was no difference in risk of fracture between the canagliflozin and placebo groups in CREDENCE [8] . The mean follow-up was longer in CANVAS compared with CAN-VAS-R (5.7 vs 2.1 years). The median follow-up of CRE-DENCE was 2.6 years. Interestingly, in a fracture analysis of CANVAS, there was no difference between canagliflozin-treated patients with or without fractures with respect to post-randomisation per cent changes from baseline in serum phosphate [86] . There was a similar fracture incidence in the canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg groups. A possible relationship between falls (potentially caused by volume depletion) and fractures cannot be excluded. An RCT of dapagliflozin in patients with stage 3 CKD demonstrated a higher risk of fracture with the SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo; seven of the 13 participants randomised to dapagliflozin who sustained a fracture exhibited orthostatic hypotension or had a history of diabetic neuropathy [87] .In summary, meta-analyses and population-based studies of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy have largely not demonstrated an increased risk of fracture [40, 47, 84, 85, 88] . However, given the changes in mineral metabolism and the results of the CANVAS Program described, longer-term data are needed with respect to risk of fracture. This issue is of relevance to the population of patients with CKD, who have or are at risk of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).Patients with comorbidities including diabetes, older age and hypertension are at risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection [89] . Therefore, it is important that clinicians inform patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors that they should temporarily stop their SGLT2 inhibitor when acutely unwell with reduced oral intake (as part of a sick day management plan), and that patients understand this advice, to try to reduce the risk of DKA and dehydration potentially leading to AKI [90, 91] .Patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection should have their SGLT2 inhibitor discontinued [90, 91] . In a systematic literature review of cases involving patients with COVID-19 and DKA or combined DKA and hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome, at least seven of the 110 patients were taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Self-monitoring of plasma ketone levels when DKA is suspected has been recommended [92] , although there are cost and possibly test kit availability issues. Additionally, patients must understand how to correctly use a meter that measures plasma ketone levels and be able to seek advice, preferably from a diabetes educator or endocrinologist, as to what actions to take based on their symptoms, plasma glucose, and ketone level.SGLT2 inhibitors have clinically important cardio-renal benefits, especially for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and end-stage kidney disease. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential safety issues with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in order to try to minimise the occurrence of adverse events, as well as to detect and intervene early if these events occur. Our understanding regarding the safety of these agents is evolving, and longer-term data will provide greater knowledge. Additionally, there is a need for greater specific data with respect to people with severe CKD.","Australia","first author","2020-10-23",10

In Australia, the change in the diagnostic criteria for GDM has resulted in an approximate 50% increase in prevalence 9 and the changed criteria appears to be exacerbating the seasonal variation. Whether the increased and increasing prevalence of GDM occasioned by both these factors is an advantage to the outcome of the pregnancy remains to be determined. In Australia, perhaps standardisation of the temperature in pathology collection areas could be considered. Or perhaps criteria adjustment may be required for different seasons.Tegan E. van Gemert 1 Robert G. Moses 2 ","Australia","abstract","2020-10-11",10

The source of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear [3] . Figure 1 demonstrates the initial timeline of the development of SARS-CoV-2 [4] . The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to global safety in public health [5] . On 31 st January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO), due to growing fears about the rapid spread of coronavirus, announced a global epidemic and on 11 th March, the disease was recognised as a pandemic.COVID-19 clinical trials indicate that almost all patients admitted to hospital have trouble breathing and pneumonia-like symptoms [6] . Clinical diagnosis has identified that COVID-19 (disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) patients have similar indications to other coronavirus affected patients, e.g. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [7] . The initial indication of a COVID-19 infection is coughing, fever, and short breath, and in the later stages, it can damage the kidney, cause pneumonia, and unexpected death. The vulnerability of the elderly (>80 years of age) is high, with a fatality rate of ~22% of cases infected by COVID-19 [8] . The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has reached over 33 million as of 29 th September 2020, with more than 213 countries and regions affected by the pandemic [9] . Over 1,003,569 people have already passed away [9] due to COVID-19. Most countries are currently trying to combat the virus spread by screening for COVID-19 in large numbers and maintaining social distancing policies with an emphasis on the health of human beings. It has been reported that travel restrictions play a significant role in controlling the initial spread of COVID-19 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . It has been reported that staying at home is most useful in controlling both the initial and last phase of infectious diseases [15] [16] [17] . However, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines, entry bans, as well as other limitations have been implemented for citizens in or recent travellers to several countries in the most affected areas [18] . Also, most of the industries were shutdown to lower mobility. A potential benefit of these measures is the reduction of pollution by the industrial and transportation sector, improving urban sustainability [19] . Figure 3 shows the global responses to lower the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. There have been negative economic and social implications due to restrictions and decreased travel readiness worldwide [20] . A fall in the volume of business activity and international events and an increase in online measures could have a long-term impact. The status of global transport and air activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is shown in Figure  4 [21]. Figure 3 . Initial preventive measures to lower the COVID-19 outbreak [14] .By March 2020, the average global road haulage activity in regions with lockdowns had declined to almost 50% of the 2019 standard. Air travel has almost completely stopped in certain regions with aviation activity decreasing by over 90% in some European countries.Air activity in China recovered slightly from a low in late February, with lockdown measures somewhat eased. Nevertheless, as lockdowns spread, by the end of Q1 2020, global aviation activity decreased by a staggering 60%. The spread of COVID-19 continues to threaten the public health situation severely [11] and greatly affect the global economy. Labour displacement, business closures and stock crashes are just some of the impacts of this global lockdown during the pandemic. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the effect of COVID-19 will result in a worldwide economic decline in 2020 and a decline in the economic growth to 3% [22] . COVID-19 has a detrimental impact on economic growth due to two primary factors. In the beginning, the exponential growth of the global epidemic directly contributed to considerable confusion about instability in the financial and capital markets. Secondly, countries have strictly regulated human movement and transport to monitor the growth of the epidemic and significantly reduced economic activity, putting pressure on both consumer and productive economic activity.Since the 1970s, the link between economic growth and pollution has been an important global concern. The assessment of energy and financial efficiency is usually connected to environmental pollution research. Green practices at a national level, the inclusion of renewable energy, regulatory pressure and the sustainable use of natural resources are associated with environmental sustainability [23] . One study has shown that environmental pollution increases with economic growth and vice versa [24] . The strict control over movement and business activity due to COVID-19 has led to an economic downturn, which is in turn, expected to reduce environmental pollution. This paper systematically assesses how the novel coronavirus has had a global effect on society, the energy sector and the environment. This study presents data compiled from the literature, news sources and reports (from February 2020 to July 2020) on the management steps implemented across the globe to control and reduce the impact of COVID-19. The study will offer guidelines for nations to assess the overall impact of COVID-19 in their countries.The generation of different types of waste indirectly creates a number of environmental concerns [25] . The home isolation and pop-up confinement services in countries that have experienced major impacts of COVID-19 are standard practise, as hospitals are given priority to the most serious cases. In some countries, hotels are being used to isolate travellers for at least two weeks on entry. In several countries, such quarantine measures have resulted in consumers increasing their domestic online shopping activity that has increased domestic waste. In addition, food bought online is packaged, so inorganic waste has also increased.Medical waste has also increased. For instance, Wuhan hospitals produced an average of 240 metric tonnes of medical waste during the outbreak compared to their previous average of fewer than 50 tonnes [26] . This unusual situation poses new and major obstacles in the implementation of waste collection services, thus creating a new challenge for waste collection and recycling groups. With the global adaptation to exponential behavioural and social shifts in the face of COVID-19 challenges, municipal services such as waste collection and management need to alter their operations to play an important role in reducing the spread of infectious diseases.SARS-CoV-2's transmission activity has major repercussions for waste services. SARS-CoV-2 attacks host cells with ACE2 proteins directly. ACE2 is a cell membrane-associated enzyme in the lungs, heart and kidneys. When all the resources in the host cell are infected and depleted, the viruses leave the cell in the so-called shedding cycle [27] . Throughout this pandemic, huge volumes of domestic and hospital waste, particularly plastic waste, has been generated. This has already impeded current efforts to reduce plastic waste and decrease its disposal in the environment. More effort should be made to find alternatives to heavily used plastics. contaminated households and quarantine facilities to protect frontline waste workers in Europe, as shown in Figure 6 . ACR+ also suggests a 72-hour delay in waste disposal (the possible lifespan of COVID-19 in the environment) [27] . Moreover, the collected waste should be immediately transported to waste incinerators or sites without segregation. Without the global pandemic, we had naively anticipated that in 2020 global emissions would rise by around 1% on a five-year basis. Instead, the sharp decline in economic activity in response to the current crisis will most probably lead to a modest drop in global greenhouse . Asthmatic children and older individuals with cardiac illness are most vulnerable in this regard. However, its main drawback is that it produces two of the most harmful air pollutants, ozone and airborne particles. Ozone gas affects our lungs and the crops we eat.According to the ESA [43], average levels of NO 2 declined by 40% between 13 th March 2020 to 13 th April 2020. The reduction was 55% compared to the same period in 2019. Figure 7 compares the 2019-2020 NO 2 concentration [43]. The displayed satellite image was captured with the TROPOMI by ESA satellite Sentinel-5P. The percentage reductions in average NO 2 emissions in European countries during the COVID-19 outbreak from 1 st April to 30 th April 2020 can be seen in Figure 8 [44]. Portugal, Spain, Norway, Croatia, France, Italy, andFinland are the countries that experienced the largest decrease in NO 2 levels, with 58%, 48%, 47%, 43% and 41%, respectively. The term particulate matter, referred to as PM, is used to identify tiny airborne particles. PM forms in the atmosphere when pollutants chemically react with each other. Particles include pollution, dirt, soot, smoke, and droplets. Pollutants emitted from vehicles, factories, building sites, tilled areas, unpaved roads and the burning of fossil fuels also contribute to PM in the air [48] . Grilling food (by burning leaves or gas grills), smoking cigarettes, and burning wood on a fireplace or stove also contribute to PM. The aerodynamic diameter is considered a simple way to describe PM's particle size as these particles occur in various shapes and densities. Particulates are usually divided into two categories, namely, PM 10 that are inhalable particles with a diameter of 10 μm or less and PM 2.5 which are fine inhalable particle with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less. PM 2.5 exposure causes relatively severe health problems such as non-fatal heart attacks, heartbeat irregularity, increased asthma, reduced lung function, Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, PM emission in most countries has been reduced [51-55]. Noise is characterised as an undesirable sound that may be produced from different activities, Most governments have imposed quarantine measures that require people to spend much more time at home. This has considerably reduced the use of private and public transport.Commercial activities have almost completely stopped. In most cities in the world, these changes have caused a significant decline in noise levels. This was followed by a significant decline in pollution from contaminants and greenhouse gas emissions. Noise pollution from sources like road, rail or air transport has been linked to economic activity. Consequently, we anticipate that the levels of transport noise will decrease significantly due to the decreased demand for mobility in the short term [59].For example, it was obvious that environmental noise in Italy was reduced after 8 th March 2020 (the lockdown start date) due to a halt in commercial and recreational activities. A seismograph facility in Lombardy city in Italy that was severely affected by the COVID-19pandemic indicated how the quarantine measures reduce both traffic and noise emissions.The comparison of the 24-hour seismic noise data before and after the lockdown period indicates a considerable drop in environmental noise in Italy [60]. pandemic may also increase inequality, discrimination and medium and long-term unemployment if not properly addressed by appropriate policies.The protection measures taken to save lives are severely affecting economies all over the world. As discussed previously, the key protection measure adopted universally is the lockdown, which has forced people to work from home wherever possible. Workplace Economist predicted that the Italian debt-to-GDP ratio would grow from 130% to 180% by the end of 2020 [68] and it is also assumed that Italy will have difficulty repaying its debt[70].COVID-19 has not only impacted health, society and the economy but it has also had a strong impact on the energy sector [72, 73] . World energy demand fell by 3.8% in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020 compared with Q1 2019. In Q1 of 2020, the global coal market was heavily impacted by both weather conditions and the downturn in economic activity resulting in an almost 8% fall compared to Q1 2019. The fall was primarily in the electricity sector as a result of substantial declines in demand (-2.5%) and competitive advantages from predominantly low-cost natural gas. The market for global oil has plummeted by almost 5%.Travel bans, border closures, and changes in work routines significantly decreased the demand for the use of personal vehicles and air transport. Thus rising global economic activity slowed down the use of fuel for transportation [74] . In Q1 2020, the output from nuclear energy plants decreased worldwide, especially in Europe and the US, as they adjusted for lower levels of demand. Demand for natural gas dropped significantly, by approximately 2% in Q1 2020, with the biggest declines in China, Europe, and the United States. In the Q1 2020, the need for renewable energy grew by around 1.5%, driven in recent years by the increasing output of new wind and solar plants. Renewable energy sources substantially increased in the electricity generation mix, with record hourly renewable energy shares in Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary, and East America. The share of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation mix has increased. Table 2 shows the effect of COVID-19 outbreak on the energy demand around the world. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted an annual average decline in oil production of 9% in 2020, reflecting a return to 2012 levels. Broadly, as electricity demand has decreased by about 5% throughout the year, coal production may fall by 8%, and the output of coal-fired electricity generation could fall by more than 10%. During the entire year, gas demand may fall far beyond Q1 2020 due to a downward trend in power and industrial applications. Nuclear energy demand will also decrease in response to reduced electricity demand. The demand for renewable energies should grow due to low production costs and the choice of access to many power systems. Khan et al. [81] reported that international trade is significantly and positively dependent on renewable energy. In addition, sustainable growth can be facilitated through the consumption of renewable energy which improves the environment, enhances national image globally and opens up international trade opportunities with environmentally friendly countries [82] . As such, policies that promote renewables can result in economic prosperity, create a better environment as well as meet critical goals for sustainable development [83] .COVID-19 is a major crisis needing an international response. Governments will ensure reliable information is provided to assist the public in combating this pandemic. Community the key preventive technique is to limit mass gatherings. Table 3 shows the impact of lockdown measures on the recovery rate of COVID-19 infections. The baseline data for this table is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period 3 rd January to 6 th February 2020. [87]. The first generation of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to gain approval by the end of 2020 or in early 2021 [88] . It is anticipated that these vaccines will provide immunity to the population. These vaccines can also reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and lead to a resumption of a pre-COVID-19 normal. In addition to the above, forestation and a worldwide ban on wildlife trade can also play a significant role in reducing the spread of different viruses. More than 30% of the ground area is covered with forests. The imminent increase in population contributes to deforestation in agriculture or grazing for food, industries and property. The rise in ambient temperature, sea levels and extreme weather events affects not only the land and environment but also public health [89, 90] . Huge investment has been made into treatments, rehabilitation and medications to avoid the impact of this epidemic. However, it is important to focus on basic measures, e.g. forestation and wildlife protection. The COVID-19 infection was initially spread from the Seafood Market, Wuhan, China. Therefore, China temporarily banned wildlife markets in which animals are kept alive in small cages. It has been reported that 60% of transmittable diseases are animal-borne, 70% of which are estimated to have been borne by wild animals [72] . Deforestation is also related to various kinds of diseases caused by birds, bats, etc. [91] . For example, COVID-19 is a bat-borne disease that is transmitted to humans. Therefore, several scientists have advised various countries to ban wildlife trade indefinitely so that humans can be protected from new viruses and global pandemics like COVID-19.In this article, comprehensive analyses of energy, environmental pollution, and socioeconomic impacts in the context of health emergency events and the global responses to mitigate the effects of these events have been provided. COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic that puts a stop to economic activity and poses a severe risk to overall wellbeing. The global socio-economic impact of COVID-19 includes higher unemployment and poverty rates, lower oil prices, altered education sectors, changes in the nature of work, lower GDPs and heightened risks to health care workers. Thus, social preparedness, as a collaboration between leaders, health care workers and researchers to foster meaningful partnerships and devise strategies to achieve socio-economic prosperity, is required to tackle future pandemic-like situations. The impact on the energy sector includes increased residential energy demand due to a reduction in mobility and a change in the nature of work. Lockdowns across the globe have restricted movement and have placed people primarily at home, which has, in turn, decreased industrial and commercial energy demand as well as waste generation. This reduction in demand has resulted in substantial decreases in NO 2, PM, and environmental noise emissions and as a consequence, a significant reduction in environmental pollution.Sustainable urban management that takes into account the positive benefits of ecological balance is vital to the decrease of viral infections and other diseases. Policies that promote sustainable development, ensuring cities can enforce recommended measures like social distancing and self-isolation will bring an overall benefit very quickly. The first generation of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to gain approval by the end of 2020 or in early 2021, which will provide immunity to the population. It is necessary to establish preventive epidemiological models to detect the occurrence of viruses like COVID-19 in advance. In addition, governments, policymakers, and stakeholders around the world need to take necessary steps, such as ensuring healthcare services for all citizens, supporting those who are working in frontline services and suffering significant financial impacts, ensuring social distancing, and focussing on building a sustainable future. It is also recommended that more investment is required in research and development to overcome this pandemic and prevent any similar crisis in the future.","Australia","first author","2020-10-14",10

In particular, two new practices emerged that are having a particular impact; social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) including face masks (Figure 1 ). Mask wearing by caregivers can potentially influence the baby's neurodevelopment due to the effect on the normal attachment and bonding that takes place in the early days of life between a baby and their parents (Sullivan et al., 2011; Green et al., 2020) . This paper discusses the potential impact of wearing face masks in the newborn period in line with underpinning theory, creating key recommendations for practice. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f At birth, a baby is born with all their neurons which subsequently undergo extraordinary development for the first few years of life (Holland et al., 2014) . The brain grows rapidly during this time and has reached half its adult size within three months, doubling in size in the firstyear. By age three, it has reached 80 percent of its adult volume (Cao et al., 2017) . Brain growth is strongly affected by the baby's experiences with people in their world, and brain development is influenced by relationships, experiences, and the environment (Griffin, 2017; Jensen & Nutt 2015; Tronick et al., 1975) . Human beings are incredibly attuned to reading facial expressions of others. This ability to read facial expressions, according to Charles Darwin (1872) , has an evolutionary advantage by aiding social interaction, reducing misunderstanding, thereby helping social groups function efficiently and harmoniously. The ability to read faces is also a muchneeded skill within our society because it helps people gauge emotions of others and regulate their behaviour and interactions accordingly. Under normal circumstances, humans have a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coordinated package of communication cues, which include facial expressions, hand gestures, body language, words, pitch, tone, and face colour such as blushing. The communication cues act together to convey message and intent (Ong, 2020) .From the minute of birth, faces are visible to infants, with research indicating that newborns shown photos of their mothers and other people, are adept at differentiating their mother's face from the faces of strangers (LoBue, 2016). LoBue's research also indicated that newborns chose to look longer at images of their own mothers compared to images of different women (LoBue, 2016) . Moreover, research has demonstrated that it only takes newborns a few days to learn how to discriminate between differing emotional facial expressions, such as happy, sad and surprised (Farroni et al., 2007; Palama et al., 2018) . By the time an infant has reached five months of age, they are able to match the image of an emotional expression such as a sad face, with the corresponding sad vocal expression (Rigato et al., 2011) . At five years of age the child has developed the ability to recognize and label facial expressions with the competence of most adults (LoBue, 2016) .In order to fully understand the impact that face masks have on human connection from a developmental perspective, it is important to explore the underpinning theory of human development. Most pertinent to this topic are the bioecological and attachment theories.The Bioecological theory of human development focuses on relationships a child has which contribute to their development and ability to reach their full potential. Bioecology is focused on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the strengths of these relationships. The psychologist Bronfenbrenner theorised that human development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interactions between the baby/child and parents/caregivers, objects, and symbols in its immediate external environment. He also proposed that a baby's future psychological outcomes will be more favourable if these relationships lead to mutual and positive emotional attachments in early life (Rosa & Tudge, 2013) . The concept of reciprocal interactions between a baby and his/her parent has shaped thinking on the development of brain circuitry although there is a paucity of recent research that supports the concept of early reciprocal interactions and brain development (Yogman et al., 2018) .The terms bonding and attachment are often used interchangeably. Klaus and Kennell (1982) differentiated the terms by describing bonding as the tie of a mother to her baby and attachment as the tie of a baby to his or her mother. Studies related to bonding were the catalyst for bringing mothers and babies together as soon as possible after birth, leading to couplet care where the mother and baby 'room-in' together (Cassidy et al., 2013) . Early contact in the immediate hours after birth is when a baby is alert and face-to-face interaction is the most successful. At this moment, the mother and baby get to know each other, and the potential for a strong bond starts developing. This bond can initiate positive parenting behaviours and is important for normal neurobehavioural development of the baby. Failure to establish this bond can result in lack of maternal feelings and subsequent rejection of the infant which could potentially progress to neglect, parental inconsistency, lack of love, and in turn, long-term mental health problems (Winston and Chicot, 2016) .Bowlby's evolutionary theory of attachment suggests that children come into the world biologically pre-programmed to form attachments with others, because this will help them to survive. A child has an innate (i.e. inborn) need to attach to one main attachment figure and this emotional connection or attachment is formed by wordless communication occurring between the infant and the mother or caregiver (Bowlby, 1992) . Poor early mother-infant attachment can be associated with emotional and behavioural problems in the infant and poor long-term social and emotional outcomes (Benoit, 2004) . When a mother and baby are separated, relational interactions are hindered, negatively impacting the attachment process.The quality of the mother-baby relationship is typically assessed at 12 months of age (Bowlby, 1992) . Although safety prevails, when mothers and/or fathers are required to wear a mask, the inability of a baby to see facial expressions and hindered wordless communication can negatively impact on both the bonding and attachment process.More recently however, there are studies utilising brain imaging which show how nurturing, supportive and sensitive caregiving influence both brain structure and function. Sethna et al (2017) used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of infants aged between three and six months to investigate the relationship between observational measures of mother-infant interactions and brain volumes. The findings from their study suggest the relationship between infant brain development and maternal interactions is sensitive as early as the postnatal period. The significance of their findings is that insensitive behaviours may constitute a source of stress for the infant and activate stress responses. The subsequent elevation of cortisol may negatively influence brain connectivity and growth. Mask-wearing during this sensitive period then raises questions regarding mother-infant interactions and whether this could negatively impact on brain connectivity and growth.A human face is comprised of the front part of the head that extends from the forehead to the chin and includes the mouth, nose, cheeks, and eyes. It is of interest that this definition does not include the eyebrows, which are powerfully expressive components of a face. Reflecting further on a face, it is three-dimensional and mobile in the sense that its features can move yet remain fixed in place. A face is also animated and has the capacity to animate others. Furthermore, a face responds by means of expression to many things, including an infant's cues and activities.A human face is usually symmetrical along its vertical axis, and its components are organised and mostly consistent across all faces. In addition, all faces include different yet similar shapes, contours and tones. A personal reflection can be seen in Table 1 , providing first-hand anecdotal evidence of the importance of the face. Simion and Giorgio (2015) note that a human face has more elements in the upper part of the face, and these elements are placed congruent to the outline of the shape of the face, significant in relation to the current discussion around face mask wearing. Johnson et al (1991) found evidence that for infants to preferentially track a human face in the first hour of life, not only is the configuration of facial features important, aspects of the features themselves are too. They further noted that an ability for preferential tracking declines during the second month of life, underscoring the importance of supporting the infant from the first hours of life to develop this ability. We must therefore understand the potential impact of being cared for and exposed to people who are almost all masked.Since the 1960's, researchers have worked to understand the capabilities of sighted and hearing newborn infants, especially in relation to how they process faces and what faces mean to them J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (see for example, Ellsworth et al.,1993; Fantz 1966; Field et al. 1982; Johnson et al. 1991; Maurer et al., 1976; Simion & Giorgio 2015; Karz and Hadani, 2020) . According to Pascalis et al (2011) , the activity of face processing in an infant involves the two step progression of face detection; the ability of the infant to recognise that what they see is a face, and, face recognitionwhere the infant recognises that the face they see is familiar or not.Additionally, the infant possesses what Simion and Giorgio (2015, p.1) term 'inborn predispositions' which are thought to be already present at birth and essential for face processing to occur. The complex face-perception system in an infant becomes focused and refined as the result of a combination of evolutionary inheritance and experience-dependent exposures, thought to be associated with neural pruning of under-stimulated synaptic connections and neural strengthening of those that are regularly exposed to stimuli (Scott et al., 2007; Simion & Giorgio 2015) . Infants interact reciprocally with their caregivers from the moment of birth.Reciprocity is a process of communication between a baby and a parent. The baby sends out signals using facial and vocal expressions about his/her needs, and then waits for a response. The parent or caregiver reads and responds to the baby's signals, and this in turn serves as a return signal for the baby to read. The actions of the baby and parent affects the other in a manner that has been described as resembling an intricate dance (Brazelton et al.,1974; Brazelton et al. 1975; Yogman et al., 2018) .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Exposure to, and having experiences of, seeing faces are thought to be fundamental to social human interaction and communication. As an infant is entirely dependent on other humans for many years, survival depends in great part on their ability to perceive, recognise and distinguish the familiar from the unfamiliar, and people from inanimate objects (Simion & Giorgio, 2015) . Field and her colleagues found that infants of a mean age of 36 hours were able to discriminate and imitate facial expressions (Field et al., 1982) . During the process the infant visually fixates on the eyes and the mouth in varying degrees, dependent on the facial expression being observed, implying the importance of an infant being able to observe the mouth as part of facial processing.The preference that newborns have for faces compared to looking at other objects suggests an innate ability of an infant to recognise what a face is (Otsuka, 2014) . Considerable research has been undertaken that has explored how newborn and older infants process and respond to faces, with investigators using images of scrambled, stylised and inverted faces (Johnson et al. 1991; Maurer et al., 1976; 2002; Otsuka 2014) . Findings included preferential tracking of faces by infants (Johnson et al. 1991) , imitation of facial expressions (Field et al. 1982) , and the notable 'still face' experiment (Adamson & Frick 2003; Tronick et al. 1975) showing that infants are active contributors to social interactions. The ability of an infant to recognise and prefer its mother's face over others' faces has also been explored and highlighted as well as facial preference related to gender and race. Infants have been shown to be able to discriminate between male and female gender (Righi et al., 2014) and one earlier study suggested a preferential selectivity based on ethnicity learned within the first 3 months of life (Kelly et al., 2008) .More recently, there is some suggestion that Botox©, a treatment used to treat the appearance of glabellar frown lines, may impact on the recognition of emotion (Lewis, 2018) . However, no study has been identified yet to support the impact of this in babies. Certainly, occlusion by a mask significantly alters what is visible on a face, with important implications for babies and parents.Currently, more than fifty countries have mandated the wearing of face masks in public to protect themselves and others from catching COVID-19. Shakespeare is credited with saying 'the eyes are the windows to your soul' (cited in Ong, 2020) . This infers that mental states, emotions, desires, and intentions can be determined by looking into the eyes. When a face mask is worn, the eyes become a primary method of communication. On the human face, the eyes and mouth are the most informative regions for communicating because they are the most expressive. The mouth region can express happiness with smiles; however, concealing the mouth can be problematic in health care when staff want to appear friendly and approachable (Karz and Hadani, 2020; Ong, 2020) . Having a mask can make users feel there is a physical barrier between themselves and the person they are communicating with.Masks not only hide smiles; they make it harder for the staff to determine emotions in their patients such as pain, discomfort, dismay and disdain (Fortin, 2020) . For people with hearing difficulties, having the mouth covered is a major barrier as they are unable to lip read. Masks can muffle speech and make hearing difficult. It has been estimated that approximately five percent of the world's population have disabling hearing loss (Ong, 2020) , and they rely on visual cues, lip-reading and facial expressions to effectively communicate, even in those who use sign language (Fortin, 2020) .Placing a medical mask on a face results in an individual missing featural information such as the nose, cheeks, chin and mouth as well as second order configural information, such as the spaces between inner facial features. Specific facial features are obliterated causing the global structure of a whole face to be incomplete (Maurer et al., 2002; Piepers & Robbins, 2012 ) and preventing people from being able to detect a full face and facial expression.For an infant, this has the potential for long reaching effects in the early stages of neurobehavioral development. A mask covering the face may affect the infant's ability to develop facial processing and orientating to or focusing on another person's face. To reiterate, newborns prefer looking at faces and clearly have an innate ability to recognise what a face is (Otsuka, 2014) . Furthermore, newborns can recognise familiar faces, especially ones where a close connection exists (Pascalis et al, 2011) , important because newborns are dependent entirely on their parents for survival and need to recognise them (Simion & Giorgio 2015) . Crucial for this process, is the newborn's ability to visualise facial expressions. For infants and children to feel safe, there is a heavy dependence on facial expressions as they rely on their parents' emotional cues via facial expression to regulate their responses towards them or to potentially threatening situations. Katz and Hadani (2020) refer to this as social referencing and if it does not occur, the infant or child feels anxious and unsure of their environment.Interestingly, there are many developmental differences between adults and infants in face recognition that may be affected by mask wearing. In adults, partial occlusion of the face by a mask can hinder face discrimination. It appears that infants from 5 weeks of age have the unique ability to discriminate and identify their parents' faces from that of strangers, even if J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the eyes or mouth are occluded (Gava et al., 2008) . However, this is dependent on the parents using expression and movement in their faces along with and other communicative cues such as speech and close, physical contact (Bigelow & Power, 2012) . It may be difficult to separate the effect of wearing masks from that of increased anxiety and stress experienced by parents during the COVID-19 pandemic generally (Galea et al., 2020) .However, the implications of mask wearing requires consideration for health professionals caring for babies, infants or children in any setting, to mitigate against the potentially negative effects. Recommendations are therefore needed to guide and support them during the pandemic, for however long it may continue.Firstly, to assist patients, frontline health care workers who wear masks, full face covering shields and protective gowns have started adhering smiling pictures of themselves to their J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f gowns to decrease patient anxiety. Clear plastic masks could be useful for those with hearing loss and those who care for them, so they can continue to lip read. Schlögl o Try to keep mask wearing to a minimum.o When not wearing a mask, maximise the facial interaction between mother / father / caregiver and baby.o Find and implement alternative ways to communicate and connect during mask wearing-for example; mothers should be provided with clear face masks or clear face shields to ensure that bonding and attachment are not disrupted, and the baby's attempts to learn to read faces are not thwarted.o For long-term babies in the neonatal unit (such as those who require complex surgical procedures), and for those babies whose family does not visit regularly, clear face masks would be recommended for a team of nurses caring for these babies.

It is likely that during the COVID-19pandemic, most of the population will cover their faces with a mask when in public, and in certain social situations. The difficulty in determining what facial expression a person is exhibiting behind a mask may present challenges for infants and young children as they depend on their parents' facial expressions, coupled with tone and/or voice to regulate their reactions toward others. Health professionals should understand the potential effects of prolonged mask wearing to minimise any potential long-term impact on neonatal development and optimise psychological outcomes for babies, infants, children and their parents.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Australia","first author","2020-10-29",10

There is strong evidence for the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for people with chronic respiratory disease [1] and previous literature has also demonstrated the benefits of PR in terms of improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life in survivors of adult respiratory distress syndrome and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonitis [2] . International statements have now suggested that the PR setting may be an appropriate rehabilitation pathway for patients recovering from COVID-19 who have persistent pulmonary and extra-pulmonary symptoms and functional limitations [2] [3] [4] [5] . In Sydney, Australia, the Northern Sydney Local Health District (NSLHD) has had 550 cases of COVID-19 (as of 15 July 2020). In preparation for potential rehabilitation referrals, the NSLHD PR service set up a telehealth rehabilitation programme for patients recovering from COVID-19 who have ongoing limitations and/or symptoms that may be amendable to PR (e.g. breathlessness, fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity). As rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients in Australia is in its infancy, we present our rehabilitation model and discuss the management of our first three cases, in order to share our experiences with others who may provide rehabilitation for patients recovering from COVID-19 in the future.Due to pandemic-related constraints, face-to-face PR has not been available in the NSLHD and rehabilitation has been provided via a virtual telehealth model of care [6] . Patients recovering from COVID-19 were eligible to participate in the rehabilitation programme if they were referred from acute or community providers and had access to a video conference device. There was close collaboration with the PR and acute care teams for a thorough handover at hospital discharge including outcome measures, where possible ( Table 1) .The COVID-19 telehealth rehabilitation programme consisted of (1) a comprehensive initial rehabilitation assessment with a physiotherapist for identification of symptoms and physical impairments that were considered treatable (i.e. treatable traits) [7] within the PR context [8] ;(2) an initial six-week rehabilitation programme, with weekly contact by a physiotherapist with multidisciplinary team (MDT) input as required; and (3) a reassessment using the same outcome measures as at initial assessment (Table 1) .Outcomes considered amenable to PR included fatigue, assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), dyspnoea, assessed by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, and exercise capacity, assessed using the five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5STS) and the 1-min sit-to-stand test (1minSTS). Prior to the initial assessment, a pulse oximeter (Onyx Vantage Red; Fairmont Medical, Australia) was delivered to the patients' homes to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation during exercise testing (and training). This monitoring was considered important to mitigate adverse events and to gauge physiological response to exercise. An oxygen desaturation of ≥3% was determined as the point to stop exercise and request a medical review [9] . The exercise tests (5STS and 1minSTS) were conducted via video conference with the patient in full view, seated on a chair with its back against a wall. Screens of cognitive function, using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) blind version, and anxiety and depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), were also completed. All questionnaires were posted or emailed to the patients. Patients were also asked to complete an experience measure after six weeks of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation programme prescribed for each patient was individualized to target identified treatable traits [7, 8] and consisted of symptom monitoring and management strategies (e.g. breathless management techniques, breathing exercises, and energy conservation), unsupervised home-based exercise training, advice regarding daily physical activity, and education from the MDT (e.g. nursing, physiotherapy, dietetics, psychology, and occupational therapy).The exercise prescription of intensity, duration, frequency, type, and mode [10] aimed to return the patients to their pre-morbid fitness levels. Patients were instructed to exercise on four days per week initially and to build up to six days a week [11] . Initially, the mode of aerobic exercise training was ground-based walking training [12] with a low starting intensity, that is, a breathlessness or fatigue score of <3 ('moderate') on the modified 0-10 Borg category-ratio scale. Duration of walking training was commenced between 5 to 10 min and progressed to 30 min [11] . For patients who were experiencing excessive fatigue and breathlessness, intermittent exercise was prescribed starting with 2-min intervals with a 1-min rest [11] . A rest day in between exercise sessions was also advised, if needed. Strengthening exercises were also prescribed with a focus on large muscle groups (exercise examples: sit-to-stand, heel raises, lunges, bicep curls with hand weights, wall push ups, and tricep dips). Initially, two sets of 10 repetitions were prescribed. Progression of strength training was based on symptoms during and after exercise with weights added as tolerated [11] .A COVID-19 recovery diary was provided to all patients which included advice regarding mental and physical recovery, management of symptoms, and an exercise diary with space to record levels of effort, fatigue, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Patient cases were reviewed in a weekly MDT meeting to ensure all patient needs were met.Patient characteristics together with impairments identified during initial rehabilitation assessment are presented in Table 2 . All patients had moderate to severe signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 on hospital admission. On commencement of rehabilitation, all patients were initially in physical isolation at home, either due to still being COVID-19 positive (Cases 1 and 3) or because of social restrictions (Case 2).Outcome measures at hospital discharge, commencement of rehabilitation, and after six weeks of rehabilitation are presented in Table 1 . Patients demonstrated improvements from commencement of rehabilitation to the six-week time-point on the 5STS and 1minSTS.All patients scored within the normal range on the MoCA (although all had some difficulty with the memory recall question) and on the HADS at commencement; however, depression score worsened in Case 2 at the sixweek time-point. Fatigue score on the FSS also worsened at the six-week time-point in Case 2 and Case 3 and, when questioned, both patients reported feeling the burden of returning to normal daily duties, work, and carer roles whilst still recovering from COVID-19 which contributed to their feelings of increased fatigue and low mood. In Case 3, quarantine adversely affected family life and caused psychological strain as social support services were unable to visit the home until the patient was COVID-19 negative. Interestingly, at commencement of PR, all patients reported feeling uncertain about what they should and should not be doing during their recovery from COVID-19 and being unsure of their long-term prognosis. With regards to adherence and progression of exercise training, Case 1 was highly compliant, completing all sessions as instructed as he had the time to focus entirely on his rehabilitation. In contrast, Case 2 and Case 3 progressed more slowly and only completed one to two sessions for the first three weeks before increasing compliance to the four to six days as prescribed. Both patients reported higher baseline symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue and had family and work demands competing with time for rehabilitation. Of particular interest, 11 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, Case 2 was reporting persistent dyspnoea that seemed disproportionate to his recovery and a respiratory physician consultation was arranged. A mild restrictive pulmonary defect was identified on pulmonary function testing. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram demonstrated persisting bilateral ground-glass opacities and a small pulmonary embolism affecting a segmental artery in the right middle lobe. The patient was commenced on therapeutic anticoagulation therapy and the patient's dyspnoea subsequently improved, as did his exercise capacity. Although a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism has been reported in COVID-19 [13] , it is likely that the patient's dyspnoea was predominantly related to his persisting pulmonary infiltrates.Feedback regarding the programme from the patient experience measure was highly positive with patients reporting that they had significantly improved their confidence in what to do during their recovery. Other reported benefits that aided recovery included management of symptoms during increasing functional demands, support whilst transitioning out of quarantine and physical isolation, and having the rehabilitation programme structure along with the MDT education.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, reports have focused on acute patient management but there is now a shift towards the longer term recovery needs of people with COVID-19. In this case series, we have presented our telehealth COVID-19 rehabilitation model and discussed the management of our first three patients. The programme delivered by PR clinicians was feasible and acceptable to patients. We believe it is valuable to provide early support to people recovering from COVID-19 and to be aware that demands related to employment and carer roles may be challenging for patients recovering from COVID-19. When providing rehabilitation via telehealth, clinicians need to be aware of some special considerations including the inability to complete comprehensive exercise testing, the need to closely monitor patients, and to have a low threshold for requesting medical reviews. To maximize rehabilitation via telehealth, videoconferencing is recommended as the preferred method for consultation and access to pulse oximeters was felt to be important so that some level of physiological monitoring was available when providing rehabilitation via telehealth. For patients who may not have access to technology or devices, healthcare providers should consider purchase of these in rehabilitative funding models. Our patients had moderate to severe COVID-19 with relatively short hospital stays. For patients who are recovering from longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays and who may present with post-ICU syndrome [14] , more intensive face-to-face rehabilitation may be required. A recent guideline provides expert consensus around rehabilitation, including a suggested core set of outcomes for people recovering from COVID-19 and this should be referred to when planning future COVID-19 rehabilitation programmes [2] . This is a single-centre report and the number of cases is limited; however, the case series indicates that rehabilitation via telehealth for people recovering from COVID-19 is feasible and safe when provided by experienced PR clinicians.Appropriate written informed consent was obtained for publication of this case series. At the time when this report was written, the authors declared that the patients in this report had not been included in any previously published report on COVID-19 that they had authored.","Australia","first author","2020-10-07",10

Europe, Asia and the Pacific have experienced unprecedented measles epidemics in 2019 [1] . Other than direct viral morbidity and mortality, measles causes an immune amnesia which can persist for over 2 years after acute infection and increases the risk of a range of other infections [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The mechanism is thought to be through loss of memory B cells and plasma cells which produce antibodies to a range of infections [7] . The measles virus is also shown to directly infect memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells as well as naïve T cells [8] . A study in Switzerland showed that measles immune amnesia increases the risk of a wide range of infections, with a relative risk of 3.47 for other infections following measles [2] . This risk may be higher in low income countries where malnutrition is an exacerbating factor. The corollary is that measles vaccination can protect against non-measles infections, presumably by preventing immune dysfunction [9] . In the Democratic Republic of Congo, measles vaccine protected against fever, cough and diarrhoea, presumably of non-measles causes [10] .In 2019, an unprecedented epidemic of measles affected Samoa. A state of emergency was declared on November 15th and lifted on December 2019, with a peak of the epidemic around November 26th and up to 3% of the population infected (5707 cases of 199,955 people) with 87 deaths [11] . The highest rates of infection were in the age groups 6-11 months, 0-5 months and 1-4 years, with 87% of deaths in children under 5 years. This translates to 8% of the population under 15 years being infected with measles within the last 6 months [12] . Over 35% of the Samoan population (70,694) is aged < 15 years, and only 5.2% is over 65 years old.Based on available data, COVID-19 causes more severe illness in older people, and children may be asymptomatic, especially under the age of 10 [13, 14] . However, in a case series of over 2000 children with COVID-19, only 50% had mild infection, 6% had critical illness and 1 child aged 14 years died [15] . In another case series, a child aged 10 months died of COVID-19 [16] .We previously exercised a hypothetical pandemic in the Pacific, with involvement of multiple Pacific island nations, and highlighted the unique challenges of the region [17] . These include multiple islands, small populations, natural disasters, weak health systems and poor disease surveillance infrastructure [18] . The impact of measles induced immune amnesia on the manifestation of COVID-19 is unknown and has not been considered, despite a global resurgence of measles in 2019. COVID-19 in Samoa could have a severe impact and a disproportionate increase in morbidity and mortality due the medium-term immune dysregulation caused by the recent measles epidemic.The aim of this study is to estimate the age-specific morbidity and mortality impact of COVID-19 in Samoa, accounting for the potential impact of measles-induced immune amnesia.We used data from the WHO situation reports of the measles epidemic in Samoa [11, 19, 20] , and an assumption that immune amnesia would be present in children infected from November 2019 onward for at least 12 months and up to 36 months [2] , to model the morbidity and mortality impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the country. We used the Samoa population for 2020 [21], which we divided by age groups following the age distribution in 2016 [22] .The entire population was considered susceptible to COVID-19 and the hypothetical epidemic starts at t = 1 with 6 latently infected people. After symptom onset, we assumed that only 80% of symptomatic infected people get effectively isolated after 5 days [23] , and isolation is assumed to stop further transmission. However asymptomatic cases, assumed to be 35% of all infections [24] [25] [26] will not be isolated because they will not be detected due to weak health systems and limited testing capacity in Samoa. Detection of asymptomatic cases requires substantially expanded testing capacity and testing of all close contacts of a case, regardless of symptomsthis is unlikely in small Pacific islands, which may struggle to even test all symptomatic cases. We considered the latent or asymptomatic period to be infectious during the last 2 days before symptoms onset, causing 44% of the total transmissions [27] , and assumed the highest viral load just prior to and just after symptoms [26, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Regarding the symptomatic period, we modelled the first day as the most infective, following by a decreasing in the transmissions potential for the following 6 days [27] , making the infectious symptomatic period 7 days long [30] . Accounting for weak health systems and limited human resource capacity, we assumed that only 60% of known contacts of an infected person will be quarantined for 14 days, and if they are latent and become symptomatic, they will take 2 days to be isolated, however we assumed that only 80% of symptomatic people will be effectively isolated without further transmissions.We used an age-specific deterministic model which simulates the epidemic in Samoa running for 400 days. The model moves people between 13 mutually exclusive compartments: Susceptible (S), Latent not infectious (E), Latent infectious undiagnosed (Eu) and diagnosed (Et), first symptomatic day for undiagnosed (I1) and diagnosed (I2), following 6 days of symptomatic for undiagnosed (I11) and diagnosed (I22), Asymptomatic infectious stages (A1 and A2), Isolated (Q), Recovered (R) and Dead (D). Each of those compartments is divided in 16 age stratified groups each of 5 years duration, ranging from 0 to 74 years old plus an additional age group of 75+ years, as available from the population data for Samoa. The force of infection that moves people from the susceptible compartment to the latent one is age-specific, based on average age-specific contact rates for Samoa [32] , the R0 and the proportion of infected people over the entire population.We considered transmission to be the same in adults and children based on viral shedding data that suggest this [33] , where children often present very milder symptom or none [34] [35] [36] . Studies showed children under 5 years have a higher viral load in the respiratory tract than adults or older children [37] [38] [39] . Another study showed that COVID-19 attack rates in families were higher when the primary case was a child [40] . In the United States, 9.8% of all cases of COVID-19 were children [41] . Given the role of children in transmission remains an area of uncertainty, we conservatively assumed equal transmission potential from children and adults. Failure to seroconvert has also been documented in people with asymptomatic infection [42] , so lack of seropositivity may not equate to lack of infection, as infection may be asymptomatic or mild may not result in seroconversion in children < 10 years [43] .To include the effect of measles on the immune system of COVID-19 infected people, we used the total number of reported cases of measles in 2019 in Samoa, 5707 [11] and, due to the lack of detailed individual age data for those cases, we assumed that 90% were in the first age-group 0-4 years, 5% in the 5-9 age group and 5% in the 10-14 age group, based on the data showing that 87% of all deaths were reported in the age-group younger than 5 [11] . Once we distributed cases in those three age groups, we calculated the proportion of people that had measles with respect to the age group size.Based on a three-year observational study, immunological amnesia after measles can increase the risk of infectious disease hospitalizations by 3.47 times [2] . For the people who had been infected with measles in the preceding 12 months, we than assumed that they are 3.47 times more likely to get infected with COVID-19. However, we averaged the susceptibility of each agegroup, weighting it between the proportion that had measles against those that did not, and overall calculated that the first three age groups, 0-4, 5-9 and 10-14 are 1.44, 1.03 and 1.03 times more likely to get infected respectively. Model parameters are shown in Table 1 , while the model equations are described in the supplementary material.No patients were involved in the design of this study, development of research questions and outcome measures.No additional data available.In Fig. 1 we show the age distribution of infections on the left and deaths on the right by the end of the epidemic. With or without measles effect, about 60% of infections are in the age group younger than 20 years old. Without the measles effect, 11.76, 17.33, 16.42 and 14.18%of the total cases are in the age group 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 respectively, with deaths in the under 20 years old accounting for more than 15% of the total deaths. Most deaths occur in older age groups. With measles immune paresis, the proportion of cases in the age group 0-4 represents 15.55% of the total cases and in the following two age-groups it is 16.69 and 15.57% of the total number of cases, respectively. Measles immune paresis increases the number of cases by 42% in the first age group (from 10,680 cases to 15,213), almost 4% in the second age group and just over 2% in the third age group; while deaths in the age group 0-4 see a 59% increase (from 17 to 27). This corresponds to an increase of almost 8% (from 90,784 to 97,824) in the total number of cases and an increase of 2.3% (from 901 to 944) in the number of total deaths associated with measles immune paresis (Fig. 2 ).The population of Samoa has experienced a recent, severe measles epidemic, and as of the end of June 2020 not yet reported any cases of COVID-19. The impact of measles immune paresis is well documented [2, 4, 7, 8, 48 ], but has not been considered as a factor which may influence COVID-19 epidemiology to date. In the first study considering this, we show a potential increase of [47] morbidity and mortality following the spread of COVID-19 in Samoa. The immune effects of measles would be most prevalent in the most measles-affected age group in Samoa, children, resulting in potential increases in morbidity and mortality in this age group. Samoa has a young age structure and intense contact between younger age groups driving the observed COVID-19 transmission in the model, and this is compounded by the high attack rate of measles in children in 2019. A large proportion of infection in children is asymptomatic or mild, with the probability of symptomatic disease increasing with age. However, available data show that severe morbidity and mortality can occur in children [15] . Deaths due to COVID-19 have been documented in infants [16] . The effect of the severe measles epidemic may result in higher severity of disease in children in Samoa. It is also now clear based on viral shedding data that children play an important role in transmission [33] , and may even have a higher viral load in the respiratory tract than adults [37] . A household contact study found that COVID-19 attack rates in families were higher when the primary case was a child [40] .The age specific mixing rates in most countries show a peak in social mixing in young people and children, corresponding to increased infection transmission for most infections in these age groups [32, 49] . Therefore, if COVID-19 is introduced into Samoa, children and young people may drive transmission, which could place older people at risk due to extended family structures and the importance of community gatherings in Pacific islands. There are few data on COVID-19 in the Pacific, but one study reports poorer outcomes in Pacific Islanders in Hawaii, attributed to lifestyle diseases and comorbidities such as diabetes [50] .For these reasons, prevention and control of COVID-19 in Samoa is critical. Disease control measures such as travel bans, case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, face masks and social distancing are the only available interventions for COVID-19 at this time, and Samoa has effectively closed its international borders [23] . For a Fig. 1 Cumulative age-specific cases (left) and deaths (right) with and without measles immunity paresis effect young population like Samoa, school closure would be an effective disease control strategy for both measles and COVID-19 [32] . Social distancing may be particularly difficult in Pacific cultures, where large gatherings and extended families are the norm, so face mask use should be considered. Ensuring high levels of vaccination against measles is also critical to reduce the potential additional risk of measles immune paresis.A study of 2143 paediatric cases in China found only 50% had mild disease, 30% had moderate disease, 6% were critically ill and one child aged 14 years died [15] . In another study, of 171 cases of COVID-19 in China, the median age was 6.7 years, three required ventilation and an infant aged 10 months died [16] . This accumulating evidence, including recent association with Kawasaki disease, shows that severe illness and death is possible in children. The occurrence of post-COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or Kawasaki Syndrome, in children with a median age of 8 years, is associated with high morbidity and mortality [51] , but the impact of this syndrome was not considered in the model. It is unknown whether measles immune paresis would reduce or increase the risk of Kawasaki disease after COVID-19 infection, but research is warranted in this area.Whilst children may be more likely to be asymptomatically infected, reflected by a low proportion of all cases being children [47] a background of a compromised immune system induced by recent measles infection may change the age-specific epidemiology in countries with recent, widespread measles transmission. These considerations may also affect other countries which have had recent measles epidemics in the Pacific, in Europe and elsewhere. These countries must strongly focus on achieving high levels of measles vaccination as part of the COVID-19 control strategy.Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12879-020-05469-7.Additional file 1.Not applicable.

Rapidly spreading globally, by early March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By 8 April 2020, COVID-19 had infected 1.28 million people and caused 72,774 deaths (WHO, 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic posed and continues to pose C immense challenges for health care systems, particularly to intensive care services. The burden of COVID-19 on health care resources of affected patients in countries other than Australia indicates that approximately 5-16% of confirmed COVID-19 cases required admission to intensive care units (ICU) Grasseli et al., 2020) . This is predominately due to COVID-19 related shortness of breath resulting in hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (Bhatraju et al., 2020) .Following the first reported COVID-19 case in Australia on 25 January 2020 (Liebig et al., 2020) , transmission continued, with strict public health measures implemented in March 2020.ICU services however, outside of Australia were struggling to deal with a surge in critically ill COVID-19 cases (Liew et al., 2020) . ICU nurses in Australia were acutely aware of international trends and thus had to be prepared to respond to this potential situation nationally.Being at the forefront of the ICU and having the most amount of close patient contact, nurses have a professional obligation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic through delivering health care to critically ill infected patients (Liew et al., 2020; Seale et al., 2009) . A nurse's willingness to provide nursing care during a pandemic can be influenced by their own perceptions of risk of exposure to COVID-19, but also fear for their family's health (Corley et al., 2010) . This perception of risk cannot be underestimated as in some instances, nurses have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a direct consequence of working during a pandemic (Corley et al., 2010; Ives et al., 2009) .Previous research Fernandez et al., 2020; Koh et al., 2005; Liu & Liehr, 2009 ) on the psychological distress and wellbeing of health care workers during a pandemic, have indicated that many health care workers exhibit high levels of psychological stress, have concerns about stigmatization and internalize fear associated with their own personal health and their family's wellbeing and health. Nurses' anxiety, concerns and psychological distress in previous pandemic responses have been substantially associated with social isolation, physical and emotional exhaustion, increased job stress, media scrutiny and rapidly changing information and communication (Liu & Liehr, 2009; Maunder, 2004) .Psychological distress can likely cause both short and long term effects on the nursing workforce (Liu & Liehr, 2009 ) of which there is already a shortage. Gaining an understanding of their motivations and willingness to engage in their professional duty of providing nursing care in the midst of extreme challenges can inform future pandemic planning and identify strategies to alleviate psychological distress. To date, there is limited literature on nurses' willingness to provide nursing care during a pandemic; what evidence there is, predominately relates to hypothetical situations. This study explores the willingness of ICU nurses to provide nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic with the purpose of identifying the response of nursing staff to the pandemic and implementing support services to assist current and future pandemic response.This prospective cross-sectional study design to explore ICU nurses' willingness to provide nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken at a large principal and referral teaching hospital in Sydney, NSW Australia. All registered nurses, including nurse educators and Nurse Unit Managers (NUMs) who worked in the ICU during the study period (25 March -3 April 2020) were invited to participate in the study. Potential participants were asked to partake in the study via a link to the survey in their work email. Completion and submission of the questionnaire were considered as implied consent. No identifiable information was obtained and participants were informed that their participation was voluntary.Data collection occurred during the study period 25 March to 3 April 2020, capturing the first few weeks under the newly implemented COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire via a SurveyMonkey link. The questionnaire was investigator developed based on an extensive literature review. The questionnaire was then reviewed and tested for content validity by a panel of experts in ICU and nursing academics.Information collected in the questionnaire included: (1) demographic data (age, gender, employment status, and length of time worked as a registered nurse and in the ICU, (2) willingness to work in ICU during the pandemic (1 item) (3) knowledge about COVID-19 (4 items), (4) communication from managers about COVID-19 (2 items), (5) preparedness of the ICU (2 items) and (6) personal concerns about COVID-19 (1 item). Participants were asked to respond to the questions using a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree=0, disagree=1, neither agree nor disagree=2, agree=3, strongly agree=4), with two questions requiring an open-ended response.Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) for this study 2020/ETH00827.Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS version 25. Categorical data was presented as percentages and continuous data as means and standard deviation (SD). T-tests and one-way ANNOVA were used to assess the relationship between willingness to provide nursing care and the demographic variables. Pearson's correlational analysis was used to investigate the relationships between willingness to care and knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, communication from managers, preparedness of the ICU and personal concerns. Only scores for knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, communication from managers, preparedness of the ICU and personal concerns scores were included in a standard multiple linear regression analysis to determine the predictors of willingness to provide nursing care. The Beta (B) values and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated in the multiple regression analyses. Statistical significance was set at p less than 0.05.Qualitative data consisted of responses to open-ended questions. Data analysis was undertaken using a qualitative thematic analysis conducted by two authors independently. The qualitative data was used to gain a deeper insight on the quantitative data.A total of 83 ICU nurses (64 females and 17 males) completed the survey. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 42% (83/198). Sixty six percent of the respondents were aged below 35 years and the majority (82%) worked full time. A quarter of the nurses (n=20) had worked as a registered nurse for three years or less and half had worked in the ICU for three years or less (Table 1) .Sixty percent of the respondents reported that they had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 and agreed that they understood how to protect their patients and themselves during the COVID-Willingness to care for patients has been defined as the nurses' intention or wanting to provide nursing care during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess ICU nurses willingness to provide nursing care for a patient with COVID-19 during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This study is novel as it was conducted immediately following the declaration of the pandemic by the WHO and thus at the height of community distress and fear.Our study demonstrated that 61% of the nurses were willing to provide nursing care for a patient in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are higher than in previous studies (Wong et al., 2010; Etokidem et al., 2012 , Damery et al., 2009 Irvin et al., 2008 ) where willingness to care during a pandemic ranged from 23% (Wong et al., 2010) to 50% (Irvin et al., 2008) . Conversely, a study (Ma et al., 2011) conducted in an ICU in China reported a high (82.3%) willingness to care during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. These results could be due to the fact that the majority (90%) of the staff had received training in caring for a patient with H1N1 prior to the commencement of the study and knowledge training prior to patient care was an independent predictor of willingness to care for patients with H1N1. Notably, there was a vaccine available for H1N1 influenza, which may have increased the ICU staffs' willingness to care as the vaccine could be viewed as a protective mechanism. Results from our study concurs with the previous study (Ma et al., 2011) where ICU nurses with greater knowledge about COVID-19 were more willing to provide nursing care for patients.What is new in our study is that it was conducted in the midst of the pandemic when there was limited knowledge globally about the pathobiology of COVID-19. It is also interesting to note that regardless of their knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, their perceptions of the preparedness of the ICU and their personal concerns, the multiple regression analysis identified organizational communication regarding COVID-19 as the only predictor of ICU nurses' willingness to provide nursing care. That is nurses who felt that they received higher level of communication from the organization were more willing to provide nursing care during the pandemic. Our study was conducted in the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and the ICU had instantaneously implemented additional communication strategies to update staff with the latest information about COVID-19 in order to allay anxiety and engender confidence in working in the ICU. Such communication included information about the transmission of COVID-19, restrictions required due to the risks associated with COVID-19, use of PPE, availability of education and access to mental health services. The specific communication strategies implemented in the ICU in our study were: The COVID Chronicle, which was a weekly newsletter of updates regarding COVID-19; The COVID-19 FAQ, which was a daily factsheet to answer the many questions staff had, that was emailed to staff and also displayed as a hard copy in the main staff areas; a daily COVID-19 staff huddle to update key staff; and lastly, a face to face question and answer session during in-service time that occurred 3 times a week to capture all ICU staff. The most efficient and effective communication strategy implemented was the daily COVID-19 staff huddle and the COVID-19 FAQs.Our study found that the majority (94%) of ICU nurses reported that they understood the risk of COVID-19 for patients, however just over half of the ICU nurses (60%) felt they had sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19. In addition, many (77%) agreed that they understood how to protect their patients and themselves from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note is the high level of reported understanding of the risks of COVID-19 to patients among ICU nurses compared to the lower levels of participants reporting sufficient knowledge for self. Perhaps understanding high level of risks to patients could be associated with ICU nurses obtaining their information from mass media coverage of the effects of the pandemic on patients globally. Furthermore, ICU nurses are often experienced at caring for patients with respiratory complications, which may have contributed to their higher levels of knowledge regarding protecting patients. The lower levels of participants identifying insufficient knowledge for self, could be due to COVID-19 being a novel virus, where global understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease was limited. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with the results of a study by Ma et al., (2011) undertaken in a Chinese ICU during the H1N1 influenza pandemic which found that less than half the ICU staff reported sufficient knowledge, despite receiving education sessions.Interestingly, the willingness of ICU nurses in our study to provide nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic had no association with demographic factors. That is, irrespective of age, gender or years of experience, ICU nurses are willing to work during the pandemic. These results are similar to another study (Ma et al., 2011) that demonstrated no difference between willingness to care and demographic variables. These studies emphasis that ICU nurses need to feel protected in order to perform their duties regardless of their age, gender or years of experience. A sense of confidence in their skills, knowledge, safety and risk perceptions have been identified in a systematic review (Aoyagi et al., 2015) as enablers for health care workers willingness to care during the pandemic. Our study identified that the majority (90%) of the nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their family, which could have an effect on their willingness to care. Providing nurses with adequate information and resources on how to protect themselves may assist with alleviating any fears associated with transmission of COVID-19 to family members. Concerns for personal and family safety was a synthesized finding from a systematic review undertaken by Fernandez et al., (2020) who examined nurses' experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic. Therefore, it is vital that pandemic preparedness planning include comprehensive communication strategy for ICU staff, which in turn can reduce factors that cause hesitation and increase factors that cause motivation for willingness to provide nursing care during a pandemic. The ICU in our study was proactive and instituted early strategic communications activities based on scientifically derived risk communications principles. This provided adequate and essential communication which enabled the ICU nurses to improve their knowledge about caring for a patient the COVID-19 pandemic. It also facilitated being able to make the best possible decisions within short time frames in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on mortality and morbidity.Like all studies, our study has several limitations that require acknowledgement. Firstly, there is the potential for selection bias due to only 83 ICU nurses who responded to the survey.Additionally, our study was conducted in a single centre. Conducting a multicentre study would have provided more robust evidence. While the findings of the single centre study may be relevant to and resonate with other centres, the results are not generalisable to all ICUs. A further limitation of this study was that it did not assess previous experience or training in pandemic or emergency preparedness response. Further studies will need to assess these.This study highlights that ICU nurses' willingness to care is associated with receiving adequate and timely communication from managers. Once again, highlighting the importance of staff management relationships. It is imperative that nurses working in ICUs during a pandemic have all the information they need to rapidly and accurately provide high standards of nursing care. Enabling a rapid response in a pandemic situation has the potential to significantly save lives.Nil funding.Nil conflict of interest. ","Australia","abstract","2020-10-01",10

In the absence of a vaccine or effective pharmaceutical treatments, modelling indicates the potential of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19related demand on health systems by two-thirds and to halve deaths [1] .People who inject drugs (PWID), sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, and people in prisons and closed settings, comprise key populations in the response to HIV [2] . In 2020, key populations and their sexual partners accounted for almost two-thirds of new HIV infections globally [3] . Older people, men, and those with medical comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and compromised immunity, are at higher risk of COVID-19 complications [4] . Several risk factors for complications, including smoking and vaping drugs, are elevated among key populations [5] . In many settings, key populations also face stigma and discrimination, criminalization, homelessness and food insecurity, which may also exacerbate vulnerability to COVID-19 complications. However, conditions faced by key populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including the underlying epidemiology of both HIV and COVID-19. As highlighted by Sohn et al. [6] , the concentration of COVID-19 risk is similar to HIV, where overlapping and intersecting individual, network and structural risks influence both acquisition and transmission and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes [7] , as well as the ability to comply with public health prevention measures.This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes including access to prevention, treatment and care, and the need to respect health and human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic, before addressing populationspecific issues and concerns.2 | DISCUSSION 2.1 | Common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes Trust and respect for human rights have long been recognized as central to effective responses to HIV. Four decades of the HIV epidemic have taught us that restrictive and stigmatizing measures drive people underground, perpetuate stigma, erode trust and respect for human rights and disproportionately impact vulnerable populations [8] . The potential for both the COVID-19 pandemic, and the responses to it, to amplify existing inequalities underlines the need to address criminalization, stigma and discrimination, which are also structural drivers of the HIV epidemic. Discriminatory law enforcement and overly restrictive lockdown orders may disproportionately impact key populations and undermine public health strategies and community trust in Government [8] with increasing reports of sex workers, PWID, MSM and transgender people being fined arrested or detained for breaching COVID-19 related restrictions [9] .It is important to remember that the HIV epidemic is not over, with 38 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) globally and 1.7 million new infections in 2019 [3]. COVID-19-induced supply chain issues may also disproportionately impact key populations reliant on access to medications such as antiretroviral treatment (ART), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and opioid agonist treatment (OAT), as well as services such as viral load monitoring, HIV and STI testing and condom and needle syringe distribution. In July 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that numerous countries had experienced disruptions to provision of ART during the COVID pandemic [10] . Clinics around the world have reduced hours, reallocated staff or closed, leaving millions of PLHIV with uncertain access to treatment [10] . South Africa, with 20% of the world's PLHIV and 3.5 of an estimated 7.7 million PLHIV not virally suppressed [11] , has the highest COVID-19 cases in Africa and ranks in the top 20 globally for COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population [12] .In addition to disruptions in access to essential medicines, commodities and health services, some key populations are at increased risk of indirect impacts arising from responses to COVID-19, particularly physical distancing measures. The negative consequences of these measures on general population health and well-being, such as mental health issues arising from isolation, loss of income and residential instability, will be exacerbated in vulnerable key populations who lack the resources to physically distance or who do not have access to social safety nets or the option of working from home [6] . In low-income countries characterized by a high burden of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, malaria and HIV/AIDS, structural and environmental conditions which impede adherence to physical distancing and hygiene measures will differentially impact key populations [13] .UNAIDS has cautioned against the use of COVID-19 emergency powers or public health justifications to restrict human rights and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized groups [14, 15] and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has expressed concerns about the use of imprisonment for noncompliance with public health measures [16] . There is a need for independent mechanisms to oversee the use of police powers and to ensure that police are accountable for their actions during the pandemic. To safeguard against the pandemic being used to introduce or expand laws, penalties and police powers that criminalize key populations, UNAIDS recommends that COVID-19 emergency laws and powers are necessary, proportionate, non-arbitrary, evidence-informed and lawful, as well as time-limited and renewable only through appropriate democratic mechanisms [17] . Across all key populations, meaningful community participation by civil society will be essential to minimize the potential for collateral damage, maintain momentum towards Global HIV targets and to ensure that the COVID-19 response, or ""cure, "" is not worse than the disease itself.Global networks, including the International Network of People who use Drugs (INPUD), the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), the Global Network of People Living with HIV (GNP+) and MPact Global Action for Gay Men's Health and Rights have issued statements calling for urgent action to protect their communities and to address population-specific needs for prevention, care and treatment [9,18-20]. Challenges faced by key populations and how networks and communities are responding vary; below we highlight some of these considerations and contexts in order to illustrate the heterogeneity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts.Compared to the general population, PWID have a high burden of comorbid medical conditions [21] , exacerbated by criminalization and socio-economic disadvantage [22] , which place them at greater risk of infection and complications. Restrictions on access to key services for PWID have the potential to increase overdose deaths and HIV and HCV transmission, undermining gains made by global elimination efforts [23] . These services, including Needle Syringe Programs (NSP) and OAT, have historically required frequent attendance and restricted access to takeaway OAT [24] . COVID-19 travel bans and border closures are also impacting illicit markets, with shortages of precursor chemicals, declining availability of opioids and increasing prices in some settings [25] potentially increasing demand for OAT and naloxone [24] .Countries such as Nepal and Morocco, with moderate HIV prevalence among PWID at 7 to 9% and limited COVID-19 epidemics with less than one death per 100,000 population [12] , have responded by working to ensure supplies of OAT for multimonth dispensing (MMD) and providing unsupervised dosing. Canada, a country with 11% HIV prevalence among PWID, and a severe COVID-19 epidemic with 21.3 deaths per 100,000 population [12] , has introduced biometric vending machines that dispense prescribed supplies of hydromorphone tablets to registered patients [26] . As government services have closed or reduced their hours, drug users and peer-run services, have stepped up to maintain and provide harm reduction services to PWID, as well as distributing OAT, ART and HCV medications to those in lockdown [27] . Modifications have also been made to harm reduction programmes, including the distribution of supplies through outreach, pharmacies, vending machines and post and services previously rejected or under-scaled by policy makers, such as take-home dosing of methadone or hydromorphone. While policy changes to accommodate unsupervised OAT demonstrate not only that flexibility in OAT delivery is possible and can be done safely and effectively, OAT continues to be unavailable in many settings including Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Cameroon, Egypt, Nigeria and Russia [27].In many settings sex workers remain vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) due to multiple factors including criminalization, challenges negotiating consistent condom use, unsafe working environments, stigmatization, discrimination and violence [28, 29] . Global COVID-19 induced bans on sex work, including closures of brothels, mean that sex workers have faced loss of income and are unable to provide for themselves and their families [18] . Furthermore, reduced numbers of clients and school closures may disproportionately impact women with responsibility for school-aged children. In most countries, national social protection schemes and emergency protection measures put in place for workers exclude sex workers, particularly where sex work is criminalized. This exclusion means that many sex workers are faced with putting their safety, health and lives at increased risk in order to survive. Sex worker organizations have responded rapidly by providing resources, including getting started in online/non-contact work, working safely during the COVID-19 pandemic and dealing with stress and emotional impacts, as well as implementing income support programmes. Bangladesh, where HIV prevalence among sex workers is low at 0.2% and COVID-19 related deaths are also low at less than one per 100 000 population [12] , is one of the few countries that has provided emergency income support for sex workers.In the absence of income support, sex work may be driven further underground with significant health and safety risks [30] . Migrant sex workers and those who use drugs may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation by clients, including unsafe work practices and lower prices. Sex workers have been targeted by police for physical distancing offences in several countries and COVID-19-related policing of public health, including punitive crackdowns, raiding of homes, compulsory testing, arrests and threatened deportations of migrant sex workers [18], has the potential to undermine access to health services, as well as sex workers' ability to report crimes against them.Social connectedness has been shown to promote health seeking and risk reduction, including access to HIV treatment and HIV PrEP among gay and bisexual men (GBM) [31] . Lockdowns and physical distancing also threaten to undermine the centrality of peer support to optimizing health outcomes in this population. However, early research suggests that some GBM in high-income countries have adapted their sexual behaviour [32] . In Australia where HIV prevalence in this population is 18% and COVID-19 transmission has been limited to date, GBM dramatically reduced their sexual contacts following the introduction of physical distancing restrictions [33] . For many in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) community, the family home may not be a safe place. In Uganda where HIV prevalence among GBM is estimated at 85%, a raid on an LGBTI community shelter resulted in 19 people arrested and detained without access to bail, legal representation or medication for allegedly violating physical distancing measures [14, 20] . Their release was eventually secured after significant efforts by civil society and a court later awarded compensation for rights violations [8] .On any given day, <10 million people, including pre-trial detainees, are incarcerated worldwide, with an estimated 3.8% living with HIV, 15.1% with HCV, 4.8% with chronic HBV and 2.8% with active tuberculosis (TB) [17] , in conditions where physical distancing is impossible. Many more are detained in compulsory drug detention, asylum seeker and immigration detention, and private drug treatment centres [9] . In the US, COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in prisons and jails, including in New York, Illinois and Ohio, with both staff and detainees infected [34, 35] . Interim guidance by the United Nations OHCHR and the WHO has urged governments to reduce the number of people in detention by finding ways to release those at increased risk of COVID-19, including older detainees and people with underlying health conditions, as well as children and those with low risk profiles and people incarcerated for minor offences [16].Estimates of the size of the transgender population vary by location, however population-based surveys report 0.5% to 1.0% of adults identify with a gender different to their sex assigned at birth [36] . Similarly, HIV prevalence estimates among transgender populations are highly variable within and across geographic locations, although evidence suggests transgender populations are disproportionately impacted by HIV [37] . In some Latin American countries, where HIV prevalence among transgender feminine people is typically >10% [36] , Governments implemented gender-based lockdown policies, with designated days residents were permitted to leave the home based on their gender. These policies led to reports of discrimination and violence against transgender people who were away from home on a day that corresponded to their gender identity but did not match the gender listed on their identification documents [8] .In many settings, disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of livelihoods, changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing and discriminatory and coercive policing have the potential to inflict more damage on vulnerable communities than SARS-Cov2. UNAIDS and WHO have called for a ""people-centred approach"" to ensure access to medication is maintained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic [17] . Expediting differentiated service delivery such as telehealth and expanded MMD for ART for PLHIV and OAT and NSP for PWID [38] , and the roll-out of adaptive programmes like social protection support for sex workers, are essential to ensure that COVID-19 is not used to disregard and further disenfranchise key populations. Communities are uniting to find solutions and several countries, including African and South American nations, have developed and/or implemented community-based ART distribution policies to reduce demands on health systems and to encourage people to stay at home [8] .COVID-19 has the potential to reverse decreases in HIV, TB and viral hepatitis mortality, however, its impacts on key populations are likely to be uneven. PWID and sex workers face particular challenges in relation to physical distancing, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that MSM and transgender people in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their risk of adverse outcomes. While successful containment of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings also protects prisoners and detainees, this group remains vulnerable to the negative health consequences of social isolation. And under COVID-19 pandemic conditions, PLHIV in resource constrained settings with fragile health systems will be more likely than PLHIV in the global north to experience ART interruptions which compromise their health.Research is also needed to guide public health responses. Consistent with the ""right to science""' [39] , interventions to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19 need to be accessible and available to all, especially key populations for whom COVID-19 is a pandemic on top of one or more epidemics. This has been reinforced by a recent call for a people's vaccine which guarantees COVID-19 vaccines are available free of charge to everyone, everywhere with access prioritized for front-line workers, vulnerable people and low-and middle-income countries [40] . Biomedical, socio-economic and behavioural data on the impacts of COVID-19 on key populations are needed, including studies designed to assess how specific policy responses increase or decrease exposure to harmful consequences and to monitor the impact of changes to service delivery. Existing surveillance mechanisms, with appropriate rights-based legal safeguards, must be adapted to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on established epidemics, including HIV and viral hepatitis, in key populations [32] . Understanding the impacts of lockdowns and physical distancing measures on key populations will be critical to monitoring trends in HIV and other infections.Heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic and in the ability of key populations to protect themselves from COVID-19 and its consequences necessitates rapid development and implementation of evidence-informed interventions that address the population determinants of transmission and local risks, while remaining sensitive to differences in the needs of key populations and the synergistic impacts of structural factors on particular communities. One of the key lessons from the HIV epidemic was that prevention responses are more effective when communities are empowered with knowledge about the virus and how to mitigate risk and are involved in, or lead, the process of developing inclusive responses. Greater solidarity with, more guidance from, and the meaningful involvement of, key populations who are working to fill gaps in prevention, care and treatment, information and advocacy, is required to shape the COVID-19 response. While COVID-19 has exposed the moral and political barriers to implementing evidencebased public health responses [41] , the willingness to set aside ideological objections to services such as unsupervised OAT in order to save lives may be short-lived. There is an urgent need for advocacy to ensure that the introduction or scale up of evidence-based interventions during COVID-19 are sustained and integrated into routine service delivery. Working together to understand how key populations experience, engage with and emerge from, COVID-19 pandemic-induced change, developing responses that address populationspecific needs, and ensuring that no-one is left behind, will be vital to a post-COVID-19 transition to a more sustainable, equitable and resilient society.

In the same time frame, Australia reported over 25,000 confirmed cases and about 800 deaths from COVID-19 [2] . Although the case fatality rate was low in Australia compared to other developed countries such as USA or UK, people were distressed due to the nature of transmission (i.e. through direct or indirect contact) and the rapid spread within the communities, which radically changed regular lifestyles for most Australians [3] .In order to limit the spread of COVID-19, the Australian Government introduced physical distancing rules including restrictions on social gatherings, strict lockdowns, and border closures with a pause on all social, cultural and sporting activities [2] . These restrictions were likely to have tremendous impact on the social, psychological and economic wellbeing of Australians living through this pandemic [4] . Strict border closures and physical distancing measures played a crucial role in reducing the spread of community transmission resulting in a 'flattening of the curve' from late March to mid-June 2020. However, Australia has faced a second wave of pandemic with the highest increase of daily case number of more than 700 in the state of Victoria in early August 2020 [2] . Many small businesses were closed due to the imposed restrictions from late March 2020 and the unemployment rate increased to 15% in June 2020 compared to 9% in June 2019 [4, 5] . Stricter restrictions and night-time curfews were implemented in the State of Victoria solely to curb the spread of infection. The continued impact of restrictions and the uncertainty around going back to normal were likely to affect personal and social life as well as mental wellbeing of all Australians [4] . Ongoing restrictions were likely to impact physical health as well, specifically those with chronic diseases. Health care seeking behaviour was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients limited their in-person visits to their general practitioners (GPs) to avoid the possible risk of transmission from suspected/asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and have started to access telehealth facilities [6] . Moreover, social isolation, along with uncertainty in employment status could have triggered risky behaviours such as increased smoking and alcohol intake [4] .Frontline workers including the health care workers were at increased risk of infection during the COVID-19pandemic. Evidence suggests that frontline healthcare workers, who were directly involved in the collection of samples, diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients during an outbreak, were also at higher risk of developing psychological distress and mental health symptoms [7] . Anxiety, distress, depression, fear of spread of infection to family, friends and colleagues, anger and confusion were some of the immediate psychological impacts documented among frontline healthcare workers [4, 8] . Ongoing restrictions, uncertainty of returning to normal life and deaths that were avoidable under usual circumstances were also likely to increase people's risk of developing long-term mental health issues [9] . It was, therefore, important to understand the extent of the mental health burden in communities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This study will assist in designing appropriate psychosocial interventions and will provide a baseline against which such interventions could be assessed.Evidence examining factors associated with psychological distress and fear due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was limited. A recently published study suggested that increased psychological distress was more common among middle-aged single women and mothers, and those in lower-income categories [4] . Prior evidence suggested that lack of sleep, increased smoking and alcohol intake were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress during the pandemic [8] . Another study found that psychological distress was associated with self-reported mood disorder and lifestyle changes [3] . However, evidence-based evaluations on psychological distress, fear and coping strategies were relatively scarce [8] . To address this gap, the aim of the current study was to (a) Assess the extent of psychological distress and the level of fear of COVID-19 among residents in Australia, and (b) Identify coping strategies and key factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping during the pandemic period.This anonymous cross-sectional study was hosted on the online platform Qualtrics and distributed using social media (Facebook, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn), text messages and emails. Participants were recruited from GP and Allied Healthcare settings, and community groups via the online platform across all states and territories in Australia between 1st and 30th June 2020.Australian residents aged ≥18 years and capable of responding to an online questionnaire in English were invited to participate. Study participants included (a) patients who attended a general practice or an allied healthcare setting, either for face-to-face or telehealth consultations in the last four weeks irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms; (b) Frontline workers (full time, part time or casual) who were in contact with patients/ clients (with known or unknown status of COVID-19) in the last four weeks, and (c) Community members, who did not consult with GP or allied health service providers in the last four weeks.All participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. Sample size was calculated using OpenEpi. Considering 25,464,116 as the population of Australia [10] , the prevalence of lifetime mental health issues amongst Australians at 45% [11] , at 95% confidence intervals and 80% power, the estimated minimum sample size was 381. Snowball sampling was used to recruit the study participants.An online link of the web-based questionnaire was developed using Qualtrics from the Federation University Australia after the ethics approval. The initial eligibility question was related to age and place of residence, which on fulfilling, participants had the opportunity to consent and commence the main study questionnaire. The anonymous questionnaire was introduced and the invitation with the online link and QR code was shared on social media platforms, emails, and text messages. No information which could potentially identify any study participants such as name, residential address, patient identification number were collected. Patients, who visited GP clinics or Allied Healthcare settings, were informed about the study by either receptionists or healthcare professionals. Study details with the survey link and QR code were also displayed at those settings, therefore, any patient willing to participate in the study could access the link by scanning the code or accessing the survey link. However, neither health professionals nor investigators were aware of the patients who participated in the study. Patients had the freedom to complete the questionnaire at their convenience at home or while waiting to visit health professionals, and the online questionnaire did not collect any identifying information from patients.A structured online survey questionnaire was used to collect data from participants, which was developed based on evidence from studies published previously [12] [13] [14] [15] . Data were collected regarding socio-demographics, which included age, gender, state, postcode, living with or without family members, country of birth, and completed level of education. Data regarding profession and current employment condition including the impact of COVID-19 on occupation, self-identification as a frontline health or other essential service worker were also collected. In addition, the collected data included self-reported co-morbidities (cardiac diseases, stroke, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory illness, psychological/ mental health problems), behavioural risk factors (smoking and alcohol intake), health service utilization in the last four weeks including type of service providers and access to mental health resources, and history of exposure to COVID-19 including diagnosis and testing. Psychological impact was assessed by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) [16] , fear was assessed by the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) [17] , and coping strategies were assessed by the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) [18] . K10 was found to be a valid and reliable tool, with wide applications in research and clinical practice [16, 19, 20] ; FCV-19S was developed more recently in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19, which was validated and tested for reliability in a few recent studies [17, 21, 22] ; validity and reliability had also been tested for BRCS in earlier studies [18, 23, 24] . K10 has 10 items and response to each item in the questionnaire was measured using a 5-point Likert scale (none, a little, sometimes, most of the time, all the time). All items were scored, and the total score categorised into low (score 10-15), moderate (score [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , high (score 22-29) and very high (score . FCV-19S has seven items and the response to each item was also measured using a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree), with scores categorised into low (score 7-21) and high (score [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . BRCS has four items and responses were collected again using a 5-point Likert scale (does not describe me at all, does not describe me, neutral, describes me, describes me very well), with scores similarly categorised into low (score 4-13), medium (score [14] [15] [16] and high (score 17-20) resilient copers. Following ethics approval, the questionnaire was pre-tested and finalised with feedback from the research team.The database was downloaded from Qualtrics and analysed using SPSS v.25 and STATA v.12. Descriptive analyses were used to describe the study variables. Mean and standard deviations were calculated for the continuous variable (age) and for each scale (K10, FCV-19S and BRCS). To conduct inferential analyses, K10 was defined into low (score 10-15) and moderate to very high (score , and BRCS was also defined into low (score 4-13) and medium to high (score 14-20) resilient copers. Participants, who took < 1 min to complete the questionnaire, were excluded from the analyses. Initially, the factors associated with psychological distress were identified by comparing low and moderate to very high distress on the K10 scale, factors associated with fear of COVID-19 were identified by comparing low and high fear on the FCV-19S scale, and factors associated with coping were identified by comparing low and medium to high resilient copers on the BRCS scale using Chi-square test. Statistical significance was determined by p < 0.05. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the strength of association, which yielded odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate analyses were conducted by adjusting the socio-demographic variables (age, gender, living status, country of birth, education, and employment status), and presented as adjusted OR (AOR) with 95% CI.Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) at Federation University Australia (B20-036). Data were collected anonymously and delinked for this online survey. Information on contacting BeyondBlue hotline (free of cost and 24/7 availability) was included in the participant information sheet for any respondent feeling distressed while completing the study questionnaire.A total of 587 individuals participated in this study, the majority hailing from Victoria (88.2%). Mean age (±SD) of the participants was 41.3 (±12.5) years and 61.8% were females. Most of them (77.1%) lived with partners and/or children. More than half of the participants (59.5%) were born outside of Australia. More than twothirds of the study population (418, 71.5%) completed at least a Bachelor course. The majority had a source of income (401/561, 71.5%) during this pandemic, and 76.3% (160/561) were perceived to have moderate to a great deal of distress due to a change of employment status due to COVID-19. Around 59% of participants also reported financial impact due to COVID-19. More than one-third (42.3%) identified themselves as frontline or essential service workers, including doctors (11%), nurses (9%) and medical receptionists (3.8%) ( Table 1) .Half of the study participants did not report any comorbidity, and 7.2% reported having pre-existing psychiatric or mental health issues. The majority of the participants (86.6%) were never smokers and more than half (63%) did not report drinking alcohol in the last four weeks. However, of those who smoked and drink alcohol, 42.4 and 31.4% reported increased smoking and alcohol drinking in the last four weeks, respectively. One in five participants (17.8%) provided direct or indirect care to the family members or patients with a known or suspected case of COVID-19, and 13.9% reported selfisolating prior to receiving negative test results or had an overseas travel history. One in ten participants (11.4%) visited healthcare providers in person, and 8.9% had telehealth consultation in the last four weeks for any reason, while 6.9% had a consultation due to COVID-19 related stress. The latter group who consulted to overcome stress related to COVID-19 used a range of service providers including GPs (31.6%), mental health support services (21.1%), psychologists (15.8%) and psychiatrists (7.9%) ( Table 1) . Almost a third of the participants experienced high to very high levels of psychological distress (33%) and high levels of fear of COVID-19 (31.9%) with almost all of them (97.3%) being low resilient copers (Tables 2, 3, and 4).Univariate analyses showed that younger participants, participants living without family members, females, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, those that did not identify themselves as frontline workers, those with increased smoking and alcohol drinking in the last four weeks, those self-isolating, those who used health service in general or used health service to overcome COVID-19 related stress in the last four weeks and those with a higher level of fear of COVID-19 were more likely to develop moderate to very high levels of psychological distress compared to their counterparts (Table 5) . However, when potential confounders were adjusted, being female (AOR 1.74, 95% CIs 1.15-2.65, p = 0.009), pre-existing mental health conditions (AOR 3.13, 95% CIs 1.12-8.75, p = 0.029), high risk behaviours such as increased smoking (AOR 8.66, 95% CIs 1.08-69.1, p = 0.042) and increased alcohol drinking (AOR 2.39, 95% CIs 1.05-5.47, p = 0.038) in the past four weeks and higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (AOR 2.93, 95% CIs 1.83-4.67, p = 0.000) were associated with moderate to very high levels of psychological distress. Conversely, being older (60+ years) (AOR 0.29, 95% CIs 0.11-0.74, p = 0.010) and being a frontline or essential service worker (AOR 0.64, 95% CIs 0.42-0.96, p = 0.032) were associated with low levels of psychological distress ( Table 5) .Univariate analyses showed that being middle aged, living with family members, being born overseas, unemployed, those reporting moderate to a great deal of (Table 6) .When medium to high resilient copers were compared with low resilient copers based on the BRCS scale, the only significant factor was visiting healthcare providers in person in the last four weeks (OR 4.01, 95% CIs 1.30-12.4, p = 0.016). However, it did not remain statistically significant when sociodemographic variables were adjusted as potential confounders. The study respondents mentioned a varied range of experiences/activities to cope up with the stress from COVID-19. The most emerging themes included engaging in daily exercise, yoga and meditation; watching movies; listening to music and reading books; spending time with kids and partners or focusing on family members; gardening; making phone calls to friends and loved ones; engaging in hobbies one was used to; cleaning home and hand washing; ensuring safe distancing; more prayers and connecting to God; working from home; cooking and eating more; drinking and smoking; not thinking too much about the situation; not watching news/statistics about COVID-19; visiting GPs or psychologist to allay fears and distress and finally, doing nothing special.This cross-sectional study was one of the earliest carried out among residents of Australia with a view to assess the extent of and identify factors associated with psychological distress, level of fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being female and increased alcohol drinking in the past four weeks were associated with higher psychological distress and higher levels of fear of COVID-19 in this study. In addition, higher psychological distress was associated with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased smoking in the last four weeks and higher levels of fear of COVID-19 while lower psychological distress was associated with being older (60+ years) and being a frontline or essential service worker. A higher level of fear was associated with being 30-59 years old, perceived distress due to change of employment status, providing care to known or suspected case of COVID-19 and having higher level of psychological distress. On the other hand, a lower level of fear was associated with being born in Australia, having a source of income and alcohol drinking in the last four weeks. Visiting healthcare providers in person in the last four weeks was also found to be associated with coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual and community level during outbreaks of infection [25] . However, it will be somewhat early to predict similar results emanating during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, with the uncertainty surrounding an outbreak of such unparalleled magnitude. A recent study carried out in 194 cities in China showed 53.8% respondents rating psychological impact as moderate to severe [14] . This finding coincides with our study as it raised almost similar levels (moderate to very high level) of psychological distress (62.6%) among the study participants. A study from the UK showed that the prevalence of poor mental health was 37% amongst participants who were in isolation or maintaining social distancing, where poor mental health was defined as having moderate to severe depressive symptoms and anxiety [26] . Similarly, the Australian Bureau of Statistics had been collecting COVID-19 impact survey data fortnightly involving a representative sample of over 1000 adults across Australia, and findings indicated twice as many adults experiencing anxiety, nervousness and restlessness compared to pre-COVID surveillance data [27] .Evidence suggests that pre-existing anxiety disorders, existing health anxiety (those who worry excessively about having or contracting illnesses), and other mental health disorders (e.g., depression and post-traumatic stress) are at risk of experiencing higher anxiety levels during the COVID-19 outbreak [28] . Similarly, our study showed a significantly higher level of psychological distress among participants having pre-existing comorbidities such as psychiatric or mental health issues. Individuals who were self-isolating prior to receiving negative results for COVID-19 also showed heightened psychological stress and this was corroborated by another study, which identified anxiousness and feelings of guilt by the quarantined persons [14] . In addition, a sense of stigma from other family members or friends might have contributed to such high levels of distress [29] . Findings related to self-identification as a frontline or essential service worker exhibiting a lower level of stress in the present study was somewhat incongruous with other initial studies, which showed a significant mental health burden on frontline healthcare workers during pandemics [30] . A recent systematic review of 59 studies with 54,707 participants showed that one or two of every five healthcare professionals reported anxiety, depression, distress and/or sleep problems during the current COVID-19 pandemic, which were primarily associated with increased workload [31] . Due to the small number of participants, our study could not conduct subgroup analyses focusing on frontline healthcare providers and our findings of lower levels of distress among these groups could be due to the prolonged exposure of the pandemic period, being accustomed with service provision as frontline workers and/or availability of personal protective equipment. The COVID-19 pandemic also led to maladaptive behaviours, including increased smoking and alcohol intake due to stress and social isolation [4] . Previous studies also found that patients with a history of smoking are at higher risk of severe COVID disease, and those admitted to intensive care, may require ventilation [32] . Our study has found significant association between increased smoking as well as alcohol drinking and higher psychological distress. Evidence from previous studies indicated community-wide disasters being associated with a number of behavioural health outcomes including increased mental health concerns and escalations in the use of alcohol [33, 34] . Social distancing, stay at home orders and quarantine measures may lead to boredom, uncertainty and disruption to routines and distress resulting in elevated psychological distress as found in our present study. Increased alcohol consumption might also be explained as a coping mechanism for the perceived distress as many self-medication hypotheses posit use of substances like alcohol for relieving distress [35] . Our study results are also consistent with the findings from a literature review which documented an increase in alcohol consumption for some populations, particularly men, because of added mental stress due to uncertainty about the future due to COVID-19, and economic and employment concerns experienced as a result of the pandemic [36] . The same can be stated regarding increased smoking, as most nicotine consumers reported using nicotine products as their main stress and anxiety coping mechanism. A multi-country study conducted in Italy, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States have revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, cigarette smokers have been buying more cigarettes than usual triggered by the fear that stores might run out of stock or be closed during lock down [37] . Another study from the USA reported that one-third of the participants increased their tobacco use during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent 'stay-at-home' orders; that negative behaviour was associated with sociodemographic variables and depression [38] .Our study showed females had higher distress and fear of COVID-19, which was consistent with studies from China [39] , Italy [40] and the USA [41] suggesting that female gender was a consistent predictor for psychological distress. A host of reasons can be postulated for this as females disproportionately share the larger percentage of caregiving roles, in both formal and informal sectors. They also serve as the primary caregivers more frequently, within a household, which may further accentuate their anxiety and stress in a pandemic situation [42] . The abovementioned Chinese studies also showed that young adults (aged 18-30 years) exhibited the highest level of psychological distress, which was consistent with our study findings. Such distress could be correlated with an increased use of social media, as young participants may watch and listen to much more negative news, which would then intensify their feelings of anxiety and depression in times of crisis. Higher levels of fear amongst middle-aged participants in our study were more likely due to being part of the workforce with possible financial uncertainly in the event of future job loss. This could also be a possible explanation of accentuation of psychological distress, and therefore, participants utilised more healthcare services (by physical visits or through telehealth) to overcome the COVID-19 related stress during the study period. Like previous studies, our study also found that fear of COVID-19 was a prominent risk factor for the onset and maintenance of increased alcohol consumption [36] . This explains why participants used alcohol as part of their neuro-adaptations and coping response to the stress (induced by fear) because of the pandemic and social isolation [43] .The results of our study further illuminated additional aspects of the factors relating to fear of COVID-19. Level of education did not have any impact on the fear of COVID-19. Similarly, participants had no association between fear and having any existing comorbidities or increased healthcare utilisation. No association was also found between fear and providing care to family or patients with known or suspected COVID-19. There could be multiple possible explanations for this finding. First, a third of the participants, being frontline essential workers, somehow accepted the situation and their role as caregivers or service providers to the family and population they served, respectively. Second, the pandemic was not regarded as severe in intensity in Australia during the study period (June 2020). Third, it could have been that participants were less aware of the severity of the virus; and finally, trust in the initiatives taken by the Australian Government, including stage 3 restrictions with banning of non-essential travel between and within the states and social isolation to prevent the exponential spread of the virus. Participants born in Australia also experienced less fear compared to those not born in Australia, which might be related to better knowledge about the health system, support networks and stronger coping by the Australia born residents. Another study from Australia reported that self-perceived probability of losing jobs was greater amongst people who were born overseas in a non-English speaking country compared to those who were born in Australia, which could also explain the higher psychological distress in non-Australian born residents in our study [44] . However, it was beyond the scope of this study to examine all the relevant factors. Our study demonstrated that frontline or essential workers were less fearful than their counterparts, which could be explained by the availability of increased testing and personal protective equipment for the health care and frontline workers.More respondents in our study completed bachelor and above qualifications, possibly due to higher number of front line or essential service workers taking part in this survey, who would presumably had higher education than others. According to the International Labour Market (ILO), almost 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to COVID-19 [45] . However, pervasive job loss was not evident among our study population as one-third of them were working as frontline or essential service workers who would not necessarily lose jobs during such a crisis, and other participants might have benefitted from the employment support initiative by the Australian Government like jobseeker or jobkeeper payment [46, 47] . Accordingly, employment status of our study participants might not reflect the true job loss situation in Australia due to the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.The survey responses in this study were predominantly from Victoria although the survey link was shared across all the states in Australia through various social media platforms and emails. This could be explained by the researchers' use of snowball sampling technique as community acquaintances and their accessibility to GP clinics/ allied health service facilities in Victoria than in the other Australian states. Therefore, findings of this study might be more generalisable to the State of Victoria rather than across Australia, and it was also likely that distressed individuals had responded to our survey resulting in selection bias. A significant number of participants in the study were not born in Australia, which is a reflection of the country's multiculturalism. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, almost 30% of Australians were born overseas, increasing the cultural diversity of Australia's population [48] . More females than males participated in the survey, which could be due to more frequent visits to healthcare providers by females than males [49] , and increased number of female workforce being employed in the frontline healthcare or essential service facilities/outlets [50] . Findings of our study were limited to people who could access online platforms to participate; hence, generalizability was limited to internet-literate people. Considering the restrictions of movement and social distancing, an online survey was the only viable option during the pandemic to address our research objectives. However, the strength of the study was the achievement of the target sample size within the crisis period; hence the study had significant power to test the hypotheses.Social distancing and self-isolation due to the current COVID-19 pandemic were likely to be stressful for people. Therefore, it was also important to understand responses from our study participants regarding their coping strategies, considering some groups could be more vulnerable than others to the psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Findings of our study were supported by prior research outlining coping activities like social connection with families and friends, limiting exposure to pandemic-related news, maintaining adequate sleep, nutrition, exercise, and practicing meditation (mindfulness) [51] .This study identified individuals who were at higher risk of distress and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, specifically in the State of Victoria, Australia. People with higher psychological distress increased their use of smoking and alcohol during the pandemic period, which warrants targeting behavioural interventions specifically for those groups and incorporating information on available support services to quit smoking and reduce alcohol use in health awareness campaigns during such pandemic periods of uncertainty.People with pre-existing mental health conditions were also more likely to experience higher psychological distress, which could worsen their overall wellbeing. An automated alert from primary healthcare providers to those vulnerable individuals for a follow-up visit would be invaluable in managing their distress. In addition, our study indicated that females were more vulnerable to psychological distress, and as such socio-cultural contexts rather than biomedical contexts influenced their mental health, which should be recognised and supported accordingly. Specific interventions to support the mental wellbeing of higher risk individuals as identified in this study should be considered in addition to existing resources within primary healthcare settings. Innovative technologies such as interactive mobile apps to support mental wellbeing can be developed and tested for effectiveness in future experimental studies.","Australia","abstract","2020-10-08",10

Although little has been formally reported and the full impact of these measures may not be apparent for some time, it is likely that those with chronic health conditions (CHCs) who already face a disproportionate psychosocial burden will experience additional consequences [1] . Some of these consequences are likely similar to the general population and others will relate to their existing health issues.As not all effects of the pandemic are likely to be detrimental, we outline both the potential challenges and opportunities for youth with CHCs as well as recommendations for further research and clinical care.Some of the key challenges likely to be faced by children and young people with CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic include heightened anxiety regarding health and well-being; stress of disrupted routines; academic and social challenges associated with school closures; increased risk of family stress, domestic violence, and abuse; and reduced access to physical and psychosocial support. We discuss these challenges in this section in detail, and a summary of the challenges and strategies to address them is included in Textbox 1. Encourage social/peer connection via technologyPrioritize monitoring and support of at-risk families and ensure the availability of safe houses for victims of domestic violenceEncourage families to use tele-health/digital therapies offered by health care providersFor multiple reasons, including the demands of ill health, treatment, and readjustment to usual life following periods of medical treatment, children and young people with CHCs are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, especially anxiety [2] . Currently, services for these patients are limited, as are face-to-face and eHealth interventions, particularly those targeted toward health anxiety [3, 4] . Partly due to the real dangers associated with the virus, the rapidity of lockdown, and the immediacy of social media, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly increased rates of anxiety in the general population. Among those with life-threatening illnesses such as cancer, worries about social isolation, catastrophization about personal health, and guilt about family support have been even greater [5] [6] [7] . Studies of children from China have also identified clinginess, distraction, irritability, and fear of asking questions about the pandemic, more so in those who reside in highly affected regions [8] . It is not just those with physical health issues who are vulnerable. A recent UK survey of over 2000 young people with a history of mental health problems found that 51% of participants believed that their mental health had deteriorated due to the pandemic, and many reported increased psychological distress and loneliness [9] . Fortunately, there is emerging evidence suggesting that effective communication and distraction can help to protect children's psychological health [8, 10] .There is some evidence that children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who usually thrive with predictability and routine, have been more affected by the disruption to routines during the pandemic than other groups. Children with ADHD have been found to display a greater level of symptoms that are related to family stress and can be reduced by establishing predictable new routines [11] . Those with ASD have also been found to exhibit greater behavioral concerns, especially in the face of pre-existing issues [12] . Increased physical activity has been suggested as one mechanism by which increased symptoms can be managed in these patients [13] .Children and young people spend a large proportion of their weekdays at school. Schools provide structure, intellectual stimulation, peer interaction, reliable meals, and access to recreational facilities and health care. Despite attempts to maximize online learning during lockdown, school closures are likely to have many unintended and potentially serious consequences on the psychological and physical health of children and young people [14, 15] . Thousands, if not millions, of children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by school closures and experience food insecurity and inadequate or limited access to online learning [16, 17] . Others are likely to engage in increased screen time and sedentary behaviors, just as during longer school holidays [18] , placing themselves at risk of unhealthy weight gain [19] . Youth with pre-existing mental health conditions are especially reliant on psychological support services offered through schools and will be unable to access school counsellors, nurses, and social workers [20] .It is well established that increased family stress, financial insecurity, and cumulative risk exposure in childhood are associated with worse mental and behavioral outcomes in children [21, 22] . Of particular concern, it is well documented that domestic violence is more likely in the face of chronic family stress such as caring for a child with a CHC. Moreover, chronic family stress further increases following crises such as natural disasters or disease outbreaks associated with economic stress [23] [24] [25] . Due to the focus on competing issues, vulnerable children including those with CHCs are often less likely to be identified via routine child health checks and by personnel such as health care professionals or school teachers. Coupled with the significantly reduced number of child protection assessments conducted during lockdown [26] , it is likely that COVID-19-associated lockdown, school closures, and family financial insecurity will compound family stress levels and increase the incidence of domestic violence and child abuse [14, 27] , many of whom unfortunately may not be recognized to receive appropriate support.During the past few months, a significant decline in general practitioner appointments, specialized care, and pediatric emergency department attendance has been reported in many countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Canada, Australia, China, and Italy [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . In some cases, delays in seeking treatment and lack of specialized care have had devastating effects on children with serious and life-threatening health complications including those of a psychological nature [36, 37] .Other reported disruptions to health care services include disruptions to routine child health services, such as developmental screening, vaccinations, and well-child visits, that support psychosocial well-being [31, 33] . There is also accumulating evidence to suggest that children with certain CHCs have been negatively impacted by changes to health care systems prioritizing the response to the pandemic, such as inflammatory bowel disease [38] , pediatric cancer [39, 40] , and type 1 diabetes [41] .Previously limited psychological services for children and young people with CHCs are also likely to have been affected by COVID-19-related disruptions. Countries such as Singapore have reported diverting psychological resources for youth with eating disorders to only those considered most urgent and forging partnerships with community services to manage the decrease in access to psychological therapies [42] , while other countries such as New Zealand have restricted face-to-face pediatric consult liaison services to inpatients at low risk of COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, 26% of young people with pre-existing mental health problems reported being unable to access psychological support services during the lockdown period [9] .Although children and young people with CHCs are at risk of all the previously mentioned challenges, they may also benefit in the following ways: reduced academic and social stress, increased time with families, reduced access to substances, easier access to health care using technology, and opportunities to build resilience. We discuss these opportunities in more detail in the following sections and a summary is included in Figure  1 along with related challenges. Although some degree of academic pressure may be essential for learning, the chronic stress of regular assignments, presentations, and examinations can have negative effects on students' physical and psychological health, including precipitating conditions such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders [43, 44] . Associated with the developmentally congruent drive toward conformity, adolescent peer-related stress can also affect students' health in a gender-related manner [45] . Youth with CHCs experience additional stresses related to disrupted education and peer relationships, readjustment during transitions in and out of the hospital, and the physical limitations of ill health [46] . During lockdown, all these issues are likely to occur less frequently. Additionally, for some, such as children with cystic fibrosis, the normalization of wearing masks may reduce the sense of difference and associated stigma [47] .Many children will be forced to spend weeks, if not months, with their families during lockdown. Given that domestic social capital has been shown to be more influential than school-related social capital and that it is associated with a reduced incidence of behavior problems [48] , including in people with chronic illness [49] , it is possible that many children and young people with CHCs will benefit from their parents being more available, being more involved in health care routines, and supporting them to deal with COVID-19-related or other health concerns. Family-based therapies for eating disorders [50] and other conditions may also be more effective in the context of greater parental availability. Additionally, evidence from Austria indicates that social connectedness can increase during lockdown and that it is associated with reduced distress and fatigue [51] .Up to 40% of young people with CHCs have issues related to substance abuse [52] . Pandemic-related anxiety, fear, and boredom are likely to increase the drive toward substance-related coping in this subgroup. Smoking and inhaling substances are particularly likely to increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 [53] . Fortunately, these risks are likely to be offset by reduced access to substances and, to a lesser extent, by lower financial independence and greater parental connection [54] .Due to disruptions to routine services, health professionals worldwide have had to rapidly adopt or expand digital health care via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc), Skype (Skype Technologies), and other servers or platforms. Regulatory barriers to telemedicine have also been amended due to the urgency caused by the pandemic [55] . Despite some of the limitations associated with engagement and physical examination, the necessity for patients to have access to digital devices, and the potential loss of privacy for young people, digital health care is likely to have equitably increased access to health care for many families, especially those living rurally and with limited financial means. It is also likely to have reduced the anxiety experienced by some children in medical settings and allowed health professionals to gain a better understanding of their patients' living circumstances. The pandemic may provide an additional opportunity to expand the use of existing eHealth interventions such as evidence-based internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT)-based applications, medical support, and self-management interventions [56] , and to identify ways for future interventions to improve outcomes for youth with CHCs.Resilience has been defined as the ability of an individual to withstand adversity [57] . Despite the medically and socially related stresses they experience on a day-to-day basis, most children and adolescents with CHCs manage to live productive and effective lives, thereby demonstrating their inherent resilience [52] . The current pandemic is likely to provide them with additional opportunities to withstand novel concerns about their health; alterations to health care and other routines; increased family stress; and disappointment about missing out on schooling, peer interactions, and leisure activities. With adequate family, social, and health professional support, previous studies have proved that children with CHCs can surmount significant periods of difficulty [58] .We offer the following recommendations and considerations for future research:• Longitudinal studies of physical and psychosocial well-being, including rates of common mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, self-harm, and substance use disorders as well as rates of hospitalization and suicide, should be conducted across all age groups. Although a number of these studies are already underway and listed on websites such as Covid Minds [59] , we noted that few studies are specifically targeted toward youth with CHCs.• Prospective or retrospective analyses of high-risk subgroups including those with ADHD and ASD should be undertaken.• Examination of the short-and long-term effects of school closure on personal stress, social relationships, and health care should occur.• Analysis of the impact of the naturalistic increase in time spent with families, especially in regard to conditions such as eating disorders where social capital is integral to treatment, should be considered.• Investigation of rates of domestic violence and abuse, particularly in families already experiencing chronic health-related stress, is necessary.In-depth qualitative analysis should be conducted regarding the views of patients of all ages, families, and health professionals regarding the use of digital health care, with a view to informing future service design and workforce development.• Evaluation of the effectiveness of existing digital interventions should be planned as well as the co-design and development of locally and culturally acceptable new interventions for addressing COVID-19-related issues.• Specific examination of resilience should be carried out using validated outcome measures, not merely assuming its existence in the absence of pathology.• Economic analyses should be conducted to ascertain the direct and indirect costs of pandemic-related disruption and inform planning for future events of a similar nature.In the meantime, to optimize the clinical care of children and young people with CHCs, we provide some resources and recommend readers to:• Support families to access generic advice on how best to care for children and young people during the pandemic from organizations such as the World Health Organization [60] and, where available, more specific health-related advice via sources such as the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes [61] , immunology and cancer services [62] [63] [64] , and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust [65] • Encourage families to maintain essential health care routines and to present early via appropriate channels when they have concerns about their children's well-being • Opportunistically screen for psychological issues, especially anxiety and depression, during clinical contacts using paper-based instruments such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 items and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item or electronic methods such as YouthCHAT [66, 67] • Refer those with identified issues early to available psychological services, either face-to-face or via tele-health • Recommend the use of evidence-based digital self-help, iCBT, and peer support interventions; for an up-to-date list of these, refer to websites such as One Mind PsyberGuide [68] • Encourage parents and health professionals to engage in self-care to reduce the likelihood of burnout and to sustain effective support of children and young people with CHCs during and following the pandemicAlthough the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and young people with CHCs might not be understood for a long time to come, increased awareness of the likely challenges and opportunities faced by this group and an integrated approach to their care [1] are likely to optimize their psychosocial well-being. Leveraging digital health interventions is key to addressing some of these challenges and opportunities in this vulnerable population [69] . The current circumstance also offers a unique opportunity to examine and improve a range of aspects pertaining to their care, and we sincerely hope that it provides the silver lining to a long dark cloud.","New Zealand","first author","2020-10-12",10

The causative agent, a novel betacoronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, was isolated on January 7, 2020 [2] and the genetic sequence January 10, 2020 enabling the rapid development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) to be available within a month of the outbreak's notification to the World Health Organization (WHO) *3+. Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission requires widespread testing, isolation, contact tracing of infected persons and other non-pharmaceutical interventions [4] , particularly in the absence of effective SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals and vaccines. Nucleic acid testing such as real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the predominant diagnostic method to confirm infection, however, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may not always indicate the presence or shedding of viable virus with replicative capacity and, by implication, transmissibility [5] . The diagnostic value of culture in the routine management of COVID-19 is limited by requirements of isolation to be performed under physical containment laboratory level 3 (PC3) biosafety conditions [6] , technical expertise, turnaround times (TATs), and costs. However, the ability to culture SARS-CoV-2 has important roles in providing adequate positive control material for the development, validation, evaluation and quality assurance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays; supporting the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents, and enabling research into viral virulence and transmission.Despite clinical recovery, there are a proportion of patients where SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains detectable for many days to weeks [5] . The relationship between persistent PCR positivity and virus viability is important in understanding the natural history and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether truly persistent infection occurs. This has significant implications for the release of infected persons from quarantine, particularly for those who reside in high-risk settings such as aged care, mental health and correctional facilities, or work with at-risk population groups such as A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 healthcare workers (HCWs). Persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection also has implications for patient isolation and bed management, the safe use of non-invasive ventilation and ongoing requirements for appropriate use of personal protective equipment for HCWs when caring for such patients.We investigated the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR results from respiratory tract samples collected from persons with COVID-19 to guide the safe de-isolation of those with persistently positive PCRs.April 22, 2020 were analysed. Samples were inoculated into cell culture as part of (i) routine laboratory protocol at the start of the epidemic; (ii) if collected from patients admitted to the ICU and (iii) if requested by attending physicians (usually due to persistent PCR positivity in an individual awaiting release from quarantine) or public health physicians as part of outbreak investigations.Samples were collected from the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngeal swabs and combined nose and throat swabs) and lower respiratory tract (LRT; sputum, endotracheal aspirate, nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage). URT swabs were received in 1-3 mL of viral or universal transport media (UTM), Amies transport media, or dry; stored at +4°C and tested within 12 hours of specimen receipt. and consumables influenced the targets tested. The total number of samples tested per target were: one (n=24), two (n=115), three (n=22), four (n=62) and five targets (n=11).Samples with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA were inoculated into cell culture under PC3 conditions [4] on the same day or stored at +4°C for inoculation the following day. Vero C1008 (Vero 76, clone E6, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 Where CPE was observed (generally within 2-3 days post-inoculation), SARS-CoV-2 replication was confirmed by PCR. Terminal sampling and PCR testing of culture supernatant was performed on day 4 as CPE may not be observed despite active viral replication, as seen with SARS-CoV [7] . Day 4 was chosen for terminal sampling as this was the optimal time for reading the endpoint as determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assay below. Additionally, with no medium change and using a concentration of amphotericin B (2.5g/mL), cell monolayer breakdown was observed from day 5 onwards in some cultures. instructions. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was then performed as above.A primary isolate, SARS-CoV-2/01/Human/NSW Australia|EPI_ISL_407893|2020-01-24 (GISAID), was titrated in serial one log dilutions (from 10 -1 to 10 -8 ) to obtain a TCID 50 using 24-well culture plates of Vero C1008 cells. The plates were observed daily for CPE using an inverted optical microscope for five days, and wells were considered positive if any characteristic altered cell foci were seen ( Figure   4 , Supplementary). The end-point titres were calculated according to the Reed and Muench method [8] based on four replicates for titration, and the infectious virus titre of our SARS-CoV-2 stock was 1 x 10 6.5 infectious particles per 200µL (Figure 1 ).To clarify the significance of the Ct of culture supernatant in the absence of CPE, a dilutional series of Welch's t-test, two-tailed hypothesis with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was used to compare the mean Ct of URT and LRT samples ( dilutions, and incorporating a 1 log margin of error, we were confident that any clinical sample with a Ct of ≥37 was not indicative of viable virus (Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 was significantly more likely to be isolated in inpatients compared to outpatients (45% vs 15%, p<0•001), and ICU compared with other inpatients (82% vs 45%, p=0•04) or outpatients (82% vs 15%, p<0•001) ( Table 1) In clinical samples where SARS-CoV-2 was isolated, the mean duration between symptom onset and sample collection was 4•5 days (median 3•5, range 0-18). By contrast, the mean duration between symptom onset and sample collection in culture negative samples was 20 days (median 18•4, range 3-29; p<0•001) (Figure 7, Supplementary) .Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR has been the primary diagnostic method to confirm COVID-19.As an indicator of infectivity, the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract samples is utilized in many jurisdictions as a requirement for release of persons with COVID-19 from quarantine [10] . In Australia, infected persons from high-risk settings (including but not limited to HCWs) are required to have two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 tests at least 24 hours apart A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 before being allowed to return to such settings [11] . Whilst there are reports of persistent or prolonged PCR positive results in recovered persons [12, 13] , few have provided robust data to support that they are no longer infectious. Furthermore, there is substantial variability in the duration of PCR positivity (up to 28 days after symptom onset) [12] , resulting in individuals (including HCWs) being isolated for prolonged periods given the potential risks of virus transmission. As the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples does not necessarily indicate viable infectious virions, we examined the correlation between the Ct of PCR positive samples and viral culture, a surrogate marker for infectivity. The Australian National Guidelines for Public Health Units also recommends that viral culture results be considered when deciding on the release of persons from quarantine following COVID-19 [11] .We successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from upper and lower respiratory tract samples collected from persons with acute COVID-19 and correlated the yield of cell culture with PCR Ct values. Similar to other reports [14, 15] we demonstrate that the threshold Ct where culture will be successful is <32 for the N gene target. However, this Ct is specific for our laboratory and we would recommend that diagnostic laboratories correlate their Ct values with culture results due to the variable analytical performance between different SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays [16, 17] .The cell culture method described herein relies not only on detection of CPE but incorporates PCR testing into the workflow. We demonstrate that virus with replicative capacity can be isolated and detected despite the absence of CPE by correlating the Ct of cell culture supernatant with the Ct of the original clinical samples where SARS-CoV-2 was detected. This effect was not due to any SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, however further genetic analysis may be warranted. This provides a more objective and sensitive measure of virus isolation as the detection of CPE can be subtle or absent due to low levels of virus that result in a delayed rise in virus load beyond day four in the cell lines used. This may assist in improving workflows in laboratories processing large numbers of cell A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 cultures or those with reduced capacity to detect CPE. A Ct sample cut-off >32 in our laboratory correlates with non-viable virus; and in the absence of CPE, a Ct sample -Ct culture value <3 also indicates an absence of viral replication, suggesting these individuals could be safely released from isolation.We have demonstrated that culture yield is improved when samples are collected as close to the date of symptom onset as possible, and that virus isolation is more likely in patients with more severe illness requiring admission to hospital or the ICU compared to outpatients. A previous study determined that virus may be isolated up to six days prior to symptom onset [18] , however our study did not include such a cohort. Given the TATs , culture results of samples collected from persons during the pre-symptomatic stage would not be available in a meaningful timeframe to guide clinical management but would provide laboratory evidence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We showed culture positivity out to 18 days post-symptom onset in one patient, which is ten days longer than previous findings from Singapore [15] . As paired URT and LRT samples were not collected concurrently in this study, we were not able to ascertain the relationship between the two in the context of de-isolation assessments. In the majority of persons that have clinically recovered from COVID-19, LRT samples may not be available, particularly in the absence of sputum production.We did not assess whether SARS-CoV-2 replication in the absence of CPE occurs in cell lines other than Vero C1008 cells, However, this has been described in MEK and COS cell lines during the isolation of SARS-CoV [7] . The culture-positive samples demonstrating no CPE but detectable virus replication by PCR were predominantly seen in the ICU cohort with approximately half collected from the LRT. Given the small sample size we were unable to determine whether other factors (e.g. concurrent infections, antimicrobial use) may have affected detection of CPE in these samples. Due to the limited volume of clinical sample received, culture was not set up in duplicate however quality A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 12 control to ensure the sensitivity of the cells was undertaken with a stock of titred virus to ensure a consistent LoD was maintained.The performance of our inhouse SARS-CoV-2 assay was comparable to the Roche cobas ® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), (data not shown). Due to reagent shortages, not all samples or culture supernatants were able to be tested with all five SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (E, RdRp, M, N and ORF1ab). Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the findings using the N target would be similar for the other targets as a similar pattern was observed where testing of multiple targets were performed (Figure 2 ). Nucleic acid extraction from the primary sample and culture supernatant was performed on the MagNA Pure 96 and EZ1 Advanced XL instruments, respectively. Previous evaluations of automated nucleic acid extraction instruments for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses showed superiority of the EZ1 Advanced XL compared to the MagNA Pure 96 [19] , but there are limited data on the performance of extraction instruments for SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to ascertain if different swab types or UTM affected either PCR or culture results. This study also did not investigate why certain individuals shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA for longer periods compared to others, nor were we able to determine whether there were any factors such as immunosuppression that may have explained prolonged viral shedding, and further research is recommended to address these questions.In summary, viral culture may assist clinicians to release from isolation individuals who have recovered clinically but remain persistently or intermittently positive SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Whilst there is limited availability of cell culture in most clinical diagnostic laboratories, this capacity adds important insights not provided by molecular methods and should be maintained in reference laboratories to guide clinical management and de-isolation.

Articles were required to report either on incidence or prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias due to coronavirus infection in adults, use of drug therapy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as management strategies available to address arrhythmias. We defined LQTS as a corrected QT interval (QTc) ≥ 500 milliseconds (ms) or ∆QTc by ≥ 60ms, as these are patients at greatest risk of TdP. 6 Patients with physiologic sinus tachycardia or inherited arrhythmia syndromes were excluded. Non-peer reviewed studies, editorials, conference article proceedings, theses, studies describing animal models or with alternate definition of LQTS, studies that did not report arrhythmia and published articles before year 2000 were excluded.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedAn initial limited search of Medline and Google Scholar was undertaken followed by analysis of text words contained in the titles and abstracts, and index terms used to describe identified articles. A second search, using all identified key words and index terms was undertaken across all included databases. Finally, reference lists of identified articles were manually searched for additional relevant studies, using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Appendix 4). Two authors (TK and MM), independently carried out initial screening of titles and abstracts, which were independently approved by a third author (MK) for inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved through mutual discussions before finalizing literature summary Tables 1-3 . Non-randomised designs were discussed according to guidelines provided within the Transparent Reporting of Non-randomised Designs (TREND) statement 7 and randomised control designs were discussed according to guidelines provided within the CONSORT statement. 8The risk of bias within and across the selected studies was assessed independently by two authors (TK and MM) using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools 9 for assessing prevalence data, randomised control trials and case reports/series (Appendices 5-7). This process afforded increased methodological rigour and evaluated potential bias and threats to validity (Joanna Briggs Institute 2017 https://reviewersmanual.joannabriggs.org/ ). Both reviewers were trained in use of the appraisal tool prior to this process.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedWe identified 1598 records after duplicates were removed. 1528 articles were removed on basic screening of title and abstract. 70 full-text articles were then assessed for eligibility, of which 25 records met the inclusion criteria (Appendix 4). Figure 2 demonstrates the study selection flow-chart, the types of studies included and reasons for exclusion.Included studies are summarised in tables 1, 2 and 3. A total of 4911 SARS-CoV-2 cases were extracted for assessment of the incidence of arrhythmias (Table 1) . A total of 961 patients were evaluated to calculate the incidence of long QT syndrome (LQTS) and ventricular arrythmias (VA) due to drug therapy with azithromycin (AZ) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) ( Table 3) . Several case reports were included ( Table 2) to illustrate the range of arrhythmias found secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug therapy but were not included in the cumulative incidences as establishing causality is difficult.Quality appraisals of included studies are presented in Appendices 5-7. Except for Richardson et al 10 , the underpowered sample sizes across the remaining studies is a potential for bias. Across all studies, the total number of patients analysed was 5872,which is a small representation of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 patients. There was marked non-uniformity within the selected cohorts; 99% of one cohort represented mild disease 11 , whilst in other studies patients with all degrees of severity were included based on unspecified clinical criteria. 12,13 Quantitative markers of severity like viraemia, were not used. 13, 14 In addition, some studies included patients without a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), whilst in other studies, all patients without a baseline ECG were excluded. 11, 15 These factors limit generalisability to the population.Most studies were retrospective monocentric observational studies, with biases in incomplete data collection and variations in reporting. The method used to diagnoseThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved arrhythmias and to calculate QT interval was not reported in some studies which may lead to reporting bias 10, 12, 15, 19, [26] [27] [28] . Furthermore, the retrospective study design lends itself to selection bias. We note large numbers of patients were initially screened in some studies and only a small population included for analysis. 16, 20 The diagnosis of infection was based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of samples taken from the upper respiratory tract which could lead to false negative results and therefore result in exclusion of infected patients. 11 Although repeat testing improves accuracy, all studies did not address whether further PCR testing was utilised. 11 In two studies, non-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were included in the final analysis which may cause dilution of results in the event that patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. 21, 22 Drug regimens differed in terms of combination, dosages and duration (Table 3) . Drug levels were not widely measured except by Perinel et al, however, assessment of LQTS was not their primary outcome. 17 Hence it is unclear if QTc measurements were taken at maximum drug levels. 21 Only four of ten studies reported drug-induced LQTS (DI-LQTS) as the main outcome, another potential for reporting bias. 15, [23] [24] [25] In one study, the duration of treatment was not specified. 26The incidence and nature of arrhythmias amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 was poorly documented. We retrieved data on arrhythmias in SARS-CoV-2 in only 5 of thirteen published retrospective studies, but many did not elaborate on the type of arrhythmias elicited, nor on the specific treatment regimens prescribed. This included a combination of antiviral, antibacterial, glucocorticoid therapy or human immunoglobulin therapy, in addition to supportive care ( Table 1 ). The types of arrhythmias, when specified across all studies included thirteen cases of ventricular arrhythmias -ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF), twenty-three cases of atrial arrhythmias -atrial fibrillation (AF), atrialThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved flutter and atrial tachycardia, five cases of brady-arrhythmias -atrioventricular (AV) block, sinus bradycardia and complete heart block, and 260 cases of LQTS (Tables 1,2) .Compared with non-ICU admissions, there was a larger proportion of arrhythmias found in ICU admissions in two studies (1.2-16.7% and 40-44% respectively). 13, 20 In comparison, Guo et al reported malignant VA in 5.9% of all patients and in 11.5% of patients with concurrent troponin elevation, suggesting arrhythmia occurs more commonly in this subset. 16 In addition to tachy-arrhythmias, sinus nodal disease and AV block have been described, requiring permanent pacemaker insertion ( This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedOur results demonstrate significant morbidity and mortality associated with arrhythmias (Tables 1-3 ). Based on cumulative incidence of 6.9%, we project 690,000 of ten million people infected with SARS-CoV-2 would have developed an arrhythmia, making it more arrhythmogenic than SARS and MERS. Some literature hypothesizes this to be due to increased virus affinity for ACE-2 but overall the exact reason for this remains unknown.Due to poor reporting of arrhythmias, as exemplified by retraction of two major studies, 32,33 our findings are likely an underestimation of the absolute prevalence of arrhythmias in this cohort. We postulate this to be due to still rising numbers of infected patients and subsequent demands placed on health care systems. Performing an ECG may be overlooked if patients lack symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia, in an attempt to reduce transmission and preserve scarce personal-protective equipment (PPE).evidence for conventional anti-arrhythmic agents is limited. Using AF as an example, patients were treated successfully with cardioversion or diltiazem. Amiodarone was avoided due to its QT-prolongation properties, particularly with concomitant use of other QT-prolonging agents. Beta-blockers were avoided due to risk of bronchospasm, especially in light of pneumonia or ARDS. Another concern is increased risk of thromboembolic events associated with SARS-CoV-2, and perhaps anticoagulation should be used irrespective of yearly stroke risk. 27, 34 There are no large trials addressing arrhythmia management in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence these decisions are made after assessment of risk and benefit on a case-by-case basis.Based on our calculated incidence of DI-LQTS, more than 1 million of the currently infected SARS-CoV-2 patients are at an increased risk of TdP. Treatment is aimed at targeting each of the pathways implicated in arrhythmia formation ( Figure 1 ). This is complicated as there is conflicting evidence regarding efficacy of HCQ, CQ and AZ asThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved SARS-CoV-2 viral load reducing therapy. Whilst one series of six patients found reductions in viral load with AZ and HCQ, with low rates of adverse events, 35 their cohort lacked critically ill patients with comorbidities and multi-organ failure. In severe disease, another group found no evidence of clinical benefit with combination therapy. 18 Moreover, combination antimalarial and AZ therapy is associated with high rates of SARS-CoV-2 is more virulent than other coronaviruses due to its unique S-protein and higher affinity for ACE2, explaining its pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Comorbidities such as inherited arrhythmia, polypharmacy, cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart disease and renal failure result in a lack of ""repolarisation reserve"", which predispose patients to developing LQTS. 38 Similarly, these are the same risk factors for severe respiratory compromise in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are also the target population for combination antimalarial and AZ therapy. 38The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection also increases susceptibility to LQTS. The mechanism is not fully understood but thought to occur from inhibition of potassium repolarising currents. 39 This article is protected by copyright.

This decision will be less difficult after RCTs such as RECOVERY (Table 5) .Finally, the lack of ""repolarisation reserve"" is of great concern particularly if genes such as p.

Direct infiltration of myocytes ensues which has been established in 35% of SARS-CoV patients. 1, 3, 47 Due to the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, direct invasion by SARS-CoV-2 may also occur. Indirect myocardial injury results from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The sum of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction, increased thrombogenicity, acidosis and hypoxia as well as the imbalance of T-helper 1 and 2 responses, leads to an intense release of cytokines and chemokines, particularly interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). The heightened catecholaminergic response amplifies this process. In fact, hyper-inflammation due to high levels of IL-6 results in hERG potassium channel blockade and QT prolongation, facilitating formation of unstable arrhythmias. 47 Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, as well as comorbidities such as ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal failure also contribute to arrhythmia formation by altering cardiac structure and also responsible for clinically severe disease 12,13 Another potential contributor for arrhythmia formation in the setting of COVID-19 is the common SCN5A-encoded Nav1.5 sodium channel variant p.Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A which results in a lack of ""repolarisation reserve"".

The impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 importation risk","On 11 th March the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic 1 . By then over 110,000 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in 114 countries and territories 1 . The virus with its origin in the Chinese city of Wuhan 2 , was quickly introduced into other regions and countries through international travel. As a consequence, governments around the world enforced travel restrictions and closed international borders, which resulted in a sharp decrease of passenger flights 3 . While the negative economic effects of the interventions are clearly visible and can for example be measured through financial performance indicators and an increase in unemployment, the societal benefit of restricting international travel has not been quantified. With the growth of outbreaks beginning to slow in some countries, calls to re-open borders are increasing. To assess whether it is feasible to do so, it is important to understand the risks posed by those countries that could act as importation sources.There are two major factors that influence the expected number of COVID-19 importations: incoming traveller volumes, and incidence rates of the disease in source countries. In Australia, the border force collects information about every individual entering the country, which is published in anonymised and aggregated form. To assess the travel bans implemented by the Australian government, we estimate passenger volumes for the hypothetical scenario that no travel restrictions were implemented, using seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models 4 .Country-level COVID-19 incidence data is available on the website of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). There is consensus that the ascertainment of COVID-19 cases is extremely low, with some studies claiming that less than 1% of cases are reported to authorities [5] [6] [7] [8] . Hence, the available incidence data very likely does not reflect the true scale of the pandemic and needs to be adjusted to account for this bias. We perform maximum-likelihood estimations using the observed incidence of the disease in travellers arriving into Australia to adjust the data. Similarly, to adjust for under-reporting within Australia we perform maximum-likelihood estimations using the observed incidence in Australian travellers arriving into New Zealand.In addition to incoming traveller volumes and adjusted incidence rates, our model considers the time individuals spent overseas as well as possible in-flight transmission. The model presents a flexible framework that can be used to quantify the effects of travel restrictions and to evaluate proposed relaxations. Further, it allows the identification of groups of travellers that most likely carry the virus, which can inform strategies for the optimal use of available prevention and control resources.In contrast to other studies that have looked at exportation risk from China 9-11 , our model quantifies the expected number of importations for a particular country and is global in scale. We use Australia, one of the first countries to report imported cases of the disease 12 , as a case study to demonstrate the model's capabilities. As an island country, nearly all international travel into the country is via air, which allows tighter control of international borders. Although partial border closures came into effect as early as one week after the first case was detected on 25 th January, Australia experienced an exponential growth in the number of reported imported COVID-19 cases until the end of March 13 . This study sheds light onto the effectiveness and timeliness of the individual travel bans implemented by the Australian government.We model the expected number of COVID-19 importations into Australia between 1 st January and 30 th June 2020. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. The first considers the actual travel restrictions as implemented by the Australian government. The second scenario, which we refer to as open borders, is hypothetical and assumes that no travel restrictions were enforced. Figure 1 compares the expected number of importations for the two scenarios. The first travel ban that was implemented by the Australian government affected foreign nationals travelling from, and transiting through China within the last 14 days prior to arrival 14 . Figure 1 shows a clear reduction in the expected number of importations after this restriction came into effect on 1 st February 2020, compared to the open border scenario. The difference in the expected number of importations for the two scenarios becomes smaller towards the end of the month, which is likely due to China being successful in containing the outbreak. Our results indicate that Australia was able to lower COVID-19 importations from China by 94.45% (91.77 -96.32) during the studied period. We estimate that approximately 1,938 fewer cases were imported from China, out of the total 2,052 importations projected for that period with open borders. The arrival card data reveals that the reduction of importations cannot solely be attributed to the travel ban itself, which only affected foreign nationals. During February only 19.57% of the expected number of Australian citizens/residents returned from China, thus, contributing to the reduction in importations.The second travel ban affected foreign nationals arriving from Iran and came into effect on 1 st March 2020 15 . Our results indicate that this restriction was less effective than the travel ban on foreign nationals arriving from China. COVID-19 importations from Iran were reduced by 32.81% (0 -56.88). Overall, only 14 fewer cases were imported from Iran. Presumably, this travel ban was less effective due to the majority of arrivals from Iran being Australian citizens and residents who were exempt from the ban.On 5 th March 2020 Australia denied entry to all foreign nationals arriving from South Korea 16 , which resulted in a 94.41% (92.05 -96.14) reduction of cases being imported from this source. In contrast to arrivals from Iran, arrivals from South Korea are dominated by foreign travellers, explaining the high reduction in importations from this country. In addition, only 5.49% of the expected number of citizens/resident arrivals returned to Australia during March. Overall, we estimate that 433 fewer cases were imported from South Korea.Six days later, on 11 th March 2020 foreign nationals arriving from Italy were banned from entering Australia 17 . This travel ban reduced the number of COVID-19 importations from Italy by 77.9% (69. 21 -85.76 ). In total, 994 fewer cases were imported. However, only 36.33% of the expected number of citizens/resident arrivals returned to Australia.The final travel ban enforced by the Australian government denied entry to all foreign travellers. This restriction was implemented on 20 th March 18 . Figure 1 shows a sharp decrease in the number of importations on this date. We estimate that Australia imported on average between 15 and 22 cases a day between 21 st March and 30 th April. During May and June the daily average dropped to three cases a day. Our results show that the reduction of COVID-19 importations is partly due to fewer Australian citizens and residents returning than expected during non-pandemic conditions. A significant factor underlying this reduction is in reduced flight availability into the country. The reduction of importations directly attributable to the individual travel bans is discussed later in this article. Considering the various travel restrictions implemented by the Australian government, we estimate that the largest proportion of imported COVID-19 cases were acquired in the United Kingdom (1,579 (1,468, 1,743) cases). The second largest source 3/9To decide whether it is safe to open international borders, governments need to understand the relationship between the number of arrivals, incidence rates in countries that act as importation sources and the expected number of COVID-19 importations. The contour plot in Figure 4 visualises this relationship. We assume that arrivals spent an average of 15 days in the source country prior to arrival. Stars indicate the expected number of importations during October 2020 from the corresponding country if borders re-open and given the country's current reported incidence rates and the expected number of arrivals. The countries referenced in Figure 4 were amongst the most frequently cited origins of travellers arriving into Australia in 2019. Note that the US, UK and Indonesia are not shown in Figure 4 as the recent daily incidence rates are well above 1e-6. Our results indicate that Australia can expect less than one importation from Malaysia, China, Fiji and Thailand during October if borders were to re-open. However, there is still a risk of COVID-19 cases being imported. Assuming that the number of infected arrivals can be modelled by a Poisson process with rate parameter equal to the expected number of importations, the probabilities of importing one or more cases from countries where we expect less than one importation during August, are as follows: China: 4.33%, Fiji: 12.78%, Malaysia: 56.87%, Thailand: 5.66%.We developed a comprehensive framework that models importations of COVID-19 into any given country. The model can be used to quantitatively evaluate existing and proposed border closures and is useful in guiding authorities to decide whether current travel restriction can be relaxed. We applied our model in the context of Australia, yet the model is globally applicable to any jurisdiction that tracks the movement of people through its borders. Mapping incidence rates and arrivals from source countries to the expected number of importations can underpin a decision support tool to determine the country-specific risk of opening international borders. It is important to note that COVID-19 reporting mechanisms and protocols can vary greatly across countries, and these practices impact the degree to which reported incidence rates are representative in each country. The confidence in reported incidence rates can be used to manage risk through our model, for instance by assigning a source country a confidence range of incidence rates rather than a single value. This helps drive decisions that avoid crossing from one region to another in the contour plot for countries with high uncertainty in their reporting data.Another potential source of uncertainty is in estimating incoming travel volumes. Australia's geography as an island nation adds confidence that the data used to estimate incoming travel volumes is representative of actual travel volume, which in turn increases confidence in the estimated importations in our model. Applying our model to other countries, particularly countries with more porous land borders, needs to consider the greater uncertainty in incoming travel volumes from neighbouring countries.The spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 in source countries is another important factor in our model. For instance, larger countries such as the US or China have experienced surges of COVID-19 in specific states or regions over time. Currently, our model accounts for national incidence rates that cover the entire country. While region-specific incidence rates are available for some countries, incoming travel volumes are reported at country level, which necessitates the averaging of incidence rates across a country. Region-specific travel volumes could add to the granularity of our model.We estimate the expected number of arrivals into Australia, assuming no travel restrictions were implemented, based on five years of historical data (January 2015 -December 2019). To give the data a normal shape, a Box-Cox transformation is applied to each individual time-series 19 . We use a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model that is suitable for forecasting time-series with seasonal variations that are possibly non-stationary 4 . To find the model with the best fit we perform a step-wise search over the model space and chose the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion 20 . All calculations have been carried out with Python's pmdarima statistical library.We use the monthly number of observed COVID-19 infections amongst travellers arriving into Australia from a given country to estimate the country's true incidence rate. We account for Australia's ascertainment in a similar way by estimating the true incidence rate with the observed incidence in Australian travellers arriving into New Zealand.Let γ be the true incidence rate of COVID-19 in a given country. Then, in a sufficiently large sample of the population, we expect to find nγ infected individuals, where n is the size of the sample, i.e. the arrivals from the given source country. Assuming that the number of infected individuals follows a Binomial distribution with unknown parameter γ, the maximum-likelihood estimate of γ is given byγ = x/n, where x is the number of infected individuals in the sample population. We construct the 95% Agresti-Coull interval 21 to ensure that the interval falls within the parameter space. The estimated incidence rates and their 95% confidence intervals are shown and compared to those reported by the ECDC in Supplementary Data File 2.In addition to adjusting the ECDC data to account for under-reporting, we estimate the disease onset date of all reported cases. From the data published in a recent study 22 , we find that the delay between a case showing symptoms and being reported follows a Gamma distribution. To adjust the data we subtract X days from the date of report for each recorded COVID-19 case, where X ∼ Gamma (1.76, 4.47 ).The importation model requires as input the date of arrival into the country under investigation (in our case Australia), the duration of the overseas stay, daily incidence rates of COVID-19 in the country of origin and the lengths of the latent and infectious periods. If a traveller is not infected with COVID-19 upon return, the traveller either never contracted the disease or 6/9where β d = 1 − e −γ d , γ d is the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the country of origin on date d, d d is the departure date of the traveller and d a is the date of arrival into the country under investigation. The probability of recovering before the arrival date is given bywhere d c denotes the date n − 1 days prior to the arrival date and n is the sum of the latent and the infectious period. The probability of being infected upon arrival is then given byOur model also considers in-flight transmission of the disease. To transmit the disease to others, the infected individual must be within the infectious period. If an individual is not infectious while travelling, the individual either never contracted the disease, contracted the disease and recovered or contracted the disease and is within the latent period. The probability of being within the latent period is given bywhere d l denotes the date l days prior to the arrival date and l is the length of the latent period. The probability of being infectious while travelling is then given byFollowing recent studies of the infectiousness profile of COVID-19, we set the infectious period to eleven days, beginning three days prior to the onset of symptoms 23, 24 . The incubation period describes the time between contracting a disease and showing symptoms. There is general agreement that the incubation period of COVID-19 is between five and six days [25] [26] [27] and is approximately three days longer than the latent period 23 . We draw the length of the incubation period from a log-normal distribution with mean equal to 1.621 and standard deviation equal to 0.418 26 . To find the latent period we subtract three from the incubation period.The number of individuals that an infectious traveller infects while on a plane is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean λ = tR 0 /s 28 , where R 0 denotes the basic reproduction rate, s is the length of the infectious period and t is the duration of the flight. We set R 0 = 14.8, following the results presented in a study that estimates the basic reproduction rate of COVID-19 on a cruise ship 29 . We assume R 0 on a ship to be similar on a plane where the population is almost fully mixed.The expected number of importations within a given time period is then given bywhere X ∼ Poisson(λ ), p i is the probability that individual i is infected and r i is the probability that individual i is infectious during the flight. The sums run over all individuals who arrive during the period of interest.The Australian arrival card data is available at https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-5a0ab398-c897-4ae3-986d-f94452a165d7/details?q=arrival%20card%20data.COVID-19 data is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographicdistribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide.Passenger flows from Australia to New Zealand are available at https://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/ongoing/international_airline_activity monthly_publications.New Zealand COVID-19 importation data is available at https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-andconditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases/covid-19-current-cases-details#download.COVID-19 importation data for NSW was obtained from NSW Health and is not publicly available.","Australia","abstract","2020-10-14",10

It is spread via droplets generated by sneezing, coughing or talking and is therefore easily transmitted between humans. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020 (1) and measures have been implemented by governments and local authorities to minimize the spread of the virus. These measures include social distancing (aiming to keep people from different households separate unless required) and rigid hygiene protocols (wearing masks when out in public, regular washing and sanitizing of hands and surfaces). The implementation of these guidelines has since resulted in global travel bans and restrictions on engaging in activities deemed ""non-essential.""In New Zealand, Alert Level Four lockdown restrictions were enforced between 25th March 2020 and 27th April 2020, with businesses that aren't deemed essential (e.g., supermarkets, pharmacies) forced to close. Between 27th April 2020 and 13th May 2020, Alert Level Three was enforced in New Zealand which brought around some changes (e.g., fast food establishments could operate a take-away service only) however gatherings of more than 10 people from different households was not permitted. Following the reduction to Alert Level Two on 13th May 2020, which allowed for most restaurants, businesses and activities to resume provided appropriate contact tracing, social distancing and hygiene rules were enforced, most people were able to resume habitual activities. On 8th June 2020, Alert Level One meant no restrictions were enforced in New Zealand with the exception of border entry being strictly controlled to allow only citizens and permanent residents entry following a 2 week quarantine.Organizations and individuals involved in sport and physical activity have experienced significant restrictions due the COVID-19 social distancing measures. Sporting events at all levels, from schools and clubs to large international events such as the 2020 Olympic Games, have been canceled or postponed. This has resulted in organized training sessions being deemed non-essential with many athletes forced to reduce their training volume drastically. Additionally, stresses related to illness and health, economic uncertainty and prolonged social isolation may lead to unfavorable or additional mental health outcomes in athletes (2, 3) .Engaging in regular physical activity has been encouraged (4) although social distancing guidelines may affect team and contact sports. Although some athletes are able to continue training and preparing for competition, sports requiring physical contact face additional issues surrounding training preparation. Rugby Union is a combative sport and the high incidence of players engaging in physical contact in the form of tackles, rucks, mauls, and scrums (5) thus social distancing guidelines have particular relevance to collision-based team sport athletes. Rugby Union athletes have been unable to participate in sport-specific activity during lockdown restrictions, which vary from country to country. Strict lockdown measures restricting access to habitual training environments and contact with other players mean coaches and practitioners are faced with challenges regarding developing or maintaining essential attributes required by Rugby Union athletes (lean mass, strength, power, speed, agility, sportspecific skills, decision-making ability) (6) .Not only have training and competition been affected by COVID-19, lockdown restrictions are likely to have influenced athletes' perceived nutrition habits. Nutrition habits can be defined as ""the habitual decisions of individuals or group of people regarding what foods they eat"" (7) . For example, habitual eating patterns will have changed significantly with the closure of eating establishments and food delivery services. Furthermore, stressors as a direct result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions may result in unfavorable food choices (8) . Additional challenges associated with monitoring nutrient intake during lockdown are likely to be encountered by clubs due to less direct contact with nutrition professionals. It is vital athletes receive the appropriate nutritional support during lockdown as an abrupt return to training and play once restrictions are lifted may result in increased risk of injury (9) and it is likely good dietary habits may alleviate this (10, 11) .Numerous surveys have been distributed across different populations and countries to identify the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on dietary patterns (12, 13) however no data has been reported in Rugby Union athletes. The purpose of this study is to explore (1) the influence of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on Rugby Union players' nutrition and training habits and (2) how nutrition habits in New Zealand Rugby Union players change after lockdown restrictions were lifted.The research instruments consisted of two surveys administered via an online survey-hosting website (Survey Monkey, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Within human ethics research regulations, this study was deemed to be low risk. All participants granted informed consent prior to commencing any of the surveys.The first survey, entitled ""Nutrition & Training Habits in Rugby Union Players -COVID-19 Lockdown"" was administered from April 19th 2020 to May 22nd 2020, during which full lockdown restrictions were enforced in New Zealand and many countries globally. Initially, management staff and/or coaching staff from Rugby Union teams located in New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom were approached via e-mail. The purpose of the survey was explained, and management staff were asked to distribute the survey web link to their players. The survey consisted of 30 questions organized into three sectionsgeneral information, nutrition and training.The second survey, entitled ""Post-Lockdown Nutrition & Training Habits in Rugby Union Players"" was administered from 2nd June 2020 to 2nd July 2020. The survey consisted of 28 questions. Management staff from Rugby Union teams in New Zealand were approached via e-mail due to the complete relaxation of lockdown restrictions. An information page was presented prior to the survey and consent was gained via a consent statement and check box.Descriptive analysis of results are presented as percentages (%) of responses.For a full breakdown of Survey 1 and 2 questions and responses, please see Supplementary Materials. Relevant results will be discussed in the subsequent sections.Relevant results will be discussed in this section.In total, of the 314 survey link clicks, 258 respondents (82% total) completed Survey 1. Demographics for the survey respondents are presented in Table 1 . The respondents were 18-25 years of age (59.7%), male (84.1%) and living in New Zealand (92.2%). Only 26.3% of respondents reported playing at either a semi-professional or a professional level, with amateur players representing competitive club level or academy teams. Living with family accounted for 58.5% of responses. During lockdown, 39.2% of respondents indicated their motivation to train was lower than usual, with 32.6% reporting no change in motivation levels and 28.3% stating motivation to train had increased during lockdown.Most respondents reported consuming breakfast daily (63.2%), eating 2-3 meals (67.1%) and 1-2 snacks (63.6%) per day. Respondents reported that a family member was most likely to purchase their food during lockdown (42.6%). Whilst 44.6% of respondents prepared their own food and meals, family members (23.6%) and a combination of people (23.3%) (the respondent and others in the household) were also involved in the food/meal preparation process.Total food intake was reported to be greater during lockdown in 35.7% of respondents. During lockdown, 16.7% of respondents' fruit and vegetable intake was lower than before lockdown, with the remainder indicating their intake was either the same or higher than before the restrictions. Packaged/convenience food intake was lower in lockdown for 41.9% of participants.Nutrition knowledge in respondents was primarily from a dietician or nutritionist associated with the club (61.6%) however coaching staff (25.2%), teammates (27.1%), family members (30.6%), the internet (31.1%) and social media also contributed. When asked about the frequency of consumption of complete high-protein foods, 49.2% of respondents reported greater than two daily feedings. Respondents who consumed no dietary supplements during lockdown consisted of 53.3% of total responses.In total, of the 112 survey link clicks, 106 respondents (95% total) completed Survey 2. Demographics for the survey respondents are displayed in Table 1 . Respondents were 18-25 years old (66.0%) and male (84.9%). In total, 34.0% of respondents perform at a semi-professional or professional level. Most respondents reported living with family (33.0%) or flatting in shared accommodation (31.1%). Motivation to train and exercise was greater in 59.5% of respondents compared to during lockdown.As with Survey 1, most respondents reported daily breakfast consumption (72.6%), eating 2-3 meals (51.9%) and 1-2 snacks (71.7%) per day. The vast majority of respondents purchased (67.0%) and prepared their own food and meals (71.0%). Eating out at takeaways, cafes and restaurants at least once per week was reported in 45.3% of respondents, with 8.4% indicating their frequency of eating out was ≥3 times weekly.Dieticians or nutritionists associated with the club provided 68.9% of respondents nutrition knowledge, with coaching staff (26.4%), teammates (33.0%), family members, the internet (31.1%) and social media (22.6%) again contributing.Consumption of ≤1 complete, high-protein food source daily was reported by 50.9% of respondents. No supplement use was reported in 32.1% of respondents.To compare results between surveys, responses from athletes located in countries other than New Zealand were filtered out. Relevant results are displayed in Figures 1-8 as comparisons between results presented by amateur players and semiprofessional/professional players.The relaxation of lockdown restrictions caused a change in living situations. Living with family accounted for 58.5% of responses during lockdown compared to 33.0% following lockdown, and flatting in shared accommodation accounted for 10.1% of responses during lockdown and 31.13% after lockdown (Figure 3) . Following lockdown, the responses indicate a shift to athletes becoming more self-reliant and both purchasing (67.0% compared to 38.0%, Figure 2 ) and preparing (71.7% compared to 44.6%, Figure 1 ) their own food and meals. Post-lockdown, respondents reported a much higher motivation to train (57.9%) compared to during lockdown (28.7%) (Figure 4) .Most respondents reported no change in nutrition habits from during lockdown to post-lockdown (50.9%) whilst 35.9% indicated that their nutrition habits were better (Figure 6) . Additionally, total food (44.3%, Figure 5 ), fruit and vegetable (53.8%, Figure 7 ) and packaged/convenience food (45.3%, Figure 8 ) was reported to be the same following lockdown.The purpose of this study was to explore (1) the influence of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on Rugby Union players' nutrition and training habits and (2) how nutrition habits in New Zealand Rugby Union players were affected by the relaxation of lockdown restrictions. Nationwide lockdowns are unprecedented and as such no data is currently available describing how the combinations of (1) disruption to daily life (2) inability to train and eat habitually and (3) stress due to the global pandemic may have influenced these factors in athletes.The majority of responses indicated that their food intake during lockdown either remained the same or increased. Whilst the long-term implication of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on body composition have not been reported, athletes would be wise to reduce total energy intake to reflect the reduction of physical activity (14) . Many respondents engaged in regular training sessions (89.4% reported completing ≥3 sessions per week) however the shift from habitual practices likely resulted in a large reduction in daily energy expenditure. Factors influencing energy expenditure during lockdown in athletes include a requirement to perform training sessions either at home or in local outdoor areas such as parks, a lack of equipment (free weights, machines) and no competition between teammates being present. These factors mean minimal rugbyspecific training sessions were performed. The temporary closure of restaurants, fast food outlets, cafes and bars may have resulted in better food choices in athletes. Most respondents indicated that fruit and vegetable intake during lockdown either remained the same or increased from prelockdown. Additionally, packaged and convenience food intake either remained the same or was lower during lockdown. These contrast with general population surveys distributed during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, with one third of 1097 Polish respondents not consuming fresh fruit or vegetables on a daily basis (13) . In a global survey distributed through 35 research institutions, respondents reported eating in an unhealthier pattern along with consuming more snacks and meals when COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were enforced (15) .Ingesting adequate protein (1.2-2.0 g.kg.d) (16) is an important factor in ensuring lean mass retention. When inadequate dietary protein is consumed, negative protein balance can result in muscle protein catabolism, adversely affecting muscle mass and function (17) . In Survey 1, only 43.9% of respondents reported consuming a whole-food, high biological value protein source more than twice daily, which may not be optimal for retaining lean mass during a prolonged lockdown period.During lockdown, most of respondents implied they consumed no dietary supplements. High heterogeneity exists in the evidence-base surrounding dietary supplement use among athletes and prevalence recorded between studies is variable (18) . Additionally, consultation with a nutrition professional should occur to consider the benefits and risks involved with consuming certain supplements (19) . Nonetheless, consumption of certain supplements may be beneficial for athletes provided training, nutrition and recovery habits are sound (20) . Due to the additional stressors of the lockdown, supplement use may not have been a priority for athletes.Protein supplementation is a beneficial strategy for athletes to reach daily requirements (21) . Whilst protein intake is recommended to primarily come from whole foods, whey and casein are of a high quality, and consumption is considered safe and convenient (16) . With most survey respondents reporting consuming a high-protein food source ≤ once daily, this may be a useful strategy for athletes to minimize the detrimental effects of a reduction in training volume, a lack of appropriate equipment and limited rugby-specific training (6).As many athletes appeared to return to the family home for the lockdown period, there would likely be a greater reliance and/or sharing of responsibilities surrounding nutrition. Following lockdown, those staying with family appeared to decrease and those flatting in shared accommodation increased. Therefore, there was a large shift in respondents indicating becoming more self-reliant, with a large number of athletes reporting purchasing their own food and preparing meals themselves. Reliance on others to prepare and cook meals can be a major barrier to healthy eating in athletes when those preparing meals do not possess appropriate sports nutrition knowledge. Furthermore, athletes cooking/shopping skills and cost can present further challenges in athletes at all levels of play (22) . These factors should be considered by sports dieticians/nutritionists when aiming to improve athletes' nutrition knowledge and food intake. Sports nutrition knowledge in respondents from both surveys appeared to mainly come from dieticians or nutritionists associated with the clubs however a large number also reported other sources including other individuals (coaching staff, teammates, family members) or through seeking it themselves (internet, social media). Many coaches provide nutrition advice to athletes however these individuals do not often possess the appropriate level of knowledge required to do so (23) . Teammates and family members who have not received appropriate training can provide incorrect and potentially harmful information. Additionally, it is important that athletes are aware of the possibility of unreliable information being presented through digital channels (24) . Fast food outlets, cafes and takeaways were able to re-open following the relaxation of lockdown restrictions in New Zealand. A number of athletes reported eating out on >3 occasions weekly. Eating out can indeed be incorporated into an optimal diet for an athlete however it is important for these individuals to be aware of how to make appropriate choices. Increased frequency of fast-food consumption is associated with poorer diet quality, perhaps due to displacement of appropriate food choices (25) . Less frequent food preparation and more frequent fast food consumption are associated with poorer diet quality, however time-restraints are a major influence on these factors (26) . As most respondents identified as amateurs, it is likely these athletes also had full-time obligations in the form of work and/or studies. Furthermore, the social aspect of being involved in a team may outweigh focusing on eating for optimal performance, recovery and health in amateur athletes (27) .Unsurprisingly, most athletes indicated their motivation to exercise and train was higher once lockdown restrictions were relaxed. The physical and aggressive nature of the game, on and off-field interactions with teammates and feelings of achievement and success are some of the factors previously reported to increase participation motivation in elite female Rugby Union athletes (28) . Lockdown restrictions would indeed cause major disruption to all of these factors. Additionally, the closure of habitual training facilities (clubhouses, gyms) and stressors associated with the pandemic are likely to have influenced athletes' motivation to train during lockdown.Respondents of both Surveys 1 and 2 reported consuming high biological-value protein sources from whole foods less than once per day. These responses may indicate a lack of knowledge of the importance of regular protein consumption throughout the day for athletes. As with during lockdown, athletes concerned with maximizing lean mass and strength gains are recommended to consume a minimum of 1.6 g.kg.d spread evenly across at least 4 meals of 0.4 g.kg (29) (30) (31) . Although athletes during lockdown will be experiencing different levels of exercise stimulation (lack of resistance training equipment, minimal rugby-specific training) which likely resulted in reductions in lean mass, strength and skill adequate protein consumption may allow for a faster return to pre-lockdown body composition and performance levels. Minimizing lean mass catabolism is also an important factor in reducing injury risk when Rugby Union training and match play resumes, with the development of the muscle tissue important for withstanding external forces associated with collision sport play (6).A major limitation of the present study is that the accuracy of the responses cannot be verified. Due to the anonymous nature of the online surveys distributed for this study, responses may not truly indicate how a respondent feels. Additionally, the nature of the questions means accurate results are difficult to obtain (for example, asking participants whether their food intake has changed as a result of lockdown measures) and information on macronutrient intake other than protein was not requested. Furthermore, respondents may not answer truthfully due to the additional stressors resulting from COVID-19, such as economic struggles, feelings of isolation or health worries.Participants were not asked to describe the nature of training sessions performed during lockdown, which presents another major limitation. It is likely that the implementation of lockdown measures would adversely affect resistance training and sportspecific training in athletes. With no access to commercial gym equipment, athletes are required to make use of limited equipment they may have at home or potentially none at all. If inadequate resistance training is performed, changes associated with muscle disuse such as lean mass and strength loss and increased fat mass may rapidly occur (32) . It has been suggested that low-volume and low-intensity contractions are adequate at stimulating muscle protein synthesis and preventing muscle wasting (33) . Resistance training protocols utilizing bands and bodyweight exercises have previously demonstrated efficacy in promoting lean mass gains in healthy older individuals (34) however this is not likely to be enough to maintain strength in Rugby Union athletes. Indeed, athletes are unlikely to have access to the equipment required to perform key exercises for developing or maintaining maximal strength (multijoint resistance exercises such as squats and deadlifts) (35) at sufficiently heavy loads (≥75% 1-repetition maximum) (36) . For optimal performance and injury prevention, Rugby Union athletes are expected to possess high levels of strength and power whilst engaging in high metabolic training volumes and rugby-specific sessions (37) and re-building these attributes before competitive matches resume will be crucial. Most respondents indicated they completed at least three training sessions per week however no information was gathered as to the nature of these sessions and as such, the ability of the respondents to offset muscle disuse wasting cannot be predicted.In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions to encourage social distancing and delay the spread of the virus have presented significant challenges for athletes of all levels and disciplines. Appropriate nutritional and training support may assist athletes retain adequate performance, lean mass, strength and cardiorespiratory fitness during lockdown scenarios however no data is currently available to support this. Coaches and performance staff can assist athletes by promoting greater protein intakes and feeding frequency, encouraging safe supplement use and keeping players engaged in interesting training sessions that can be completed from home. Staff must also be aware of the challenges athletes may be facing, related or unrelated to the ongoing pandemic.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

Early evidence in Asia, including China, Singapore, and South Korea, showed COVID-19 control using combinations of movement restrictions, physical distancing, hygiene practices, and intensive case and contact detection and management. [1] [2] [3] The WHO-China Mission recommended decisive government leadership to rapidly enhance surveillance and apply riskbased non-pharmaceutical interventions with effective population engagement. 2 However, it was unclear how well this could be implemented in societies with little experience of successfully containing a novel respiratory virus. 4 As evidence emerged that the unique nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) required distinct strategic approaches, New Zealand moved from a response guided by national influenza pandemic planning to a COVID-19-tailored approach focusing on suppression (stopping SARS-CoV-2 commu nity spread) over mitigation (slowing down transmission), 5 with a goal of COVID-19 elimination, to reach very low or zero COVID-19 incidence. 6 Risk-infor med border restrictions were implemented ahead of WHO advice before the first local case of COVID-19 was con firmed on Feb 28, 2020. Graduated suppression strategies were then applied, escalating to national lock down (stay-at-home order with few exemptions) within 26 days. This response has international relevance, particularly for other island nations, high-income and western settings, and countries with ethnic and social health inequities. New Zealand is a high-income remote Pacific island state of nearly 5 million people, with an ageing population and diverse ethnic structure: approximately 16% Indigenous Māori, 7% Pacific peoples, 15% Asian, and 62% European or other. Inequitable morbidity and mortality for Māori and Pacific peoples, seen during previous influenza pandemics, continue for many communicable diseases today. 7 COVID-19 ethnic and social disparities have been observed overseas. 8, 9 New Zealand's response sought to prevent COVID-19 disparities and minimise transit of infection to lower-income Pacific countries. 6 Here, we investigate the impact of national suppression strategies on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in New Zealand and measures of response performance.This descriptive epidemiological study examined a cohort of all confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases and all people tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Zealand up to May 13, 2020 , which marked the easing of the most restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions, after which community transmission ceased. National COVID-19 case definitions applied. Confirmed cases required laboratory definitive evidence (ie, SARS-CoV-2 detection by validated molecular test). Probable cases were close contacts of confirmed cases with clinically compatible presentations where SARS-CoV-2 testing was incon clusive and other causes excluded. New Zealand's com municable disease surveillance and response capabilities have been recently described 10 and details on the four national COVID-19 Alert Levels, their associated non-pharmaceutical interventions, and test and trace guidance have been published. 11, 12 Key features of the response timeline are outlined in the panel and figure 1, including nonpharmaceutical interventions required by Alert Levels and key surveillance changes.The speed of New Zealand's Alert Level escalation (from Alert Level 1 to 4 between March 21 and March 26, 2020) prevents assessment of individual Alert Levels on study outcomes. Therefore, we considered the effects of national COVID-19 suppression strategies over five phases. Phase Evidence before this study To identify international epidemiological studies of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 containment and population outcomes, systematic searches of MEDLINE and PubMed were undertaken on July 8, 2020, for peerreviewed articles published since Jan 1, 2020, using the following keywords: ""novel coronavirus"" or ""nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" or ""SARS-CoV-2""; and ""epidemiolog*"" or ""public health strateg*"" or ""reproduction number"" or ""health loss"" or ""population impact*"" or ""effectiveness"". Of 2230 articles identified, 24 were included. Among these, three were in high-income democratic Asian settings, seven in western settings, and two examined multiple international settings. Escalation of non-pharmaceutical interventions including movement restrictions (travel bans or physical distancing) were effective in COVID-19 mitigation or suppression to varied extents.We use highly complete, prospectively collected national COVID-19 case and testing datasets to comprehensively describe New Zealand's initial public health response to COVID-19.The response was notable for its speed and intensity (including border closure, rapid implementation of national lockdown, and surveillance enhancements) in a high-income, western setting with little previous experience of containing novel respiratory pathogens. This is the first study to our knowledge to assess the impacts of national or subnational non-pharmaceutical intervention escalation and de-escalation decisions on the distribution, transmission patterns, and severity of COVID-19, and the attainment of an explicit national goal of COVID-19 elimination.New Zealand's experience describes the multifaceted components of a national response as a feasible route to COVID-19 elimination, particularly in other high-income or island settings. The study supports WHO recommendations for timely decisive government leadership for evidence-informed, risk-based escalation and de-escalation decisions combining rigorous case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine measures with population education and engagement. Further research is needed to understand the wider cost benefits of this response. capacities including imple menting managed quarantine facilities for returning citizens and residents who could not safely self-isolate; and mandatory state-managed quarantine for all returning travellers (April 10). Phase 4 was the second half of lockdown, covering April 11-27, during which Alert Level 4 continued and there were further increases in SARS-CoV-2 testing, including the first asymptomatic population survey (April 16), before any decisions to change Alert Level. Finally, phase 5 was the de-escalation to Alert Level 3 (April 28), covering April 28-May 13, which included easing of population movement restrictions (eg, small gatherings up to ten people permitted). Further population testing surveys were done before de-escalation to Alert Level 2 on May 14.COVID-19 became legally notifiable from Jan 30, 2020. Suspected, probable, and confirmed case data were prospectively recorded on EpiSurv, the national notifiable diseases database, using a standardised COVID-19 case report form. All confirmed and probable case data were extracted on June 16, 2020, including age, sex, location, 2013 New Zealand Index of Deprivation (NZDep) quintile (where quintile 1 is least socioeconomically deprived and quintile 5 most deprived), 13 travel history, occupation, basis for case detection, course of infection or illness, underlying conditions, link to a confirmed case or outbreak, and notification and confirmation dates. Selfdetermined ethnicity was identified by linkage to the national patient demographics dataset. Ethnicity was grouped by prioritised classification in order of Māori, Pacific, Asian, and European or other, with the remaining cases classified as unknown. 14 Results of all SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests were extracted on June 3, 2020, from Éclair, the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository, with the following metadata: age, sex, linked prioritised ethnicity, 14 District Health Board (DHB) location, and NZDep quintile.Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (Health; HD20/062).Cases were assigned to the five phases in two ways to assess different impacts. First, cases were assigned to a phase on the basis of the estimated date of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ie, the exposure period), defined as occurring one incubation period before symptom onset (or notification date, if data on symptom onset were unavailable). Uncertainty in incubation period was incorporated by replicate sampling (n=1000) from a Weibull distribution 15 with means and SEs pooled across replicates. Assigned exposure period was then used to assess the impacts of non-pharmaceutical intervention phases on disease transmission and the characteristics of cases affected. The estimated average daily incidence of New Zealandacquired case infection was calculated as the number of non-imported cases divided by the number of days in the phase and the national estimated population size.Case counts, cumulative incidence, relative risks, and prevalence of demographic characteristics were compared by phase and by disease transmission types. Transmission types were either outbreak (linked cases extending outside of a single household) or household cluster (cases living in the same household), and infection source was defined as imported (international travel within 14 days of onset), import related (epidemiological link to an imported case), or locally acquired (no international travel within 14 days and no link to an import-related case).Characteristics of cases with severe disease outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were compared with non-severe cases. Due to the low number of deaths that occurred (n=22), a separate analysis of mortality as an outcome was not done.Second, for analyses of response performance, cases were assigned to a phase on the basis of the earliest date of evidence of infection (ie, the presentation period), defined as the date of illness onset (or notification date, if data on illness onset were unavailable). Basis for case detection, Physical distancing is enforced, additional precautions are encouraged for higher-risk groups (eg, people aged >70 years) when leaving home, and specific gatherings (eg, weddings) are permitted if no more than 100 people.Population is asked to stay within so-called bubbles (comprising household close contacts) that can include additional support (eg, carers) and encouraged to work from home, businesses must not physically interact with public, public venues are closed, no gatherings of more than ten people are allowed, telehealth services are encouraged, and only essential inter-regional travel is permitted.Population is required to stay at home except for essential reasons (eg, short periods of exercise), businesses are closed unless offering essential services (eg, supermarkets), educational facilities and public venues are closed, and health-care services are reprioritised. A communication wellbeing campaign entitled Getting Through Together is launched. testing incidence and positivity, and time-to-event intervals were calculated by phase using the presentation period. Time-to-event intervals were average days from illness onset to notification, isolation, or hospitalisation dates. International arrival numbers, 16 Government Response Stringency Index values, 17 and population mobility changes were summarised for New Zealand. The Government Response Stringency Index is a composite indicator measuring the strictness of government policy responses to COVID-19. Population mobility changes were calculated using mobility data, with daily observed local resident mobility compared against median estimates for each weekday derived from a 4-week baseline (Feb 10-March 15, 2020) to calculate percentage changes.Rates and proportions were calculated with 95% CIs assuming Poisson and binomial distributions, respectively. 2019 New Zealand population projections produced by Stats NZ for the Ministry of Health were used in denominators.Risk factors for severe outcomes among cases were examined using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Crude ORs were calculated for age, sex, source of infection, and exposure phase variables. Due to confounding by age, all other ORs were adjusted for at least age and sex. Aged residential care (ARC) is an important setting for COVID-19 outbreaks internationally, and there is potential error in our socio economic status measure for ARC residents because it is based on ARC facility location. Therefore, to assess the impact of key demographic variables on risk of severe outcomes, multivariable analysis esti mated ORs for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation including adjustment for ARC residency and the presence of at least one underlying condition. There were insufficient data for precise estimates of risk associated with individual underlying conditions, so multivariable analyses were done only for conditions with at least 20 total observations. Key time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) for key parameters were calculated using bootstrapping techniques. 18 Sensitivity analysis of the inclusion of probable cases (standard national reporting practice) and exposure period based on notification date for 30 cases was assessed by repeating key study analyses with their exclusion. R (version 4·0.2) and STATA (version 15) were used for statistical analyses.The funders of this study had no role in the study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all of the data and final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.1503 cases of COVID-19 were detected in New Zealand presenting from Feb 12 to May 10, 2020, of which 1153 (77%) were confirmed and 350 (23%) probable ( figure 1; table 1 ). This was a cumulative incidence of 302·7 cases (95% CI 287·6-318·4) per million people. 95 (6·3%) people with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, ten admitted to intensive care (0·7%), and 22 (1·5%) died (table 1) . The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked in phase 2 at 8·5 (7·6-9·4) followed by a 62% decrease to 3·2 (2·8-3·7) in phase 3 (the first half of lockdown), progressively declining thereafter. The main source of infection was overseas acquisition, with the proportion attributable to importation declining from lockdown (ie, from phase 3 onwards). The results of sensitivity analysis with the exclusion of probable cases are shown in the appendix (pp 2-3), with no major impacts on study findings. Demographic characteristics were influenced by infection source, with 1034 (69%) imported and importrelated cases, and by outbreak settings (table 2; figure 2). COVID-19 incidence was lowest in children for all sources (table 2) . Overall, cases were predominantly female, aged 20-34 years, of European or other ethnicity, and had higher socioeconomic status (47% in NZDep quintiles 1-2). People of Māori ethnicity had the second-highest rate of import-related disease after people of European or other ethnicity (table 2) , with 30 (46%) Māori cases in this group linked to New Zealand's largest outbreak (see wedding in figure 2). Locally acquired cases showed female predominance, higher incidence among Asian and Pacific peoples, and distribution across deprivation quintiles (table 2) . These characteristics, as well as major geographical trends, were evident in the demographics of major locally acquired outbreaks (figure 2).Cases were detected throughout New Zealand, with the highest incidence per 100 000 population being found in Southern (64·6, 95% CI 56·3-73·8), Waikato (44·4, 38·3-51·2), and Waitemata (37·4, 32·8-42·3) . Travel restriction start dates are highlighted, which include entry restrictions to foreign nationals from specified countries, requirement for all remaining incoming travellers to isolate for 14 days, and border closures to all but New Zealand citizens or residents. Panel B shows daily SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing counts and daily test positivity (for days with ≥100 tests) and major national COVID-19 surveillance changes. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. *Expanded to include non-febrile presentations of acute respiratory infection (shortness of breath, cough or sore throat, with or without fever), and testing of asymptomatic household contacts. †Removal of epidemiological criteria (travel to COVID-19-affected areas or close contact with a case) as a requirement (with clinical presentations) and expanded clinical criteria to include anosmia and coryza. Percentages shown are percentages of the total cases unless indicated otherwise. ICU=intensive care unit. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. *Cases were assigned to study exposure periods by sampling incubation periods from a Weibull distribution before illness onset (or notification date for 30 cases with no illness onset data, 25 of whom were asymptomatic). †New Zealand-acquired infection; excludes imported cases. ‡87 of these cases were the first cases to emerge in the community with no known source. §Includes airline crew and other frontline service workers (eg, police). ¶Outcomes are not mutually exclusiveie, cases could be assigned to more than one of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death. COVID-19 was reported as the primary cause of death on the COVID-19 case report form for all deceased cases. ||Cases were assigned to study presentation periods by date of illness onset (or notification date if no illness onset data). **Includes asymptomatic self-referral for testing outside of case definition or contact tracing protocol. popu lation structure, Asian or Pacific peoples were disproportionately affected in eight out breaks and Māori in the largest (figure 2). Among 782 (52%) cases linked to 316 COVID-19 household clusters, only nine (1·2%) cases in people younger than 15 years of age were the first cases in their household. Case symptoms are summarised in the appendix (p 10). Only 501 (34%) of 1472 cases presented with cough and fever. Severe outcomes were associated with older ages: multivariable adjusted ORs ranged 2·72 (95% CI 1·40-5·30) for 50-64 year olds to 8·25 (2·59-26·31) for people aged 80 years or older, compared with 20-34 year olds (appendix pp 4-5). After age-sex adjustment, having reported at least one underlying condition was associated with severe outcomes (OR 1·81 [1·16-2·83]) as was ARC residency (3·86 [1·59-9·35]; appendix pp 4-5). There was no clear association of lower socioeconomic status with severe outcomes after adjusting for ARC residency, as well as for age, sex, ethnicity, and having at least one underlying condition (appendix pp 4-5). Higher odds of severe outcomes were associated with Pacific peoples (2·76 [1·14-6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10-4·20]) ethnicity versus European or other ethnicity after multivariable adjustment (appendix pp 4-5), although no Asian or Pacific peoples died. Higher odds of severe outcomes associated with locally acquired infection (2·32 [1·40-3·82] compared with imported) and exposure in later phases (3·08 [1·22-7·77] in phase 4 compared with phase 1) is explained by the timing and occurrence of locally acquired outbreaks in vulnerable-population settings (eg, ARC; figure 2; appendix pp 4-5). Among 22 COVID-19 deaths, the mean age was 81·5 years (SD 10·0; range 62-99), 11 (50%) were male, 20 (91%) were of European or other ethnicity, two (9%) were Māori, and 16 (73%) lived in ARC facilities. 11 (50%) cases had at least one underlying condition.Initially, cases were mostly identified through clinical health-care presentations, but predominantly through contact tracing from phase 3 onwards (table 1) . 212 001 SARS-CoV-2 tests were done up to May 13, with a 220-times increase in testing incidence from phase 1 to phase 5, and less than 5% national daily test positivity from March 29 ( figure 1; table 1) . A dramatic drop in international passenger arrivals and considerably reduced population mobility were observed from phase 2 (appendix p 11).Testing increased over the study period among all demographic groups (figure 3; appendix pp 6-7). Females had consistently higher testing rates than males (figure 3). In phase 1, testing rates were highest in people of Asian ethnicity, adults aged 20-34 years, and people of higher socioeconomic status (figure 3; appendix pp 6-7). Subsequently, Pacific peoples, adults aged 50-64 years, and people of lower socioeconomic status had higher rates. People younger than 20 years of age had lower testing rates in every phase (appendix pp 6-7).Key time-to-event intervals declined by phase, except for time to hospitalisation where numbers were too small to stratify (median 8 days [IQR 4 to 11; range 0 to 39]; appendix pp 8-9, 12). Between phases 1 and 4, the average time from illness onset to notification reduced from 9·7 days (95% UI 8·8 to 10·7) to 1·7 days (1·2 to 2·2) and average isolation intervals from 7·2 days (6·3 to 8·2) to −2·7 days (−4·7 to −0·8) days, where negative days represent isolation before illness onset (appendix p 12). Small counts in phase 5 prevented maximum likelihood estimations. Numbers were also too small for phasebased stratification by source of infection or basis for case detection. Sensitivity analysis with the exclusion of probable cases found no significant differences in timeliness, except for a shorter average onset to notification interval in phase 3 (appendix pp 8-9).New Zealand experienced one of the lowest cumulative case counts, incidence, and mortality among higherincome countries in its first wave of COVID-19 following early implementation and rapid escalation of national COVID-19 suppression strategies. 19, 20 New Zealand effectively achieved control with progressive, riskinformed border closures reducing the burden of imported disease driving the epidemic. This was followed, only 15 days after first case confir mation, by a phase of rapid escalation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to national lockdown. This 10-day escalation phase had the highest average daily case infection rate during the study period. Within 2 weeks, lockdown was associated with a substantial reduction in daily case infection rate and improving response performance measures: the majority of cases were detected by contact tracing, and there were decreasing average times to case notification and isolation and increasing population testing with effective targeting of higher-risk groups.Enhancements in response capacity also supported de-escalation decisions. The daily test positivity was less than 5% from March 29 (day 4 of lockdown), as recommended by WHO before easing of restrictions, and only 25 cases of asymptomatic infection were detected despite routine testing of asymptomatic contacts, population testing surveys targeting asymptomatic and highrisk groups, and high testing rates by phase 5. Moreover, despite full de-escalation to Alert Level 1 on June 9, New Zealand effectively eliminated COVID-19, as currently defined, 6 to very low numbers detected at border quarantine facilities for an extended period. 20 Furthermore, rapid suppression of community transmission limited overall disease disparities for populations most vulnerable to severe outcomes. Most cases were linked to imported cases, with predominant features of healthy travellers: younger adults, European ethnicity, and higher socioeconomic status. Locally acquired disease was less common, but tended to reach more vulnerable populations (ie, older people, ARC residents, and minority ethnic groups) and was associated with more severe outcomes. Female case predominance in this group probably relates to the settings where locally acquired outbreaks occurred, including a girls' school, and ARC facilities where residents and carers were more likely to be female, but is potentially influenced by testing bias. Higher female testing incidence might reflect female predominance in certain high-risk groups targeted for testing, such as health-care workers, which is also considered a potential reason for slight female case predominance described in England. 8 Higher male mortality reported overseas was not seen in New Zealand, 2, 8, 21 and although the crude OR for severe outcomes was slightly higher for males, this estimate was imprecise and did not persist after multivariable adjustment. In keeping with some international findings, children appeared to have had a lesser role in household transmission and outbreaks-even at a school-in New Zealand, despite intensive testing of asymptomatic contacts. 2,21 However, with lower national testing rates in children, detection bias cannot be excluded.High-risk workers and indigenous Māori people did not appear to be disproportionately affected in the first wave. Rapid control of community transmission through mandatory physical distancing provided time to enhance the response, including prioritised testing of higher-risk groups, also ensuring that COVID-19 did not overburden health system capacity. Nonetheless, after adjustment for confounders, older people, ARC residents, people reporting at least one underlying condition, and Asian and Pacific peoples were at higher risk of severe outcomes than other populations. These findings align with international risk associations. 2, 8, 9, 21, 22 Our study supports the ongoing need for the response to address systemic barriers, such as health-care access, to achieving equitable health outcomes for minority and higher-risk groups, particularly in the absence of elimination. 23 There are contextual features of New Zealand's experience that have implications for generalisability to other settings. New Zealand's small, non-federated health system proved responsive, including rapid test development and early reprioritisation of health-care services, with readiness probably facilitated by delay in the first case arriving due to border measures. The pandemic's commencement during New Zealand summer time with low seasonal respiratory infections meant an initially restricted testing resource could be more readily targeted. Despite these advantages, there was some early undetected community transmission, with the first locally acquired case presenting on March 4 when the national case definition targeted febrile illness, a less frequent feature of COVID-19 in the New Zealand cohort and overseas. In New Zealand, only a low proportion of asymptomatic infection was detected relative to other countries despite widespread testing, and the low level of community transmission that occurred might have contributed to this. Serological studies are required to quantify this further.New Zealand's border response has implications for island states where borders can be more readily controlled. Samoa and Fiji, for example, also exercised early border closures to non-citizens and non-residents, aligning with strategies effective during the 1918 pandemic, and so far maintain zero or very low COVID-19 counts. 19, 24 While clearly effective in limiting disease importation, there remain questions about the costs and sustainability of these measures. Although New Zealand-based research before the pandemic suggested a net health economic benefit from complete border closure in a modelled pandemic scenario, 25 the potential indirect health effects of the national response are under surveillance and the net impacts yet to be determined. Cost-effectiveness analysis lay outside the scope of our study but focused research in this area is essential. Furthermore, Taiwan has shown that COVID-19 control can be achieved in the absence of complete border closure, although using advanced technological systems and ongoing strict disease suppression strategies in a society that had already normalised some of these measures from previous novel virus exposures. 19, 26 Finally, the speed and intensity of the national response to limit the epidemic is unprecedented internationally; New Zealand had the fastest trajectory to reach the highest country score in the Government Response Stringency Index. 17 The observed impact of lockdown on inhibiting disease transmission aligns with reproductive number estimates for before and after lockdown produced for New Zealand and other countries. 21, 27, 28 It is likely this early, intense response, which also enabled relatively rapid easing while maintaining strict border controls, prevented the burden of disease experienced in other high-income countries with slower lockdown implementation, including Australia, the UK, and Italy-the latter initially taking mitigation approaches. [28] [29] [30] Integral to New Zealand's response has been decisive governance, effective communication, and high population compliance-in an earthquake-prone country, communities and emergency management systems are primed for disaster response. 10, 31 This study has methodological advantages. It uses two comprehensive national datasets: one employing standardised national case questionnaires prospectively applied to every notified case for the primary purpose of COVID-19 surveillance, and the other recording every SARS-CoV-2 test done using nationally validated methodology. Moreover, data were extracted for the study period in mid-June, enabling completeness, and preventing right censoring of the epidemic curve. Furthermore, following the end of the study period, case numbers remained very low, including a 25-day period where no cases were notified. 20 There are also limitations. It was not possible to differentiate impacts of individual non-pharmaceutical interventions due to the rapid and overlapping implementation of response measures. Moreover, the relatively small case dataset has statistical limitations for comparative analyses. The categorisation of phases and presentation and exposure periods incorporated assumptions. In particular, the modelled incubation period applied to all cases was not derived from New Zealand data and some cases might have been incorrectly assigned to an exposure period. Misclassification of imported cases is also possible, although 98% of cases became symptomatic in phase 1 within 5 days of arrival from overseas. Finally, as an observational study using surveillance data, results are prone to errors including inter-operator differences in defining and recording case data. Notably, that cases were on average recorded as being isolated before symptom onset from phase 3 onwards suggests that quarantine (or self-isolation) dates were reported. Although the impacts of movement restrictions cannot be differentiated from the timeliness of case management here, this still measures response performance.In conclusion, our study indicates that early and intense implementation of national COVID-19 suppression strategies have effectively altered the course of New Zealand's epidemic and limited the burden of disease and inequities in this high-income democratic setting, initially achieving COVID-19 elimination. This supports the WHO recommendations for timely decisive national leadership for evidence-informed, risk-based escalation and de-escalation decisions combining rigorous case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine measures with population education and engagement.

Inflammatory factors released as part of the 'cytokine storm' are thought to play a critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients (4). The cardiac sequelae reported in patients with COVID-19, include acute coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathy, acute pulmonary heart disease, arrhythmias and heart failure (5). There have been multiple proposed aetiologies for these, yet clear mechanistic insight is lacking (5). There is a severe inflammatory response in 5% of COVID-19 patients, associated with septic shock (2). This leads to a drop in blood pressure, and approximately 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 require vasopressors to improve blood pressure (6). Furthermore, 68-78% have sustained cardiac dysfunction, primarily right ventricle dysfunction and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (7, 8) .In severe infections, inflammation associated with a 'cytokine storm' can cause cardiac dysfunction and pathology. COVID-19 induces a cytokine storm of similar magnitude to that induced by CAR-T cell-associated cytokine storms (9). Additionally, the severe COVID-19 is associated with sepsis and bacterial products in the serum (10), which are known drivers of cardiac pathology and dysfunction. In the absence of infection, well known inflammatory mediators such as TNF are associated with heart failure and have been demonstrated to induce systolic dysfunction (11). Thus, inflammation could be a major primary mediator of cardiac injury and dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and would have further pathological consequences including inadequate organ perfusion and immune cell infiltration, further exacerbating disease. Thus, preventing cytokine-induced cardiac dysfunction may limit severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, targeted treatment strategies, particularly in severe infections such as COVID-19, are currently lacking.Several anti-inflammatory agents have shown clinical benefit for the acute management of COVID-19. Dexamethasone improved 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization (12). Additionally, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (ruxolitinib and baricitinib) and IL-6R inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) are currently in COVID-19 clinical trials. However, systemic immunosuppression may impede viral clearance thus potentially exacerbating disease (13). To circumvent this, we aimed to identify cardiac-specific inflammatory targets that trigger cardiac dysfunction in response to the cytokine storm, reasoning that these might provide a safe and effective therapeutic option.Here, we utilize multi-cellular human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac organoids (hCO) combined with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to identify therapeutic targets and treatments for cardiac dysfunction. We recently adapted our hCO system (14, 15) to include co-culture with endothelial cells that form enhanced branched endothelial structures surrounded by pericytes (Fig. S1) , together with an optimized culture environment that reflects a maturation stage; mimicking the postnatal metabolic environment (15) followed by reversion to a more adult metabolic substrate provision (see Methods). This platform enabled rapid screening of cytokine combinations that mimic the COVID-19-induced 'cytokine storm' and cardiac dysfunction, with subsequent application of omic assays and drug screening (13).We began by examining the effects of a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cardiac function in our hCO (13, 16) . Inflammatory molecules tested were TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17A, and G-CSF, as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns including poly(I:C) to mimic dsRNA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic TLR4 activation and septic responses.Using 17) , we identified that the expression of the receptors IL1R1,  TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, IFIH1, MYH88, IL6ST, IFNAR1, IL6R, TMEM173, IL17RA, IL17RB,  IL17RC, IL17RD, IL17RE, IFNGR1, TLR3 , and TLR4 were at similar or higher levels in our hCO compared to adult human heart (Fig. S2A) . In adult mouse hearts many of these are enriched in non-myocyte populations (18) (Fig. S2B) . We used single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to assess cell specificity in our enhanced hCO (Voges et al., In Revision) . Mapping to human heart snRNA-seq (19) revealed the presence of proepicardial/epicardial cells, fibroblasts, activated fibroblasts/pericytes and cardiomyocytes (Fig. S2C,D) . Some cardiomyocytes were fetal-like, however there was a distinct sub-cluster that mapped adjacent to adult ventricular cardiomyocytes from human hearts (20) (Fig.  S2E) . The cytokine/pro-inflammatory receptors were expressed across different cell types, but were enriched and more highly expressed in epicardial cells and fibroblasts ( Fig. S2F ) (15, 17) . We screened inflammatory factors in all pair-wise combinations in hCOs with multiple functional measurements including contractile force, rate, activation kinetics and relaxation kinetics (14, 15) ( Fig. 1A) . TNF caused a reduction in force, while IFN-γ, IL-1β, poly(I:C) and LPS caused diastolic dysfunction characterized by a preserved contractile force but prolonged time from peak to 50% relaxation (Fig. S3) . A secondary full-factorial screen of TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and poly(I:C), once again revealed that TNF induced systolic dysfunction (Fig. 1B,D) with an EC 50 of 1 ng/mL at 48 hours (Fig. S4A) . A combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C) induced diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 1c,e) , however also decreased the beating rate which may influence the kinetics of contraction (Fig. S5, Supplementary  Video 1,2) . Changes in rate were not responsible for increased relaxation time, as hCO paced at 1 Hz retained the severe diastolic dysfunction phenotype (Fig. 1F, Supplementary  Video 3,4) . Individually, IFN-γ and IL-1β caused concentration-dependent diastolic dysfunction with a low EC 50 of 0.8 ng/mL at 48 hours and 3 ng/mL at 24 hours, respectively, while poly(I:C) was not able to induce dysfunction alone ( Fig. S4B to D) . These results were confirmed in an independent cell line and overall the combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C) induced the most consistent, robust diastolic dysfunction ( Fig. S6A to E) . Taken together this demonstrates that TNF induces systolic dysfunction consistent with previous in vitro (21) and in vivo (22) studies and the combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C) induces severe diastolic dysfunction in hCO. The dominant factor identified causing diastolic dysfunction, IFN-γ (Fig. S6C) , is generally elevated in heart failure patients, but its role in heart failure is contradictory in animal models with both detrimental and beneficial effects reported (23).The most common cardiac dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is right ventricular dysfunction or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (7). Therefore, we chose to interrogate the mechanism of diastolic dysfunction induced by IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C), from here on referred to as 'cardiac cytokine storm' (CS). Since protein phosphorylation is intimately linked with all biological functions (24) we reasoned that measuring the global phosphoproteome in hCO would provide an accurate fingerprint of the mechanistic targets of the CS. Employing the latest developments of our phosphoproteomics technology (25, 26), enabled identification of over 7,000 phosphosites in each sample, accurately pinpointing 7,927 phosphorylation sites to a single amino acid residue on around 3,000 different phosphoproteins from single-run measurements of 20 organoids yielding < 100 µg of protein each ( Fig. 2A, Fig. S7 ). Preliminary studies using TNF identified several known biological effects of this cytokine including decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase A and increased phosphorylation of ADRK1 (also known as GRK2), supporting our approach. Applying this technology to the CS treatment revealed 91 phosphosites that were consistently elevated across three biological replicates (Fig. 2B) . These sites were enriched for terms relating to proliferation, with transcription factors over-represented with 35 sites found on transcription factors or chromatin-binding proteins and 13 associated with the biological process term 'cell proliferation' (FDR < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Among these was phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) S727 (median 13.9 fold), as well as two sites on BRD4 (Bromodomain-containing protein 4) S469 and S1083 (median 7.4 and 12.3 fold respectively) (Fig 2B,C) . In view of the availability of specific small molecule inhibitors for each of these targets or their upstream regulators we focused on these proteins in subsequent functional assays. The cytokine receptor enrichment in non-myocytes (Fig. S2 ) and broad expression of key phosphorylation sites such as BRD4 (Fig. 2B) suggests a multi-cellular response mediates cardiac dysfunction. We assessed activation of individual cell populations in hCOs using snRNA-seq of ~40 pooled hCOs per condition ( Fig. 3A) with mapping as described above (CTRL - Fig. S2C ,D and CS - Fig. S8A,B) . In CS conditions there was an increase in fibroblast and activated fibroblast number (Fig. 3B) . Consistently, recently identified markers of fibroblast activation (27) also increased, including MEOX1, SERPINE1 (also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 which induces clotting), TNC, VEGFC, and IL4R, (Fig. 3C,D) . Fibroblast activation is known to be widely associated with cardiac dysfunction, including in patients with diastolic dysfunction (28).We next screened drugs that could potentially prevent cardiac dysfunction under either TNFinduced systolic dysfunction or CS-driven diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 4A) . TNF is known to induce systolic dysfunction via GRK2 mediated repression of β -adrenergic receptor signaling (21). The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine hydrochloride, can inhibit GRK2 (29), but we found that it was toxic at effective in vitro concentrations (30) (Fig. S9A) . GRK2 mediates receptor endocytosis (31), and baricitinib was recently identified as a potential AAK1-mediated endocytosis inhibitor using machine learning (32). Baricitinib prevented TNF-induced dysfunction in hCO ( Fig. 4B and Fig. S9A,B) . However, baricitinib was only protective against TNF-induced systolic dysfunction when co-administered with TNF and was not effective after 24 h TNF treatment (Fig. 4C) , potentially because receptor internalization had already occurred. Additionally, hCO did not recover quickly from TNFinduced systolic dysfunction after the removal of TNF (Fig. 4C) indicating that secondary remodeling events may have occurred.A key signature of diastolic dysfunction under CS conditions was elevated phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators. STAT1-S727 ( Fig. 2C) is associated with assembly into chromatin and is required for STAT1 transcriptional and biological activity in response to . The putative STAT1-S727 kinase is CDK8 (34), so we next tested two CDK8 inhibitors SEL120-34A (35) and BI-1347 (36) previously shown to reduce STAT1-S727 phosphorylation. We also tested baricitinib and ruxolitinib two inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway. However, none of these compounds, nor a broader spectrum CDK inhibitor flavopiridol, prevented the CS-induced diastolic dysfunction (Fig. S10) , noting that flavipiridol was toxic and reduced force and hence all kinetic parameters. Notably, SEL120-34A and BI-1347 specifically attenuated the rate and activation time defects under CS conditions ( Fig.  S10B ,C,E,F), which we validated in additional experiments ( Fig. S11A to D) and may still have clinical utility in this setting.We observed elevated phosphorylation of the epigenetic regulator BRD4 in our CS treated hCO phosphoproteome. We have previously shown that BRD inhibitors reduce relaxation time in immature hCO (14), so we next evaluated the BRD inhibitors INCB054329 (37), JQ-1 (38), and ABBV-744 (39). Strikingly, INCB054329 prevented CS-induced diastolic dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12 ) without affecting force or rate ( Fig. S10A to G, Supplementary Video 5). JQ-1 also showed improved diastolic function in one hPSC line at the highest concentration ( Fig. S10H) , so an additional higher concentration for both JQ-1 and ABBV-744 were tested. JQ-1 protected hCO against CSinduced diastolic dysfunction, although INCB054329 was the most efficacious ( Fig.  S13A,B) . ABBV-744 was not effective, possibly because it is also an androgen receptor inhibitor, which causes diastolic dysfunction in human cardiomyocytes (40). INCB054329 restored diastolic function following 24 h of CS conditions (Fig. 4E) . This is potentially because CS-induced diastolic dysfunction is driven by the presence of the inflammatory mediators, demonstrated by partial hCO recovery 24 h after removing CS factors (Fig. 4E) .In patients, all inflammatory factors may be present simultaneously, and we found that INCB054329 could attenuate diastolic dysfunction with all four factors, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and poly(I:C), present (Fig. S13C) .Diastolic dysfunction in hCO and human patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or COVID-19 is associated with fibrosis (28, 41) (Fig. 3) , with BRD4 known to activate extracellular matrix deposition by fibroblasts (42, 43) . In addition to this potential mechanism, chronic inflammation caused by obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension cause systemic inflammation which also drives endothelial dysfunction and decreased nitric oxide (NO) availability (44). This causes iNOS compensation in other cell types, which can cause nitrosylation stress and cardiac dysfunction (45, 46). As BRD4 is broadly expressed in our hCO ( Fig. 4F) , BRD4 inhibition may also protect against these changes. We found CS decreased NOS3 mRNA (also known as eNOS) and induced NOS2 mRNA (also known as iNOS) ~40 fold in hCO, which in turn could be fully prevented by BRD inhibition without rescue of eNOS (Fig. 4G) .We next assessed whether human serum from COVID-19 patients could induce dysfunction in hCO (Fig. 4H) . Interestingly, levels of acute cardiac damage (cardiac troponin I, CTNI) and cardiac stress (brain natriuretic peptide, BNP) were elevated in 'mild' rather than severe patients in our cohort (Fig. 4H) . Using our platform we were able to demonstrate that hCO function was dictated by factors present in the human serum, as patients receiving noradrenaline as inotropic support elevated contractile force in our hCO (Fig. 4H) . Human COVID-19 patient serum with elevated CTNI and BNP caused diastolic dysfunction in hCO (Fig. 4H) . INCB054329 prevented diastolic dysfunction caused by serum with the highest levels of CNTI and BNP, and had no effect on function in hCO treated with serum with the lowest levels of CNTI and BNP (which did not induce dysfunction and was free from inotropes) (Fig. 4I ).There are currently no reported animal models that recapitulate the cytokine storm following SARS-CoV2 infection that has been observed in humans. We therefore tested the ability of INCB054329 to prevent LPS-induced cytokine storm and lethality in vivo (Fig. 5A) . LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β and IFN-γ, which were elevated in the plasma (Fig. 5B) and induced in the heart (Fig. 5C) . Treatment with INCB054329 blocked the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production ( Fig. 5B,C) . LPS induced a fibrotic response in the heart including induction of Meox1 and Tnc but not Postn, consistent with our data in hCO (Fig. 3) , which was also blocked by INCB054329 (Fig. S14) . Also, consistent with data in hCO, LPS reduced eNos and induced iNos which was blocked by INCB054329 without rescue of eNos (Fig. 5D) . Nppb was also reduced, consistent with a reduction in LPS-induced cardiac stress (Fig. 5E ). We observed a marked improvement in mortality, whereby all INCB054329-treated mice survived after 24 h of the LPS-challenge, compared with only 25% in the control group (Fig. 5F ). INCB054329 therefore has potent and robust effects on improving of cardiac pathological markers and cytokine storm-induced mortality.SARS-CoV2 can infect human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM) (47). We tested whether BRD inhibition would potentially exacerbate infection/death (Fig.  6A) . We confirmed these findings and show that infection of 2D cultured hPSC-CM increases over time (Fig. S15A) , dsRNA is present in infected hPSC-CM (Fig. S15B) and there is live viral replication in infected hPSC-CM (Fig. S15C) . Increasing viral titres increased cell death (Fig. S15D) and even low titres resulted in intracellular viral infection and death over 7 days (Fig. S15D,E) . Low titres of 0.01 MOI could infect mature hCO, demonstrating that this was not due to hPSC-CM immaturity (Fig. S15F) . However, hCO infection was ~100 fold lower than 2D culture and there were no gross effects on sarcomere organisation in the hCO (Fig. S15F,G) , indicating localized infection. We therefore chose to assess the effects of BRD inhibition on viral replication in 2D hPSC-CM (Fig. 6A) . Treatment with INCB054329 at the time of infection did not change viral load or replication (Fig.  S15H,I,J) . As patients may receive BRD inhibitors prior to infection of the heart, we also assessed the impact of a treatment combined with 3 day pre-incubation of INCB054329. This resulted in a >4 fold decrease in viral load (Fig. 6B) , potentially via decreased ACE2 expression (Fig. 6C) . Treatment with INCB054329 also prevented cardiomyocyte sarcomere loss caused by infection (Fig. 6D,E) and drastically reduced the presence of infected cells Fig. S15K ). This indicates that pre-treatment with BRD inhibitors confers some protection of the heart to SARS-CoV2 infection, making them very promising therapeutics for the prevention of cardiac injury and dysfunction for patients with COVID-19.Cardiac dysfunction may be caused by systemic cytokine storm (9) or locally induced cardiac viral toxicity or cytokine production (48). In this study we show that inflammatory mediators directly impact cardiac function in hCO, a model free from the secondary effects and neurohormonal compensation present in vivo. We find that a combination of classical viral response cytokines IFN-γ and IL-1β, combined with dsRNA -'CS' -cause severe diastolic dysfunction with 20-50% increases in relaxation time without decline in systolic function. This is consistent with clinical data from HFpEF patients, where cardiomyocytes have increased time to 50% relaxation by ~13-18% (with similar overall values of 100-150 ms in both humans and hCO) (49). A reason why cardiovascular risk factors for HFpEF are also risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, may be that the underlying chronic inflammation and cardiac dysfunction becomes further exacerbated by the acute, inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. Prolonged relaxation also increases the risk of arrhythmias, which have been widely reported in COVID-19 patients (50). Arrhythmic events increased in CS conditions across our 7 experiments, for which INCB054329 also conferred protection (Fig. S16A to C) .By performing high-sensitivity phsophoproteomics and drug screening with our optimized hCO platform we identify a therapeutically targetable inflammation-BRD4 -fibrosis/iNOS axis. This acts as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction, which functions independently of JAK/STAT. BRD4 inhibition reduced inflammatory cytokine production, fibroblast activation, and compensatory iNOS production, all of which drive cardiac dysfunction.Previously, the BRD inhibitor GSK525762A has shown efficacy in mouse cytokine storm models (51) and JQ-1 has shown efficacy in small animal cardiac injury models (52). However, in our studies INCB054329 was far more potent than JQ-1, and ABBV-744 had no efficacy in improving CS induced dysfunction. This indicates that BRD inhibitors need to be carefully selected for cardiac efficacy, despite their broad utility for a variety of clinical conditions (53).We demonstrate that BRD inhibitors are powerful drugs to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and prevent cardiac infection. Additionally, we also show anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, which may have benefits in multiple organs affected by COVID-19 including the lungs (43). Taken together, the efficacy and known safety profile of BRD inhibitors make them prime candidates for drug repurposing for COVID-19 to improve morbidity and mortality.A) Schematic of experimental pipeline.

Although EDs are generally capable of meeting the immediate medical needs of this population, they are not always effective at addressing the complex social and chronic health issues associated with homelessness.The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 virus, has the potential to exacerbate existing social inequities and health disparities, including barriers to accessing social services and healthcare. It is imperative that the emergency care community reflects upon the delivery of healthcare to patients experiencing homelessness, with a view to identifying strategies for optimising health outcomes during and beyond the pandemic.People who are homeless are at disproportionate risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing a more severe disease trajectory. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 continues to evolve, but available data indicate that males, older adults and people with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory disease are at higher risk of critical illness or death from COVID-19. These risk factors are elevated among homeless people, who are predominantly male and suffer a high burden of chronic health conditions (often poorly controlled) at a younger age than the general population, in addition to mental health and substance use problems. The standardised mortality ratio among the homeless population is 2 to 5 times greater than for the general population. 2 The majority of people experiencing homelessness in Australia sleep in 'severely' crowded dwellings (44%), supported accommodation (18%), boarding houses (15%) or with other households on a temporary basis (15%). 1 Untenured, congregate living conditions are not conducive to physical distancing, commonly lack amenities necessary to maintain hygiene, and place individuals at greater risk of exposure to infecton. 3 Moreover, for those who are sleeping rough or staying in congregate shelters, there is little or no opportunity for effective isolation or quarantine measures.In addition to the risks posed by unstable and unsuitable housing, people who experience homelessness may be unduly affected by lockdown and containment measures, as many support services have been reduced or suspended to comply with government restrictions. For instance, in Victoria, drop-in services and day meal programmes have been deemed non-essential services. Although such restrictions have been implemented to reduce community transmission and to prevent outbreaks, contraction of these services may adversely affect the physical and mental health of homeless individuals and hinder community engagement. Closure of community-based services may also lead to increased demands on EDs for health and social care.In order to provide effective care during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency care providers must be agile in responding to the unique needs of people experiencing homelessness. Clinicians working in urgent and emergency care settings may be the first and only health professionals to have contact with homeless people. 4 As such, it is essential that ED encounters are used to address the complex healthcare needs of this population and to improve linkages between hospital and community services.Homelessness is dynamic and can be challenging to identify. Most existing healthcare systems are poor at identifying homeless patients and underestimate the prevalence of homelessness in the ED. 5 Underrecognition is exacerbated in emergency settings where homelessness is frequently perceived to be synonymous with 'rough sleeping', despite rough sleepers accounting for only 7% of Australia's homeless population. 1 In the midst of a global pandemic, the urgency to identify people who are homeless is magnified, both because homelessness poses inherent risks that exacerbate potential exposure to infection, but also because there are widespread implications for public health, including community transmission, contact tracing and the provision of isolation and quarantine services.The integration of standardised housing questions into triage screening or routine clinician history taking may improve the identification of patients experiencing homelessness, as well as those whose housing is at risk. 6 Homeless persons have high rates of ED utilisation and repeat visits. 7 However, most EDs follow traditional disease models of care and struggle to address the complex social needs of homeless people, alongside tending to their healthcare needs. Despite unresolved needs, people experiencing homelessness often discharge against medical advice or are routinely discharged into unstable housing situations or to the street. Medical step-down facilities under hospital governance (e.g. The Cottage St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne) have been shown to be successful and efficient models to provide healthcare and support, but these are not widely available. There is an urgent need for widespread adoption of innovative and integrated models of ED care, stronger hospital-to-community partnerships and greater collaboration with existing services. For example, the introduction of dedicated homelessness teams and primary care in-reach services into the EDs in Western Australia has proven successful in reducing ED presentations and admissions, decreasing the frequency of discharge against medical advice and producing significant cost savings. 8 Much of the success of this programme is attributed to the bridging and integration of community services into the acute care setting.Despite ample evidence that 'housing is healthcare', many hospital discharge guidelines fail to acknowledge the implications of housing on health and to consider individual housing needs. 9 Patient disposition into crowded dwellings or to the street may be especially deleterious during the COVID-19 pandemic and blatantly violate physical distancing restrictions. Indeed, an outbreak of COVID-19 among the homeless population would be challenging to contain, given the inherent difficulties of contact tracing, isolating and quarantining a transient population.In an effort to avoid this scenario, the Victorian Government has established emergency response homeless hotels for rough sleepers, an Integrated Intake Assessment and Triage Service and COVID-19 Isolation and Recovery Facilities (CIRF) in metropolitan Melbourne. CIRF provide basic healthcare and supported accommodation for people experiencing homelessness who require isolation or quarantine, including patients who are discharged from hospital awaiting test results. 10 Of note, there are no CIRF in regional Victoria and existing CIRF are limited in their capacity to manage behavioural problems and concurrent medical or substance-use conditions that require hospital services. 10 In these instances, EDs may be required to admit patients for ongoing care or at least until SARS-CoV-2 test results are returned, the feasibility of which will vary across services.In order to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2, maintain public health and better serve and care for people experiencing homelessness, emergency healthcare settings must institute effective systems to identify people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Knowledge of housing status is imperative to the provision of adequate treatment and referrals, disposition and ongoing care of homeless individuals. 6 Furthermore, it provides the base to improve research capability on health and health service utilisation among homeless people, to measure progress, to build evidence, to affect policy change and to provide highquality services. This is even more important during the era of COVID-19. As communities struggle through this period of economic turmoil and rising unemployment, the number of individuals at risk for homelessness will increase. The absence of pointof-care testing and the associated delays with obtaining swab results means follow up is frequently conducted via telecommunications. This is problematic and further highlights the importance of CIRF for people experiencing homelessness, as these individuals may be transient, unable to engage with contact tracers, or may not have resources necessary to access telehealth.Consistent with the concept of social determinants of health, adequate housing significantly contributes to better health, offering both direct and indirect benefits. 3 For these reasons, permanent housing solutions are required, as temporary measures will not eliminate the ongoing risk of COVID-19, nor address the complex health needs within this population. Recent research has demonstrated an association between social deprivation, housing insecurity and COVID-19 infection. 11 In order to address the social inequities and the health of people experiencing homelessness, prioritisation and investments in long-term social housing solutions are indicated. COVID-19 may act as the impetus EDs need to advocate for revamped models of care and systemic improvements (including housing) to optimise long-term health outcomes for people experiencing homelessness.To address the needs of the homeless population during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals must consider a range of innovative strategies. These include standardised housing questions, update of discharge guidelines, dedicated homelessness teams and primary in-reach services. EDs are the critical interface between community-and hospital-based care and are well placed to drive these reforms.There is a unique opportunity to leverage COVID-19 response efforts to mobilise sustained improvements in health and social care for people experiencing homelessness. In addition to immediate public health benefits, targeted initiatives and multisector collaborations have the potential to have a positive, long-term impact on marginalised populations. Addressing the needs of patients experiencing homelessness may be challenging but forms a central component of the social contract between EDs and the communities they serve.","Australia","first author","2020-10-03",10

Perhaps the earliest work on such modelling was by Kermack and McKendrik (1) . They introduced a class of models referred to as compartmental models (2) . Nowadays these models are often referred to as the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) models or some equivalent thereof (3) . In these models the entire population is divided into three compartments according to these labels and the transitions of people from one compartment to another determine the rates of infected and recovered people. Infected people may infect susceptible people, and infected people may either develop immunity, or may be removed from the population due to death. Simi-larly new individuals enter the population due to birth. However birth and death may be ignored and the population may be considered as conserved during rapid spread of a disease without incurring significant calculational errors. The transition rates between the compartments are the free parameters in this model. The SIR model has been extended in several different ways. For example only two compartments, susceptible and infectious are used when individuals do not develop immunity in case of diseases like influenza. The SIRD (susceptibleinfectious-recovered-deceased) model differentiates between the recovered and deceased compartments. Infected individuals can either recover or die. The transitions over time are modeled as first order differential equations in all SIR models. These models also have been discretized and simulated (4) . In spite of their success, the compartmental models are simplistic and consider only homogeneous population groups within each compartment. As a result, complex interactions between individuals or complex behavior of individuals are hard to capture in these models (5) . The spread of a pandemic is a complex phenomenon that is determined largely by the interactions between individuals in a community and for example the way a virus can remain active on the surfaces of inanimate objects. Compartmental models can typically capture a global effect that is determined by the transition rates between the compartments, without any finer control at the individual level. For example, one of the most important public policies often invoked during a pandemic outbreak is typically some form of social distancing. Moreover these measures must be optimized to prevent disrupting economic activities as well as to reduce the spread as much as possible. It is difficult to incorporate such social distancing measures in the compartmental models. The only possibility is to introduce some global parameters retrospectively assuming the model fits the data perfectly. In other words, these models are not naturally best suited to make forward predictions. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to assume that each member in a population will behave in an effectively uniform (rationally or irrationally) homogeneous way in a pandemic situation. It is difficult to capture these individual variations in behavior through global parameters, even though such individual behaviors may have global effects in the spread of a pandemic. These shortcomings of the compartmental models were D R A F T pointed out by Epstein (6) and Parker and Epstein (7) . They argued that the assumption of a homogeneous nature of population is in particular unrealistic in compartmental models, since complexity of interactions among individuals through their access to public places and social networks are quite often difficult to capture in these models. On the other hand agent-based modeling can capture these nuances of interactions in a society more accurately. National Institute of Health's Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) program (8) based on agent based simulation helped in formulating policies during the avian flu or H5N1 pandemic.Parker and Epstein (7) reported a global scale agent-based simulation of six billion people for modeling the spread of a pandemic. While the spread of a pandemic is not restricted by national borders in today's global world, quite often the public policies for preventing the spread of a pandemic are dictated by local situations within a country, state or even a city. Hence it is an important and interesting question to examine whether agent-based models can simulate local situations accurately (9, 10) . In particular, an accurate simulation based on a local trend of the spread of a pandemic can give the authorities the scope to frame local policies regarding social distancing measures to curb the future spread of a pandemic. Local and national governments are grappling with this problem of framing appropriate national and local policies rapidly in many countries around the world, including the USA, India, China and the countries in the European Union.Validating a model of pandemic spread is a challenging problem. It is very difficult to estimate the extent of the spread, as many infected individuals remain asymptomatic. Testing is often reactive, rather than proactive. Individuals are mostly tested when they display symptoms, hence positive cases identified through testing is often biased. One possibility is to consider death rates due to a pandemic, as has been done in many works such as in Ref. (11) . However the death rate alone may not be a reliable measure of the spread of a pandemic, due to the fact that quite often older individuals with other health problems (so called co-morbidity) succumb to a new infection disproportionately. Further, it is likely that the number of COVID deaths may be under-reported and there can be significant lags between the actual time of death and the time the death certificate is issued (12, 13) . Hence, validating a model based only on death rate can be problematic and does not capture the spread of infection and in particular the severity of the infected population accurately. The challenging aspect of framing public policy is to capture the severity of infection, as severity puts pressure on the health infrastructure in terms of provisioning hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU). Hence in this paper we consider hospitalization and ICU data for validating our model. As we shall see, our study projects proportions of deaths which seem consistent with those reported in various sources. It is possible to use robust and publicly available data as hospitalization and ICU figures are available from the government health departments, for example, from the New York state government (15). Of course the assumption here is that all severely infected patients can be accommodated in hospitals, which is the case in most developed countries, e.g., (15), and at least in the initial stages of a pandemic in developing countries. It should, however, be noted that in New York as time progressed fewer patients were transferred to the ICUs due to an improved ability to treat these patients in the hospitals. Thus, the proportions of people who ended up in the ICUs did not remain a constant in time (16). However, in our work we have regarded this number as a constant for the sake of simplicity. Further refinements of the model or rendering the proportion of people who are transferred to ICU can indeed be easily varied in our study. We present an agent-based modeling framework for local communities and cities in this paper. To our knowledge, this work is distinct from other attempts using an agent based approach (see for example in Ref. (17) ) We introduce two types of entities in this model: home groups and public places. Each home group consists of 2 − 6 members and each public place has a fixed capacity. We start the simulation with a small percentage of infected agents among the members of the home groups (typically about 0.1% of the total population). In each time step of the simulation, a random member of a randomly chosen home group visits a random public place if all the public places are not filled to capacity. An agent picks up infection from a public place in the presence of other infected agents. There are over fifty models currently deployed in for forecasting the incidence of infection and death due to Covid-19. Most of these models are different adaptations of the SIR model, regression models or ensemble models. The main aim of the models is to accurately predict the spread of infection and deaths by using the data known until now. Hence the objectives of these models are quite different from the model we present in this paper. Our aim is to choose our parameters from the very early trends of the spread and validate the model through precise data on hospitalization and admission to ICU. We believe that the data on the spreading of infection may not be very accurate due to biases in testing. The paper by Keskinocak et al. (18) discusses an agent-based model. However, they mainly use their model to study the effects of social distancing measures and compare their simulation results with data on spreading of infection. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the details of our model and the methodology in section 2, we discuss the results in section 3, and we conclude with discussions and future work in section 4.Depending upon the effective viral loads carried, we assume that there are four categories of agents in our simulations. We also let the entire population to be susceptible to infection and allow only a part of the population to have better immune response. This segment of the population can recover from the infection asymptomatically. The other part develops complications.The effective viral load of category 1 agents reaches a low D R A F T threshold, stabilizes for a certain time and then a typical agent recovers with a presumed exponential decay of the viral load. The exponential decay is assumed because we chose to assign the gradual reduction of the effective viral load to have a characteristic time scale as opposed to being scale-free. We do not consider immunity in this work, as it is not well established whether there is even any short-term immunity from COVID-19. Hence agents who have recovered from a mild infection may get infected again. The effective viral load of a category 2 agent continues to grow until it reaches a higher value that requires hospitalization. A category 2 agent has two possible outcomes. One possibility is that a category 2 agent may stay in the hospital for a certain number of days and then recovers through an exponential decay of its viral load. Otherwise a category 2 agent is shifted to ICU after a certain period, and then may either transform into a category 3 agent and dies, or recovers from ICU as a category 4 agent, again through an exponential decay of its viral load. Since our simulation time frame is rather limited, we assume that agents in categories 2, 3 and 4 do not visit any public places. We have chosen these categories in order to validate our model in a robust manner given that the data for hospitalization and admission to ICU are quite robust and publicly available (15). Note that we have avoided using the death rate as a quantity that is being tracked in our model except to assume that the number of deaths of the agents in the ICUs should be consistent with the overall number of deaths in the entire period of our simulations. The main result of this paper is that simple agent-based models give accurate results for hospitalization and admission to ICUs based upon parameters that can be constructed through trial and error as well as on directly available data as explained in detail below. Moreover, once the needed parameters are extracted for a given region and the population involved, our model can predict the future trends in hospitalization and admittance to ICU. Thus, our study may allow for the possibility of preparing for future demands on health care, or better provisioning of services. There is a population of N agents divided into G home groups, each with 2 − 6 members. We assume that the number of households with a single member is small enough to not have a significant effect on our calculations, a condition that can be relaxed when considering studies on smaller pop-ulations. The size of a home group g i , denoted by |g i | is chosen randomly within this range, although the population N is fixed. In other words, G is chosen so that |g i | = N . The number of time steps T in our simulation is based on the notion of a virtual day. The simulation is run for 50 days, each day consisting of a number of time steps depending on N . This is done to create a realistic situation that at least one member from each home group has a chance to visit a public place like a grocery store for getting provisions at least four times during the simulation period. (However it is not guaranteed that members of each home group will visit public places at least four times due to the stochasticity in the choice of agents in each simulation step). Hence the total number of simulation steps is Σ{|g i | × 4} and a day, denoted by D, consists of Σ{|g i |×4} 50iterations. There are P public places p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p P , each with capacity C. We have kept the capacities of the public places homogeneous with a realistic assumption that an agent comes into contact with only a small number of other agents irrespective of the total capacity of a public place. We vary the public place capacities for implementing social distancing measures in our model. In our realization, an overall lower capacity in public places would expose a smaller number of agents to infection, which is the aim of social distancing.The viral load profiles of random individuals from various effective viral load categories, those who get mildly sick, those who get sick enough to be hospitalized, then among them those who transition to ICUs and may or may not survive, are reported in Fig 1. Fig. 1 shows the representative agents from each category. The plateau regions of infections in Fig. 1 are between 3 − 6 days, according to our notion of a virtual day, randomly chosen for each agent. The viral load of a category 1 agent increases for one day, that of category 2, 3 and 4 agents increases for three days. The separation between category 3 and 4 agents occurs after one day in the ICU, i.e., category 4 agents lose their viral load through an exponential decay and category 3 agents progress towards death through an exponential rise in viral load.The life-cycle of an agent is as follows. An agent either stays at home, or visits a public place. The viral load of an uninfected agent is zero and continues to be so when it stays at home. A random agent is selected from a random home group in each simulation step, provided the agent is not a category 2, 3 or 4 agent. Category 1 agents may be chosen at any stage and we assume that these agents are asymptomatic and able to visit public places. Once an agent is chosen, it visits a public place depending on the availability of space in the public place. We randomly choose a public place to accommodate the agent. A simulation step is considered as a failure if all the public places are already filled. Once an agent enters a public place, it stays there for a small amount of time, arbitrarily fixed at about 10 minutes according to our calibration. An uninfected agent gets infected if the public place was previously visited by other infected agents, or if there are other infected agents currently visiting the public place. We assume this initial infection to be a small amount of viral load, as a particular agent may visit a public place D R A F T at most a few times and the duration of the stay at a public place is also short. Finer models of initial infection, e.g., an exponential increase in viral load depending upon how many other infected agents are simultaneously present in the public place, did not show any qualitative differences in our simulation.Agents spend most of the simulation time in their home groups. An agent enters its home group after returning from a public place and remains there unless chosen again to visit a public place. As we have mentioned before, only uninfected or category 1 agents can visit a public place. While in a home group, the infection level of each agent increases by a unit amount in each time step until a threshold is reached as discussed below. This is the rationale behind our calibration of the simulation time in terms of days, as the viral loads for the transitions in the model are reached due to this increase over specific number of days of simulation time. Hence there are basically two simple transitions in an agent's life, home to public place and back. We have assumed that the other members of a home group are not infected due to the presence of an infected member, in other words isolation at home is perfect. However it is easy to lift this restriction in our simulation, though the only qualitative effect is an increased rate of infection. Another way of implementing this infection in home groups is to randomly infect a small number of uninfected agents if there is any infected agents in their home groups. However, this also does not produce qualitatively different results.We now discuss the transitions between the categories of agents in our model. There are three transition probabilities in our model, p 1,2 , p 2,34 and p 3,4 . These transition probabilities along with the capacity of the public places are the free parameters in our model. When category 1 agents reach their threshold of viral load, a fraction of them transitions into category 2 agents whose viral loads keep on increasing, while the remaining agents remain as category 1, enter the plateau of incubation and finally recover through an exponential decay of their viral load, as shown in Fig. 1 . This transition from category 1 to 2 occurs according to the probability p 1,2 . The second probability p 2,34 separates the category 2 agents from category 3 and 4 agents, when category 2 agents reach the higher threshold of viral load in Fig. 1. Category 3 and 4 agents are more vulnerable and their viral loads increase after the incubation period and they are admitted to ICU, while category 2 agents recover. The third probability p 3,4 separates category 3 and 4 agents after they are admitted to ICU. There is an initial increase in viral load for both categories, but category 4 agents recover after that, whereas category 3 agents progress towards death.This model captures a realistic scenario of spread of a pandemic in which infection is transmitted through air and different surfaces. Hence public places are the primary source of spreading the infection. There are several sources of stochasticity in our model, the agents who visit the public places are chosen randomly, and category 1 agents may be chosen repeatedly. The incubation time of the virus in an agent is random within a range, and the probabilities with which an agent transitions from one category to another are also sources of stochasticity. We will analyse the results of our simulation in terms of incremental hospitalization and admission to ICU, comparing with such incremental data released by the health authorities. It will be clear that these three probabilities and the capacity of public places (the four free parameters) are sufficient to match reliable data for the COVID-19 epidemic. We are unaware of any model that is accurate enough to match this kind of hospitalization data. We now discuss the parameters in the model. They can be classified as sensitive and robust. The probabilities p 1,2 , p 2,34 and p 3,4 are sensitive parameters. Any change of one of these probabilities influences the next probability drastically. For example, if we increase the probability of transition from category 1 to 2, i.e., p 1,2 , there will be more category 2 agents in the population and consequently there will be more category 3 and 4 agents. Similarly, if we increase the probability of transition from category 2 to categories 3, 4, i.e, p 2,34 , the populations of category 3 and 4 agents increase. The sensitivity of these probabilities results in higher levels of hospitalization and admission to ICU, the two specific data that we use for validating our model. However, one robust aspect of our model is that these probabilities can be tuned by using the hospitalization and ICU data for an initial and relatively short period, and then the trend predicted by the model matches with the actual trend of hospitalization and ICU later. The robust parameters are related to the different viral load thresholds and the stable levels of viral loads after the thresholds are reached, i.e., the plateau regions in Fig. 1 . We denote the viral load threshold for category 1 agents as t 1 , that of category 2 agents as t 2 , and the threshold for separating category 3 agents from category 4 agents as t 3 . Recall that the plateau region for a stable viral load for all agents is chosen as between 3 and 6 days, randomly for each agent. This plateau region is denoted by P . We show in the results section that our simulation results do not have much qualitative changes if we vary the parameters t 1 , t 2 , t 3 and P . We summarize these parameters in the following table. The first five parameters are sensitive and the next four are relatively robust.transition probability for hospitalization p 2, 34 transition probability between category 2 and 3, 4 p 3, 4 transition probability between category 3 and 4 seed initial seeding of infected agents capacity capacity of public places t 1 viral load threshold for category 1 agents t 2 viral load threshold for category 2 agents t 3 viral load threshold for category 4 agents P duration of the plateau or stable viral loadThe model was simulated with ANSI-C multi-threaded code using the OpenMP library. A distributed memory version was tested using the MPI library, however the communication overhead caused lower performance. The simulations were run on the Pawsey supercomputer facility in Perth, Western Australia on two different architectures. The first one is Magnus, a Cray XC40 supercomputer, each compute nodeincludes two Intel Xeon E52690-V3 (Haswell) processors, each with 12 cores, 24 cores in total. The second architecture is Zeus, each node containing two Intel Xeon E5-2680 V4 (Broadwell) 14-core CPUs, for a total of 28 cores. It was necessary to run the longer simulations on Zeus due to a 24hour time limit for each job on Magnus. The simulation time for a population of 8 millions is about 42 hours, and that for a population of 1.2 millions is about 6 hours. Hence it was difficult to explore the parameter space for the simulation of New York city. Our simulation strategy is similar to that of Parker and Epstein (7), as we keep track of only the infected agents and not the whole population. The time for each iteration increases as a result as the simulation progresses. Still the efficiency was higher with this approach particularly for larger populations.The memory requirements were also within the 128GB per compute node of both Magnus and Zeus.We first show the simulation results for New York City with a population of about 8 million. The hospitalization probability in these simulations is 0.2, i.e., an infected agent transitions to severe with this probability (category 2 agents in our model). Among the agents whose infection levels require hospitalization, the transition to ICU occurs with a probability 0.3 (category 3 and 4 agents in our simulation). And among those who are admitted to ICU, recovery occurs with a probability of 0.5 (category 4 agents). The New York State Government data is shown in Fig 2 and our simulation results are shown in Fig. 3 . We also show a direct comparison between government data and simulation data for total hospitalization for NY City in Fig. 4 . We show the comparison between government data and simulation data for admission to ICU in Fig. 5 . As can be seen our simulation results match quite accurately with the actual data in Fig. 4 , except for a steeper rise in simulation results. However, our results for admission to ICU are overestimates of the actual data. This is due to the fact that we could not explore the parameter space for such a large population due to the very long simulation times. In particular there is a subtle interplay between the sensitive parameters p 1,2 and p 2,34 that we were unable to explore systematically due to very long simulation times.The results for Mid-Hudson valley are shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9. Though the population of Mid-Hudson valley is about 1.35 million, the dynamics of the spread of the infection seems to be very similar to that of NY city, as all the probabilities as well as the public place capacities are exactly the same in these simulations. Next, we show the simulation results for a smaller population and compare it with the government data for hospitalization and admission to ICU. This simulation is for the Western New York region with a population of 1.8 million. The overall hospitalization and admission to ICU are much smaller in number compared to that of Mid-Hudson valley, which has a comparable population. These results for the WNY region are shown in Figs. 10, 11, 12 and 13 .We have presented a simple agent-based simulation model in this paper that can match the actual hospitalization and ICU admittance data quite accurately. We would like to highlight that this simple model can be enhanced in several different ways to reflect the actual social interactions and hence the spread of a pandemic in the real world. Though this model is inspired by the works by Epstein (6) and Parker and Epstein (7), their model is of global scale, whereas our model is targeted for much smaller communities in cities and regions. The possible enhancements of our model can motivate the study of spread of a pandemic more precisely. For example, it is possible to impose a spatial grid on our home communities and public places to reflect the different parts of a city or community. It is even possible to simulate movable public places like public transportation and subway systems. A spatial grid will also enable imposing selective lockdown measures on different locations in the community, and study the effect of social distancing more precisely. As the results for NY City with a large population and Mid-Hudson with a much smaller population show, perhaps the location of Mid-Husdon is the reason for similar spread of the infection in these two communities. On the other hand though Western New York has a similar population as Mid-Hudson, the dynamics of spread of infection is quite different there, as is evident from both the government data and our simulation results. These kind of model findings can help suggest directions for further investigations of the pandemic spread in Western New York and other areas. We have assumed that an agent stays at a public place only for a short time, in other words our assumption is that the public places are homogeneous. It is also possible to group public places in our model according to shorter and longer stay, e.g., grocery stores, public transportation and offices. That will again facilitate a finer scale study of the spread of the pandemic. Our model has the capability to make forward predictions on the access needed to public health facilities, and that can help the local and state governments to prepare for the spread of the pandemic. The fine tuning of the parameters by noting the initial spread of the pandemic will help in predicting the medium term requirements of the public health facilities.","Australia","first author","2020-10-21",10

Pandemic 'plague' (possibly typhus) in 430 BC in Athens during the Peloponnesian war likely killed two-thirds of the local population, whilst bubonic plague in the 14th century killed one-third of the world's population. As with many of their predecessors, these were caused by bacteria, and in true contagion-style, able to take flight in the setting of severe crowding, poor public health control, limited (if any) antimicrobial intervention, and in association with major events such as wars. The word 'quarantine', or a period or place of isolation, comes from the Italian word 'quaranta' which means 40. In the mid-1600s the Italians stopped people from disembarking from ships for 40 days if it was believed there was a disease outbreak onboard, a legacy we still embrace today.In contrast, more recent pandemics have been dominated by viruses such as influenza H1N1 and H3N2, localised epidemics by Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), MERS-CoV, and now, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. These can often be directly transferred from animals as occurs with other zoonoses, and have occurred in settings of modern public health systems, where antimicrobial agents of varying efficacy cannot be readily deployed, and in the absence of any identifiable major global event.We welcome this collection of papers from colleagues on SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 from both the diagnostic laboratory and clinical viewpoints. Our aim is to provide up-to-date perspectives at a national level on this significant pandemic, and lessons learned during the greater part of the current pandemic. The exponential growth in manuscripts globally on SARS-CoV-2 means that no single cross section of papers will provide all the important information. However, by having a single edition, with broad focus on human pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we aim to provide the readers of Pathology with insights from different areas of COVID-19 diagnosis. These include an overview of the variety of diagnostic tools and their application as summarised by Gulholm et al., 1 together with technique-focussed articles on molecular diagnostics (Williams et al. 2 Substantive progress continues to be made in the arena of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection with improvements in molecular diagnostics, rapid antigen detection tests and serological assays. As for all diagnostic tests, the clinical utility will depend on clinical context and, importantly, on disease prevalence which should inform their use. Delineation of case clusters using next generation sequencing methods are critical for timely infection control and public health measures. These aspects have not been included in this mini collection but are described elsewhere. 16, 17 We conclude with two thoughts. Given the rise in cases in some regions of the Asia Pacific and their likely adverse social impact, Australia is a good position to deploy assistance if required. Branley et al. 18 have provided one example of such deployment to a remote Australian quarantine setting. We continue to be faced by the risk of pandemics and we must learn from our observations at present with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and resulting COVID-19 disease. P.G. Wodehouse wrote in 1926: 'To the thinking person nothing is more remarkable in this life than the way in which humanity adjusts itself to conditions which at their outset might well have appeared intolerable'. Our ability to tolerate, as well as learn and share in a collaborative manner new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, and to harness this knowledge to reduce human suffering, is something of which we can be proud. Hand-in-hand, however, we must also be cognisant that science changes constantly and hence (as noted by the Honourable Mr. Justice Archie Campbell in The SARS Commission Executive Summary) 'the point is not about who is right and who is wrong… we should not be driven by the scientific dogma of yesterday or even the scientific dogma of today. We should be driven by the … principle' 18 to take every reasonable step to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection. During the coming months and years, this, together with use of knowledge in designing diagnostic tests, research into antivirals, vaccines and novel interventions will be important in how we improve the outcomes of this pandemic.The authors state that there are no conflicts of interest to disclose.","Australia","first author","2020-10-08",10

It is argued that no previous infectious disease, including the Spanish Flu (1900) has had such an influence on the financial markets (Baker et al., 2020) . The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the dynamic connectedness of stock return and volatility in global financial markets. More importantly, we assess whether return and volatility connectedness differ in countries with previous experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Our study is driven by both the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its severe effect on global financial markets.We conjecture that there is greater heterogeneity in the timing and intensity of investors' responses to COVID-19 between a country (market)-pair with alike pandemic experience compared to a country pair without such prior experience. Accordingly, stock market connectedness in the former pair tends to be significantly lower than the latter pair. Our rationale is based on the behaviourist theory of investing, which incorporates elements of psychology to explain market imperfections. Ru et al. (2020) find supporting evidence for the imprint theory (see Marquis and Tilcsik, 2017) in behavioural bias of investors, such that investors with early experience on similar crises tend to react more quickly to COVID-19 than those without such imprints. Previous studies have documented that prior experience with similar events can affect individual's risk aversion (Guiso et al., 2015 and Bernie et al., 2017) and investments (e.g., Huang, 2019) . While investors should add stocks that minimise the risk of their portfolios, in practice investors choose stock which they are familiar with. A prominent example in the literature is the home bias in stock holdings (Kilka et al., 2000 , Huberman et al., 2001 and Wang et al., 2011 . Investors have richer knowledge of stocks in their home countries and hence prefer to exploit this to their advantage. This implies that perception about the situation is an important factor that drives the decision-making process (Nguyen et al., 2019) .Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we join the rapidly growing discussion of the economic impact of COVID-19 on global financial markets (Baker et al., 2020; Zaremba et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Secondly, we contribute to the literature of connectedness and contagion by assessing the impact of COVID-19 on stock return and volatility connectedness . Thirdly, by analysing phases of the pandemic, we address how quickly return and volatility connectedness vary alongside the severity of the pandemic.Last but not least, we contribute to the behavioural theory of markets by investigating how return and volatility connectedness change conditional on prior experience in SARS 2003 (Ru et al.. 2020 .Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) similar to other crises, stock return and volatility connectedness increase as the severity of the pandemic builds up; (2) both return and volatility connectedness decrease among countries with experience in SARS 2003.The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the data and modelling framework. Section 3 discusses the results of our empirical analysis and finally Section 4 concludes the paper.Our sample period is from the 22 nd January 2020 to 20 nd May 2020. The start of our sample period is the day when Johns Hopkins University started to publish the daily confirmed and death case statistics in COVID-19. 2 Our initial sample includes countries in the Group of Twenty (G20), which consists of governments of 19 countries and the European Union. The choice of G20 is driven by their systemic importance to the world economy. 3 We obtain and merge our data from four sources. Firstly, we measure return and volatility connectedness using the 5-minute interval stock prices from Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH). Secondly, we extract daily interest rates, foreign exchange volatility and GDP growth from Datastream. Thirdly, the number of confirmed cases and death tolls of COVID-19 are obtained from the Coronavirus Resource Centre of Johns Hopkins University. Lastly, the number of deaths of each country during SARS in 2003 is collected from the website of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Our sample includes 11,696 observations over an 86-day period.To measure return and volatility connectedness, we employ the approach of Yilmaz (2012, 2014) . More specifically, we construct the generalized total return and volatility connectedness index of each pairwise countries in G20 within a bivariate fractionally integrated Vector Autoregressive (FIVAR) model. The FIVAR model allows flexibility to capture the stationarity (or short-memory) of the stock returns as well as the long-memory behavior of the volatility. The bivariate FIVAR model can be specified as follows:where is a vector of the stock return in country i and j in case of return connectedness analysis,i.e. ( ) , or a vector of the two stock volatilities in case of volatility connectedness analysis, i.e. ( ) . and are respectively realized return and realized volatility, which are calculated using the 5-minute stock prices of the G20 country. 4 The error term, ( ), with * ; + as its variance-covariance matrix. is the ( ) coefficient matrix associated with , and denotes the ( ) identity matrix. L is the lag operator while is the lag order of the model. ( ) *( ) ( ) + with d denotes the memory degrees of the stock volatilities. 5 We firstly calculate the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEV) matrix from Model (1) with a rolling window of 200 days and a forecast horizon of 10 days. 6 The ( ) element of the GFEV matrix at day t can be calculated as,As shown in Do et al. (2013 Do et al. ( , 2014 , to incorporate the Diebold and Yilmaz approach in a FIVAR model, the moving coefficient matrix need to be adjusted with the long memory degree (d)and is calculated recursively as, ∑ . We note that, , and is the identity vector with unity as its rth element.Next, we construct the total generalized connectedness between country i and j at day t using the normalized GFEV ( ̃) as, Andersen et al. (2003) , Do et al., (2014) . ∑ , and ∑ , where is the nth 5-minute logarithmic stock return in day t. 5 In case of return connectedness analysis, d is restricted to be zero due to the stationarity of the stock returns, which makes our bivariate FIVAR model equivalent with a bivariate VAR model. We estimate our bivariate FIVAR model using Yip et al. (2017) approach. where, ̃ ( ) ( ) ∑ ( ) .To capture the experience in SARS 2003 of each pair of G20 countries, we create a category variable SARS_death i,j , in which SARS_death i,j =0 when neither country in the pair experienced SARS death; if only one country reported deaths in SARS in 2003 in a pair, As COVID-19 spread across the world and its severity has evolved, we create a category variable COVID_stages to capture three stages of COVID-19 development in our sample. The first stage is from 22 nd January to 29 th January 2020, when COVID-19 was mostly transmitted within China. The second stage is from 30 th January to 10 th March 2020, the period over which COVID-19 gradually spreads across the world, so that the WHO declared global public health emergency on 30 th January 2020. In the third stage, the severe impact of COVID-19 was recognized and declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. We incorporate the development of COVID-19 within the following model: Furthermore, we also add three control variables in all models to consider the cross-country differences in economic development, including interest rates (proxied by 3-month government bonds), foreign exchange volatility over the previous 21 trading days and quarterly GDP growth.Given that our dependent variable is between a pair of country, we estimate the within-pair differences for the aforementioned control variables. In addition to the use of discrete stages to measure the severity of COVID-19, we perform analyses using global and country-specific confirmed or death cases. Columns (1-2) and (5-6) of Our study provides evidence of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on stock market connectedness. In general, connectedness in global financial markets is intensified with the rapid development of the pandemic. We also find that connectedness is considerably lower if a country experienced SARS death(s) in 2003. Our findings are associated with behavioral biases of investors in stock markets, in which investors with early experience of the similar pandemic tend to react faster and stronger to COVID-19 compared to those without such prior experience. This is because the former group of investors are more alarmed about similar risks faced in the past, while the latter group of investors tend to neglect those risks. (1). The dependent variable is Return connectedness for columns 1-2. The dependent variable for columns 3-4 is Volatility connectedness.COVID_stage=2 is a dummy variable if the date is between 30th January to 10th March 2020, and zero otherwise.

A survey of 1491 Australian adults found since the pandemic started 48.9% reported a reduction in physical activity, 40.7% had poorer sleep quality, 26.6% increased alcohol consumption and 6.9% increased smoking intake. 1 These negative changes are linked to higher stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. 1 A metaanalysis combining studies conducted across Asia and Europe found the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population are 29.6%, 31.9% and 33.7%, respectively. 2 Those who had to self-isolate or work from home may have decreased their incidental physical activity. Additionally, the pandemic has affected food accessibility, led to food stockpiling, caused production issues and increased food prices. This also led to an increase in purchases of highly processed foods with a long shelf life. Shelter-in-place restrictions can result in irregular eating patterns and frequent snacking which are associated with increased risk of obesity. Restrictions in public spaces, loss of routine, reduction in working hours or loss of job and reduced social contact with others may contribute to increased feelings of isolation, depression or anxiety. Such feelings may further diminish people's motivation or confidence to undertake preventive health action. Without swift action, these significant behaviour changes may become ingrained and contribute to increased risk and subsequently additional cancer diagnoses in the medium to long-term.In contrast, some might also argue that there were positive impacts on health during COVID-19 lockdowns. For example, those who worked from home had access to more time by not commuting and were protected from traffic pollution. This extra time at home could be used for exercise, relaxation, spending time with family and cooking healthy meals, which are all behaviours associated with a lower risk of cancer.decreased due to service closures or delays including reductions in colonoscopies, mammograms and HPV tests among others. In many countries, only symptomatic case detection whereby patients selfpresent to GPs continued. For example, all screening services were suspended in the United Kingdom and referrals for cancer dropped dramatically by 75% since the pandemic started, with an estimated 2300 cancers going undiagnosed per week during the lockdown period. 3 In the United States, screening tests for breast, prostate, colorectal, cervical and lung cancer were down 87%, 60%, 90%, 83% and 39%, respectively in April 2020, compared to February 2020, with an estimated 80,000 missed cancer diagnosis over a 3-month period. 4 In Australia, bowel, cervical and breast screening also declined rapidly. 5 There were 145,000 fewer mammograms conducted between January and June 2020, compared to the same period 2 years prior. 5 Media outlets reported health and hospital systems were 'hotspots' for infection, and overwhelmed during the pandemics' peak, which resulted in many patients being cautious about seeking healthcare for fear of contracting the virus or further straining the healthcare system. The Australian national bowel screening program continued to provide test kits by mail. However, research suggests that patients tend to avoid or forget to attend to routine cancer screening when feeling anxious or overwhelmed by other life stressors. 6 Given the physical, social and economic challenges people face due to COVID-19, participation in cancer screening may provoke more anxiety than usual, and not be a priority for patients during these times.After extended diagnosis delays, cancer services will likely experience a large patient backlog. A sudden surge in cancer diagnoses will increase demand for cancer treatment and if more patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, could further overwhelm health and hospital services, as well as psychooncology and, supportive care services as well as palliative care. This may have a critical effect if a second, third or seasonal wave of COVID-19 infections occurs. The long-term impact of these delays will only become apparent in the future. In the United Kingdom, the estimated increase in cancer deaths up to 5 years after diagnosis range from 4.8% for lung cancer to 16.6% for colorectal cancer. 7 COVID-19 also threatens to impact how cancer treatment is delivered and the implications for cancer survivors have been discussed elsewhere. 8 To reinstate paused cancer screening activities, patients may need to be provided with a cue-to-action, such as a letter from their health care service provider that it is safe to return in-person, or patients could be encouraged to attend by adding an incentive such as a free flu vaccination. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the issue of patients potentially staying away from their doctors, Cancer Australia released a nation-wide campaign 'Cancer Won't Wait' to educate people on cancer symptoms, and the importance of prompt presentation, either by telehealth or in-person, to a health professional if they are concerned. Cancer early detection campaigns have successfully been used in Australia prior to COVID-19 and can serve as models for future use during pandemics.The pandemic has reinforced the need for telehealth, which was previously advocated for use primarily in regional and rural areas.Globally, despite the numerous benefits of telehealth, its limited uptake prior to COVID-19 was frequently reported to be a result of patient and clinician barriers including time, infrastructure, equipment, cost, education and preference for in-person consultations. In Australia during March-May 2020, the volume of GP telephone consultations increased (from 0% to 34% of all consultations), while there has been little change in GP consultations conducted via videoconference (from 0% to 1% of all consultations). 9 Limitations of in-person healthcare delivery such as inequity in access have become even more evident during this pandemic and changing attitudes towards telehealth indicate a need to increase availability and accessibility. For example, self-collection of vaginal samples for cervical cancer screening is currently only available for women whose screening is overdue, but may actually increase participation more broadly, with telehealth consultations facilitating this process. Virtual skin checks, whereby consumers send images of lesions suspicious for skin cancer, are another example of a cancer screening service conducted via telehealth. However, many countries do not have regulatory frameworks in place to integrate and reimburse telehealth. 10 There has been a global call to action for governments to implement a national strategy and operational plan to increase education and guide clinicians to switch to telehealth in a standardised manner. 10 A proactive approach to health promotion and cancer prevention could be facilitated by increased reimbursement of preventive health checks and counselling. Telehealth delivery of cancer prevention has enor-In summary, as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdowns, more than ever the onus for cancer prevention has been firmly pushed back to each person's self-management. Contributing to the containment of a pandemic, whilst balancing risks and benefits about how and when to obtain cancer prevention and early detection services will be an ongoing issue and requires better preparation.Collaborative research into the long-term impacts of pandemics is crucial to address these issues. Intervention trials should use standardised COVID behavioural assessment tools to allow results to be comparable and facilitate sharing of lessons learned.","Australia","first author","2020-10-27",10

People with cancer may be immunosuppressed due to their disease and treatment and are therefore at greater risk for infections, such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 2 The novel COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 3 COVID-19 spread rapidly through human-human transmission and resulted in a pandemic affecting 216 countries across the globe. 3, 4 COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and as such the primary symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. 5 Additionally, evidence now suggests that symptoms of sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, muscle or joint pain, fatigue and loss of sense of smell and taste are associated with mild cases of COVID-19. 6 As of the 17 th of September 2020, there has been over 29 million cases and nearly 931,321 deaths associated with COVID-19 globally, resulting in a fatality rate of approximately 3%. 4 Early evidence out of China highlighted that the fatality rate was higher for people with pre-existing comorbidities. 7 In particular, people with cancer were seen to have a mortality rate of 5.6%. 7 Further studies in Europe and America have supported these findings. [8] [9] [10] [11] Impact of COVID- 19 Strategies such as social distancing and quarantine requirements have been implemented globally to mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19. 8 These measures, as well as the distress associated with a pandemic, have resulted in widespread anxiety and a deterioration in mental health across the globe. 12 The level of distress cancer patients experience may be increased due to concerns about contracting COVID-19 and how the pandemic could affect their access to oncology services for care and treatment. 3 Social distancing measures including the limitation of visitors in healthcare facilities may also affect a cancer patient's support network and sense of well-being. 13 Telehealth and Cancer Care during Telehealth is defined by the Telehealth Resource Centre as a collection of means or methods for enhancing the healthcare, public health, and health education delivery and support using telecommunications technologies. 14, 15 Telehealth in cancer care is not new; it has been effectively used for cancer symptom management, survivorship care, providing remote chemotherapy supervision, palliative care, and psychological support. 2, 16, 17 Nonetheless, the social distancing and quarantine requirements instigated to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented, rapid and widespread adoption of telehealth technology. 15 As people affected by cancer are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19, it is critical that their risk of contracting COVID-19 is reduced. 16 The use of telehealth can aid this process by providing safe and appropriate care to the patient whilst minimising physical contact with a healthcare facility. 18 Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to explore how telehealth has been utilised across interdisciplinary healthcare professional groups in cancer care and broad reach clinical trials delivery.The rapid deployment of telehealth services during COVID-19 has resulted in a paradigm shift, where digital by default has become the new norm for healthcare delivery. 19 It is postulated that these digital solutions have the potential to become a great equalizer, acting as a catalyst for change in populations impacted by social determinants of health. 20 However, the opportunities afforded by telehealth are only beneficial if the patient possesses the necessary skill set to effectively comprehend, navigate, and troubleshoot the required digital interfaces, otherwise there is a risk that health disparities will be further increased through the addition of a digital divide. 21 This specific skill set is known as telehealth literacy and is defined as the aptitude to find, comprehend, and evaluate health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem. 22 Telehealth literacy requires an interplay between six core literacies: traditional (reading and writing skills), information (how to locate and use relevant information), media (critical thinking and filtering trustworthy information), health (ability to appraise and act on health information), scientific (understand science based information) and computer (ability to use digital technology). 22 Empirical evidence has identified specific vulnerable patient groups to telehealth literacy challenges which include those who are older, live rurally, have less formal education, lower socioeconomic status, come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, living with multiple chronic conditions and those who have less access to online resources. 23 Low levels of telehealth literacy can have significant implications for online security, particularly with the sensitive nature of health information, the need to understand complex privacy laws and the volume of unregulated health apps currently available. [24] [25] [26] It has been observed that higher telehealth literacy levels empower cancer patients and caregivers to engage in shared decision making and has been linked to seeking a second opinion, effective utilization of self-monitoring/self-management strategies outside of the clinical setting, as well as increased treatment compliance throughout the cancer care continuum. 24, 27 Patient, caregiver, and practitioner education in telehealth systems is vital to build capacity and smooth the transition to online delivery. 24, 28 Oncology nurses and members of the interdisciplinary team should consider administering a patient reported outcome measure, such as the eHealth Literacy Scales (eHEALS) 29 to determine the eHealth literacy levels of patients. This should be delivered prior to the implementation of online interventions, thus ensuring patients and caregivers continue to experience quality person-centered cancer care. 30 Moreover, telehealth literacy skills are crucial for people affected by cancer and their caregivers, as they must be able to interpret the information to make informed decisions about different avenues of cancer care, and possible participation in clinical trials. 24, 30 During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiation oncologists have followed guidelines that provide alternate treatment options. COVID-19 clinical guidelines 31 have enabled patients to delay treatment, come for fewer fractions of treatment (hypofractionation) or, to exclude radiotherapy completely. Such considerations are important when access is reduced or visiting the hospital setting creates additional risk to the patient. 31 For example, lung cancer patients have been given increased options for high dose stereotactic treatments to reduce visits to one to three sessions. Whereas prior to COVID-19, a more conservative approach (around 25 treatments) resulted in increased travel for treatments at an oncology centre. 31 Elsewhere, international breast cancer clinical guidelines recommend several different options to ensure that hospital visits are kept to a minimum, which include: increasing the scope for the use of moderate hypofractionation (15 fractions), increased utilisation of FAST forward trial fractionation (5 fractions) or omission of radiation treatment altogether for some specific cohorts. 32 In prostate cancer management guidelines created by a team of radiation oncologists from the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) recommend a combination of changes for different presenting stages of disease. Active surveillance is recommended for patients with low to favorable intermediate risk disease; whilst higher risk patients are managed with androgen depravation treatment until radiotherapy is safe to be delivered. Again, hypofractionation is recommended in most cases when treatment does commence. 33 In keeping with the changes in the delivery of cancer treatments there has been a rapid increase in the utilization of oncology telehealth service delivery.Telehealth models were developed in Australia a decade ago to improve the care of oncology patients, particularly in rural Australia. 34 Until the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth use in medical oncology was limited to rural patients and necessitated the presence of a general practitioner or nursing/allied health staff during the consultation. Despite the limited use, this model proved to be very successful and yielded high satisfaction among health care workers and rural oncology patients. 35 There is a dramatic change in this landscape since the current pandemic. Oncology practice all over Australia have now widely accepted and adopted to the telehealth model. Routine oncological reviews and the pre-chemotherapy assessments are now delivered through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020). This has significantly reduced the risk of exposure to the virus to immunocompromised patients by reducing the number of outpatient visits.There are studies supporting the benefit of telehealth in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients and healthcare workers. 36 Careful clinical history and inspection through a video assisted platforms have enabled clinicians to assess cancer related symptoms and toxicities of chemotherapy. Telehealth has provided many advantages to the patients and carers along with the healthcare workers. The recent change to telehealth has reduced the need to travel to the hospital, which is a major advantage for the cancer patients who have mobility issues and/or other physical disabilities. Telehealth has improved access to home based palliative care services for many patients. Recent studies indicate that telehealth can be safely used in discussing the advanced directives with patients/carers while optimizing end of life care both at patient's home and at health care facilities. 37 The visual features of telehealth are helpful in establishing rapport with the health teams and close connectedness with the treating team. This model may also be utilized to help maintain the patient's of quality of life and reduce the carer stress. 37During the COVID-19 pandemic, oncology specialists have been required to alter methods of service delivery across the clinic and treatment areas. Telehealth implementation has been facilitated by swift policy changes from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to enable physicians to provide telehealth to vulnerable patients from the 13 th of March 2020. Noteworthy, the previous telehealth Medicare codes had specific requirements which involved remote locations only, however, the new COVID-19 telehealth codes are now accessed by GP's, specialists, nurse practitioners, midwives and allied healthcare professionals for any consult where it was deemed clinically safe and appropriate.Furthermore, the COVID-19 telehealth model in Australia has also supported phone consultations with patients whereas previously, there were tight restrictions on video consults only. 38Many cancer centres have gone onto virtual cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings using various platforms including Microsoft Teams to ensure socially distant meetings. 39 This pragmatic approach has been welcomed by all health disciplines to ensure that multidisciplinary cancer team discussions continue to occur in a timely and safe approach during the COVID-19 pandemic 40 This platform has allowed specialized clinicians and teams to access meetings remotely, having a presence in meetings they may not have had access to prior to the pandemic, providing high quality advice to teams and care to patients. It is important for healthcare organisations to ensure that such platforms are safe and secure in keeping with data protection legislation. Given the success of the virtual MDTs meetings, it is likely that they will continue even after the end of the current pandemic because attendance of healthcare professionals at MDT meetings has increased compared to previous face-to-face MDTs meetings.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a shortage of accredited health placements due to social distancing, risk mitigation and isolation measures identified by placement partners. 41 At the same time, there has been a growth in telehealth technologies, funding and services. 38 While there is some research supporting the use of telehealth placements within accredited health programs which includes medicine, nursing and allied health, 42-44 the efficacy of telehealth for professional placements is underexplored.Evidence to date indicates that telehealth can deliver high quality healthcare; 36 transcends geographical, architectural and physical distancing restrictions; 2 and offers potential financial, access, monitoring and in-home advantages. 16 Telehealth's functionality, to bring together expert clinicians and carers (even if geographically dispersed), facilitates interprofessional collaboration which is known to improve clinical performance, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. 45 Interprofessional education (IPE) involves students from different professions learning with, from and about each other supporting the development of interprofessional learning competencies. 46 While some systematic reviews have been conducted to date examining the benefits of IPE in health education, 47 none have been conducted looking specifically at IPE through telehealth platforms.Telehealth has the benefit of being able to be delivered remotely, ensuring a safe learning environment for students and for vulnerable members of the population, such as oncology patients, during COVID-19. 48 Moving forward, the demand for qualified health professionals with competencies in the use of telehealth, such as the use of technology, digital literacy and communication skills 41 is expected to rise. 48 Therefore, curriculum development in undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare professional accredited courses which embeds telehealth competencies should follow.The rapid growth of digital technologies in 1990s was associated with an increasing use of computational imaging techniques in diagnostic pathology, although with many technical challenges. 49 The introduction of high-resolution digital cameras and the improvement of computational processing in the following years led to a better image quality and ease of access and brought about opportunities to help simulate actual microscopic examinations. 50, 51 These advancements consequently led to more sophisticated technologies which allowed for the whole slide imaging (WSI) of stained pathology glass slides in the clinical laboratory, to be viewed on the spot, sent to colleagues at distant places (telepathology), securely archived, or used for educational and research purposes. 52 Digital pathology encompasses WSI and related technologies such as image management system, laboratory information system, digital transcription, digital dashboard, work flow management, specimen labelling, tracking systems, digital image interpretation, and reporting tools. 52 There are many applications for digital pathology some of which are briefly mentioned here:Primary diagnosis: scanned images of pathology slides can be sent to the laboratory information system and hospital information system, to be examined by the pathologist. 53 This is gradually becoming a standard practice, but different health care systems and labs vary in the extent to which they embrace this technology, from laboratories which have digitised a select histopathology subspecialty to the laboratories with a large-scale digitisation of whole pathology slides. 54 2.Receiving/ giving second opinions and information sharing between pathologists: Digital and telepathology can facilitate obtaining second expert opinion on previously examined pathology slides from another on-site or off-site pathologists. 55 This approach is particularly useful for difficult cases. 56 3.Remote or flexible working conditions: with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the individuals' availability or mobility to and from the workplace, or even for the sake of flexible working situations, digital pathology provides an ideal platform where digital images of pathology slides can be electronically transferred to the pathologists far from their original labs (e.g. at their home office or even when they are away on a trip). 55, 57 Telepathology, can also be applied to improve the provision of pathology services to low-and middle-income countries 58 , or even rural and remote areas in high-income countries which are facing challenges in accessing pathology services which are mostly concentrated in large cities. 52 Another benefit of digital pathology and telepathology is that the pathologist can view and examine digital slides on their computer, laptop or even mobile phones, using a WiFi internet, mobile internet, or a ""virtual private network"" (VPN)connection. 59 A more effective workflow: Digitisation of the workflow in the pathology laboratory has been indicated to be able to accelerate the turnaround times of pathology diagnoses. 60 For example, the Kalmar and Linkӧping Hospitals in Sweden have efficiently integrated their slide scanners to their laboratory workflow allocation, and their pathologists regularly receive digital slides for making primary diagnoses without much need for waiting for the glass slides to arrive. 55 Improved slide archiving and slide retrieval: Maintaining a digital slide archiving system makes the tedious task of slide retrieval more efficient and time-saving compared to the glass slides kept at storage cabinets.Education: Digital and telepathology are increasingly used for educational purposes around the world and are gaining more acceptance among pathologists and academics. 59, 61 In Australia, a multi-university digital imaging online repository platform (partly related to human pathology) were launched in 2012. As of September 2020, this online platform contains over 20,600 medical and microscopic images which are being used for educational purposes at Australian and international universities. 62 The availability of archived high quality digital images is contributing to quality education at universities around the world. 55, 56 7. Improved ergonomic situations for pathologists: The use of digital pathology can improve the ergonomics of pathology slide examination, and in fact, many pathologists believe that it increases the efficiency of their work due to more comfortable working positions. 60, 63 8.Research: WSI and digital pathology is increasingly used in clinical and collaborative research. Facilitated availability and same-time access to digital images by different researchers, will encourage collaborative intra-and inter-institutional research through sharing and pooling the digital images and the relevant information. 55 Having mentioned all the above, however, digital pathology and telehealth is in its developmental stages and there are several challenges ahead which should be overcome before the full digitisation of pathology imaging. Some of these challenges include the high cost of equipment as well as a need for standardisation of reporting systems 61 , standardisation of slide preparation and staining to prevent excessive variations in the slide quality 53, 56 , and computational complexities in the image analysis. 56Internationally physiotherapists have incorporated telehealth practices for people affected by cancer to maintain services and contact without compromising their health. Using virtual communication methods, telehealth supports remote access to care for musculoskeletal assessments while maintaining social distancing. 64 Physiotherapists are an important member of the multidisciplinary team to help optimize function, movement, and quality of life for people affected by cancer. 65 Physiotherapy using telerehabilitation instead of conventional face-to-face care could be a lasting alternative to treat people diagnosed with cancer in their home environment after hospital discharge, but additional research is needed. 66Details of studies evaluating broad-reach delivery of lifestyle (including physical activity, diet and weight change) interventions that sought to improve health outcomes in those with cancer were first published in 2002. Specifically, these included a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the effect of a telephone-delivered high-vegetable, low-fat diet on breast cancer events and death in women with early stage breast cancer (n=3088). 67 The other pilot, RCT 68 evaluated a telephonedelivered weight-loss intervention for obese women with breast cancer (n=48). Within 10 years since the publication of results from these trials, an exponential rise in the number of studies evaluating the effect of broad-reach lifestyle interventions for people with cancer was observed. This increase was likely due to the growing recognition of (i) the clear association between physical activity and weight, and survival outcomes following cancer 69 , (ii) the growing evidence-base that supports lifestyle intervention (i.e., physical activity, exercise, weight loss and/or dietary intervention) leads to improvements in a range of health outcomes during and following treatment 70, 71 , and (iii) that face-to-face delivery of lifestyle interventions in clinical settings restricts access to a select group of oncology patients.In Effect sizes reported in the studies included within the systematic review ranged from small (0.2-0.49) to large (>0.8). These review findings were similar to those reported following a review of nonbroad-reach intervention trials (i.e., including highly supervised, clinic-based trials) involving those with cancer 73,74 , as well as telephone-delivered lifestyle interventions in the general population. 72, 75 Further, one of the studies included in the review was a comparative-effectiveness trial, which demonstrated that a telephone-delivered 8-month exercise intervention was as effective for achieving improvements in fitness and quality of life, compared with the delivery of the same intervention face-to-face. 76 These findings, which include a preponderance of support for telephone-delivered interventions among cancer survivors, are particularly noteworthy since anecdotally there has been a reluctance by members of the cancer care team (including allied health professionals) to accept that broad-reach lifestyle intervention delivery can be safe, feasible and effective. Additionally, at least prior to COVID-19, funding models rarely allowed for telephone delivery of lifestyle advice and support. It seems that a virus pandemic rather than scientific evidence was needed to facilitate flexibility in the manner by which cancer care is and can be delivered.With growing use of telehealth, it becomes particularly pertinent to highlight the limitations to the socioeconomic status -low through to high, residing in urban and more regional/rural areas, and with the majority of participants reporting more than one other comorbidity). Preliminary findings from the ongoing ECHO trial also demonstrate that telehealth delivery of exercise during chemotherapy for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer is safe and feasible. 78 Of note, as a direct consequence of the telehealth mode of delivery, unlike the vast majority of lifestyle intervention trials, ECHO was able to continue even during the strictest COVID19 restrictions. We now await the results that will determine whether the intervention is also cost-effective at improving survival, quality of life and function.There is a strong body of evidence to support exercise therapy as part of standard care for people affected by cancer. 79 Regular exercise has been shown to have a positive effect on reducing adverse treatment side effects, enhancing mental wellbeing, and improving cancer survival rates. 79 The COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant risk to people with cancer 10 and most face-to-face exercise oncology services have ceased and have been modified to home-based or telehealth delivery to reduce the risk of infection, posing a risk of a reduction in uptake of these vital services. 80 It remains imperative for people diagnosed with cancer to engage in physical activity during these challenging times, particularly as the negative physical and mental health impacts of self-isolation and quarantine are becoming apparent. 81 The need for safer options for the delivery of exercise services for people affected by cancer has recently become desirable, with the current COVID-19 pandemic forcing clinicians to re-think how they can safely deliver exercise interventions. Telehealth is one such option which has not traditionally been the main format of exercise delivery for people affected by cancer. 80 However some studies have already demonstrated its' feasibility 75, 82 and effectiveness in improving physical 75 The use of telehealth in the oncology setting is not new and in recent years has mainly been used to facilitate medical access for those individuals living in remote and rural areas. 28 During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, oncology nurses across the world were required to rapidly change to a telehealth service and adapt to provide safe and effective care to people living with cancer. 13 Rapid decisions were made, which included developing criteria for in-person versus remote care and developing equitable platforms for telehealth. Noteworthy, most decisions were made with limited guidelines or evidence for practice related to the pandemic. 13 Oncology nurses observed that telehealth may provide both a means for patients to be treated appropriately in their home environment without having to travel long distances for consultation, affording a timely solution to discuss side effects, interventions, and possible treatment additions and/or changes. 88 However, a barrier for oncology nurses who are involved in the provision of telehealth services includes the inability to perform a physical assessment (e.g auscultation) of the patient. This limitation, however, can be overcome using local healthcare professionals, who must ensure clear communication bothwritten and verbal back to the team.Fundamental to the success of telehealth delivery is reliant on the patient being able to use the technology appropriately. 22 Other issues can include, and are not limited to, data speeds impacting and interrupting consultations, poor quality or low-resolution cameras which might be problematic in identifying physical ailments which require nursing assessment. 25 Moving forward into the pandemic and beyond, these issues may cause a real barrier to the safe delivery of cancer services and have the potential to delay urgent medical life-saving interventions and therefore, requires careful consideration.Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic oncology nurses globally have demonstrated their continued ability to be effective leaders. 13 Transformational nursing leadership requires the ability to think critically, provide timely evidence based actions and solutions to service delivery and advocacy across all settings and domains of oncology practice. 89 Nurses have been at the forefront of designing and delivering rapid changes, including telehealth within oncology services over the course of this pandemic. 13 Internationally, oncology nurses have navigated different complexities, such as: reducing on treatment patient volume, maintaining the safety of patients and staff, managing out-and-in patient clinic flow, delivering modified treatment protocols, transitioning telehealth models of service and delivering organisational strategy through clear communication.The clinical telehealth response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been rapid and is continually evolving in oncology care. Evidence has identified that telehealth in oncology can be used across the interdisciplinary team to enable people to navigate the health system and access routine care during an infectious outbreak. The regular use of telehealth in cancer care may lead to more effective and sustainable models of care. However, the benefits and limitations of this model of service delivery needs to be carefully considered and appropriate training and education provided for all healthcare professionals and patients.","Australia","first author","2020-10-15",10

[9] [10] [11] There are many reasons why bystanders do not provide CPR, even when they witness an arrest and are provided with CPR instructions during the emergency call. These include fear of causing harm, a lack of confidence and skill, or that they perceive no benefit from intervening. 12 Some of the changes seen in rates of bystander CPR in high prevalence regions are likely to be due to the decrease in witnessed OHCAs. With lockdowns restricting people to their homes, social distancing and quarantine isolations of infected family members, there is less opportunity to witness an OHCA in public areas. 3 However, the public's willingness to provide bystander CPR, a potentially aerosol generating action 13 , may be intuitively damped by fear of contagion during an infective pandemic, providing another contributing factor.In this issue of Resuscitation Plus, Grunau et al. 14 present the results of a large international social media survey to investigate the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the willingness of bystanders to provide CPR to OHCA victims. A total of 1360 participants responded from 26 countries (predominantly Canada). As with all survey research, limitations such selection bias (survey was English only) and overrepresentation of groups due to the recruitment strategy were evident.Recall bias was a particular issue, as questions relied on participants recalling their perceptions of pre-pandemic willingness, ratings that may have been affected by being asked while living through the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study indicate a significant decrease in the willingness to provide CPR during the pandemic across all resuscitation steps especially, but not surprisingly, providing rescue breaths to a stranger. However, were basic personal protective equipment (e.g. facemask or mouth-covering) to made available, willingness to provide compressions during the pandemic significantly increased. These findings support the changes made Given the current increase in OHCA in the home and delays with EMS reaching patients, now more than ever we need bystanders to act. Once more, awareness and adapted education can play a crucial role: resumption of safe face-to-face training where possible, implementation of distance learning methods together with specific dispatch telephone instructions and information campaigns are all needed to explain the importance of CPR and that any resuscitation attempt is better than none.Janet Bray is funded by a Heart Foundation Fellowship.None.No Conflicts of interest.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Australia","first author","2020-10-19",10

While our emphasis is on research-based data collection via teleNP, we also touch upon issues relevant to the clinical application of TeleNP in epilepsy.The Australian Epilepsy Project (AEP) is a large-scale clinical research project shortlisted for funding by the Medical Research Future Fund of the Australian Government. The vision of the AEP is to develop predictive epilepsy-specific decision support tools for use by clinicians.Machine learning / artificial intelligence (AI) methods will be applied to prospectively acquired neuropsychological, genetics and advanced imaging data obtained from 8,000+ adults living with epilepsy, to predict their epilepsy-related two-year outcomes ( Figure 1 ). Sharing of deidentified datasets will further maximise breakthrough opportunities in research. We have commented elsewhere [5] on the role of machine learning/AI in the analysis of such datasets, and in the health sector more broadly, and do not consider this issue further here.The AEP commenced a pilot study in February of 2020 to evaluate recruitment feasibility and participant tolerability of the protocols for collection of neuropsychological and imaging data.The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Australia in late January 2020, and a State of Emergency was declared in Victoria in mid-March, around six weeks into AEP recruitment.Despite the introduction of Government-mandated COVID-related restrictions, the AEP pilot study has been able to continue by switching to the use of TeleNP for all participants. Prior to the arrival of COVID-19 in Australia, the AEP Pilot Study relied almost exclusively on face-to-face interactions for its data collection and analysis activities. The institutional and governmental response to COVID-19 in Australia demanded a re-evaluation and adjustment to each of these activities to ensure the safety of all persons involved, while preserving the scientific integrity and health care objectives. All our activities accord with guidance from  MRI: MRI is performed in-person, at research-dedicated scanners. All participants are screened for COVID-19 symptoms or risk factors before they attend the premises. On-site, physical distancing strategies, appropriate personal protective equipment use, and cleaning procedures are all applied according to up-dated research facility protocols. Images are transmitted electronically to the hospital radiology departments for standard reporting and clinical use. This approach eliminates the need for participants to physically attend hospital premises for clinical scans and reduces the burden on hospital radiology at a time of increased strain on the hospital system.While genetics and epilepsy follow-up (e.g. seizure diaries, medications, psychological and quality of life questionnaires, adverse events, health economic data) are not collected in the AEP Pilot Study, in the full project genetic samples will be obtained by blood-draw at a local community pathology provider (typically at the same time as routine clinical blood tests), and epilepsy follow-up will occur via smart device app/web survey and telephone call.Reporting  Data analysis and transfer is performed by research staff accessing secure server platforms remotely via encrypted network connections, enabling this work to be safely performed from home. Key team decision making activities are supported via teleconferencing.The most substantive protocol changes have involved the transition to collecting all neuropsychological data via TeleNP. Traditional, face-to-face neuropsychological testing carries elevated COVID-19 risk, both for participants and the neuropsychologist, and is clearly unacceptable from both a community safety and occupational health viewpoint. The examiner and examinee may spend several hours in close proximity, passing materials back and forth (e.g. stimulus materials, response forms), usually in a small enclosed room for privacy. Further, the examinee must also travel to the physical premises for the assessment, which can necessitate additional interpersonal interactions (e.g. public transport, waiting areas).The neuropsychological measures used in our TeleNP protocol are listed in Table 1 . These measures were selected for their evidence base in epilepsy (as acquired through traditional, face-to-face assessments), and their compatibility with TeleNP administration. The experience gained from the AEP Pilot Study will be used to further empirically refine instrument selection. Test of Premorbid Functioning [6] : an estimate of premorbid intellect based on irregular word reading, used here both as a measure of intellect, and due to the elevated incidence of reading disorders in epilepsy [7, 8] .WASI-II FSIQ 2 (Matrix Reasoning, Vocabulary) [9] *: a short form intelligence measure with excellent psychometric properties.Oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test [10] : the SDMT is a sensitive measure of processing speed and, in its written form, has been used widely in epilepsy trials [11] .Oral Trail Making Test [12] : a measure of divided attention and speed, sensitive (in its original written form) to dysfunction in epilepsy [11, 13] .Reverse Digit Span [14] *: a measure of working memory, sensitive to dysfunction in epilepsy [13] .Verbal Fluency [15] *: letter and category based verbal fluency are sensitive markers of dysfunction in epilepsy, both in focal epilepsy [16] and as an effect of antiseizure medications [13] , and also useful as a predictor of cognitive risk from surgery [17] .Boston Naming Test [18] *: a measure of confrontation naming, sensitive to lateralised dysfunction in focal epilepsy [19, 20] , and also useful as a predictor of cognitive risk from surgery [21] .Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (learning and delayed recall trials)*: a word list learning task sensitive to memory dysfunction across a range of epilepsy syndromes [22] , to lateralisation in temporal lobe epilepsy [19, 23] , and predictive of post-operative cognitive outcome [24] . [26] , it has been used widely in other neurological conditions and is sensitive to frontal and temporal lobe dysfunction [27] . We include the following measures from the CANTAB:  Spatial Working Memory: a measure of spatial working memory; shown to predict postoperative psychological outcomes in epilepsy [28] . Rapid Visual Information Processing: a measure of information processing speed and sustained attention; computerised assessment of sustained attention has been recommended for large scale epilepsy research [29] . While numerous different measures of non-verbal memory have been used in epilepsy there is no broadly agreed upon, recommended measure [23, [30] [31] [32] .Arbitrary associate learning has been shown to be a sensitive marker of mesial temporal lobe function in temporal lobe epilepsy [23, [33] [34] [35] . The paired associate learning subtest of the CANTAB has been shown to be a sensitive marker of pathology in the mesial temporal region in other forms of neurological disease targeting the mesial temporal lobe [36] . [39] *: a widely used mood screening tool developed specifically for epilepsy, validated against psychiatric interview determined clinical diagnosis [39] .Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD7) [40] *: a brief generalised anxiety screening tool that has been validated in epilepsy against psychiatric interview determined clinical diagnosis [41] [42] [43] .Epilepsy Anxiety Survey Instrument (EASI) [43] : an anxiety screening tool designed specifically for use in epilepsy, validated against psychiatric interview determined clinical diagnosis.In our pre-COVID face-to-face protocol we had been administering EpiTrack [13] and the Reaction Time task from the CANTAB. The trail making test (TMT), inhibition task and maze task within EpiTrack cannot be administered via telehealth, and the Reaction Time task is not available via CANTAB Connect (indeed the variability in the hardware possessed by participants would almost certainly preclude accurate measurement of reaction times in any home delivered, web based platform). We include the oral version of the TMT in our telehealth protocol, as a measure comparable to the written TMT [44] . We have also trialled various versions of the Stroop task (Victoria Stroop [45] , Dodrill Stroop [11] ), to use as a measure of inhibition, but have ultimately abandoned it due to insensitivity (Victoria version) and difficulty presenting the stimuli appropriately via videoconference (Dodrill version).The potential benefits of TeleNP have long been recognised, including convenience, user satisfaction, potential cost-reductions and improved access (geographic; availability of interpreter services [46] ). Nonetheless, the neuropsychological community has not uniformly embraced the adoption of TeleNP necessitated by the emergence of COVID-19. One of the most obvious concerns relates to whether TeleNP departs sufficiently from standardised faceto-face administration to invalidate test results and interpretation. There is accumulating evidence that telehealth delivered neuropsychological assessments can yield reliable and valid evaluations [47] [48] [49] . Since the emergence of COVID-19, a number of journal articles [4, [50] [51] [52] and statements from professional bodies have provided guidelines and experiencebased recommendations regarding the use of TeleNP (via position papers [53] , webinars and online resources; see, for instance, the Australian Psychological Society The best TeleNP evidence concerns the use of tasks that are predominantly verbal in nature [47] . This encompasses the majority of measures we have selected for use (Table 1) , and includes measures such as paragraph and word list learning tasks [54] [55] [56] [57] , verbal span/working memory tasks (such as digit span) [54] [55] [56] [57] , verbal fluency tasks [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] , and measures of crystallized intelligence (e.g. measures of word reading and vocabulary [57] [58] [59] [60] ).There is also evidence for tasks that rely upon verbal responses to visually presented stimuli, such as visual confrontation naming [54, 55] and visuoperceptual reasoning tasks (e.g. WAIS J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Matrix Reasoning [57, 58] ). While supported by good evidence, it is worth noting that purely verbal tasks do not guarantee immunity to issues when administered via telehealth. Transient interruptions of the connection can interfere, especially with 'one shot' (e.g. digit span) or timed tasks (e.g. oral versions of SDMT and TMT). Our experience to date has been that poor connections are often apparent from the outset, and in many instances can be remedied simply by re-establishing the call or asking other users on the network to minimise their own network usage (e.g. streaming). We have had one participant whose computer microphone proved to be faulty but were able to proceed by using a concurrent telephone call accompanying the computer's video feed without appreciable lag (a solution, incidentally, that we have employed in clinical practice also). Another participant was unable to establish a videoconference link from home, despite repeated attempts, and ultimately completed their teleNP assessment onsite.More difficult to administer are tasks that require physical interaction with stimuli provided by the examiner (e.g. paper forms, three dimensional blocks). While there is some evidence for administration of such tasks via TeleNP (e.g. Grooved Pegboard [57] ; written version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test [57, 61] , Complex Figure Copy and Recall Tests [62] , Clock Drawing Test [47, 48, 62] ) we have ultimately elected not to include them for a variety of reasons (impracticalities of providing materials to participants: Grooved Pegboard; poor sensitivity and reliability: Rey Complex Figure [31] ; suitable oral version available: SDMT). In other instances, we opted to retain the conceptual element of a traditional pen-and-paper task, but change the mode of delivery and response (e.g. using the oral versions of the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test [44, 57, 61, 63, 64] ), though we note that this likely alters what the task is actually measuring (e.g. pen-and-paper versus oral Trail Making Test [44] ).TeleNP is not without its challenges. Familiarity with the required technology -on the part of both the examinee and clinician -can influence the degree of engagement with, and the flow and ease of, the interaction. Indeed, we have found it essential to factor in ~15 minutes of initial set up time at the beginning of appointments to ensure participants are able to log onto the videoconference call and that their technology is functioning appropriately (assisting them via phone as necessary). A single neuropsychologist administered the TeleNP assessments for our protocol, with this individual completing multiple supervised practice administrations prior to commencing participant data collection (and reviewing the aforementioned TeleNP webinars provided by the Australian Psychological Association and the International Neuropsychological Society once these were available). These practice sessions were essential to ensuring familiarity with the testing technology and practicalities of administration via telehealth. We have also developed a set of Standard OperatingProcedures for telehealth to facilitate the training of new staff as the project expands.The suitability of TeleNP for specific patient groups is an important issue, such as paediatric populations, people with intellectual disability or severe cognitive compromise, and linguistically and culturally diverse groups. Indeed, many of these concerns are also relevant to traditional face-to-face consultations. This complexity has not yet been fully addressed by the field and remains a critical challenge to the broad application of clinical TeleNP. However, the acquisition of uniform test data for machine-learning analysis is a narrower problem, where these issues are partly avoided through assessment of a necessarily more targeted cohort in which TeleNP administration is appropriate.Access to technology is another issue of concern, since not all individuals possess the hardware required to support videoconference-based TeleNP. The use of technology at a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f local facility (e.g. GP clinic or research site) can increase availability and address issues of social equity, while simultaneously ensuring the quality of technology and connectivity [47, 48] . Indeed, the majority of evidence for telehealth administration comes from studies where examinees are tested via technology at a local research facility [47] . We have made this approach available to participants, in order to improve participant access to the study (we offer free parking for participants who are able to travel to the facility by car and offer taxi vouchers for those who require transport). To date, roughly 20% of participants have o Quiet, distraction free room in which to complete the TeleNP assessment  Emailed a link to a set of electronically-hosted surveys tapping elements of psychosocial functioning germane to epilepsy (e.g. Neurological Disorders Depression in Epilepsy [39] ; Patient Health Questionnaire GAD-7 [40] ; Epilepsy Anxiety Survey Instrument [43] ; QoLiE-31 [65] ; Liverpool Adverse Events Profile [66] [67] [68] ; ABNAS [69] ). The surveys are hosted on a REDCap [37, 38] database server at our institution. Emailed a telehealth information sheet, along with text describing an 'agreement to telehealth' whereby participant and researcher agree that they will not ""record, reproduce, publish or make copies of the materials used during the neuropsychology telehealth session"" [70] . Participants are advised that their TeleNP session cannot proceed until they confirm acceptance of this agreement.  Explains what will happen in the event of lost connection (attempt to reconnect; if unable to, will call mobile phone; if no contact within 10 minutes, session considered aborted and will be rescheduled)  Confirms the participant's current location and obtains additional contact information in event of emergency (e.g. seizure). We explain that in the event of a seizure, if we cannot reach one of the contacts provided, or if we feel a more urgent response is appropriate, that we will call an ambulance. This information is summarised in a teleNP information sheet provided to all participants in advance of their session. We are yet to have a participant experience a seizure during testing. Re-iterates terms of agreement to participate in telehealth (e.g. participant will not record or reproduce any materials) Neuropsychological testing is administered via the following methods [47,50,53,54,58,70- handle any unanticipated problems that might arise and also to monitor behaviour during the testing.For each task, the neuropsychologist records observations of anything that might invalidate a test (e.g. temporary connection loss; distraction). All data is recorded on response forms coding using a random six digit participant identification code, and then transcribed onto a secure central database (REDCap). Table 2 summarises the data for each cognitive task. Performance is considered for the sample as a whole (overall mean z-score, SD, n and result of one sample t-test/Wilcoxon signed rank test [relative to a mean/median z-score = 0, one-sided test], and percentage of cases performing >1.5 SDs below expectation), and also separately for each method of administration: teleNP-at home, teleNP-onsite, face-to-face (n for each method of administration, result of a one-way ANOVA/Kruskall-Wallis test).The ANOVA/Kruskall-Wallis tests indicate that no cognitive test shows a significant effect of administration method (p>.05, albeit with small group sizes). Collapsed across administration method, one sample t-tests/Wilcoxon signed rank tests confirm a pattern of impairments typical of those seen in epilepsy, with significant (p<0.05) reductions in processing speed (oral SDMT), executive function (oral TMT B, COWAT), language (BNT, Animal fluency) andanterograde memory (RAVLT measures). Trends (p<0.08) were also apparent for sustained rapid information processing (CANTAB RVP) and working memory (DSB, CANTAB SWM).Screening of mood and anxiety also confirmed a relatively high proportion of individuals at risk for these disorders: 10 of 29 participants (34%) were at high risk of mood disorder based on the NDDIE [total score > 15, see reference 39]; and between 8 and 11 (28% and 38%) were at high risk of anxiety disorder based on the brEASI [total score > 7, see reference 43] and GAD7 [total score > 7, see reference 42], respectively.  Anterograde memory: the most common cognitive complaint in epilepsy [74] ; the majority of focal epilepsies affect the temporal lobe [75] . Executive functions/fluid intelligence: sensitive to ASM effects [13] ; the frontal lobes are frequently involved in focal [75] and genetic [76] epilepsies. Crystallized intelligence: considered less susceptible to ASM effects [77] ; can be affected by age of epilepsy onset [78] ; provides a measure of cognitive reserve [79] . Mood: frequently disturbed in people with epilepsy [80] . Adverse treatment side effects J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Such screening assessments cannot replace comprehensive assessments and may miss subtle problems for some individuals. However, unlike other existing tools that have been developed for dementia screening, the tools would be validated for epilepsy, be age and education adjusted, address functions most often affected during the course of epilepsy and its treatment, and be useable for the remote assessment of patients unable to attend face-toface assessment or who would otherwise be lost to follow-up. Ultimately this kind of approach will facilitate large-scale collection of data that would not otherwise be practical using traditional methods. The impetus to move towards telehealth stimulated by COVID-19 should be viewed as an opportunity to expand the reach and breadth of neuropsychology [47, 54] . The clinical neuropsychologist's role in an epilepsy surgery program extends beyond psychometric documentation. The delivery of counselling, psychoeducation, advocacy, and psychotherapy via telehealth has a solid evidence base [82] , including in epilepsy specific contexts [83] [84] [85] [86] , and is encouraged in recent set of epilepsy-specific consensus recommendations [87] .Speaking from the local perspective, within the Department of Clinical Neuropsychology at Austin Health we already employ telehealth (telephone, videoconferencing using the Coviu platform) routinely in the pre-and post-surgical counselling of patients [88] . Anecdotally, a number of our patients have commented that they feel more comfortable in their home These anecdotal benefits are substantiated by our recent experience in Germany using phone or videoconference telemedicine in the counselling of people with epilepsy during the COVID pandemic [89] . Overall 82% of the 239 adult epilepsy patients participating in the audit were satisfied with their telemedicine experience, with high rates of satisfaction especially for time, comprehensibility, and opportunity to get answers to current questions. The participants J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f considered immediate convenience and shortfall of travel expenses as advantages of telemedicine. Approximately three quarters of participants reported that they would appreciate the opportunity for future telemedical counselling, but at the same consider telemedicine as an add-on service rather than a permanent substitute to visits onsite.COVID-19 has abruptly and dramatically changed the way that society functions, including the operation of the health and medical research sector. Our experience shows that it is possible to continue to perform evidence-based, epilepsy-related neuropsychological research while at the same time fully supporting public health strategies aimed at containing and mitigating the effects of COVID-19. In the event that sustaining such policies into the medium or longerterm is necessary, the strategies adopted by the AEP have positioned it to continue to grow and expand, with no impact on the feasibility, integrity or safety of the project. Indeed, this model of telehealth-based operations provides a template for the healthcare of tomorrow, while decreasing the burden on traditional hospital systems. The challenges posed by COVID-19 are immense, and we must respond swiftly and creatively, where possible converting the adversity of the present into opportunities for the future.","Australia","first author","2020-10-16",10

COVID-19 has however extensively impacted BSA and like all providers of medical imaging worldwide, BSA has had to respond directly to the COVID-19 threat to protect its staff, clients, their families and the wider community by making changes to the way it operates, including a never before seen shut down of services. 3 In the initial stages of the pandemic, COVID-19 is known to have impacted attendance for screening with the fear of infection seeing some women cancel their appointments or postponing them in an effort to 'do the right thing' and adhere to the 'stay-at-home' message put forward by the Australian government. 4 At the same time, professional bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR), the Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand (BreastSurgANZ Council) and the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy (ASMIRT) were also reacting to the threat, advocating for the cessation of routine screening. 5, 6 Despite concern that without screening, pre-clinical breast cancers would remain undiagnosed, the RANZCR argued that COVID-19 is a significant risk to the older screening demographic who face greater adverse outcomes from COVID-19 than the general population. The RANZCR put forward that even a delay of 6-12 months would not see a significant progression of an early undetected breast cancer. 6 The view was that to continue screening was an unnecessary risk to all involved and called for an immediate cessation of screening. 6 These views were ultimately agreed to by BSA, determining that the ongoing risk involved with continuing screening outweighed the benefits and routine screening was suspended. 7 However, ensuring continuity of care, recently screened women were still notified of their results and women requiring an appointment at an assessment clinic were able to attend for additional testing. 7 In due course, it was announced that all sites and services were closed.As the measures imposed by the Australian government flattened the curve associated with the first COVID-19 wave, BSA reopened, all be it to a 'new normal'. The reopening process has ultimately been a direct reflection of the COVID-19 threat in each community with advice from BSA being that resumption would be varied by location, with no specific date for when all services would resume. 7 Some states were advising that not all screening clinics were open and those that were may have reduced bookings to best mange social distancing and cleaning. 8 Others that screening services would recommence slowly through a planned staged approach. 9 With a second wave of infections now affecting some States, it has become evident that the 'new BreastScreen normal' will involve ongoing disruption to services and continued changes to practice, the extent being more severe in some jurisdictions than others.All non-clinical changes in the BreastScreen setting essentially mirror those undertaken in the wider community. In an effort to limit the transmission of COVID-19, women are encouraged to reschedule if they have recently travelled overseas or more currently to hotspot locations; have COVID-19 like symptoms; have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Some services are also prioritising bookings for due or overdue women in the target age group (50-74 years). 12 Women are also informed that key safety measures are in place at their appointment site. However, reflective of each State and Territory's COVID-19 status, not all Services provide the same level of detail with the NT BreastScreen website having only a generic link to Corona virus news, updates and alerts, 13 BreastScreen Queensland's site stating that'. . . Queensland services are implementing a range of strategies to minimise and address risks from COVID-19 for women who attend for breast screening and our staff'. 2 and BreastScreen WA that they '...will continue to ensure the highest levels of hygiene and care'. 14 The level of information available appears directly proportional to the risk of COVID-19. Other states such as NSW and Victoria who are at the forefront of a second COVID-19 wave have provided more extensive and detailed information. 8, 15 The burden of managing the important safety measures of risk profiling, temperature checks and social distancing at appointments has largely become the responsibility of clinic reception staff. Where women are able to adhere to requests to only attend their appointment 5 minutes before scheduled 8, 15 and alone, waiting rooms have almost become 'no waiting rooms' as a one in one out 'don't come early, don't come late' 10 schedule is aimed for to minimise the number of people at the clinic, their time in the clinic and to maximise social distancing. This is not always possible where women are brought by taxi, community transport (they may arrive early or late) or are accompanied by careers or require translators. 8Whilst working from home has enabled much of the Australian population to manage social distancing, the technical requirements of mammographic imaging necessitate that radiographers attend the workplace and work one on one with clients.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted between individuals through respiratory droplets from a person in close contact (within 1m) and by indirect contact with surfaces. 16 Because of these transmission routes, radiographers are at high risk as the procedure requires close (face-to-face) contact with the client. 15 ASMIRT advocated that any resumption of screening give due consideration to the close client radiographer proximity 17 (~23-42 cm) and the large client volume (~27-35 women per day) associated with routine screening.Infection control management during COVID-19 has demanded changes to the way imaging is undertaken. BreastScreen NSW informs women that minimal face-toface contact will be managed by radiographers under NSW Standard Health Precautions. 15 Although there has been no change to the routine imaging series required (craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views), the way in which the procedure itself is undertaken has changed for some radiographers.There is no mandated or evidence-based approach to radiographer positioning in mammography. The literature and educational texts vary and as such the approach to positioning is wide-ranging between individual radiographers, sites and services. Therefore, the changes to positioning necessitated by COVID-19 have not presented the same challenge to all radiographers.Positioning for the CC view poses the greatest risk. In this view, radiographers may position from the woman's medial or lateral side, with the woman's head turned away from the breast being imaged. Where a radiographer positions from the medial side, the proximity of their face to the client is close,~23cm. For a radiographer working from the lateral side, this distance is significantly increased to over 40cm. Differences between the height of the client and radiographer will also impact this distance. Some radiographers also employ a breathing technique requiring the woman to exhale with the aim relaxing the upper body allowing more posterior breast tissue onto the receptor. This action is also said to increase the potential for the pectoralis major muscle to be included in the image; however, there is no evidence base to support this. Although time spent positioning is limited, the radiographer who positions from the medial side and or uses the exhalation technique is at an increased risk of airborne infection.To overcome these issues in NSW, advice was given to position exclusively from the lateral side of the breast being imaged and to cease the exhale technique. 18 Similar advice was put forward by ASMIRT. 17 For those radiographers who have had to modify their technique, there is to be an expected impact on image quality whilst adapting to the recommendations. How significant the impact maybe is yet to be analysed, but it should not be expected to impact cancer detection.In the MLO view, the client to radiographer face-toface distance varies depending on radiographer client height and whether the radiographer positions standing or seated and the approach to positioning (anteriorly or posterior to anterior). Distance can be further managed to the radiographers' advantage and with no impact to the resultant image by asking the client to look upwards. 18 Compliance with this change is easily achieved. It should be noted though that some women in the demographic may have degenerative change that may limit neck movement. More recent requirements with the second wave in some jurisdictions for both clients (if possible) and staff to wear masks where physical distancing (providing care within 1.5 m of clients) cannot be maintained, such as mammographic imaging, will also help minimise the spread of the virus. 19 Changes to equipment cleaningThe provision of quality healthcare services, including those of BSA is founded in best practice infection control for clinical practice through national infection control standards and legislation governing infection control and occupational health. 20 BSA National Accreditation Standards (NAS) state that 'equipment should adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations and/or suitable infection control advice and include the cleaning of breast support and compression paddle between each examination to meet relevant state, territory and national standards'. 20 COVID-19 cleaning has expanded this to include areas of the mammography unit not in direct contact with the client. Reductions in client numbers to accommodate the additional time required for cleaning have been necessary. 8 Radiographers must be mindful that their cleaning regimes do not damage to the electronic components or the plastics, aluminium or carbon fibre of the unit, and in particular, liquids must not be allowed to enter the internal parts of the equipment. 21 Anecdotally, women appear satisfied that adequate steps have been taken to ensure their safety within the limitations of the same. Moving forward, the challenge of balancing the benefits of breast screening and the expectations of the screening population with the potential for clients and staff to be exposed to COVID-19 are significant. Some believe that the risk outweighs the benefits and that it is safer to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 and avoid screening all together. 22 The Australian Government Department of Health continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its health services including BSA. 3 For now, women remain engaged with preventive health behaviour shaped by perceived risk, well communicated messages of safety and sound infection control procedures.As a second wave of COVID-19 infections emerges, the threat of ongoing disruption (suspension of routine screening or closures) remains real. There is a great concern that due to the BSA closedown, some cancers may have already been missed, as women either do not reschedule or further delay their appointment. A decrease in the number of breast cancers detected has already been seen in data from the Cancer Council; simply some women are not getting tested. In Victoria during the months of April and May 2020, a 37% reduction in the number of breast cancers diagnosed in either the BreastScreen or diagnostic setting has been reported. 23 There is significant concern that the trend will continue particularly in areas where there is reimposition of lockdown.In a time of uncertainty, some routine is important and this is especially so with respect to breast cancer detection. Without successful eradication of or a vaccine for COVID-19 the 'new BreastScreen normal' will be a reflection of COVID-19 risk minimisation. Whilst most radiology departments continue to experience fluctuation and downturn in client throughput, BSA is expecting to return to full pre-COVID-19 capacity in the near future. However, by necessity, BSA operations must remain both flexible and responsive to the threat. The 'new normal' for screening services therefore needs to be one which enables well women and staff to continue screening with a visible sense of reassurance that all that can be done is being done to ensure the safe and continued early detection of breast cancer.","Australia","abstract","2020-10-07",10

It has recently been given emergency approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in COVID-19 patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Successful clinical off-label use for several weeks has been previously reported. Other models of Impella (Impella 5.0 and 5.5) are licensed for left ventricular support up to 14 days. The purpose is to improve cardiac output sufficiently to prevent secondary organ failure and to unload left ventricle. Among other indications, Impella has been used in acute viral myocarditis 1, 2 . The standard technique for the implantation of Impella CP involves insertion of the percutaneous femoral artery introducer for the guidewire to be advanced via the aorta and aortic valve into the left ventricle under fluoroscopy. The microaxial pump is then implanted using modified Seldinger technique. The blood inlet of the device is positioned within left ventricular cavity 3.5 cm below the aortic valve and an outlet together with the 14Fr pump motor-above the aortic valve. A 9Fr reinforced catheter traverses the aortic valve to provide continuous flow of up to 3.7 l/min of blood from the left ventricle into systemic circulation. Correct positioning of the Impella is paramount for optimization of flow and avoidance of complications. Of the particular importance is the position of the blood inlet which may inadvertently impinge on the anterior mitral leaflet, mitral subvalvular apparatus, left ventricular wall and left ventricular outflow tract walls, and at times migrate into aortic root. Transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography is used to confirm position 3 . Adequate echocardiographic imaging with transthoracic echocardiography in intensive care patients is not always possible because of overdistended lungs by positive pressure ventilatory support, non-optimal patient's positioning and postoperative and posttraumaticEight adult first cross merino ewes were used for 25 experimental implantations of the Impella CP. Sheep characteristics are presented in Table E1 . Haemodynamic variables prior to the implantation of the Impella CP are presented in Table E2 .Initial position guidance. Quality of 3D ICE imaging of the relevant anatomical structures for each sheep is presented in Table 1 . Quality of 3D ICE imaging of the procedural components for each sheep is presented in Table 2 .Three-dimensional en-face images of the aortic valve ( Fig. 1 , Movie 1) offered delineation of the three leaflets and assessment of their motion to exclude pre-existing aortic valve pathology. The quality of AV assessment was found to be adequate in all cases. The aortic root and proximal ascending aorta were imaged from the right atrial position of the 3D ICE catheter in all cases. Significant intracardiac or aortic anatomic abnormalities were not found in any animals. Activation of the three-dimensional Colour Doppler for assessment of aortic valve incompetence did not reveal underlying pathology beyond trivial aortic regurgitation in two animals (Fig. 2 The J-tip 0.035-inch stiff access guidewire was visible in all cases within the aortic root and ascending aorta (Fig. 5 , Movie 5). The guidewire spontaneously entered the ascending aorta in all 8 sheep during all 25 implantations. A J-wire loop forming in the aortic root in one case was immediately identifiable on both 2D and 3D imaging. The position of the cut-plane in 3D ICE volume had to be at times adjusted to include lateral parts of the left ventricular cavity for better visualization of the wire. The wire was clearly identified by 2D ICE, but fanlike rotational manipulations of the ICE catheter were required to place the wire within 2D plane. The spatial relationship between the wire and cardiovascular structures was significantly better appreciated with 3D ICE in all cases. However, some tilting of the 3D volume on the screen was helpful for identification of the wire within left ventricular cavity due to reverberation artifacts. Some reduction in dynamic range settings was helpful for sharper and faster wire visualisation. Inappropriately high gain hindered identification of the wire, especially when it was positioned in a proximity and parallel to the walls of the left ventricle.A diagnostic catheter was inserted over the stiff guidewire and was also clearly identifiable on 3D ICE in all cases and did not require 2D ICE imaging for clarification. It appeared slightly more echogenic than the wire when compared side by side, but not significantly different when imaged by itself. A side-lobe artifact arising from the guidewire and to the lesser degree from the catheter was noted on several instances (Fig. 6 , Movie 6). 2D ICE was sufficient to demonstrate the diagnostic catheter traversing the aortic valve and entering the LV cavity. However, the position of the catheter tip was not always clearly visible (Fig. 7) with 3D ICE providing significantly Thin soft 0.018-inch guidewire was more difficult to visualise in most cases with inconsistent identification of the forming loops, especially with 3D ICE.The advancement of the Impella pump over the guidewire into the ventricle could be visualized during all Implantations with minor requirement for adjusting the cut-plane position, and occasional rotational adjustment of the ultrasound probe. The reinforced catheter of the Impella correctly appeared in the image as a double-walled structure with cut-plane positioned along the catheter. It created prominent reverberation artifact (Fig. 9 , Movie 8). The tear-drop appearance of the metal cap between blood inlet area and plastic pigtail was highly echogenic, making it an ideal 3D marker for positioning (Fig. 10 , Movie 9). The Impella plastic pigtail was difficult if not impossible to visualise in all cases. Strong reverberation artifact arising from the tear-drop metal cap at the inflow further complicated visualisation of the plastic pigtail. The relationship between the Impella CP catheter inflow portion of the system and surrounding cardiac structure was superior with 3D ICE when compared to 2D ICE in all cases. However, superior spatial and temporal resolution of 2D imaging offered better appreciation of the aortic valve leaflets and mitral subvalvular apparatus in relation to the Impella. One of the insertions identified the tip of the catheter being impacted under the posteromedial papillary muscle prompting repositioning with slight withdrawal of the catheter (Fig. 11 ). In 8 implantations the tear drop initially could not be clearly identified due to the impaction into the apex. Slow gradual withdrawal of the Impella under 3D ICE guidance was undertaken until tea-drop became obvious in the mid-LV-cavity.Overall, the image quality of highly relevant for Impella implantation cardiac structures with 3D ICE was good to excellent (scored 8.6 on a scale 0-10). The quality of imaging components of the procedural equipment with 3D ICE was good (scored 7.8 on a scale 0-10) with exception of thin soft guidewire, which allowed for barely adequate quality. 3D Colour Doppler produced extensive ""colour bleeding"" artifact at the standard settings and required significant reduction in colour gain to identify the blood inlet in the catheter (Fig. 12) . Identification of the inlet on 3D www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Colour Doppler was achieved in 18 implantations and served as an additional confirmation of correct tear-drop identification and inflow site relative position to the cardiac structures. The ""3.5 cm"" rule applicable for human adults for the position of inflow below aortic valve was not used due to the different anatomical characteristics of the ovine left ventricle. ICE was sufficient in all cases to ensure adequate flows and absence of inflow obstruction as detected by Impella Controller. The outflow could be visualized in all cases as an extensive turbulence within the proximal ascending aorta above the aortic root. Reduction in colour gain diminished colour ""bleeding"" over the myocardial tissue in all cases and offered good confirmation of the pump outflow position within the aorta.3D Colour Doppler was used to reassess the aortic valve for potential incompetence following implantation of the Impella CP. Mild and moderate peri-catheter aortic regurgitation was easily identified on five occasions (Fig. 13 , Movie 10).Postprocessing with adjustments in dynamic range, gain, and colour priority and transparency for each individual image presents better visualization and appreciation of spatial relationships between the catheter and cardiovascular structures.Complications. Insertion of the guidewire and the diagnostic catheter inside of the left ventricle frequently caused ectopic cardiac beats due to the direct myocardial irritation by the devices.There were two failures of the Impella implantation to achieve pump flow:The guidewire became tangled around intra-aortic pressure catheter and could not be removed after insertion of the pump across the aortic valve. It occurred in sheep 2 during the third implantation. Both 2D ICE and 3D ICE failed to identify the cause of the problem. Removal of the Impella demonstrated severely kinked soft guidewire.Case 2 The excessive portion of the guidewire within left ventricular cavity became kinked and tangled around the Impella catheter and could not be removed after insertion of the pump across the aortic valve. An attempt by the operator to apply extra pulling pressure on the guidewire resulted in kinking of the Impella catheter approximately 10 cm above the pump motor housing causing perforation of the carotid artery and resulting in catastrophic bleeding. It occurred in sheep 5 during the second implantation. Both 2D ICE and 3D ICE failed to identify the cause of the problem.In one sheep the ICE probe entered the right internal thoracic vein and was identified by unusual imaging with the view resembling right ventricular-centric apical transthoracic echocardiographic view. Multiple attempts at repositioning of the probe were required before it was successfully negotiated into the right atrium. This complication occurred in sheep 3 during the first implantation and is likely to be idiosyncratic to sheep.This translational interventional study demonstrated feasibility of three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography with a wide azimuthal and elevation of 50° to provide adequate guidance for intracardiac implantation of the Impella CP percutaneous temporary left ventricular assist device in an ovine model. The combination www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with two-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography modality further improved the quality of imaging and the precision of guidance for optimal Impella CP positioning.The Impella CP provides a minimally invasive option for temporary left ventricular support. This potentially includes sufferers from COVID-19 cardiac injury with severe left ventricular failure in the absence of respiratory failure, unresponsive to pharmacological therapy 5 . Early mechanical cardiac support should be considered in these patients who have a reasonable probability of recovery, to avoid multiple organ dysfunction resulting from a low cardiac output state.The optimal choice of the extracorporeal circulatory assist device remains controversial in wide clinical practice and is not yet clear for COVID-19 sufferers. Physiological considerations suggest that in some patients with isolated cardiac complications, left ventricular assist device-based approaches may be superior to VA ECMO in unloading left ventricle while in others a modular approach by combination of both techniques (ECPELLA) 6 or by combination of VV ECMO and Impella 7 may offer the best results.A significant subgroup of COVID 19 patients reportedly developed rapidly progressive cardiac failure during the recovery phase from acute respiratory failure 10 . These patients remain highly contagious, while being unstable with regard to both respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. Transfer of these patients to the catheterisation www.nature.com/scientificreports/ laboratory for fluoroscopic-guided implantation of the Impella would represent a high risk for these patients, hospital staff and other patients. High oxygen requirements, tachypnea and non-invasive ventilatory support can often be prohibitive for adequate TTE image acquisition 11 . TEE in these patients would require general anaesthesia, reintubation and return to invasive ventilation. This also presents a risk of disease transmission to attending physicians. All the above could be prohibitive for the provision of mechanical cardiac support to otherwise suitable patients. Point of care ICE is the most invasive echocardiographic modality but it could provide an alternative approach to guide awake implantation of the Impella CP under local anaesthesia in this subgroup of patients and avoid undesirable intrahospital transfers and the need for invasive ventilation. The risks associated with ICE must be carefully weighed against the risks of other available imaging modalities within specifics of each individual patient and treating institution.Although it would be of interest to compare ICE to TTE and TEE, such a comparison was beyond the scope of this study for the following reasons. Our ovine model was thoracotomized for a parallel study making TTE impossible at the time of Impella implantation. The proximity of the right atrium to the aortic root is similar in sheep and humans but the sheep left ventricular apex is midline and the main chamber of the left atrium is lateral to the midline. Previous investigations suggested limited anatomical feasibility of TEE in ovine models 12 . We therefore do not believe that a comparison between intracardiac echo and either TEE or TTE in sheep would be directly applicable to humans. Thus, the study was not designed to compare different echocardiographic techniques but aimed to explore the hypothesis that ICE can be used as a feasible alternative to TTE and TEE when those techniques are clinically unsuitable. Considering translational nature of this study, further human investigation is warranted.Two-dimensional ICE has been reported in six patients during percutaneous coronary interventions supported by the Impella Recover LP 2.5 13 . ICE was used to assess aortic root and aortic valve, left ventricular outflow tract, left ventricle and mitral apparatus prior to the implantation of the Impella. The ICE probe was inserted via the femoral vein to obtain views from the right atrium. As the ICE was performed in the catheterisation laboratory, standard fluoroscopic guidance may have been used to assist in implantation of the pumps in these patients. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2D ICE was further reported to be used in one patient during percutaneous coronary intervention supported by the Impella Recover LP 2.5. 2D ICE was used in that case for dynamic assessment of short axis left ventricular area from the right ventricular window 14 .Femoral venous access is normally used for intracardiac echocardiography. Jugular two-dimensional ICE catheter access for guiding intracardiac device implantation has been described 15 in a patient undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The authors sited two major benefits-good imaging planes for the anatomical structures of interest (ascending aorta, long-axis aortic valve and long-axis left ventricle) and an absence of interference with the operator inserting the prosthetic valve. Our experimental findings support this report. Percutaneous implantation of the Impella CP is routinely performed via femoral arterial approach. The use of jugular access for the ICE has the benefit of eliminating physical interference with the operators inserting the Impella but might not be preferred in awake COVID patients who have their heads enclosed in a protective barrier.Transthoracic, transesophageal 3 and epicardial 16 echocardiography has been used to navigate implantation of various Impella devices. We did not find any animal or human reports that have described implantation of the Impella with guidance purely by ICE, nor any reports of wide-angle three-dimensional echocardiography used to guide and to optimally position the Impella.Our intracardiac imaging was adequate in all cases. It required a short learning curve for the sonographer with expertise in 2D and 3D TTE and TEE. Jugular access presented unfamiliar views, but cardiovascular structures relevant to the implantation of the Impella were clearly identifiable. Standard factory scanning settings had to be adjusted for grey scale and Colour Doppler modalities to optimise image quality. We did not use fluoroscopy in any of the cases except to demonstrate the favourable three-dimensional spatial relationship between the implanted pump and ICE probe tip on completion of the insertion and running of the Impella (Fig. 14) . Adequate ICE imaging of the ovine aortic arch can be obtained from the superior vena cava to identify a guide wire in the arch (Fig. 15, Movie 11 ) but such views have not been reported in humans.Human clinical implantation of Impella CP usually utilize percutaneous femoral or axillary arterial access 13 , with fluoroscopically guided guidewire advancement to the left ventricle. We used a cut-down approach for the left common carotid artery. This approach was selected based on the anatomical specifics of the ovine model and intraoperative convenience and did not imply any recommendations to change traditional human vascular access. Figure 9 . 3D ICE image of the Impella catheter entering left ventricle (LV) via aortic valve (AV) from the ascending aorta (Ao). Standard 2D cut-plane image on the left and 3D full volume on the right. Longitudinal cut-plane at the level of the AV presents the Impella CP catheter as a double-walled structure. It is wirereinforced catheter, which produced significant reverberation artifacts (R).| (2020) 10:17485 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74220-8 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The inability of ICE to image the descending aorta has been accepted from the outset as an inherent limitation of this imaging technique where blind guidewire advancement would be required through that portion of the aorta. A similar limitation would apply for TTE, while most of the abdominal aorta would not be imaged with TEE. Guide wires are often inserted into the descending aorta from the femoral artery without any form of imaging as is the case of intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation. The use of a curved guide wire or sheath dedicated to successful transit of the aortic arch into the ascending aorta will allow blind insertion of the guide wire into the ascending aorta in the majority of patients and can likely be assisted by ICE imaging of the arch. COVID-19 patients potentially selected for the mechanical cardiac support are likely to be younger and without underlying serious vascular pathology, which would minimize the risk of aortic complications during blind introduction of the guidewire through parts of the aorta which are not suitable for imaging with ICE. Careful ultrasound-guided placement of the femoral arterial introducer sheath and high level of postprocedural vigilance in monitoring for potential aortic complications would be justified in cases of ""blind"" aortic instrumentation. This limitation of ICE constitutes additional risk for the patient and needs to be considered in making clinical decision to select ICE among other imaging techniques. Two complications with tangled soft guidewire after implantation of the Impella CP across the aortic valve demonstrated important shortcoming of ICE related to the limitations in spatial resolution. In contrast with fluoroscopy, ICE did not clearly identify excessive length of the thin soft guidewire within left ventricle and intravascular trajectory of this guidewire outside Impella between the catheter outflow port and vascular introducer. This led to the unrecognized by echocardiography entanglements and life-threatening complications. Because the guide wire exits the Impella through the pump outflow port, excessive tension on the guide wire is likely to cause bowstringing of the drive sheath resulting in vascular perforation at the point of maximum kinking of the sheath. Accordingly, excessive traction should not be applied to the guidewire. In cases of difficulty during guidewire withdrawal, the whole implanted device together with the Impella CP should be removed as a block.Limited visualization of the plastic pigtail tip due to the strong reverberation artifact arising from the apex tear-drop part of the Impella CP made it difficult to use this portion of the pump as a guide in one third of experiments. Detection of the tear-drop of the Impella CP impacted into the left ventricular apex suggests a potential The strengths of the study include a pre-specified protocol, high data integrity and simple explorative analysis plan. The study was conducted over a very short inception period of one week considering utmost emergency to develop alternative approaches for COVID 19 patients suffering from acute severe heart failure and the worldwide pandemic closure of most research facilities, including our laboratory.The limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size. Confounding bias was mitigated by standardising investigative techniques and operator-dependent errors using echocardiography experts for image acquisition and analysis. The translational nature of the study involves utilization of the ovine model thus human application remain speculative.There have been no previous studies investigating implantation of the Impella CP left ventricular assist device with both two and three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography.Our study demonstrates potential to expand the use of the Impella CP for subgroups of patients where other types of imaging to guide implantation are clinically problematic. However, this study acknowledges the invasive nature of ICE with associated potential complications, thus placing the approach into non-standard, reserve category.Three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography is a feasible option to guide implantation of the Impella CP for left ventricular mechanical support and should be carefully considered in cases where other imaging modalities are unsuitable. Clinicians must be aware of the limited human experience, the imaging limitations and the risks associated with this technique in order to avoid serious iatrogenic complications. We conducted a prospective, single-centre translational study of intracardiac echocardiography to guide implantation of the left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) in adult sheep. The study was approved by the University of Sydney (Australia) Animal Research Ethics Committee (2019/1650 amendment) and conducted at the Charles Perkins Centre for Research, The University of Sydney (Sydney, Australia). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan were finalised before data collection was initiated. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Animals. Animals were acclimatised for at least two weeks prior to the procedure and received routine preventative treatments prior to arrival. Mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised, adult female merino sheep with invasive monitoring of arterial pressure, central venous pressure and cardiac output. Animals received fluid Figure 14 . Fluoroscopy with 3D reconstruction has been performed to demonstrate favourable for imaging relationship between the Impella CP implanted into left ventricle and correctly positioned and the 3D ICE catheter with the ultrasound tip located within the right atrium. The proximity to the implanted device allows the use of high ultrasound scanning frequencies, contributing to improved axial spatial resolution. The 2D scanning plane is at a significant angle to the implanted Impella plane, thus requiring significant physical probe manipulations. 3D wide-angle acquisition rectifies this problem by acquiring full volume pyramid of data with elevation of 50° which was sufficient for adequate imaging of the Impella with minimal physical manipulations of the probe when using jugular venous access. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. As a part of the parallel study, six animals underwent a left thoracotomy and exposure of the heart prior to the Impella implantations.All sheep had arterial pressure and central venous pressure monitoring via fluid filled catheters attached to the carotid artery sheath and right internal jugular central venous catheter. A transit time flow probe (Transonic) was placed around the main pulmonary artery via the left thoracotomy. Animals were in the right lateral position with pressure transducers zeroed immediately before the procedure at the level of the right atrium. Mechanical ventilation was conducted in synchronized IPPV mode with PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O. Haemodynamic parameters were continuously recorded.Echocardiography training, Level 3) 17 performed all echocardiographic examinations (SC2000, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Left internal jugular 14 FG valved cannula was used for the intracardiac probe access. Images were acquired using AcuNav Volume 12.5 F, 90 cm four-ways steerable intracardiac echocardiography catheter (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA Inc, Mountain View, CA). Live three-dimensional volumes were acquired at 6 MHz fundamental and 8 MHz harmonic frequencies with the sector set at 90 × 50° as standard and adjusted together with the depth as required. Maximum achievable frame rate was 60 frames per second for 2D and 14-20 frames per second for 3D grey scale imaging. Temporary resolution was lower for the 3D Colour Doppler, averaging 7-9 frames per second. Right atrial views were obtained with minimal steering for probe positional manipulations, mostly using advance and withdrawal and rotational repositioning. Right ventricular views were not required for the purpose of the study. Echocardiographic quantification was not required. Images underwent cropping and postprocessing using on-cart software. The quality of imaging with three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography was rated by the expert echocardiographer on an arbitrary scale of 0-10 with the score values applied as following: 0-1-inadequate image quality. 2-3-very poor image quality. 4-5-poor image quality. 5-6-just adequate image quality. 7-8-good image quality. 9-10-excellent image quality.","Australia","first author","2020-10-15",10

The Broad Spectrum Host-Directed Agent Ivermectin as an Antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 ?","The work identifying ivermectin, a macrocyclic lactone 22,23-dihydroavermectin B produced by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, and subsequently demonstrating its activity as a novel therapeutic against ""infections caused by roundworm parasites"" was recognized, along with the seminal work on the antimalarial artemisin, with the award of the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine [1, 2] . Soon after its discovery in 1975, ivermectin was approved as a treatment for parasitic infection indications in animals (1981) , and subsequently for human use to treat onchocerciasis (river blindness) 6 years later. It has since been approved for treatment of a range of human nematode (roundworm) infestations that cause river blindness, filariasis, ascariasis and strongyloidiasis, as well as pediculosis and scabies, caused by ectoparasites, and also for rosacea [1, 3] . Because of its importance in treating all of these indications, ivermectin is firmly on the WHO (World Health Organisation)'s List of Essential Medicines [6] , with millions of doses prescribed worldwide every year.Starting in 2012, ivermectin's antiviral properties have been progressively documented towards a number of RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, flaviruses such as dengue and Zika, and most notably, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) [4, 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , as well as DNA viruses such as pseudorabies, polyoma and adenoviruses [18] [19] [20] . Ivermectin's antiviral activity is based on its ability to bind to and inhibit the transport function of the host importin α (IMPα) protein [11, 18, 20] ; IMPα is known to mediate nuclear import of various viral proteins and key host factors, although other actions of ivermectin have been proposed which may also contribute to its activity [eg. 12, [21] [22] . In light of the possibility that ivermectin has potential to be a key weapon to help control Transport into and out of the nucleus is an integral part of normal eukaryotic cell function, as well as in the case of viral infection, since viruses commonly hijack the system in order to antagonize the cellular antiviral response that is driven to a large extent by nuclear factors such as transcription factors [14, 27] . The key signal-dependent mediators of this transport are the members of the IMP superfamily of proteins, of which there are multiple α and β forms [14, 27] . Nuclear transport mediated by the IMPα/β1 heterodimer is the best characterized pathway by which host proteins enter the nucleus through nuclear envelope-embedded nuclear pores; host proteins transported into the nucleus include members of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) inducible transcription factor families that play key roles in the response to infection. Specific viral proteins [see 27,28] also use this pathway (see Fig. 1 ). Briefly, IMPα within the IMPα/β1 heterodimer performs the adaptor role of signal-specific recognition of the nuclear import cargo, while IMPβ1 performs the main transport roles of binding to/translocation through the nuclear pores, and subsequent release of the nuclear import cargo within the nucleus upon interaction with another transport factor, the monomeric guanine nucleotide binding protein Ran (not shown in Fig. 1 ) [see 27]. Specific high affinity recognition by IMPα is critical to nuclear localization of various viral proteins such as dengue nonstructural protein (NS) 5, as shown in mutagenic studies [32]; significantly, dengue virus with impaired NS5 interaction with IMPα is severely attenuated, underlining the critical importance of the NS5-IMPα interaction for dengue infection. The importance of this interaction to dengue infection is the basis for the fact that multiple distinct small molecules that disrupt IMPα recognition of dengue NS5 are able to limit dengue infection [eg. 7, 8, 11, 31, 33] . Significantly in the case of ivermectin, this activity extends to a large number of different viruses (see below) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , including SARS-CoV-2 [18] .We identified ivermectin in 2011 in a high throughput screen using bacterially expressed proteins and a 1200-compound library of small molecules for inhibitors of HIV-1 Integrase (IN) recognition by IMPα/β1 [34]; specific inhibitors targeting IMPα/β1 directly (such as ivermectin) and not IN (such as budesonide) were identified using a nested counterscreening strategy [34, 35] . Of several compounds now confirmed to be active against IMPα/β1 and possessing antiviral activity as a consequence [7, 14, 31, 36] , ivermectin is the best characterized, shown to have broad-spectrum activities (summarized in Tables 1-3) . It was initially shown to inhibit nuclear import not only of IN, but also of simian virus SV40 large tumour antigen (T-ag) and other IMPα/β1-(but not IMPβ1-) dependent cargoes, consistent with the idea that IMPα (not IN) is the direct target of ivermectin [34, 35] . Subsequent work has confirmed this, with ivermectin's ability to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of various different host, including NF-kB p65 [37, 38] and viral proteins demonstrated in transfected and infected cell systems (see Table 1 ) [14, 34] . Ivermectin's ability to inhibit binding of IMPα to the viral proteins NS5 and T-ag has also been confirmed in a cellular context using the biomolecular fluorescence complementation technique [11] (Table 1) .Although targeting of IMPα by ivermectin was implicated by many years of research (see also below), direct binding was only recently formally demonstrated using a set of biophysical techniques, including thermostability, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism (CD) [11] . Importantly, the CD/thermostability studies indicate that binding of ivermectin to IMPα induces structural changes which are likely the basis of ivermectin inhibition of IMPα binding to viral nuclear import cargoes. Strikingly, the structural change also appears to impair heterodimerisation of IMPα with IMPβ1 [11 -see however 20]; thus, ivermectin inhibits nuclear import not only by preventing signal recognition by IMPα, but also by ensuring that the IMPα/β1 complex essential to mediate subsequent transport through the nuclear pore is prevented from forming (see Fig. 1 ).Consistent with the fact that many viruses are known to rely on IMPα/β1-dependent nuclear import of specific viral proteins for robust infection, including many viruses for which the lifecycle is entirely carried out in the cytoplasm [14, 27, 28] , a body of in vitro studies have confirmed ivermectin to be active in limiting infection by a range of different RNA viruses [10, 14] , including HIV-1 [7] , DENV (all 4 serotypes) and related flaviviruses [8, 11, 12] , influenza, and alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Chikungunya [9, 15, 16] (see Table 2 ); it is also active against DNA viruses [18] [19] [20] . Exciting recent studies indicate it is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 [17] .A striking aspect of this antiviral activity is that, where determined, the EC50 for viral inhibition as assessed by a range of different techniques is in the low uM range (see right column, Table 2 ), interestingly aligning perfectly with its activity in inhibiting recognition of viral nuclear import cargoes by IMPα (see Table 1 ). The clear implication is that the mechanism of inhibition of infectious virus production in the case of all of the viruses listed in Table 2 is largely through targeting IMPα to prevent its role in nuclear import, and of viral proteins in particular (see Fig. 1 ). Significantly, two other small molecules (GW5074 and gossypol) that appear to target IMPα in a very similar way to prevent its nuclear import function [31 and unpublished] have comparable antiviral properties [13, 31, 36] , consistent with the idea that the host protein IMPα is a key contributor to infection by a number of medically important viruses.As in many other disciplines, one of the biggest challenges in antiviral research is to transition from laboratory experiments to preclinical/clinical studies, with the question of dosing in the case of ivermectin for viral infectious indications contentious [see 6, 39, 40] . It is important, firstly, to stress the obvious in this context: that the antiviral activities of ivermectin documented in Table 2 have been derived from laboratory experiments that largely involve high, generally non-physiological, multiplicities of infection, and cell monolayer cultures, often of cell lines such as Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells impaired in interferon α/β production) that are not clinically relevant. Clearly, the results in Table 2 for low uM EC50 values reveal robust, dose-dependent antiviral activity in the particular model system used, but it would be naïve to believe that it is necessary to achieve uM concentrations of ivermectin in a patient for maximum clinical benefit.In fact, a key consideration in clinical intervention using ivermectin is its host-directed (IMPαdirected) mechanism of action. Host-directed agents that impact cellular activities that are essential to healthy function must be tested with caution; although ivermectin has an established safety profile in humans [24, 26] , and is FDA-approved for a number of parasitic infections [1, 3, 5] , it targets a host function that is unquestionably important in the antiviral response, and titration of a large proportion of the IMPα repertoire of a cell/tissue/organ is likely to lead to toxicity. With this in mind, where a host-directed agent can be a ""game-changer"" in treating viral infection may well be in the initial stages of infection or potentially even prophylactically by keeping the viral load low so that the body's immune system has an opportunity to mount a full antiviral response [11, 17] .Ivermectin's potential as an antiviral to treat infection can of course only be demonstrated in clinical studies. Preclinical studies in a lethal Pseudorabies (PRV) mouse challenge model showed that dosing (0.2 mg/Kg) 12 hours post-infection protected 50% of mice, which could be increased to 60% through administration of ivermectin at the time of infection [18] . Clinical data for a phase III trial against DENV infection similarly indicate antiviral activity, with daily dosing (0.4 mg/Kg) found to be safe, and virological efficacy demonstrated, although it was concluded that dosing regimen modification was required to achieve clinical benefit [41] . These studies underline ivermectin's real potential as an antiviral able to reduce viral load in a clinical context.The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has eclipsed the porcine flu epidemic in terms of numbers of infections (currently approaching 40 million) and deaths (> 1.1 million, with > 220,000 of these in the US alone) worldwide. The search for antivirals through repurposing existing drugs has proved challenging (eg. see [42, 43] ), one important aspect of repurposing being the perceived need to achieve therapeutic levels in the lung. Published pharmacokinetic modelling based on both the levels of ivermectin achievable in human serum from standard parasitic treatment dosing and robust large animal experiments where lung levels of ivermectin can be measured, indicates that concentrations of ivermectin 10 times higher than the c. 2.5 µM EC50 indicated by in vitro experiments (Table 2) are likely achievable in the lung in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [39] ; modelling based on different assumptions predicts lower values, but highlights the long-term stability of ivermectin in the lung (for over 30 days) based on data from animals [40] . It should also be noted that liquid formulations for intravenous administration of long-acting ivermectin have been described, with aerosol administration also in development, to enable ivermectin administration to achieve even higher concentrations to tackle SARS-CoV-2, whilst the use of ivermectin in combination with other agents may enhance efficacy at lower doses.Ivermectin as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 in humans has already been approved in a number of states and countries, including the Republic of Peru [44] and Northeastern Beni region of Bolivia [45] . Importantly, close to 70 trials worldwide are currently testing the clinical benefit of ivermectin to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 3 ); these include variations on dosing regimens, combination therapies (preliminary results for NCT04523831 in Table 3 , #45) [46, 47] , and prophylactic protocols. With respect to the latter, preliminary results from recently completed study NCT04422561 (Table 3 , #22, and footnote) examining asymptomatic family close contacts of confirmed COVID patients, reveal that two doses of ivermectin 72 h apart result in only 7.4% of 203 subjects reporting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in stark contrast to control untreated subjects, of whom 58.4% reported symptoms, underlining ivermectin's potential as a prophylactic. Results from retrospective/observational trials [49] [50] [51] [52] are also consistent with clinical benefit. Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (Bangladesh) reported that none of 115 subjects receiving a single 12 mg dose of ivermectin developed pneumonia/cardiovascular complications, compared to 9.8% (pneumonia) and 1.5 % (ischemic stroke) in 133 control subjects [49] . Further, significantly fewer ivermectin group patients developed respiratory distress (2.6 versus 15.8 %), or required oxygen (9.6 versus 45.9 %), antibiotics (15.7 versus 60.2 %) or intensive care management (0.09 versus 8.3 %). Ivermectin-treated patients became SARS-CoV-2 negative significantly faster (median 4 compared to 15 days), had significantly shorter hospital stays (median 9 versus 15 days), and significantly lower mortality (0.9 vs 6.8 %). Although combinations of therapies were used, the results for a 196 patient propensity-matched cohort study (ICON -Ivermectin in COvid Nineteen -study) at Broward Health Medical Centre (Florida, USA) [50] indicate significantly reduced mortality (13.3%) in subjects receiving 0.2 mg/Kg ivermectin (optional second dose 8 days later), compared to 24.5% mortality in those not receiving ivermectin, with more significant differences for patients with severe pulmonary involvement (mortality rates of 38.8 versus 80.7%). Although these early results are consistent with efficacy, it is clear that only the results from large rigorous randomised clinical trials (Table 3) will definitively establish ivermectin's utility to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is to be hoped that the results from these trials will emerge in the next few months to document ivermectin's credentials or otherwise as a viable therapeutic for COVID-19 infection, and potentially infection by many other viruses. Subsequently, IMPβ β β β1 mediates transport of the trimeric complex into the nucleus through the nuclear envelope (NE)-embedded nuclear pore (NPC, nuclear pore complex). Release within the nucleus enables the transcription factor to carry out normal function in transcriptional regulation, including in the antiviral response. IMPα α α α cannot mediate nuclear import, unless heterodimerised with IMPβ β β β1. B.In viral infection, specific viral proteins (eg. NS5 in the case of DENV, ZIKV) able to interact with IMPα α α α utilize the IMPα/β α/β α/β α/β1 heterodimer to access the nucleus and antagonize the antiviral response [14, 27, 28] . This is critical for optimal virus production as shown by mutagenic and inhibitor studies.The SARS-CoV-2 proteins that may access the nucleus via IMPα/β α/β α/β α/β1 in infected cells has not been nuclear import [11] , contributing to reduced virus production.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f EC50 = 1.9/0.6 uM (luciferase, 2 hosts)/ 3 uM > 5000-fold reduction (pfu) [15] 3 uM > 1000-fold (pfu) [15] 3 uM > 200-fold (pfu) [15] 1 uM c. 20-fold (pfu) [9] est.

Search was conducted with help of a health science librarian.We included case reports, case series and observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals and preprints available in English that identified small neurological events in patients with COVID-19 using MRI.

These events ranged from microbleeds (observed in SWI or T2* GRE images), white matter hyperintensities (FLAIR images), small lesions, or signal changes in diffusion-weighted MRI within grey or white matter. For each article, events were manually localised to grey or white matter regions based on available MRI images and/or radiological descriptions. The Illinios Institute of Technology (IIT) Desikan-Killiany grey matter atlas incorporating 84 brain regions, was used to label any events located within grey matter. 23 IIT white matter bundles were used to label any events located within white matter. 23 FSLeyes neuroimaging software from the FMRIB library was used to visualise white matter tracts and grey matter areas from the IIT atlas. 24 Any COVID-19 patient with non-specific neuropathological findings (e.g. ""juxtacortical white matter"") or without an MRI image or description were excluded from further analyses. This data encoding process generated two tables for grey and white matter regions with columns corresponding to each article and rows corresponding to the name of the region/bundle.

No reuse allowed without permission.White matter events were identified most frequently in the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. The corticospinal tract is a major white matter pathway connecting critical subcortical brain regions such as the basal ganglia and thalamus and as such, facilitates information related to voluntary motor control. As a result, diffuse aberrations in the corticospinal tract are associated with motor symptoms such as tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes, which have been commonly reported in COVID-19 patients. 8, 38, 42, 46, 60 Similarly, the corpus callosum plays an important role in interhemispheric communication; which can result in disconnection syndrome and broad neurocognitive deficits. 65 In grey matter regions, events were identified most frequently in the temporal and precentral gyrus as well as the bilateral thalamus. Alterations in thalamocortical connectivity can disrupt the regulation of consciousness and arousal. 61, 62 As such, acute events in these regions may explain symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, agitation, and loss of consciousness. 8, 30, 34, 40, 51, 53, 55 Despite their acute manifestation, the accumulation of neurological events in subcortical structures and consequent disruption to distal cortical regions can increase susceptibility to cognitive impairment and decline-bearing significant ramifications for long-term cognitive prognosis. 63, 64 The epicentre and mechanism of spread All rights reserved.

As such, the qualitative nature of the translation should be considered with caution while interpreting our findings. Secondly, most of the included articles were cross-sectional case studies and hence cannot directly attribute the observed neuropathology to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, longitudinal neuroimaging is necessary to directly assess causality. Lastly, some of the neurological events included in our study may be explained by the ageing process;whereby white matter hyperintensities are correlated with age. 13, 90 Hence, findings regarding white matter changes; particularly white matter hyperintensities in the centrum semiovale, should be interpreted with caution.Patients with COVID-19 exhibit acute neuropathological and cerebrovascular events. These events occur predominantly in white matter tracts such as the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum, as well in grey matter areas such as the pallidum, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum. These aberrations likely contribute to altered thalamocortical connectivity and may disrupt the regulation of consciousness and arousal. The accumulation of these events in All rights reserved.

This reflection is underpinned by Johns' model of reflection, 1 which describes 5 stages of reflection: description, reflection, influencing factors, alternative strategies and learning. We begin by providing some background information about our course, work-integrated learning as a pedagogical practice, its importance in healthcare and how our course contributes to health systems improvement in Australia. We explore a number of key issues that have emerged through our students' experiences during COVID-19 in relation to the course and discuss how we have responded to challenges to our teaching philosophy and pedagogical approach posed by COVID-19.The University of Tasmania delivers 2 postgraduate healthcare redesign, work-integrated learning (WIL) courses (Graduate Certificate in Clinical Redesign and Professional Honours (Clinical Redesign)) in which students undertake a health service improvement project in their own workplace. The courses have a combined intake of 200 to 300 students a year. Our students are largely experienced healthcare professionals working across many disciplines in both major and regional hospitals and health services. In semester 1, 2020, our student cohort (N = 101) consisted of a large number of students with a nursing background (~65%) as well as students working in medicine, paramedicine, allied health services, pathology, administration and support services. Seventy-five percent of our students were aged over 35 years with 85% being female.Workplace-based projects undertaken during the courses are fully supported by our healthcare redesign academic staff, whose experience in healthcare includes nursing, midwifery, pathology, quality improvement and quality and safety as well as academic and organisational research. WIL is an educational approach whereby students apply academic theory in the real world via an experiential learning model, which accurately reflects the learning outcomes and aims of our course. 2 The benefits of WIL have been demonstrated in many disciplines, 3 including health, 4 globally and within the Australian health system. 5 Graduates from our course have demonstrated this through the achievement of successful, sustainable changes to health service delivery. 6 For example, a medication management project for elective surgery patients in Victoria won a regional Quality and Safety Award. The graduates involved in this project improved accuracy and timeliness of charting regular medications, leading to a reduction of both repetitive tasks and adverse drug reactions. The graduates' reflection on this work highlighted that 'lessons learnt from this work provided. . . useful insight to promote redesign into practice and provides a backbone for proposing how change could be monitored' (Student D).The courses are designed around the expectation that our students will undertake a number of project activities within their workplace. In line with the views of Parmelee, 7 active learning strategies in health education enhance the learning environment 2 Journal of Medical Education and Curricular Development through more meaningful educational experiences. Our learning activities are often role-specific and require direct interaction with the student's organisation and colleagues in accordance with the theory of work-integrated learning. 2 For example, students are required to develop governance structures, engage with stakeholders, collect and analyse data and design health service interventions as part of their assessment tasks providing a foundation for sustainable change. 8 Our courses are designed to support these activities through partnerships with healthcare organisations, who provide organisational oversight of projects and support, such as access to service and administrative data sets, provides a constructive educational culture. 9, 10 In addition, we deliver a number of face-to-face masterclass days which align with units around project planning and intervention design.The COVID-19 pandemic first affected the way we deliver our courses in March 2020, when the number of new COVID-19 cases began to grow exponentially across Australia. Most of our students live and work in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, where strict measures were rapidly implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and increase capacity within the health system. 11 This meant that our students faced many changes to their workplaces, organisational structures and their own roles as well as major changes in their home and personal lives. It has been suggested in the literature that universities and higher education facilities should move to online learning throughout COVID-19 with students being encouraged to maintain social and professional connections fully online. 12 This approach, however, is not a practical solution for work integrated learning models, including our courses, where students undertake workplace projects in healthcare settings.Through a student focussed-lens we identified 5 key issues 1 through data derived from students' emails and formal assessment task extension requests, and phone calls from distressed students. Notes were kept from the conversations with students and there were several issues that repeated in these communications which highlighted the main concerns that our students faced as the broad impact of the COVID-19 pandemic grew.We anticipated that COVID-19 would have an impact on the workload of our students as they are predominantly working in senior clinical and middle management healthcare positions. However, we could not predict the impact that this would have on the overall learning experience. Students told us they really wanted to continue with their studies, that they were learning so much and it was relevant to their current roles, and that they did not want to 'start again'. However, they were also overwhelmed with demand for clinical work (overtime), strategy planning and development for COVID-19 and constant uncertainty.""The content of this unit is so relevant to the work I do; I would really like to explore the content of each module rather than skimming to get through. At the moment I just cannot do that"" (Student K).Many of our students were seconded to positions that were not consistent with their ongoing project work in the clinical redesign courses. This meant that students were unable to continue with their studies and were forced to defer. Aside from indicating a high level of stress due to the business of their new role, students also felt anxious about when they might be able to get back to their project as part of completing their studies. This included students who moved to a telehealth model of care, students who were asked to take on new clinical or managerial roles and students who were unsure of what they would be doing day-to-day.""I have almost finished my project plan, but it's looking like I'm not going to be able to continue with this project until after the COVID-19 situation as our service is changing and we are moving towards telehealth and some staff working from home"" (Student B).""At this point, there is no way possible for me to do anything even remotely solutions or implementation with my project -everything that is not absolutely essential has been put on hold and there is a very good chance I will be seconded away from my primary work area for decent chunks of time, over the next few months (for example I am needed to leave old-age psychiatry to cover geriatrics so geriatrics can cover Gen-Med so Gen-Med can increase services in general and in ED)"" (Student T).The pandemic also meant that many students' home lives were changing. School-aged children were unable to attend their places of education, small children were often unable to attend day care facilities and other family members may have been working from home or not able to work at all. These changes were reflected in a number of comments from students who requested extra time to complete assessment tasks, catch up on reading material and course content or defer until the following semester.""As you may be aware Qld (Queensland) schools went back this week with a 'learn from home' approach. While not directly teaching my children, time has been spent getting them organised, down loading and negotiating correct platforms etc. This is work that was difficult to undertake ahead of time as most of the information has only been supplied over the last couple of days. I suspect they will need ongoing support this week"" (Student A). The project work that students undertake in our courses requires support and commitment from organisations in the form of stakeholder engagement, governance and access to information such as organisational systems data. The disruption of this support due to COVID-19 resulted in significant delays for students' project deliverables. Some students were about to embark on their project in Semester 1 and some students were in the final stages of their project.""I've been busy with COVID-19 planning and haven't had an opportunity to progress my project, in addition to the clinicians not having time or energy to contribute to the ongoing diagnostics"" (Student J).""I expect to complete the project however there will be difficulties with completing the diagnostics and communication as planned (i.e. unable to conduct focus groups but could undertake individual discussion, unable to feedback at staff meetings but could send email updates to relevant staff )"" (Student F).With a focus on student experience, we share our reflections of teaching and learning in a WIL, healthcare space during Semester 1, 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and some strategies for overcoming challenges.It became increasingly apparent that our teaching team needed strategies to assist students during this time to continue their studies while not adding further pressure to their work or personal lives. First, we reached out to our partner organisations and students, as well as internal channels, to develop and implement solutions to ensure that our students felt academically, and personally, supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies were in line with broader university support provided to students, including the provision of an automatic extra 5 working days from the due date to submit an assignment and extending the date for withdrawal without academic penalty until the end of Semester 1 where unit results are published before 8 July 2020. The university also introduced a procedure to ensure students maintain a strong Grade Point Average (GPA) (average results of all grades achieved throughout a course) in which students are able to ask for their results to be converted to an Ungraded Pass (UP) if their GPA was negatively impacted by COVID-19 during Semester 1. An UP is a grade that shows a student has successfully completed a unit of study within their course but their grade does not count toward their GPA. This allows usually high performing students who achieved lower than expected results due to the effects of COVID-19 to have these results removed from their GPA calculation (provided they have passed the unit). 13 Further strategies were based on the direct needs of our students. Flexibility around timing was requested by our students most often, allowing them extra time to complete their assessment tasks, including project deliverables, and reading through the unit(s) content. In particular, students in the 2 fully online, theory units found it difficult to meet the deadlines for the assessment tasks as they had not had time to engage with the learning material. This was evidenced through the number of formal extension requests received in these units. In addition, we provided further options for students allowing due dates to extend into Semester 2. As we were unable to provide our faceto-face masterclass days due to COVID-19 restrictions, there were also changes made to the order in which our students completed their units, to maximise the chances of students being able to attend masterclass sessions. Ongoing communication with students about their enrolment in individual units has been essential to ensure that we are providing equal opportunity for social learning outside of the workplace as well as experiential, workplace learning. Further to this, we recognised that a number of students no longer had a workplace in which to complete their project or had been seconded into a role that was not consistent with their initial project idea(s). We needed to develop a longer-term strategy for supporting these students both professionally and academically.In line with suggestions from other medical educators, we considered adaptive strategies for learning and how to innovate in this new COVID-19 environment. 14 After much team discussion, we decided to develop a suite of virtual projects for students unable to undertake a workplace project to complete the course requirements. The projects are set in a virtual 'madeup' health service, designed to reflect current Australian health service provision, and provide a context in which students can develop problem-solving skills through data gathering and analysis exercises and planning implementation of appropriate interventions. The characteristics of a problem-based learning approach, using problems as a stimulus and focus for student activity, 15 will enable our students to meet the course learning outcomes through real-world scenarios with data adapted from previous redesign projects. The virtual projects aim to be sufficiently flexible so that students can tailor them to their own needs, experiences and interests with the teaching team facilitating this individualised learning approach. This will provide an environment that encourages creativity and critical reflection, which can be adapted to a wide variety of learning styles. 16 However, we will need to ensure that learner collaboration and interactivity are maintained as they are key enablers of learning in online environments. [17] [18] [19] Students appeared to appreciate the efforts made by the teaching team to respond to learning challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback from students throughout the semester indicating that the personal support from each member of our teaching team and the consideration shown to students by the University as a whole created a positive learning environment that made students feel valued and understood:'I cannot stress strongly enough that understanding adult workloads, family life and study commitments, having the flexibility to hand assignments in before semester cut-off date and not fixed on a ""due date"" so to speak, has been hugely appreciated, this is flexible learning.' (Anonymous student feedback, Evaluate, 2020).As a teaching team we embrace constructivism as our teaching and learning paradigm and this approach continued to influence the way we responded to our students' challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Constructivism proposes that students learn by observation, processing and interpretation, and that they filter information into knowledge. 20 In our teaching and learning experience, constructivism essentially provides an intellectual framework for experiential learning through contextualised meaning making. Learning is increased when students can contextualise and situate what they learn for immediate dissemination. 21 Learning is therefore regarded as an active process through engagement with real-world problems which aligns with the experiential learning theory and our pedagogical approach. 22 As educators, we play an important role in linking students' previous experience to current learning content, enabling students to experiment with our learning material and provide feedback, in real-time, as a quality assurance approach. Similarly, consistent with pedagogical research around social learning theory 23 there are several factors that influence teaching and learning per social learning perspectives: context, culture and community. Our students' learning occurs as a combination of each of these concepts through observation and collaboration within the workplace (collegial connection) and directly through online interaction with learning materials and human interaction with lecturers. From a social learning theory perspective, knowledge is constructed while students engage in activities, receive feedback and participate in other forms of human interaction in a social context. 23 We aim to provide this social environment by supporting our students through projects that they plan, develop and implement as part of a shared goal or outcome for their organisation. This concept has been recognised in the field of medical teaching, as an approach whereby students learn to problem solve, contributing to improved clinical care and health systems. 24 We recognise that healthcare is a diverse field with many disciplines and areas of expertise and that a virtual project may appear to be a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Our students include nurses, pharmacists, medical officers, paramedics, allied health and administrative staff who conduct projects across all areas of healthcare. The virtual project curriculum is not based on 1 discipline but provides students with a choice of redesign projects covering a range of fields. These currently include acute medical inpatient journey, mental health, specialist outpatient clinics, pathology services, ambulance services and community healthcare. By providing a more individualised approach to virtual projects, we aim to continue to support our students as individual healthcare professionals through the development of contextually-relevant problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Virtual project-based learning then becomes a pedagogy that essentially integrates theory with the simulated practice of work within a purposely-designed curriculum.The creation of virtual projects was at first challenging, as we believe that the most important way to learn how to improve health services is by doing, consistent with the constructivist approach. Health service improvement involves knowledge mobilisation based on previous tacit knowledge gained in practice. 25 For many practical skills, especially 'soft skills' centring on engagement of health workers; the only way to learn and hone these skills is to practice. Our teaching is therefore centred on practice, utilising experiential learning, problem solving and the analysis of practice within theoretical concepts. Through our team discussions we came to the conclusion that this strategy could be applied to the virtual projects by retaining and emphasising the reflective elements in assessment tasks, whilst still retaining a student-centred approach to teaching and learning. We considered alternative strategies by delaying the WIL units. However, a prolonged delay may mean that students are unable to finish the degree within the maximum timeframe stipulated by the course rules.We felt that the creation of virtual projects was the right choice but that they had potential limitations that required addressing. Participation in virtual projects as an educational model reduces the opportunity for learning in a social context. Students who choose this pathway will not interact with workplace colleagues as part of their projects. Previous research, however, suggests that students perceive greater social interaction in an online learning space when creating and sharing indepth online messages. 26 Therefore, it will be important for us, as a teaching team, to ensure that our students remain socially connected to other students undertaking the virtual project curriculum and in the broader course.Our response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 has been informed by a constructivist paradigm. While we hope our courses will make a positive contribution to students' future professional careers, our ultimate goal is for our students to become safe, competent and reflective practitioners. We feel a sense of pride by offering our students alternative strategies to allow them to keep studying and we have done this by being open and responsive. We were able to create a positive learning environment were students feel comfortable to think critically. Critical thinking assists students to become capable, autonomous practitioners needed to deliver services in a health care environment, that is rapidly increasing in complexity. Similarly, as we have all practiced in various healthcare roles, we have a level of empathy for our students in that we understand the constraints that are often faced during project work in healthcare organisations. This empathy extends to include COVID-19 as we have endured many challenges with our own healthcare redesign project work within local and national organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic has led us to critically reflect on our roles as educators in the fields of health and medicine. We now Prior et al. 5 have a clearer understanding of our position within the learning and teaching space, leading to enhanced methods of support and teaching strategies, for our students' benefit. It is not unusual that a major event such as COVID-19 leads to changes in thinking and practice. 27The COVID -19 pandemic has caused disruptions in teaching and learning in our WIL course. Four key issues have emerged: workload and capacity, role changes, changes in home-life and project-specific delays. These issues provided us with insights about how our students were coping with responding to the pandemic and studying at the same time. Therefore as a teaching team we were placed in a position to reflect on our student-centred way of teaching through a constructivism lens allowing us to further develop our methods of experiential learning and teaching by concentrating on how to provide equity in access to all students wishing to study clinical redesign in a (virtual) WIL model.","Australia","first author","2020-10-14",10

Questions about the morality and suitability of libertarian principles of selfreliance, market driven policy and minimal government in time of crisis are emerging (Doherty, 2020; Lent, 2020; Whitzman, 2020; Wong, 2020) . Some of the V C The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com Health Promotion International, 2020, 1-10 doi: 10.1093/heapro/daaa112 Article arguments cited include the impact of policies in countries around the world aimed at fragmenting and privatizing health systems, which have hindered access to primary health care when it is most needed; and the manner in which market driven reforms have exacerbated poverty and social inequality with socially disadvantaged communities and groups becoming highly vulnerable in time of crisis (Solty, 2020) . Equally important, it is argued that COVID-19 challenges the dominant cultural values of individualism and self-determination, mainly because the pandemic reveals that health is not just a private asset but part a social good and a fundamental right for everyone (Watson et al., 2020) . An example cited to illustrate this point is the current health crisis in the USA as a result of the policy of drawing individuals' premium payments in part from their employers. The economic crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of workers suddenly losing not only their jobs but also their health insurance and therefore finding themselves unable to access essential health care (Dunford and Qi, 2020) . When faced with a global pandemic such as COVID-19, the flaws of individualization approaches to health and adherences to rhetoric of individuals as rational consumers of public goods and information including health, becomes evident. Research on responses to the pandemic in the USA by disadvantaged adults with comorbid conditions has also showed that they lacked critical resources such as health literacy and engagement with the health system and health information to make informed decisions, and, despite concerns, were not changing routines or plans (Wolf et al., 2020) . In the USA, anti-lockdown protests and attitudes towards the virus and protective guidelines have mostly been influenced by partisan voting patterns rather than rational assessment of risk (Vince, 2020) . Interestingly enough decades of neoliberalism and social conservatism with its zealous emphasis on personal liberties and small government display their worst civil society traits in time of crisis through cultural expressions such as these refusals to wear masks as well as incidents of physical attacks on health staff and businesses in UK, Australia and USA trying to enforce mask wearing (Vince, 2020) . What refusals to adopt protective measures such as these indicate is the manner in which, decades of individualization and autonomy-based approaches to the relationship between individuals, the state and society, distort the relationship between individuals and the social interdependency nature of health and wellbeing.The advent of a global infectious disease such as COVID-19 questions our understanding of autonomous agency in two important ways, as stated by Azétsop and Rennie (Azétsop and Rennie, 2010) a decade earlier:First, as both a victim and a vector, a patient cannot be simply seen as a rational agent who has the final ethical word on his own decisions. Both vulnerability to infection and threat of transmission to others should shape our understanding of patient agency. Second, the concept of choice that shapes our conception of agency in bioethics can no longer be understood in isolation from society. (2010, p. 2) Confronted with an evolving threat such as a global pandemic, governments and public health officials have not hesitated to curtail autonomous agency and personal choice when the wellbeing of third parties are involved (Bayer, 2007) . Individualism and autonomy are, however, constantly evoked to account for disparities in health and economic outcomes, with the most disadvantaged groups and individuals often becoming the target of programmes and policies to address their self-care and autonomy deficiencies. At the centre of this paradox lies a fundamental flaw in the application of the 'rights' language (Kirtley, 2017) and the relationship between individuals and the state. The preference neoliberalist policy gives to notions of individual freedom as equated with an absence of constraints imposed on an individual by outside authorities fails to recognize the role of government intervention, collective action and the common good to create the conditions in which individuals can exercise their free will (Ives, 2020) .The conceptualization of health disparities and health interventions using this narrow application of individual freedom and responsibility principles, ignores the links between free will and the structural and social conditions that shape individual action and choices (Thomas and Buckmaster, 2010; Schram and Goldman, 2018) . The social, economic and structural factors shaping individual choices, health behaviours and health outcomes are as evident in time of global pandemic events as they are in normal times. The brief respite to this rhetoric in favour of greater attention to the addressing the health impacts of poor housing, poverty, unemployment and underemployment are no more than a recognition that a concern for the common good requires a broader understanding of individual rights and freedom of choice.The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is a leading health and welfare statistics agency that collects data on many health and welfare issues and topics in Australia. Decades of collecting evidence on the social determinants of health provides a sobering picture of worsening conditions in key indicators including socio-economic exclusion, unemployment and housing. Some of the figures in the 2019 report include the fact that more than 116 000 women and children in Australia were estimated to be homeless, an increase of 4.6% from 2011 (AIHW, 2019). Although the percentage of the Australian population living in poverty has not changed in the last 10 years sitting around 13%, fluctuations in the poverty gap in the last 10 years have been identified and linked to specific government policies (AIHW, 2019). A notorious example is the impact of the transfer of many sole parents to Newstart Allowance in 2015 resulted in a rise in the rate of poverty among unemployed sole parents from 35% in 2013 to 59% 2 years later (ACOSS, 2018). The government's decision to temporarily double the Newstart payment (renamed Job Seeker) in response to the pandemic is expected to have an impact on these figures with an anticipated significant decrease in the percentage of Australian living under the poverty line. This will be discussed in more detail later in this paper.The housing situation in Australia has also worsened for low-income families. Housing, as stated by the Australian Council for Social Services (ACOSS) is the largest fixed cost in most family budgets. Housing affordability continues to be one of the most significant barriers and sources of stress for ow-income families in Australia. Individuals and families with lower housing costs (especially those who own their homes outright) are in a much better position and enjoy higher standards of living than those on the same income but with higher housing costs (especially tenants) [(ACOSS, 2018), p. 5]. The 2013 À 14 report on housing affordability identified housing stress being experienced by an increasing number of renter households. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 50.1% of low-income renter households had housing costs >30% of gross household income (which includes Commonwealth Rent Assistance) (Parliament of Australia, 2015a,b). A report by the AIHW in 2019 found that in June 2016, around 195 000 households were on social housing waiting lists, with 47% having waited for more than 2 years. However, as the 2013 Senate Inquiry into affordable housing revealed, social housing supply has declined over the last 10 years and been redefined by successive governments as a welfare safety net measure for the most disadvantaged. This means that social housing is no longer available to most people, even people who have chronic health problems and are experiencing extreme poverty (Parliament of Australia, 2015a,b).A 2014 Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report called 'Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia. The extent of income inequality in Australia' (Parliament of Australia, 2014) found that income inequality has increased in Australia against the backdrop of rising incomes across all income deciles. As one submission by Prof. Morawetz pointed out, in the last 20 years income inequality in Australia has increased and today the richest 20% of households in Australia account for 61% of total household net worth, whereas the poorest 20% of households account for just 1% of the total [ (Morawetz, 2016) , p. 6]. These findings indicate that despite economic growth in the last 20 years, Australia has an increasing number of individuals and families facing economic hardship, social exclusion and dependency on government benefits, including those on Newstart unemployment benefits, which until the advent of COVID-19 forced their recipients to live well below the poverty line (Parliament of Australia, 2014). The 2014 Senate Report concluded that, based on the evidence received by hundreds of submissions and analysis of government policy, the 2014-15 budget had disproportionately and negatively impacted people living on low incomes.Economic policies that disadvantage and exacerbate poverty have profound impacts on health outcomes (Spencer, 2003) . Income inequality affects to all areas of social and economic life, health and wellbeing. That is why it is often referred as the 'fundamental cause' (Phelan et al., 2010) due to its impact on access to resources such as knowledge, education, power, prestige and beneficial social connections. In relation to health, income inequality, as the 2014 Senate Report pointed out, was a key barrier preventing people from accessing health care or investing in preventive health and healthy lifestyles. People were also delaying seeking medical assistance for some acute injuries due to the additional costs associated with accessing care. Oral health has also been identified as a health issue for low-income families due to the high costs of accessing dental care in Australia (Sanders, 2007) . Household income and health-related outcomes are strongly correlated, and as pointed by Phelan et al. (Phelan et al., 2010) , with a social gradient for health being observed for life expectancy and a range of chronic diseases in Australia.Efforts by successive Australian governments to address the social determinants of health have drawn criticism for failing to take adequate account of structural barriers preventing people from achieving positive health outcomes. The 2013 parliamentary enquiry into Australia's response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health report 'Closing the gap within a generation' (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013) identified a lack of commitment to structural change and action to address the social determinants of health in Australia. The recommendations made in the Report included a new approach and priority to the social determinants of health along with greater investment of policies in health, education, housing, social security and employment aimed at reducing inequality and poverty in Australia (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013). It also recommended local governments produce annual progress reports to parliament outlining the specific steps taken to meet social determinants of health in each of the areas outlined above.Similarly, the recommendations from the 2014 Senate Report on income inequality cited above, as well as the recommendations from other key Senate inquiries on education (The Review of Funding for Schooling 2011, known as the Gonski Review), housing affordability (Out of reach? The Australian Housing Affordability Challenge, 2015), have all signalled the urgent need for greater government intervention and priority on reducing disadvantages through taxation reform, redistribution of wealth and funding models in education, housing and welfare policy. In relation to income inequality, the 2014 Report recommended the Commonwealth government undertakes an analysis of income inequality in Australia and a review of policies and programmes such as levels of income support payments for people on unemployment benefit and Family Tax Benefit (Parliament of Australia, 2014).The response from successive governments in Australia to the growing inequality divide and its negative impacts on education, employment, housing, health and wellbeing outcomes has been ad hoc and mostly focussed on mitigating its excesses. Some examples include the response from the government to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health report (WHO, 2005) , which emphasized their preference for a traditional focus on addressing health concerns using the health system as the primary vehicle for attaining improved health outcomes rather than addressing the social causes of ill health (Community Affairs References Committee, 2013). Another example is the response to the Senate Report on income inequality which included refutations of the Report findings by members of the government (Parliament of Australia Coalition Senators' Dissenting Report, 2014) and arguments supporting approaches to addressing inequality through economic growth, which the government argued is the most effective way to address inequality (Community Affairs References Committee, 2013). The response reaffirmed the right of the government to continue harsh welfare policies such as a below poverty unemployment benefit and reduction in family tax benefits to restore 'fiscal sustainability'. These policies alongside reductions in company tax rates have been cited as effective responses to increase investment, employment and help improve economic conditions for business, families and individuals (Parliament of Australia, 2016).The absence of national body responsible for coordinating responses to social determinants at the Commonwealth level has meant that there is no current consensus on an agreed framework or a national body of indicators to measure, monitor and evaluate key action on the social determinants of health across states and territories. The only exception relates to Indigenous communities with the creation in 2008, of a cooperative national effort to address alarmingly high and persistent levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the Council of Australian Governments (Cooper, 2011) . There is evidence of some progress in key areas such as enrolments in early childhood education and Year 12 school attainment (Queensland Closing the Gap Snapshot Report Card, 2019). One major problem with these reports, however, is the absence of national and local progress reports identifying specific actions taken to address health inequities in key social determinants of health indicator areas such as housing, employment, education, transportation, social environment and physical environments. Such reporting would make it possible to track and monitor the impact of specific programmes and strategies to improve health outcomes through health and non-health-related programmes.A review of policies and interventions across all jurisdictions showed that most strategies were predominantly operationalized in health care and relatively few of them addressed health equity outside of access to health care (Fisher et al., 2016) . The review concluded that some strategies across Australia included strengthening Primary Health Care and targeted strategies to improve access for equity groups, specially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. However, the research concluded: ""there is also reason for concern, given that policies frequently represented and addressed health inequities as a problem of poor health among specific disadvantaged groups and did relatively little to address (or call for cross-sectoral action to address) social gradients in health"" [(Fisher et al., 2016), p. 560] .The emphasis on specific health issues and health access for some priority groups, although an important strategy to mitigate health inequities, ignores the nonhealth factors responsible for the health outcomes of these priority groups, focussing instead on individualized promotion/prevention strategies. The persistent focus health rather than social equity tends to overmedicalize issues, veiling the fundamental problem of social inequality (Lynch, 2017) . A telling example is the current interventions to address the high incidence of otitis media (OM) among Aboriginal children in Australia. These high rates, as indicated by research (DeLacy et al., 2020) are linked to poor housing conditions, overcrowded housing, exposure to tobacco smoke, education and overall social and economic disadvantage. As pointed out by DeLacy et al. (DeLacy et al., 2020) : ""Current interventions are primary focussed on biomedical approaches such as investigating vaccines and antibiotics. Although vaccines and antibiotics are essential to the provision of high-quality clinical care for OM, a broader public health lens is required to address the underlying social factors reported to be driving the gap in OM rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children"" [(2020), p. 495].The emphasis on policies aimed at economic growth and competitiveness through financial deregulation and privatization, while limiting the size of the government and its social policy agenda, despite robust and repeated evidence of their negative effects on income inequality, and the social determinants of health, illustrate a pervasive commitment to neoliberal ideology (Fourcade-Gourinchas and Babb, 2002) . Despite the enormous body of evidence from research and government inquiries, as those discussed above, demonstrating the link between government policy and social inequality, neoliberalist principles and agendas have continued to inform government strategies and reforms in education, health, housing, employment and welfare programmes. Under the guise of 'common sense' free-market principles are being applied to a large variety of microeconomic problems, and this has helped to spread neoliberal solutions to broad areas of public, business, administration, personal and social life. One of the most profound impacts of this approach relate to the manner in which neoliberalism has shifted the relationship between individuals and the state by constructing individual responsibility rather than government policies as the decisive factor in determining how individuals' fare in life. The birth of the responsible individual has been accompanied by moralizing discourses centred on the classification of welfare recipients, the sick, and the disabled as undeserving people whose poor choices have led them to their current predicament (Woolford and Nelund, 2013) .From a social determinants of health perspective, market driven reforms and the redefinition of the individual as the subjects of their own lives-the entrepreneurial self, has had profound impacts on government approaches to health inequalities and health care system reforms. There is an extensive body of literature outlining the impact of neo-liberalism on the public sector in general and health sectors in particular (Horton, 2007; Baum et al., 2016; Sakellariou and Rotarou, 2017) . These include a new managerial system skin to those of the private sector, a shift away from community-based health promotion and illness prevention to more subacute clinical services, budget reductions, competitive tendering and a focus on short-term measurable throughputs such as increase in hospital use or episodes of care . Individualization models in health, with its focus on health as an individual issue determined by individuals' genetic make-up and individual choices have led to policies to address social determinants of health through lifestyle interventions to change behaviour. The underlying belief that individuals are responsible for their health problems has led to incidents such as surgeons at Adelaide's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 2007 declining to perform certain elective surgery on patients who are obese or who smoke (Van Der Weyden, 2007) .The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the manner in which societies and individuals respond to it, has provided many opportunities to observe how choices (particularly habitual behaviours), are influenced by cultural values, social attitudes and government policy. Decisions to follow health advice such as maintaining physical distance or wearing masks are shaped as much by environmental, social and political factors as they are by personal safety concerns. Van Der Weyden (Van Der Weyden, 2007) research on individual choice concluded that despite having access to information and resources to advert risk, people often lack the individual resources COVID-19 pandemic and cracks on neoliberal ideologies necessary to be considered morally responsible for failing to change their behaviour. As pointed by Van Der Weyden (Van Der Weyden, 2007) , when it comes to health and individual responsibility for health outcomes, it is philosophically inconsistent and potentially harmful to hold individuals as morally responsible for their health outcomes and health behaviours. The moral value associated with some behaviour fosters stigmatization of particular individuals or groups with consistently low health and social outcomes. Furthermore, it has been increasingly acknowledged that the social and economic conditions in which people live, i.e. their physical, material, cultural and social environments provide the strongest cues for the choices and behaviours that we adopt, often without awareness (Andermann and Clear, 2016) . This acknowledgment should shift the focus away from largely ineffective programmes and interventions by well-meant public policy bureaucrats that focus on encouraging individuals to resist these environments and adopt healthier lifestyles. Instead there is an urgent need to focus on interventions that seek to change the environments and socio-economic circumstances in which people find themselves (Kaplan et al., 2015) .One of the most significant consequences of the COVID-19 global pandemic has been the manner in which it has dislocated this rhetoric of personal responsibility and individual choice, enabling instead a less punitive language towards the sick and unemployed. Through various policies including free access to childcare and doubling of the unemployment benefit, the Australian government has, in effect, acknowledged the importance of addressing the social determinants of health in order to protect the nation from the social, economic and health consequences of national and global responses to the health crisis. Increases in the JobSeeker payments have allowed people to pay rent, access three meals a day and buy fresh fruits and vegetables, as reported in a national survey conducted by ACOSS (ACOSS, 2020). From a health perspective, this highlights that the health choices people make are strongly determined by budgetary concerns rather than poor health literacy or poor health habits. Prior to the pandemic, social problems such as homelessness were often regarded as 'wicked problems' due to the complexity and interactions between causal factors, conflicting policy objectives and disagreement over the appropriate solution. The advent of COVID-19 saw Federal and State governments working together to provide short-term accommodation to more than 7000 homeless people in Australia (Knight, 2020) .The government has also put a moratorium on rental evictions for 6 months to prevent a short-term spike in homelessness. This assistance to renters, the homeless and the unemployed has shown that often, these 'wicked problems' are portrayed as unsolvable because of the politics and political implications of addressing the root causes of many of these social policy challenges (McConnell, 2018) . In time of crisis, protecting political reputation, controlling agendas and carving out particular ideological trajectories may not be as important as the leverage gained from demonstrating an ability to control and manage risks. However, finding long-term solutions to key social determinants of health in Australia will ultimately be the measure by which the success of the government's response to COVID-19 pandemic will be judged. In the meantime, the brief respite from market driven, neoliberal agendas and narratives in response to the pandemic challenge decades of government dogma on the primacy of the individual and the supremacy of market solutions to complex social, economic and health challenges. It has also exposed the impact of these decades of neglect and omission of the fundamental causes of health inequalities in Australia.","Australia","first author","2020-10-07",10

As genetic variants are randomly allocated at conception, MR resembles a randomized controlled trial and is less subject to confounding than observational studies. The publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics provide valuable resources for assessing the causality between lifestyle factors and the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. A MR study found evidence that both body mass index (BMI) and smoking had a causal effect on the risks of COVID-19 with respiratory failure and of hospitalization with COVID-19; however, the estimated causal effects had limited precision 8 .This study aimed to investigate the causality between four lifestyle factors, namely BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, and severe illness of COVID-19 using the two-sample MR approach 9 .Summary-level data were obtained from two GWAS analyses conducted by the COVID-19Details of the GWAS analyses can be found at https://www.covid19hg.org/.Genome-wide significant genetic variants identified from GWAS were selected as instrumental Physical activity: five variants identified to be associated with accelerometer-measured overall physical activity (measured as average vector magnitude) in a sample of ~91000 UK Biobank individuals, explaining ~0.2% variation in overall physical activity 14 . Proxies with a minimum linkage disequilibrium r 2 =0.8 were used for genetic variants that were unavailable in the COVID-19 data sources (two, one and two variants for BMI, alcohol consumption and physical activity, respectively; one alcohol consumption variant had no proxy available, so it was not included in analysis).The statistical power was calculated using the proportion of variation in the lifestyle risk factor explained by the genetic instrumental variables, sample size of the COVID-19 GWAS, and the method proposed by Burgess 15 .The analyses were conducted using the TwoSampleMR R package 20 . All statistical tests were two-sided. Results with a nominal P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.For BMI, lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, respectively, this study has 80% statistical power at the significance level of 0.05 to detect an OR of 1 suggesting that the observed associations were not driven by any single genetic variant (Data not shown). There was evidence of heterogeneity in the genetic variant-exposure effects for BMI and alcohol consumption, but not for lifetime smoking and physical activity ( Table 2) .Using a two-sample MR approach, this study found evidence that BMI and smoking have a causal effect on increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness. These findings were the same as those by Ponsford et al. 8 For the first time, this study provided evidence that physical activity causally decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. However, only five genetic instrumental variables were used, and they explained ~0.2% variation in physical activity only; the estimates for the causal effects were of reduced precision. The findings are perhaps more important in terms of qualifying causality than quantifying the causal effects.As to alcohol consumption, this study had sufficient power to detect the observed IVW OR for COVID-19 hospitalization, but not for severe respiratory COVID-19. Interestingly, results from the MR-Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode methods supported the association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and COVID-19 severe illness.Limitations of this study included that there might be bias in the causal effect estimates, as there was sample overlap between the lifestyle factors GWAS and COVID-19 GWAS, e.g., UK biobank participants were included in the GWAS of COVID-19 hospitalization. However, given the proportions of COVID-19 cases in the GWAS analyses were low, any bias must be minimal 22 .In conclusion, this study finds evidence that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity causally decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. All these lifestyle risk factors are modifiable, so they could be targeted to reduce severe illness of COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness. The findings also have a profound public health value -a healthy lifestyle could be helpful for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Australia","first author","2020-10-21",10

Amid increasing concerns of medical professionals about the harms associated with invasive ventilation, there is interest to explore the role of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to In this commentary we aim to summarize what is known about the role of NIPPV in patients with AHRF and ARDS due to COVID-19 and other viral infections, point out evidence gaps and make a case for consideration of NIPVV as a possible alternative to early intubation in patients with COVID-19.Aims to limit intubations are mainly based on concerns about ventilator-induced lung injury and the recognition that the pathophysiological and anatomical features of COVID-19 related lung infection are different from classic ARDS, for which invasive mechanical ventilation is considered the standard of care. COVID-19 is primarily causing injury to the capillary endothelium instead of essential injury to the alveolar epithelium. 1 Lungs affected by COVID-19 show marked ventilation-perfusion mismatch but preserved compliance, 2 making the recruitment maneuver and the use of high positive end-expiratory pressure potentially deleterious. The risk of ventilator-induced lung injury in patients with COVID-19 is further increased by the lack of specialized personnel (e.g. shortage in respiratory therapists and intensivists) and the lack of appropriate equipment (e. g. use of devices used for chronic mechanical ventilation, use of a single device for several patients).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f NIPPV includes treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). 3 CPAP is useful in AHRF, as it recruits collapsed alveoli, improves ventilation-perfusion matching, and therefore oxygenation. BiPAP is useful for the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory failure, as it supports ventilation by using a different level of in-and expiratory continuous airway pressure, thus increasing tidal volume and minute ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS typically have severe hypoxemia and relatively well preserved lung mechanics. 2 It is therefore reasonable to assume that patients with COVID-19 will benefit from CPAP therapy. However, as many patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure are obese and may therefore have risk factors for hypercapnia including obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, BiPAP therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis.Guideline recommendations on the use of NIPPV in COVID-19 vary widely (Table 1) Prone positioning has been shown to reduce mortality in severe ARDS. 13 There is emerging evidence that prone positioning is beneficial in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, and that NIPPV can be provided to these patients in the prone position in a general ward. 14NIPPV has been widely used in China and some European countries during the current pandemic, but to date there is insufficient evidence to support this use.An Italian retrospective chart review study of patients with COVID-19 found that of 71 patients on helmet CPAP, 26 (37%) were intubated and 54 (76%) died (before or after intubation). The availability of ventilators was limited in the study setting, thus not allowing for a comparison between CPAP use and early intubation.NIPPV was commonly used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China that emerged in 2002, but only four small observational studies that mention NIPPV are available, 17 one of which focused on the nosocomial infection risk and included only two patients on BiPAP. 18 Another study did not specify the ventilation type that was used and did not evaluate outcomes in patients on NIPPV. 19 In the two remaining studies, both from Hong Kong, BiPAP treatment was used in all patients on NIPPV. 20, 21 Intubation was avoided in 14 out of 20 (70%) patients on BiPAP and was associated with a shorter ICU stay (3.1 days vs 21.3 days, p < 0.001) compared with intubated patients in one study. 20 It was, however, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unclear if early intubation as opposed to BiPAP use would have resulted in better outcomes, especially for the patients who required intubation despite treatment with BiPAP. The other study assessed the outcomes in patients with SARS in one hospital that used BiPAP as initial ventilatory support compared with outcomes in 13 hospitals in which only invasive mechanical ventilation was used. 21 Patients in the hospital using BiPAP did not significantly differ from the patients in the hospitals not using any NIPPV in terms of demographic characteristics, co-morbidities and disease severity on admission apart from significantly higher Lactate dehydrogenase levels in the patients admitted to the NIPPV hospital. Patients in the NIPPV hospital had lower adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for intubation (OR 0. 36; 95% CI 0.16 -0.79) and death (OR 0. 24; 95% CI 0.08 -0.72) compared with patients in the hospitals only using mechanical ventilation.A systematic review identified 22 studies conducted on the use of NIPPV during the 2009 influenza A pandemic caused by the swine influenza (H1N1) virus, of which the majority were case series and none were randomized trials. 17 In a Spanish registry study of 685 patients with H1N1 pneumonia 177 patients were treated with NIPPV (specific type of ventilation not specified), which was successful in 72 patients (41%); the remainder of patients required intubation. When NIPPV treatment failed, the delay in intubation was not associated with increased mortality compared with patients who were intubated without a trial of NIPPV (26.5% versus 24.2%, p <0.001). 22 The lack of randomization introduces selection bias. Patients who were directly intubated were likely sicker than those treated with NIPPV initially, and it is therefore unclear whether in comparable patients failure of NIPPV would not increase mortality compared with early intubation.In summary, there is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of NIPPV in AHRF due to viral pneumonia. Observational studies suggest that the use of NIPPV has the potential to reduce the need for intubation. It is unclear whether patients in whom NIPPV treatment fails would have had better outcomes if they would have been intubated earlier without a trial of NIPPV. Patients who can overcome severe COVID-19 without requiring intubation will benefit from avoiding sedation, inability to communicate, potential delirium and posttraumatic stress disorder. Table 2 gives an overview of potential benefits and disadvantages of different breathing support strategies in acute respiratory failure.High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is an emerging therapy for AHRF that can warm and humidify gas, which can decrease airway inflammation, improve mucus clearance and enhance patient comfort. HFNC can deliver a 21% to 100% fraction of inhaled oxygen at flow rates of up to 60 liters/min and generates a positive end-expiratory pressure which prevents alveolar collapse.there is currently no available evidence to assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared with standard oxygen or CPAP.A European multicenter trial of 310 patients with AHRF (caused by pneumonia in 84% of the patients) found that treatment with HFNC, standard oxygen, or NIPPV did not result in significantly different intubation rates. HFNC was associated with lower 90-day mortality J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f than either standard oxygen or NIPPV. 23 This could potentially suggest a role for HFNC in patients with AHRF due to COVID-19.Recommendations against the use of NIPPV and/or HFNC in patients with AHRF due to COVID are at least partially based on concerns about virus spread in aerosols produced by these procedures. However, very little is known about the risk of viral transmission associated with different aerosol generating procedures. A systematic review found that tracheal intubation had a significantly higher risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections to healthcare professionals (OR 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3 to 18.9, 4 cohort studies) than NIPPV (pooled OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.8, 2 cohort studies). 24 A study that used laser smoke visualisation to assess dispersion distances during aerosol producing procedures using a human patient simulator found that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distance was greatest (100 cm) using a nasal cannula at an oxygen flow rate of 5litres/min while there was only negligible air dispersion with the use of CPAP via oronasal mask at a pressure of 20 cmH 2 O. 25 The risk of viral transmission with NIPPV can be significantly reduced with the use of a filter on the expiratory circuit and the automatic measurement and quantification of a leak at the interface (which allows prompt leak correction and reduction of virus dispersion). Although intubation is associated with a high risk of viral transmission, the risk can be reduced by techniques of apneic oxygenation and rapid sequence intubation with paralysis.Invasive mechanical ventilation has a reduced risk of viral transmission compared with NIPPV once a closed ventilation circuit is established.In summary, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CPAP and HFNC are associated with a higher viral transmission risk than standard oxygen delivered via nasal cannula or different mask types, especially when relatively high oxygen flow rates are used.The use of filters on the expiratory circuit of NIPPV may indeed result in lower viral transmission rates with NIPPV than with the use of standard oxygen or HFNC. Precautions to minimize transmission from aerosol-generating procedures in COVID-19 patients are warranted, including the use of negative-pressure rooms, personal protective equipment including a respirator that ensures a level of protection equal or greater than N95/FFP2 and the use of viral/bacterial filters with any devices.On July 1, 2020, only 12 studies (including five randomized trials) that investigate NIPPV in COVID-19 were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. This compares to a total of 2447 registered studies using the term ""COVID"". The table in the supplement provides an overview of all identified studies and their characteristics. A US randomized trial assesses the effectiveness of CPAP treatment at home compared with no intervention in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 who are sent home from the emergency room with mild pneumonia or respiratory illness. One randomized trial from the US and Sweden respectively compares helmet CPAP with HFNC; whereas an Italian trial compares helmet CPAP with no intervention. A French trial compares the effectiveness of standard oxygen, CPAP, HFNC, and invasive ventilation while also assessing the effectiveness of dexamethasone versus placebo using a factorial design.In the absence of sufficient evidence and pending trial results, NIPPV should be considered as an alternative to early intubation, and the type of NIPPV should be based on case-by-case decision making that takes into account a patient's characteristics (e.g. the ability to independently move into a prone position) and co-morbidities (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared with NIPPV in COVID-19. Safety concerns around aerosol spread of SARS-CoV-2 during NIPPV treatment make such trials difficult to conduct.Nevertheless, evidence from large well-conducted randomized trials is urgently needed because future pandemics with other viral pneumonias are likely. These trials should address the effectiveness of NIPVV compared with early intubation and HFNC, and the risk of viral transmission to health care workers when patients are using different breathing support strategies.The authors have no conflicts of interests to disclose. , intubation with sedation may better facilitate patient undergoing certain procedures or transporting to a different medical facility (e.g. patient cannot lie flat for a computed tomography scan)• Requires specialist care in the intensive care unit (physician, nurses, respiratory therapists) • Often requires sedation, inability for patient to communicate and may have increased association with delirium and posttraumatic stress disorder • May be associated with longer hospitalization and higher mortality compared to patients who have avoided intubation on NIPPV d • Risk of vocal cord damage, procedural hypotension, and other adverse effects directly associated with placement of an endotracheal tube • Potential for lung injury associated with positive endexpiratory pressure • High risk of viral transmission during intubation (can be limited by techniques of apneic oxygenation and rapid sequence intubation with paralysis) and also during","Australia","first author","2020-10-08",10

As of 10 th of August, more than twenty million infections and over 700,000 deaths related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been confirmed worldwide 1 .Different countries have adopted varying degrees of physical distancing and mitigation strategies with diverse impacts on their transmission rates, death toll and economies 2, 3 . It has been proposed that testing of asymptomatic individuals with the isolation of cases and contact tracing could reduce the prevalence of the disease and end the pandemic 4 . In Australia, restriction measures were first implemented on 23 rd of March (with the closure of bars, clubs, cinemas, places of worship, casinos and gyms), and two days later the country closed its borders 5 . As part of the mitigation strategy, the Victorian state government implemented a screening ""blitz"" in the last week of April. The purpose of this was to screen a large number of people and therefore allow for contact tracing and physical isolation of positive asymptomatic individuals prior to easing of restrictions. After a peak in the number of cases at the end of March both in Australia and the state of Victoria, a steep decline in the daily number of new cases became evident, and restrictions were gradually and progressively eased since the second half of May 5 . Estimates of the infection rates among asymptomatic individuals in Australia are currently scarce and, given that physiological changes imposed by pregnancy could lead to increased susceptibility, it is unknown whether the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in pregnancy reflects that of the general population.Preliminary data suggest that pregnant women are not at increased risk of severe disease and its complications compared to the general population, nor is there convincing evidence of vertical transmission 6, 7 . However, within the pandemic context, pregnancy represents a unique situation as women have multiple interactions with the health care system and most are ultimately admitted to the hospital for childbirth. Therefore, pregnant women may be a source of infection to others who they encounter during their frequent attendance to healthcare facilities, so it is vital to understand the rates of asymptomatic infection in this population. While pregnant women with symptoms may be undergoing testing in general clinics, few studies opportunistically targeted a population of asymptomatic pregnant women.Knowing the rates of infection in pregnant women and whether they reflect the prevalence of infection in the general population may inform decisions regarding the need to test pregnant women (for example, before admission for childbirth) depending on the pandemic context and the general population infection rates. This study aims to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among pregnant women during hospital visits within a defined study period during the coronavirus disease pandemic in Melbourne, Australia.We performed a cross-sectional study at Victoria's largest maternity service that provides birthing services across three hospitals in southeast metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. There are about 10,000 births in the service each year (nearly one in seven of all Victorian births).During the two-week period from 6 th to 19 th May 2020, inclusive, women attending routine antenatal visits were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. We also included pregnant women who had testing in other sectors of the hospital (maternity ward, birth suite, pregnancy assessment unit, or COVID-19 screening clinic) with possible symptoms of the disease. In the weeks that preceded testing of asymptomatic women, we had adopted the following strategies in our three maternity hospitals to reduce exposure of patients, relatives and staff: a significant number of antenatal consultations (approximately 60%) were shifted to a telehealth model, with face-to-face appointments reserved for visits at 28, 36 and 40 weeks of pregnancy, or when deemed necessary by the attending health professional; all women were routinely asked about recent travel, known contacts and the presence of recognised COVID-19 symptoms; if symptoms were present, women were advised to attend the COVID-19 screening clinic and not to attend their antenatal appointment; all women attending the clinic or the hospital had body scanning temperature check on arrival; no support persons were allowed during clinic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f consultations or ultrasound examinations, and only one support person was allowed during labour and birth; and all health care professionals attending births wore personal protective equipment (PPE) after appropriate training. Since the beginning of the pandemic, antenatal clinic staff wore face masks and face shields when in contact with patients.Combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected as recommended 8 and according to national guidelines 9 using FLOQSwabs ® and transported in UTM medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy) by a trained health professional (nurse or midwife) wearing appropriate PPE consisting of a gown, nonsterile gloves, eye protection and a protective mask. SARS-CoV-2 testing was then performed utilising multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR, AusDiagnostics, Mascot, Australia), an assay with demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity (>99.9%) 10 . Turnaround times for test results are usually between 24 to 48 hours. In case of positive results, the Department of Health is notified for further management and contact tracing, and patients immediately contacted and told to stay at home unless concerning symptoms are present, in which case they should seek health care through their local hospital.In the screening period, additional data were collected regarding maternal age, weight, height, parity, gestational age, recent overseas travel since the beginning of the pandemic and presence or absence of COVID-19 symptoms during the week that preceded the test.Gestational age was calculated according to the first day of the last menstrual period, or by the sonographic measurement of fetal biometric parameters when the gestational age given by ultrasound differed from that provided by the last menstrual period by more than oneweek. Tests were performed from 6 th to 19 th May 2020, after a decline in the number of daily cases in the first wave of the disease in Australia (Figure 1) . Overall, 351 women consented SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of those, 332 (94.6%) were tested in the antenatal clinic, and 19 (5.4%) were tested in the maternity ward, birth suite, pregnancy assessment unit, or the COVID-19 screening clinic due to possible symptoms of COVID-19. One woman (0.3%) in the routine screening group could not tolerate the test, and therefore 350 women underwent testing.The baseline characteristics of the screened population are summarised in Table 1 . The median maternal age of the study population was 32 years (IQR 28 to 35 years). The median J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days), 148 women (42.2%) were nulliparous and 203 (57.8%) were parous. Ten women (2.9%) were in the first trimester (less than 14 weeks of gestational age), 77 (21.9%) were in the second trimester (from 14 to 28 weeks of gestational age), and 264 (75.2%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy (gestational age of 28 weeks or more).In the routine screening group, two women (0.6%) reported possible COVID-19 symptoms in the days that preceded the test (one reported headache and one reported rhinorrhea). In the symptomatic group, the most common symptoms were fever (13, 68.4%), respiratory changes including cough and dyspnoea (5, 26.3%) and sore throat (4, 21%). No woman reported recent overseas travel or contact with known infected persons.All 350 tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2, including those performed in women with symptoms. We estimate with 95% confidence that the true proportion of positive tests in the population during the study period was between 0 and 1% (p̂ = 0%, 95% CI 0% to 1.0%).The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is highly contagious. Each infected person is likely to infect on average, a measure known as R0, between 2.2 and 5.7 individuals 11, 12 , if measures to reduce transmission such as physical distancing and hands hygiene are not implemented. Universal testing has been proposed not only to reduce transmission rates and avoid an overload of the health systems but also as an alternative strategy to reduce economic and social damage during relaxation of restriction measures, with strict household quarantine after a positive test 13 . Feasibility, cost and effectiveness of such policy have not, however, been evaluated. In addition, it is unlikely that one single strategy will be enough to assuage the disease burden. Instead, it is the combination of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f different effective measures that will be able to mitigate the enormous consequences of the pandemic 2, 3 .In this study, we report the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing of a large sample of pregnant women screened during antenatal care and a smaller number of women who pursued testing due to symptoms of possible coronavirus infection. We found no positive tests in either group during this low prevalence period, which was consistent with the population estimates at the time. The findings of this study suggest that widespread testing of asymptomatic pregnant women may not be necessary in periods of low community transmission. Additionally, since pregnant women are no more susceptible to infection than others 6, 7, 14 , population prevalence estimates may be reliably extrapolated to pregnant women. In Australia, mitigation measures such as the closure of the borders and restriction rules were implemented relatively early in the pandemic. The early introduction of these measures likely explains the lower prevalence and fatality rates than most other high-income countries. Indeed, of all tests performed in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic, 0.8% were positive 5 . The real positivity (prevalence) rates were likely even lower because community testing has been focussed on those with symptoms, albeit with a progressively lowering threshold for those symptoms.A similar universal screening study performed in New York City examined 215 pregnant women admitted at the time of labour and found that 15.4% of them had a positive result, of whom nearly 88% (29 of 33 with a positive test) were asymptomatic 15 . At that time, the number of reported cases in New York ranged from five to over eleven thousand per day 1 .Similarly, a recently published seroprevalence study in Spain reported that 14% of the women had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies, of whom 40% were symptomatic 16 .In a smaller study in Japan, 52 obstetric patients admitted to the hospital were tested with PCR, and two (3.8%) had positive results without any symptoms 17 . The differences observed between the studies can be explained by the diverse regional prevalence of the disease, with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f much higher asymptomatic community transmission levels in some areas of the United States and of Europe.A second wave of infections has affected Australia and particularly Victoria since our study was conducted, requiring stricter physical distance measures to be implemented. The number of daily cases is decreasing. Although the reassuringly low disease prevalence among pregnant women found in our study may not hold in higher prevalence periods, our findings remain valid to inform policy as Victoria makes its way through the ""roadmap to recovery"" outlined by the State Government. The threshold of community transmission above which testing of asymptomatic childbearing women is warranted remains to be investigated. In the state of Victoria, there are currently 1,008 confirmed active cases 1 . Considering a state population of 6.63 million inhabitants 18 , the prevalence rate of the infection is estimated at 152 per one million inhabitants (as compared to 52 cases per one million inhabitants during the study period). The interpretation of the epidemiology will need to be revisited as the community transmission rates rapidly change with the pandemic dynamics. Our study was conducted between the first and the second infections waves and, although the prevalence found can no longer be considered representative of current disease rates due to markedly increased community transmission, infection rates in pregnancy can still be assumed to be similar to those of the general population. In high prevalence periods, identifying pregnant women who carry the virus is important to allow for treatment of symptomatic individuals, physical isolation of carriers, contact tracing, and implementation of correct PPE to reduce transmission risk during antenatal consultations, laboratory testing, ultrasound examinations and during birth that may involve an aerosol-generating procedure such as maternal effort in the second stage of labour or endotracheal intubation for general anaesthesia (if required) during caesarean deliveries.Our sample represents the population of pregnant women from a large geographical area in metropolitan Melbourne covered by catchments of our three maternity hospitals during a defined period in the constantly changing pandemic. The main limitation of this study is the fact that testing was performed on a limited number of mostly asymptomatic pregnant women as an opt-in test, and at a single point in time. Our sample did, however, include a group of women with potential symptoms of COVID-19, whose test results were negative. A single nasopharyngeal swab may potentially fail to identify a proportion of infected individuals 19 , and it has been suggested that serial testing may be necessary to minimise false-negative results 13 . These issues are, however, less problematic in low prevalence populations, in which the predictive value of a negative result is high, reliably ruling infection out in asymptomatic individuals.In summary, our findings reflect a period of low disease prevalence and suggest that first, the rates of infection among pregnant women are no different from those of the general population and, second, that testing of asymptomatic individuals may not be necessary in periods of low disease prevalence. While screening reliably rules out the disease in low prevalence periods, the costs, harms and benefits of asymptomatic screening need to be carefully weighed considering the rapidly changing landscape of the pandemic in different scenarios, and focussing on testing of symptomatic individuals or subjects who live in disease clusters may be more appropriate.The authors report no conflicts of interest.

For example, various learning theories for online and/or blended parasitology education,including Community of Inquiry [2] , Connectivism [3] and Online Collaborative Learning [4] have been used. Recently, the Blending with Pedagogical Purpose Model [5] has most commonly been used for teaching and learning in parasitology [1] and other disciplines [6] , where students are the learning community and multiple technologies (e.g. learning management systems) and multi-media are utilised to (i) scaffold and deliver the content of subjects/courses; (ii) promote reflective blog journals, with collaboration and peer-to-peer learning among students; and (iii) evaluate student learning. However, the social presence in a learning setting is often achieved by face-to-face teaching and interactions among students, which are key components of a learning environment. In the last two decades, these blended, student-centred learning practices [7] using adaptable digital technologies [8, 9] have become useful tools for effective and engaging parasitology teaching and learning.The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the existing teaching and learning practices from primary schools through to tertiary institutions in almost every country of the world [10] .for veterinary parasitology. Our goal is to share our experiences in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which has brought about great uncertainty and challenges in almost every walk of life. The rapid shift seen across the tertiary education system might be the beginning of a new era in course delivery. The adoption and/or modification of teaching and learning practices tested (out of necessity) during the COVID-19 lockdown may guide or influence the re-design of parasitology curricula.On Tuesday 17 th March 2020, the Melbourne Veterinary School suspended all face-to-face teaching and we, as educators, were given three days to prepare for the online delivery of lectures and practical parasitology classes scheduled the following week. Our Parasitology team at the University of Melbourne has extensive experience in teaching parasitology to animal science and veterinary students. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted new approaches to enhance learning outcomes utilising a combination of conventional face-toface teaching and digital technologies [9] . Through reflective practice and considering the original intended learning outcomes (ILOs), we rapidly adapted the face-to-face lectures and practical classes in parasitology to online modules for Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students (second-and third-year levels within a 4-year degree, 130 students/cohort) andBachelor of Agriculture students (third/final year level, 80 students). In support, the University offered various professional development courses through the Department of Learning Environments i to staff and students to aid with the transition to remote/online teaching. Based on our experiences of online teaching and learning in the field of veterinary parasitology, we have proposed a toolkit (Box 1) for parasitology educators; our teaching J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof module received appreciation from students (supplemental Table S1 ) and academic peers alike.For timely lecture delivery, we uploaded pre-recorded lectures on a learning management system (e.g. Canvas ii ) to allow student self-directed, independent learning and to avoid possible network access issues during live streaming of lectures. Subsequently, we held weekly flipped classroom [9] sessions (i.e. live question and answer (Q&A)) via Zoom iii and used polls iv to provide opportunities for cognitive, social and teaching presence for the online learning experience of students, as per the learning theory of Community of Inquiry [2] . For practical classes, we used a number of approaches and utilised pre-developed resources available online (supplemental Box S1), circumventing the difficulties associated with preparing, at short notice, a semester's worth of high-quality material, especially videos using the Loom application v .Our typical veterinary parasitology practical class involves the identification of a group of parasites, assorted hands-on techniques to isolate and identify parasites in various organs of a range of hosts, and problem-based clinical scenarios for veterinarians. We developed the 3-hour face-to-face practical classes into online modules using various asynchronous and synchronous teaching approaches to encourage deep learning, while promoting student engagement, the interaction between students and teachers and meta-connective pedagogy [12] . For each online practical class, we developed a PowerPoint presentation (supplemental Box S1) which outlined all components of the practical and provided links to external online available resources, and these slides were uploaded on Canvas one week prior to the practical class. The online practical contained an introduction to the class via a 15-20 min live interactive session using Zoom, followed by multiple independent and collaborative sessions for students via breakout rooms in Zoom, ending with a 30 min J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof summary via a live Zoom session using polls. The Zoom breakout room feature allowed student collaboration and lecturers to interact within smaller groups of students (10 per group). Students were also provided with the opportunity to ask questions directly via Zoom unmute, a Zoom chat (typed) as well as through an online discussion page in Canvas. In addition to recorded lectures, the entire practical class was recorded and made available to students via Canvas for later viewing, and for students unable to attend the session, or those that were in another state or country. This method of online delivery of our veterinary parasitology subject received very positive feedback from students (see supplemental Table   S1 ). Additionally, we tried to mimic virtual microscopy sessions by preparing high-quality videos, high-resolution scanning of slides or photography of gross specimens (supplemental Box S1) and presenting them via several user-friendly commercially available platforms vi .The BEST network platform, in particular, is highly interactive as it not only allows a virtual microscopic experience but also permits annotation which is an invaluable tool for both students and teachers. In addition to positive student feedback, the average exam scores for pre-and post-pandemic cohorts was comparable, indicating that the modified methods of content delivery were effective. Strategically targeted questions using flipped classroom approach [9] were also posed to students during the online Q&A sessions/practicals (using a polling application) which allowed live gauging of the level of student understanding. SomeUse existing 'active' resources and specify the parts that need to be viewed.Provide interactive group activities (e.g. online quizzes, polls, discussion boards, subject dedicated Facebook page, etc.) which support peer learning and collaboration.Communicate clear instructions and expectations about the assessment.Emotional openness is a great instructional strategy, so don't hide your feelings and use ""icebreakers"" during teaching and learning activities. For example, ask at the beginning of a lesson ""What is a new skill/interest you have undertaken during isolation?""Use virtual office hours using platforms like Zoom to interact and provide social support to students. This can be a great way to collect student feedback on your online teaching and identify any issues which need immediate addressing.Once you find a teaching style working for you, feel free to repeat it each week until you are back in your classroom!

It is pertinent that readers pursue their own reflection having been challenged, assumingly, by his statements and findings. Instead my comments focus on individualistic stances, which are influenced by belief systems and norms which make new views towards value and success both bound with indifferent difficulties.The value of this editorial should not be defined only by its findings, but also consider that the ability of the field's participants and stakeholders to take the easy road to research is prevalent in our scholarship. Disregarding research because it is replicated sans context or devaluing its findings because it is not easily measured against 'a course grade' is this field's Achilles heel. Part of the challenge in using research today as Kimmons rightfully states, is that there is a lack of impact towards praxeology and by association, to those who practice, and do not subscribe to the most renowned methods of research in the academy. Practitioners are like the ""learning and performance"" emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or paramedics (given a medical analogy) [who all hold] a mixture of experiences and outcomes that create unique know-hows. We ignore their expertise and ask them to adhere to the expectations of the academy to be acknowledged, without us [the academy] understanding how practitioners share their knowledge and expertise. The value of the 5000+ word article to a practitioner or even a policymaker is worthless, if it is not in a form which is readily consumable, and yet there are very few of us that seek to address this need (Bishop et al. 2020) . Furthermore, the intersectionality that exists in any one research agenda is reported by a constrained positionality perspective, leaving us void of rich experiences to teach, design and ultimately learn (Laurillard 2013) . To elaborate, research articles readily present one view of a research context with the understanding that generalization should confound use and relevance of findingsbut they are not…they are presented as best practices and principled guides for implementation. Thus, the realistion is now that the multiple occurrences of force majeures, world crisis's and financial and economic reforms are forcing the field to address these and other issues that matter to the future.The focus on the U.S. trends, is noted by Kimmons (2020) as a limited population to judge the field. Ignoring other geographically-situated definitions, experiences and values, have given birth to a parochial and somewhat insular understanding of the field. Kimmons (2020) also noted an absence in the findings of the tools that we in the field actively use (i.e., Blackboard, Moodle, BrightSpace, Canvas, etc.). A finding that given enough fuel will open research agendas to critique the design and implementation of these same tools. Instead of demanding improvements to these tools, we promote alternatives, a true contradiction of sorts as learning from poor design should not result in discarded solutions but improved iterations. Another area that requires more attention is an analysis of how learning influences performance in our immediate society. We do learn to perform, yet we focus only on the learning that occurs in the education sector, leaving other sectors a brief remark as to their own value within what we determined as ""our"" realm. Our ontological selves (as a field) no longer requires but demands more of us, by the need to acknowledge other geographies and languages, to expand the opportunity for us to seek the unknownunknowns, to create bridges to other sectors, as, we become calm in the discomfort of new paths, being ready to support, achieve, and… Understanding where we have gone wrong is the one thing we know, but actually actioning it in our behaviours, scholarship, curriculum and most importantly our [learning] designs is what we need to do (de Alvarez and Dickson-Deane 2018; Laurillard 2013; Romero-Hall et al. 2021 ). As we continue to march to our own beating drums, the new generation has used the voice that we trained them to have, as a weapon against our own dogma. Here, when we say one thing and yet, still do another -the cycle does not stop…we are at a point where accountability is much more the focus of our future than the action of our past.","Australia","first author","2020-10-22",10

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus responsible for this outbreak as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Nghiem et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . Despite several public health strategies, the daily total number of COVID-19 cases globally has not slowed down (WHO, 2020a) . Eleven months on, this virus has caused 35.5 million illness cases and 1.04 million deaths, as of October 2020 (Worldometer, 2020) .Published studies have reported faecal shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals before and during the onset of symptoms (Lescure et al., 2020; Nghiem et al., 2020; WHO, 2020c; Wu et al., 2020) . Several studies also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools and wastewater (Ahmed et al., 2020; Bogler et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Singer and Wray, 2020) . Given these considerations, there have been concerns about the possibility of indirect or direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via exposure to untreated or treated wastewater (Ashour et al., 2020; Bogler et al., 2020; Cheung et al., 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020) .A Water Environment Federation blue-ribbon panel of experts commissioned to evaluate the safety of wastewater workers during the coronavirus pandemic recommended that studies should be conducted to evaluate respiratory exposure during tasks performed by workers in wastewater collection and treatment (TPO, 2020) . Other independent studies have also called for QMRAs to evaluate respiratory exposure associated with wastewaters (Amoah et al., 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020) . This is particularly relevant to aerosolization of wastewater J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof and thus accidental exposure of wastewater operators to SARS-CoV-2 during daily workplace activities such as manual cleaning, coarse screening, wastewater sampling for microbiological and chemical analysis, and process supervision.Reference pathogens including norovirus, enterovirus and adenovirus were used for QMRAs in relation to WWTP influents (Dada, 2018a (Dada, , 2018b (Dada, , 2019a (Dada, , 2019b (Dada, , 2020a (Dada, , 2020b McBride, 2007 McBride, , 2011 McBride, , 2016a McBride, , 2016b McBride et al., 2013) . Recently, Zaneti et al (2020) applied SARS-CoV-2 as the reference QMRA pathogen considering ingestion via the faecal oral route.There is a dearth of published information on risk assessments focused on coronavirus spread through exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via inhalation. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was used as the reference QMRA pathogen to assess health risks during occupational exposure by inhalation in wastewater treatment environments.Information related to treatment type, population covered and location of each wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was extracted from an online inventory collated during the National Performance Review for 2018. Information from over 300 publicly owned WWTPs in New Zealand was collected and analysed for QMRA purposes.Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are the most prevalent form of wastewater treatment used for treating domestic sewage from small to medium-sized communities in New Zealand (Figure 1 ). WSPs generally encompass three different pond systems: oxidation (mechanical), aerated, and anaerobic ponds (WaterNZ, 2005) . WSPs are used either wholly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof or in combination with other forms of treatment (e.g. aeration lagoons, wetlands, sand filters, membrane filtration, and ultraviolet based disinfection). In terms of populations served by WWTPs, activated sludge (AS) systems are the most popular treatment systems ( Figure 1 ). Activated sludge (AS) systems are also the most widely used biological wastewater treatment process in the developed world (Scholz, 2015) .Pond-based systems are considered as self-sufficient treatment units, because the efficacy of treatment is contingent upon the maintenance of the overall microbial communities (Hosetti et al., 1998; Hosetti and Frost, 1995) , and the proper balance of organics, light, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, algal presence (Amengual-Morro et al., 2012) , and temperature.Because pond-based treatment systems are self-sufficient, there is a reduction in operator responsibilities to manage the treatment unit (Butler et al., 2017; Hosetti et al., 1998) .However, WWTP operators may still be required to perform routine activities including manual cleaning, coarse screening, and wastewater sampling for microbiological and chemical analysis. WWTP operators working with activated sludge systems also perform similar activities. As a result, WWTP operators can be exposed to aerosolized form of SARS-CoV-2 via wind or mechanically generated aeration. The formation of wastewater aerosols and droplets was confirmed as a key mechanism for faecal-droplet-respiration transmission during previous coronavirus outbreaks and is suspected in the current COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Ding et al., 2020; Gormley et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2004) . Aerosolized human coronaviruses remain viable for up to 16 hours (Fears et al., 2020; Van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Although dispersal of larger droplets is limited, as they deposit close to the source, larger droplets can cause local contamination of surfaces due to their enhanced capacity to ii. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in raw wastewater;iii. How much aerosolized water a WWTP operator will inhale during a working day;iv. Humidity and temperature-dependent viability of coronaviruses in aerosolized form; and, v. Estimation of the amount, frequency, length of time of exposure, and doses for exposure (see Table 1 ).SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater that arrive at the WWTP This study assumes a conservative stance in which all individuals who have been previously or are currently infected (symptomatic or asymptomatic) continue to shed the virus in their stools. One of the key factors influencing the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater is the concentration of virus shed by infected individuals (Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) .Literature has shown concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in stool of infected individual ranged between 1.7 x 10 6 to 4.1 x 10 7 genome copies (Han et al. 2020 in Amoah et al. 2020 . In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof accordance with previous WWTP QMRA reports and international literature (e.g. McBride 2016a,b), median (1.7 x 10 6 genomes per mL) and maximum (4.1 x 10 7 genomes per mL) stool virus concentrations were bounded in the hockey-stick distribution in such a way that the resulting data are strongly right-skewed with a hinge at the 95 th percentile. This therefore presents, in the same population, the generally predominant lower virus concentrations (i.e. having higher probabilities) alongside the extreme concentrations (which may be rare, but substantial).Generally, some levels of dilution occur given that greywater and other forms of wastewater become mixed with stools once flushed down the toilet. Two scenarios were thus considered.I. No dilution scenario: Stools from individuals shedding SARS-CoV-2, flushed down the toilet, are not diluted at all and reach the WWTP as influent. It was assumed to contain SARS-CoV-2 concentrations of most likely between 1.7 x 10 6 genomes per mL (median) and 4.1 x 10 7 genomes per mL (maximum) (i.e. dilution factor = 1).Dilution scenario: The average person passes about 30 mL of stool a day for every five kilograms of body weight. This translates to approximately 192 to 510 mL of stool per individual. Typically, the amount of water used in the toilet for one full flush is 6L. That is, for every single toilet use per individual shedding SARS-CoV-2, the concentration is diluted roughly 12 to 31 times. A dilution factor (stool_DF) distributed between 12 and 31 was therefore included in the modelling.Prevalence-dependent SARS-CoV-2 loading Three different scenarios (low, moderate and aggressive), representing different proportions of the population infected with the virus, were applied in this study. Low outbreak, moderate outbreak, and aggressive outbreak scenarios assume that 0.03%, 0.3% and 3%, respectively, of the population being served by a WWTP are infected and are shedding SARS-CoV-2 in their stools.Given this consideration, the virus concentration expected at the WWTP is:Where is the number of individuals infected in a population being served by a WWTP, is the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the stools of infected individuals, _ is the total population being served by a WWTP, _ is the stool dilution factor.Virus reductions achieved before and during treatment at the WWTP The final virus concentrations in WWTP wastewater on a random day were then subjected to varying log removals (depending on the wastewater treatment scenario considered) before they were incorporated into the QMRA. It was assumed that before aerosolization, human coronaviruses in raw wastewater and the residual coronavirus concentrations following treatment all remain viable.Given these considerations, the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration in wastewater for each WWTP treatment scenario is therefore:Where log is 1, 10, 100, 1000-and 10,000-fold reduction respectively for 0,1,2,3 and 4 log-removals achieved during treatment at the WWTP.Among the meteorological factors, humidity (relative humidity; RH and absolute humidity; AH) and temperature play an important role in the viability status of coronaviruses in the air.Published literature has shown that 60% of coronaviruses in droplets or aerosols remain infectious for up to an hour at a RH of 79% at 25 0 C but at a higher temperature and lower RH of 38 0 C and 24%, less than 5% remained infectious. Recent studies have also suggested that AH rather than RH modulates virus survival (Deyle et al., 2016; McDevitt et al., 2010; Shaman and Kohn, 2009; Shaman et al., 2010 Where AH is absolute humidity in gm-3, RH is relative humidity in percent and T is in 0 C, applicable over a temperature range of -40 to 50 0 C, and:Viability of aerosolized coronavirus (%) = −0.0515 * AH + 2.0487Given these considerations, the viable concentration of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 is therefore given as: (Dorevitch et al., 2011; Dufour et al., 2006; Haas et al., 1999) to arrive at minimum, mode and maximum associated volumetric intake rates of 10, 50 and 100 mL for ingestion associated with primary contact. In this study, it was assumed that WWTP operators would be physically present at the WWTP vicinity for a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof median and maximum period of 4 and 8 hours on any random day, with associated volumetric intake rates of 2, 10 and 20 mL per hour (Table 1) Carlo simulation is a randomization method that applies multiple random sampling from distributions assigned to key input variables in a model, in a way that incorporates the uncertainty profiles of each key input variable into the uncertainty profile of the output.Typically, in a Monte Carlo model run, 100 individuals who do not have prior knowledge of existing contamination in the wastewater and who do not wear protective nose coverings are 'exposed' to potentially infectious aerosolised pathogens on a given day and this exposure is repeated 1,000 times. Therefore, the total number of exposures is 100,000. The result of the analysis is a full range of possible risks, including average and worst-case scenarios, associated with exposure to pathogens during the identified recreational activities. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken using @Risk software (Palisade, NY).QMRA results are reported in terms of illness, assuming a conservative stance in which every single infection leads to illness. The predicted risk is reported as the IIR (individual illness risk), calculated as the total number of illness cases divided by the total number of exposures, and is expressed as a percentage. The IIR is then compared with a threshold of 1 illness per 1000 exposed individuals as specified in the WHO interim guidance document.This threshold is considered the no observable adverse effects level (NOAEL).Presented in Figure 4a there would be no more than one illness case among 100 WWTP operators accidentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, via inhalation at the WWTP environment, on any random day during low grade outbreak conditions (i.e. 0.03% of the population served by the WWTP is infected). In comparison, 95% of the time, there would be no more than three illness cases recorded during moderate outbreak conditions (i.e. 0.3% of the population served by the WWTP is infected). During aggressive outbreak conditions (i.e. when 3% of the population served by the WWTP is infected), the risk profiles are markedly higher with up 14 illness cases predicted among 100 WWTP operators accidentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, via inhalation at the WWTP environment, 95% of the time on any random day (Figure 4c ). These elevated risks would also remain if, during conditions of aggressive outbreak, WWTP operators were exposed to partially treated wastewater in processing units where wastewater virus reductions of less than 1log had been achieved (Figure 4c ).Cumulatively, in terms of averaged-out illness risk profiles, the individual illness risks for low J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f grade, moderate and aggressive outbreak scenarios, respectively, are 0.691, 6.8 and 62.4illness cases per 1000 individuals (Figure 4a-c) .In the more realistic scenario where dilution of the stool with toilet flush water was included in the risk assessment (Figure 4d) , 99% of the time there would be no illness case among 100 WWTP operators accidentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, via inhalation at the WWTP environment, on any random day during low-grade outbreak conditions (i.e. 0.03% of the population served by the WWTP is infected). However, 99% of the time, there would be no more than 1 and 4 illness cases, respectively, per 100 exposed WWTP operators during moderate and aggressive outbreak conditions (Figure 4e-f ). Cumulatively, in terms of averaged-out illness risk profiles, the individual illness risks for low-grade, moderate and aggressive outbreak scenarios respectively are 0.036, 0.32 and 3.21 illness cases per 1000 exposed WWTP operators (Figure 4d-f ).This study was conducted in response to concerns that populations at greatest risk in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be WWTP operators who may be exposed to raw wastewater. Our study is the first ever QMRA study that has assessed the potential level of occupational exposure of WWTP operators to SARS-CoV-2 via inhalation. This study is also the second QMRA study published that has assessed the potential level of occupational exposure of WWTP operators to SARS-CoV-2. A previously published QMRA report (Zaneti et al., 2020) (2020) study also did not include consideration of contaminated surfaces in the modelling, despite these sources being potential vital links in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 through the oral route. Our study is an improvement upon the first QMRA report in that it focuses on human health risks during accidental inhalation of aerosolized forms of the wastewater.In selecting QMRA input parameters, this QMRA included considerations for most of the factors that have been suggested as crucial to the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the WWTP environment (Amoah et al., 2020) . In addition to inhalation rate and exposure time, this study also included considerations of humidity and temperature-dependent survival of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosolized form based on a viability model for influenza viruses (Kong et al., 2020) .The influenza viability model applied to estimate humidity and temperature-dependent survival of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 is justified because it has been detected in patients with influenza-like illness (Kong et al., 2020) .This study also adds to the body of scholarly literature in that it considers the assessment of occupational health risks associated with accidental exposure to SARS-CoV-2 following logremovals that are typically achieved in WWTPs. The observation that risk profiles were highest for raw wastewater but generally reduced with increasing orders of log reduction is expected.Overall, in the more realistic scenario where dilution of the stool with toilet flush water was included in the risk assessment, our results show cumulative illness risk (mean) was less than 1 per 1000 exposures for low-grade and moderate outbreak scenarios.. This indicates that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof the risks of accidental occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, via inhalation at the WWTP environment are negligible. It is, however, important to mention that in terms of the upper limit (i.e. 99 th percentile), a low level of risk was observed. These predicted health risks, however, only occur during extreme values of the QMRA input components were used. For instance, a WWTP operator exposed to raw or partially treated wastewater for 8 hours continuously that is very unlikely unless WWTP staff are manually ).There was still uncertainty as to whether these viral RNA detection rates actually correlate with the presence of infectious virus. In a recent study (Wölfel et al., 2020) , high concentrations (up to 10 8 ) of viral fragments similar to those in sputum were reported based on 13 stool samples taken within 12 days from 4 patients. Unlike the case for sputum, an attempt to grow SARS-CoV-2 from stool was not successful. However, contrasting results were published in another study where SARS-CoV-2 was successfully cultured from faeces of a critically ill patient in China (Xiao et al., 2020) . While the number of samples analysed in this study is very small (n=3), it points to the possibility of the RNA in faeces being infective. Wölfel et al. (2020) submitted that more studies would be needed to address whether SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool is rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment.Given this possibility of infectivity of RNA viruses in stools, albeit at levels not currently known, it was considered safe to assume in this QMRA that all viral RNA in stool was infectious.This QMRA also excluded opportunities for dilution of stools from infected individuals; hence it involved higher SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the raw wastewater that reached the WWTP. Generally, in addition to the levels of dilution that occur at the toilet level (i.e. with toilet flush water), more dilution can occur within the sewerage system. For instance, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f greywater and other forms of wastewater (e.g. from baths, sinks, washing machines, and other kitchen appliances) from houses connected to reticulated sewerage systems become mixed with the stools once flushed down the toilet, en route to the WWTP. As the available literature suggests that dish, shower, sink, and laundry water comprise 50-80% of residential wastewater (Al-Jayyousi, 2003) , higher dilution possibilities indicate that the reported risks in this QMRA may be overstated.It should be noted that the coronavirus dose response models used in this study was based on an infection endpoint, as reported by Watanabe et al. (2010) . In our study, we have assumed a worst-case scenario where every infected individual becomes ill. In reality, infection may not necessarily progress to illness. For instance, while healthy individuals may not necessarily become ill, the elderly and immune-compromised citizens may present with a different response effect for the same dose of SARS-CoV-2. Even among the healthy, differential immunity status may exist (McBride et al., 2013) .Although this study also considered risks following treatment at the WWTP, this study did not focus on a specific wastewater treatment but used a more generalizable range of treatments. that could be potentially achieved at various WWTPs in New Zealand and elsewhere. These included scenarios for virus removal (i.e. raw wastewater) as well as 1,2,3, and 4 log virus removals equivalent to 10, 100,1000 and 10,000-fold reductions in viral loads, respectively. These represent the range of virus log reductions that have been associated with various forms of wastewater treatment, e.g. 1 log 10 in wastewater pond treatment systems (Verbyla et al (2015) ) and between 2-4 log 10 removals in activated sludge and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f membrane bioreactor systems (De Luca et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2009; Zhang and Farahbakhsh, 2007) .More studies are still needed to characterize SARS-CoV-2 in the faeces of active and recovered individuals. Stool virus concentrations and infectivity analysis of a larger sampling scale would be useful to improve the quality of future QMRAs. Care should be exercised to ensure a harmonization of laboratory-generated genomic concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and doses applied in future QMRAs. For instance, while the coronavirus dose response model in Watanabe et al. (2010) was based on plaque-forming units, there may be multiple virus particles for each PFU as viral particles that are defective or which fail to infect their target cell will not produce a plaque and thus will be inadvertently excluded from the plaque count.Our study suggests that the risk of accidental occupational exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater via inhalation at the WWTP environment is low. Despite the highly conservative stance that this QMRA adopts, generally low individual illness risks were predicted during low-grade and moderate outbreak conditions (when less than 0.03% and 0.3% respectively, of the population served by a WWTP are actively infected).

Around this time, Australian states and territories went into ""lockdown,"" closing ""nonessential"" services. Several states and territories began relaxing restrictions in June as the number of infections and active cases decreased in late May and June. Victoria reintroduced a lockdown of nonessential services and closed its border in early July 2020 following an increase in the number of cases. Initial framings of COVID-19 positioned the virus as particularly harmful to older populations while young people were seen as ""not at risk."" However, young people have been just as susceptible to coronavirus. While young people are less likely to die from the virus, they have similar infection rates to older people and in Australia, the number of cases amongst Australians aged between 20 and 29 are the highest of any age group (Australian Department of Health, 2020). Just as harmful is the social and economic impact of coronavirus on young Australians. This is particularly true of young women who are at a higher risk of both being infected by coronavirus and suffering economically from the associated lockdowns. This is the impetus of this study.Since February 2020, there have been almost 800,000 Australian jobs lost due to . In response to the economic fallout, the Australian government introduced a wage subsidy scheme, JobKeeper, on March 30 for businesses who experienced a 30%-50% reduction in turnover. The JobKeeper payment is a flat rate of $1500 paid to employers per worker per fortnight and covers only permanent full-time and part-time workers and casual employees who had held their job for over 12 months (Australian Treasury, 2020) . The government also announced a JobSeeker payment for short-term casuals who lost their job paid at a lower amount of $550. In August 2019, there were an estimated 1 million casual employees in Australia who had been with their current employer for less than 1 year (Parliamentary Library, 2020) . Just over 26% of young people aged between 15 and 24 are more likely to be causal workers and employed with their current employer for less than 12 months. This is more than four times the proportion of casual employees over the age of 25 (Parliamentary Library, 2020) .Casualization is endemic in industries that tend to employ young people. Young male workers are concentrated in construction, manufacturing, and retail while young female workers are overly concentrated in health care, retail, and accommodation services (Junankar, 2015) . Over 46% of casual employees in the accommodation and food services industry had been employed for less than 12 months and over 36% of employees in retail and 33% of employees in arts and recreation had been employed for less than 12 months. These are the industries that have been hit hardest since COVID-19-related restrictions have been put into place. Arts and recreation services and accommodation and food services have declined by about 35% and 24%, respectively (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2020). Thus, many young people have not only lost their jobs because of the industries they have been employed in, but they have also been ineligible for the higher-paying wage subsidy. This is a familiar story. Accommodation, retail, and arts were industries that were significantly affected by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. While the GFC impacted most countries, Australia was largely left unscathed with the exception of young people. Prior to the GFC, youth unemployment was at 8.8%, which was close to the lowest youth unemployment rate on record in the 1970s. In 2015, some 8 years after the crisis, it was around 13.6% (Bowman, Borlagdan, & Bond, 2015) . While conventional wisdom has long held that young people are the first to lose their jobs in recessionary times they also tend to ""experience a faster and stronger turnaround when economic conditions improve"" (Bowman et al., 2015) . However, evidence has suggested that the GFC has cast a long shadow on youth unemployment both in Australia (Denny & Churchill, 2016) and globally. Youth unemployment has become an insurmountable problem for governments who have either neglected the issue or have 2 -CHURCHILL implemented policy programs which have failed to address the systemic issue. While both the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Organisation for the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) argued in 2014 that stronger employment growth was the solution for youth unemployment, jobs growth since the financial crisis had advantaged older workers over their younger counterparts (Churchill, Denny, & Jackson, 2014) . Furthermore, it has taken almost 10 years for the proportion of the youth population in employment to recover to pre-GFC levels (Borland, 2020) . It is no surprise that during this period, the gig economy has become an alternative for young people looking for work or looking for more hours (Churchill & Craig, 2019) . How long a shadow COVID-19 casts upon young people is unknown but it is very likely to be just as long as the GFC. This study examines the immediate impact of COVID-19 on young people in Australia and their employment. It uses the GFC as a counterpoint to compare and contrast the impact of COVID-19 on young people.The study also takes on another comparative dimension by taking a gendered lens, comparing young men and women as the economic impact of COVID-19 has engendered a very gendered impact. Young women are more at risk of getting coronavirus than their young male counterparts. Indeed, young women aged between 20 and 29 have the highest coronavirus infection rates in the country (Australian Department of Health, 2020).But they also face other risks. Young women were not doing well before COVID-19 (Ravn & Churchill, 2019) in terms of labor market outcomes and this is despite the fact that Australia ranks number one in the world in terms of educational participation for women (World Economic Forum, 2019) . The Australian labor market is heavily gender segregated (WGEA, 2019) and thus they are more likely to be on the frontline as essential workers putting them even more at risk of being exposed to coronavirus (Cooper & Mosseri, 2020) . Young women are also more likely to be employed in the industries and occupations that have been most severely impacted by COVID-19, such as accommodation and food services, retail, health care, and social assistance, in which women make up more than half of this workforce. Furthermore, young women are more likely to be in casual employment in these industries and thus ineligible for JobKeeper (Cassells & Duncan, 2020) .COVID-19 has also reinforced how critical care work-both paid and unpaid-is to the functioning of societies (Özkazanç-Pan & Pullen, 2020) . Both the demands and burden of this work, lopsidedly done by women, have only increased since COVID-19 (Craig & Churchill, 2020) . While men have increased the amount of time spent actively caring for and supervising children, the gap between men and women still remains. Furthermore, COVID-19 has done little to attenuate the gender gap in domestic labor (Craig & Churchill, 2020) . This latest wave of the care crisis has meant that managing the demands of both work and family has only become more difficult. This is especially true in the case of women (and men) who have lost childcare as lockdowns have closed formal childcare centers and kept informal caregivers quarantined away. To accommodate these disruptions, mothers have been scaling back their employment. This is particularly true of those with young school-aged children who have reduced their work time significantly (Collins, Landivar, Ruppanner, & Scarborough, 2020) . Fathers' time in paid employment, on the other hand, appears to be relatively unaffected (Collins et al., 2020) . While there has been no explicit attention paid to young women and care work during the pandemic, we can expect that like their older counterparts they too have been similarly affected. One in every 15 young persons between the ages of 15 and 24 is a young carer of which women make up the majority (ABS, 2018).The economic policy response to COVID-19 in Australia has largely ignored the gendered dimensions of COVID-19 and instead has focused on ""shovel ready projects"" (Australian Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communication, 2020)-infrastructure projects like road maintenance and new rail lines, which overwhelmingly favor men because of the highly gender-segregated nature of the Australian labor market (Hill, 2020; WGEA, 2019) . While this type of response worked well during the GFC, which significantly blunted its impact, the economic impact of COVID-19 is different in that it is women who have been overwhelming CHURCHILL -3affected. There has been little policy attention in terms of labor market opportunities for women and highly feminized industries like higher education, which face significant pressures during COVID-19 and have not received any government assistance. The free, universal childcare, which is critical to maintaining female labor force participation, offered by the Federal government during the peak of the crisis ended in June 2020 and was replaced with a new subsidy scheme which parents must pay a fee for, which acts as a barrier to labor force participation (Hill, 2020) . This is despite evidence which suggests that investment in social infrastructure, not physical infrastructure, not only generates better economic recovery but a more gender equal recovery (Hill, 2020 ).To assess the immediate impact of COVID-19 on young men and women and their employment, this study draws upon labor force data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This study uses detailed monthly labor data taken from the Labour Force Survey, which is a national survey of all people aged 15 years and over (see ABS, 2020, for more details). The variables of interest in the detailed monthly labor data are the following: (i) participation in the labor force rate (both full-time and part-time employment), (ii) unemployment rate, and (iii) underemployment rate.The underemployment rate is derived by calculating the number of unemployed persons as a proportion of the total labor force (unemployed and employed). Here, unemployment is defined as all persons aged 15 years and over who were not employed during the reference week, who actively looked for work, including full-or part-time work at any time in the 4 weeks up to the end of the reference week and were available to start work in the reference week or were waiting to commence a new job within a 4-week period from the end of the reference week and were able to start in the reference week if the job was available to start. The underemployment rate is the number of underemployed workers expressed as a proportion of the total labor force. Here, underemployment refers to time-related underemployment, specifically people who would prefer to work more hours than they currently have.These workers may be part-time who would like to work more hours or full-time workers who worked part-time hours in the reference week and would prefer to work more hours.As Table 1 illustrates, men aged between 15 and 19 have had the lowest labor force participation rates of all age groups over the last 20 years. In January 2000, the labor force participation rates for men aged 15-19 and 20-24 were 61% and 87.6%, respectively. The participation rates for men over the age of 25 were similar to the rates of men aged between 20 and 24. In July 2008, just before the onset of the GFC, the rate for 15-to 19-year-old men had decreased to 57.8% and the rate for 20-to 24-year-olds remained steady. A month later as the crisis was underway, the labor force participation for 15-to 19-year-olds was down 3.4 percentage points in a month (to 54.4%) and down 1.1 percentage points for 20-to 24-year-olds (82.9%). The participation rate for 15-to 19-yearold men rebounded to 57% in September and October before returning to 54% in November 2008. From July to November 2008, the decrease for young men aged between 15 and 19 was 3.7 percentage points. For 20-to 24year-old men, the participation rate rebounded to 84.5% in September before going back down to around 82% in October and November 2008. The decrease in participation amongst men aged between 20 and 24 from July to November 2008 was 1.4 percentage points. In contrast, the labor force participation for older men aged 25 and above on average increased by 0.1 percentage points although there was some variation across age groups, for example, men in their 30s experienced a decrease of around 0.8 percentage points but men in their early 40s experienced an increase of 0.7 percentage points from July to November 2008.Moving to February 2020 just as the pandemic was beginning, the labor force participation rates for 15-to 19and 20-to 24-year-old men were 54.3% and 82.5%, respectively, decreasing to 46.4% and 77.1%, respectively, by June 2020 after reaching lows of 44.2% for 15-to 19-year-olds and 73.2% for 20-to 24-year-olds. Across the period, these changes accounted for a decrease of around 7.9 percentage points for 15-to 19-year-old men and 5.4percentage points for 20-to 24-year-old men across the period. This is significantly bigger than the decrease during the GFC. Those who were aged between 25 and 29 also experienced a decrease of around 1.5 percentage points from January to May 2020. In contrast, the decrease between February 2020 and June 2020 was around 3 percentage points for those aged between 30 and 44 years of age. The decrease across the rest of the age groups was around 1.3 percentage points.In Table 2 , the labor force participation rates show that in contrast to men, it has generally been older women who had had the lowest labor force participation rates. Focusing on young women, aged between 15 and 19 and T A B L E 1 Male labor force participation rates, by age group, January 2000-June 2020 (%) and 76% for 20-to 24-year-old women. Between July and November 2008, the decrease in participation rates for young women was around 2.5 percentage points. In contrast, women aged between 25 and 64 experienced either no change or small increases of around 1-2 percentage points during the period.Moving to February 2020 just as the pandemic was beginning, the participation rates for 15-to 19-and 20-to 24-year-old women were 57.8% and 81.5%, respectively, decreasing to 44.1% and 72.7% by May. There was a rebound in June 2020 as parts of the Australian economy rebounded but participation was still 9.1 percentage points lower for 15-to 19-year-old women and 6.2 percentage points lower for 20-to 24-year-old women when compared to February 2020 participation rates. Women aged between 25 and 29 also suffered a decline of about 4.5 percentage points across the period. Comparatively, the declines in labor force participation for older women were significantly less, averaging about 1.4 percentage points.Men's unemployment rates for the last 20 years for the working age population are presented in 5-year age groups in In Table 5 , the male underemployment rate for the last 20 years is presented. As the figure illustrates, underemployment is largely an issue for young men. At the beginning of the Millennium, the underemployment rate for young men aged between 15 and 24 was 9.4%, which is 4.6 percentage points higher than the general In February 2020, the underemployment rate for men aged between 15 and 24 was 15.4%. By April 2020, the underemployment rates for men aged between 15 and 24 increased to 21.6%, declining to 18.2%. This amounted to an increase of 2.8 percentage points between February and June 2020. Increases in the underemployment rate for older men were somewhere between 5% and 6%. This is largely because the base underemployment rate amongst older men was lower than younger men.In Table 6 , the female underemployment rate for the last 20 years is presented. Like their male counterparts, underemployment has become an issue mainly for young women. At the beginning of the Millennium, the underemployment rate for young women aged between 15 and 24 was 12.7%. It was significantly lower for women aged between 25 and 34 (5.7%). The underemployment rate for older women aged between 35 and 54 was at around 8%. In July 2008 just before the GFC, the underemployment rate was up to 12.9% for women aged between 15 and 24 and 6% for women aged between 25 and 34. The underemployment rate in August 2008 went up by 1 percentage point for the 15-to 24-year-old women and remained largely flat for women 25-34. ByNovember 2008, the underemployment rate was at 14% for 15-to 24-year-old women and 5.6% for 25-to 34-year-olds.Moving to the beginning of 2020, the underemployment rate for women aged between 15 and 24 was 20.1%.It was around 8.5% for women in older age groups. By February 2020, the underemployment rate was 21.5% for 15-to 24-year-old women; 8.6% for women 25-34. By June 2020, the rate had actually decreased by 0.5 percentage points for 15-to 24-year-old women, but was up 2.63 percentage points to 11.2% for women between 25 and 34. Using high-quality data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, this study explored how COVID-19 has impacted young men's and women's labor market participation. Critically, these data show the deleterious impact of COVID-19 and the associated economic fallout on young Australians. Across all measures-labor force participation, unemployment, and underemployment-younger Australians were significantly impacted more so relative to older age groups. There are two possible explanations for this. First, it reflects the labor market position of young people prior to COVID-19, which has been slowly deteriorating since the 1970s (Cuervo & Wyn, 2011) andhastened by the GFC. It also likely reflects the availability of wage subsidies like JobKeeper, which likely advantages older age groups who are less likely to be casual and thus keeping them more attached to their employers and thus not looking for employment. It also is further evidence of how the system's design, which excludes those who have not been with their employer for 12 months, has impacted young people who have higher rates of unemployment.Like other economic downturns, the economic fallout resulting from COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures has pushed young people out of the workforce (Bowman et al., 2015) . However, relative to the GFC, the impact of COVID-19 on young people has been significantly worse. This is troubling as the GFC only affected young people and in the years following the crisis, the youth labor market further deetiolated as older women and migrants took up labor market opportunities at the expense of younger men and women (Churchill et al., 2014) . The effects of the GFC on young people are a warning sign to what might happen to young people both during and after COVID-19. The impact may be much worse given that COVID-19 has affected all age groups, not just the young. The impact has also been more gender-even than the GFC in that women have been just as affected as the men. This is in contrast to the GFC, which mostly affected young men, resulting in declines in labor force participation and increases in unemployment and underemployment.While women have been impacted, the effects of COVID-19 on women have varied. The findings suggest that COVID-19 can erode both advantages and gains made by women in the labor market in recent decades. While the youngest group of women in the labor market still outperform their male counterparts in terms of labor force participation, the gender gap which was 6.4 percentage points at the start of 2020 was reduced to 2.3 percentage points in June 2020. This is because the decline in participation was greater amongst young women (9.1 percentage points) than young men (7.9 percentage points). This was, however, not the case for young women in their 20s. The declines in labor force participation amongst women in their 20s were higher than their male counterparts, indicating that these women have been pushed out of the labor market. This is critical given that a significant proportion of women in this age band are likely to be tertiary graduates who are either entering the labor market for the first time or are newly graduated in their first jobs. This may have significant effects on their future labor force participation, careers, and family formation. It is also likely that these declines for women, especially in their 20s, reflect their position outside of the labor market. Women have significant care responsibilities, even young women (ABS, 2018), which significantly impact upon their labor force participation. This echoes what Collins et al. (2020) found that women with care responsibilities significantly reduced their hours in paid employment during COVID-19 whereas men's hours in paid employment were unaffected.While unemployment remained higher for younger men, reflecting their lower participation rates, the increases in unemployment rates have been higher for younger women. This is likely because young women are over-represented in industries that have been most exposed to the economic fallout during COVID-19, such as accommodation and food services, retail, and arts and recreation services (ABS, 2020). These industries contain a higher proportion of lower quality jobs, which tend to disappear quickly during downturns (Khushi & McManus, 2017; Williams & Tait, 2011) . Furthermore, these types of industries are not particularly ""family friendly,"" especially during COVID-19, and are not easily done from home. Thus, even if there were not as many job losses, the nature of these industries makes it impossible for women to keep their jobs if they have caring responsibilities.CHURCHILL -9Beyond job losses, the increase in unemployment appears to signal that women are putting themselves on the labor market in greater numbers as COVID-19 goes on. While it has been a long-held idea that some women retreat from the labor market (usually to the home, becoming ""inactive"") during recessions, more recent research has shown that following the GFC, women did not retreat (Rubery & Rafferty, 2013) . This has been attributed to changes in women's stronger connection to the labor market in recent times, their commitment to their careers, and also policy supports and welfare arrangements (Rubery & Rafferty, 2013) . These ideas can be extended perhaps to young Australian women who want to maintain the high labor force participation rates they enjoyed before the crisis. Young Australian women also want more hours. While this has always been the case, the desire for more has increased significantly during COVID-19. Over one-in-five Australian women want more hours (higher than men in the same age group) and during the height of COVID-19, it was one-in-four. This finding taken together with earlier findings about unemployment suggest that young women are underutilized and perhaps further reflects the idea that young Australian women want to maintain their position in the labor market.Young people are neither immune from coronavirus nor the economic fallout. Compared with their older counterparts, young people's participation in the labor force has gone down and both un-and underemployment have risen significantly. Compared with the GFC, in which the youth labor market has just ""recovered"" from, the impact is likely to be significantly worse, suggesting that the recovery from this downturn will be deeper and longer. Unlike the GFC, COVID-19 is also impacting those in their early to late-20s, suggesting a broader impact too. While successive Australian governments have largely ignored the youth unemployment problem, they will need to tend to this to ensure that young Australians live up to the idea that young people bounce back from recessions better and quicker than their older counterparts. Highly conditional wage subsidy schemes like JobKeeper have the ability to create two cohorts of young people-those who stayed attached to their jobs with financial certainty and those without who become underutilized and marginal. Further, governments will also need to pay attention to the gendered consequences of COVID-19. Some of the gains women have made in terms of labor participation are being eroded, especially those women in their 20s. This would compound the already pressing conundrum of women's economic opportunities in Australia in which they are highly educated but significantly underemployed.Governments will need more than ""shovel-ready"" projects to mediate these impacts for young women. If they fail to do this, the economic recovery will be uneven and these women, who are at a critical period in their lives, will lose out. This will have scarring effects, which not only disadvantage these young women across their lives but also governments who are losing a significant part of the future skilled workforce. Thus, governments need to invest in industries that will bring women back into the labor market, not just construction or large infrastructure projects which favor men. They also need to invest in social infrastructure like childcare which helps women maintain higher levels of labor force participation, but also brings dividends economically for both men and women (Hill, 2020) .Finally, women, in particular, young women, are underutilized and their successes in education are not being capitalized on. Engaging high-skilled and qualified women may be one pathway to higher productivity and a pathway out of the economic fallout.The data that support the findings of this study are openly available at the Australian Bureau of Statistics at http:// www.abs.gov.au, reference number 6291.0.55.003.https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3625-4574 10 -CHURCHILL","Australia","first author","2020-10-31",10

As the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) (2) was asked to create a new EQA for the serological lateral flow PoCT devices that were being evaluated as suitable devices to assist in the protection of high risk populations, for example aged care facilities and hospitals. The normal process described above may take 12 months but this new EQA was required in a few weeks. POCT is not widely used in Australia outside of laboratory networks, but these new PoCT devices would be deployed into areas without laboratory oversight. They would be introduced into an environment without the normal quality framework in which other EQAs are used. The 10 most frequently cited deficiencies in POCT (3) are: 1) Failure to perform quality control testing, 2) document QC activities, 3) follow manufacturer's instructions explicitly, 4) document personnel training and competency, 5) document and take appropriate corrective action for control outliers, 6) failure to perform proficiency testing or external quality assessment schemes, 7) have a procedure manual for testing and result reporting, 8) perform and document calibration verification at least every 6 months, 9) verify accuracy for analytes not included in a PT program, and 10) provide for continuing education for testing personnel.To address these potential errors Martin et al (4) have described a quality framework consisting of device validation/verification, operator training, inventory management, QC and EQA procedures, competence assessment, record maintenance and governance. However, this framework has at its heart a high level of governance and training of the PoCT operator. The requirements for the EQA were that suitable material to identify poor performance was used, the process of performing and recording the EQA results was simple and intuitive, there was rapid turnaround of the results and support was available.What is described in this paper is the rapid development and deployment of an EQA program for serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specifically designed for staff with low levels of training and direct supervision. The aim of the EQA was to be as simple and error free as possible in the areas of registration, data entry, assessment, feedback, and supervisor monitoring.The requirement to deliver an EQA to an entirely new cohort of users within such a short timeframe created unique demands on both the delivery process and the application design. The time required to extend RCPAQAP's existing EQA infrastructure to support this program would have been prohibitive, and the existing platform may have posed challenges for unfamiliar users outside of the laboratory context. For these reasons, a separate system was designed and delivered independently from RCPAQAP's existing EQA platform. This system was built on the Heroku cloud platform as a service (PaaS), allowing rapid prototyping, deployment, and scaling to many customers, without specialised infrastructure expertise.In addition to faster application delivery, the lack of existing constraints in a new system also allowed the design to be tailored specifically to point-of-care users. Recognising the additional stress these users would be under during exceptional conditions, the application was designed with as few prompts as possible. Reducing the required user interactions reduces the chances of data entry errors and decision fatigue. The desire to allow users to run the application on their personal devices needed a lightweight and responsive technical design so that the user-experience would be fast and reliable on both desktop platforms and low-power mobile devices using low-speed network connections.To make the process of recording the EQA results intuitive and straightforward, some affordances were made. To avoid unnecessary complexity identifying participants, no credentials are required from users. Instead, users are pre-registered and begin by scanning a QR code on the sample instructions using the camera on their mobile device. In case the user is unable to scan the QR code, an alphanumeric code -carefully designed to avoid ambiguous characters -can be manually entered to identify the sample. The participant then selects from a list of pre-registered test kits using large and clear touch targets to reduce the chance of mis-selection (Figure 1) . By selecting the test kit in the first step, the app can prompt the participant only for measurands available on the device they have. The results of these measurands are then entered by the participant using large touch targets, along with lot number and operator details. Where possible, operator details are auto filled by the device to minimise the required data entry. Along with this data, the user is prompted to upload a photo of the test kit showing the test result. On supported devices, the user can access their camera directly from the application.To expedite the turnaround of the results, multiple stages of feedback are provided (Figure 1 ). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Immediately after submission, the participant is given a provisional assessment to provide initial real-time feedback on their performance. Submitted results including the uploaded photo are then presented to RCPAQAP staff as part of a rapid review workflow, to verify the user-entered result and check for transposed results or other recording errors ( Figure 2 ). As a suitably large corpus of result photos is collected, this review workflow can be enhanced by machine learning algorithms for automatic verification. If the interpretation is assessed as valid, a performance certificate is issued, and the participant is notified by email (Figure 3 ). The application has been designed to allow RCPAQAP to scale the customer enrolment process, sample management, and logistics to allow for the higher EQA sample volumes potentially required for COVID-19. Devices and users can be enrolled in bulk using a csv file supplied by the participating organisation or enrolled by RCPAQAP staff. The application allows samples to be registered along with expected results for the measuring platform and the sample and customer are linked at the time of enrolment with the QR code. The platform needed to account for rapid changes in the availability of testing platforms, so new testing platforms can be added and are immediately available to customers, even if a sample has already been dispatched.Simplified, consumer-oriented user guides were designed to supply the unique QR code and lead users through the testing process. Text was minimised to essential handling and testing procedures, and a 24-hour support line was implemented to provide support for testing and follow-up actions in the event of a failure. Telephone support in the use of the device, phone App and interpretation of the assessment is available.Samples were acquired from patients who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed by an PCR assay. Age, sex, clinical history, and SARS-CoV-2 symptomology were noted. The sample was Homogeneity and stability testing were performed in accordance with ISO/IEC 17043:2010 (1). Stability testing was undertaken at 37 degrees Celsius for 14 days, which showed no deterioration in sample result quality. Homogeneity testing using 15 samples was also performed with 100% correlation for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Each survey consists of a single sample sent to the user within one week of formal enrolment. submission of results.There have been many consequences of the COVID pandemic, one has been the rapid education of the public on pathology testing and PoCT. Obviously with a pandemic there is a need to have rapid reliable testing available at places where decisions will be made instantly about someone being admitted to a workplace or high-risk site. The aim being the reduction of spread of the virus to susceptible people in hospitals or aged care facilities.However, the need for rapid deployment of the PoCT did not allow a quality framework to be developed and was susceptible to error because of the attitude of the people performing the testing, the nature of the PoCT device used, the testing environment itself, access to training, and the traceability of both documentation and results, including patient results, and quality control results. Untrained staff, even health care workers, can have high confidence in the result of any testing device leading to an underestimation of risk by the user and a false perception of infallibility (5) . Combined with the pressures of the urgency of the testing, the large number of operators performing the testing, and the concerns of the client being tested, there is a need to identify rapidly operators or devices that are not performing appropriately.As many errors around POCT have been associated with the extra-analytical stages of the process, such as poor documentation and data management, having the ability to automatically capture data electronically can ensure a much greater degree of test accuracy (6, 7) . Rapid feedback to the operator of success or failure of the PoCT device is critical, as is simple intuitive instructions on how to perform the EQA exercise.The PoCT App will also be used for other EQAs. The strengths of this approach are the simple nature of the concept, easy and permanent recording of the result, real time turnaround of the result to the operator, the analytics available to supervisors and the support. This allowed operators with minimal training to quickly understand and use the EQA program with confidence.This type of testing illustrates the key role that laboratory data play in many clinical decisions; and that raises the possibility of whether more testing will have to move closer to the healthcare consumer of the future (8) . The reliability of serological testing for COVID-19 in the early phases of the pandemic became a critical issue when government were considering the use of these tests (9, 10, 11) and subsequently the POC devices have not used to date in Australia. However, they have been used in other countries where the EQA is being used.","Australia","first author","2020-10-17",10

Since then, studies and estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 have abounded, with widely varying results [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Virulence is often measured using the case fatality ratio (also called case fatality rate or case fatality risk, CFR), which is the number of deaths due to a disease as a proportion of the number of people diagnosed with the disease. The CFR is dependent on the particular pathogen (and its mechanism of action) and the immune response of the host, which can depend on age, sex, genetic factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Environmental factors such as climate and health system may also affect CFR. It is important to accurately quantify the CFR of a new disease to inform policy, communication and public health measures.There are many published calculations of case fatality ratios for COVID-19 using various datasets from different countries and using a range of methods. In some places, initial outbreaks have now concluded and the final crude CFR accurately reflects the overall ratio of reported deaths to cases. In many other places, outbreaks are continuing. Questions remain regarding quality of data, methods of calculation and even the possibility of changes in the CFR over time. These continuing uncertainties make it necessary to improve estimates of the CFR by refining the methods used to calculate it. In essence, this means finding the best way to correct the crude CFR for biases due to time lags and other factors. Most previously published studies make use of a parametrised distribution of times from onset (or hospitalisation) to death, determined from individual case data from early in the outbreak (largely from China) [5, [10] [11] [12] , which is then used in combination with statistical methods to estimate the CFR using population-level data on cases and deaths [5, 10, 11, 13] . Various assumptions are made in these analyses, including the form (and transferability) of the time course of cases, time lags in reporting or testing or hospitalisation, and estimates of the proportion of cases being detected.The time-shifted distribution (TSD) analysis method began with an observation that the shape of the evolving time distribution of COVID-19 cases in a given country often closely matches the shape of the corresponding distribution of COVID-19 deaths -simply shifted by a number of days and linearly scaled in magnitude. This is illustrated in Figure 1 for COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy (data from [14] , 3-day averaged data shown); the time-shifted relationship between case and death distributions can be seen in both cumulative and daily tallies. We can understand this shift from the perspective of the time delay between diagnosis and death or recovery. However, the closeness of the match reflects a much simpler apparent relationship than that suggested or assumed by conventional analyses, which relate deaths and cases using statistical parametric models that incorporate a broad distribution of expected times between diagnosis (or onset) and death, usually generated from case study data (e.g. [15] ). This observation suggests that there are two parameters of interest: the number of days separating the case and death distributions (called the delay time or ! ), and the scaling factor between the time-shifted case data and the death data, . For the optimal value of ! , there is a simple linear relationship between cumulative number of deaths at time , ( ), and cumulative number of cases at time − ! , ( − ! ), with gradient :It appears that this simple analysis generates two parameters of significant interest: the apparent delay between reporting of related cases and deaths, and the CFR. The estimates of these parameters (which can be determined unequivocally once an outbreak is concluded) can be calculated during the course of an outbreak and give a better approximation than the crude CFR. It should be noted that such an analysis cannot be applied during purely exponential growth, because time-shifting (horizontally) and scaling (vertically) an exponential function are equivalent operations, as: ""($%$ ! ) = [ %""$ ! ] ""$ = ""$ , which means that any value of ! will give an equivalent relationship between ( − ! ) and ( ) with gradient depending on ! .for China in early March.In comparison, the time-shifted distribution analysis is both transparent and straightforward to implement, using only publicly available data and no assumptions, and can provide a reasonably early estimate (once exponential growth has sufficiently slowed) of CFR that converges to the ""true"" value. If the value of the time delay is approximately known early in the outbreak, this could be used to constrain the fitting procedure, but as observed already, it is difficult either to know the time delay between onset and death or to apply it to the time delay between reporting of cases and deaths.Time-shifted distribution analysis was performed on COVID-19 data from an extensive range of countries, using datasets from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering [14] , cross-checked and supplemented with data from Worldometers.com and 3-day averaged.The differences in delay times are also startling, ranging from zero to 24 days with no clear pattern. This delay between reported cases and deaths may be informative regarding the state of reporting or testing in a country but it is difficult to interpret. The mean delay between onset of symptoms and death has been estimated at 12-22 days using case data [2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 16] , but there are also delays between onset of symptoms and testing, between testing and reporting of results, and in reporting of deaths. For example, in Sweden a mean delay of five days between onset of symptoms and the ""statistical date"" of a reported case (including one day from test to statistic) was reported [7] . In some countries, tests are only administered to the sickest patients (many days after onset), and in others, test results can take up to a few weeks. We note that for Australia and New Zealand, where case numbers have been low and testing extensive and rapid, the calculated time delay is more than ten days, whereas many of the harder-hit countries in western Europe and North America have much shorter calculated time delays.We are interested not only in the versatility and simplicity of this method, but also in what conclusions may be drawn from the parameters calculated -namely, the CFR and the delay time. Reported CFR values for COVID-19 vary widely, but the best current estimates of the true infection fatality ratio or IFR (taking into account all infections including undiagnosed and asymptomatic) are around 0.6-0.7% [4, 6] based on cruise ship and population serology data.The very high CFR values calculated for many European countries in particular are probably vastly inflated due to the inadequate testing and overwhelmed health systems in these countries, which result in underestimation of case numbers. However, it is an oversimplification to assume that this is the only relevant factor that differs between countries, since we know that demographics and health systems (among other things) can also affect survival probability.In Australia, case numbers have been generally low (especially before June) and testing rates high. It is unlikely that there have been appreciable unreported COVID-related deaths [29] .The USA is an interesting case study. The TSD analysis is problematic because the relationship between cases and deaths changes over time, causing mismatch between case and death distributions and a downward drift in both CFR and delay time. This may be due to incomplete data, or changes in testing or reporting over time, which can affect both delay time and case numbers. Alternatively, the case fatality ratio may be truly changing over time, due to changes in treatment approach or in the demographics (or location) of COVID-19 cases [32] . In the USA, there is also heterogeneity between states. To demonstrate, we present the time-shifted distribution analysis for the USA in Figure 7 , and for the state of New Jersey (which has the highest mortality rate in the USA) in and Illinois and New Mexico give 5%.In Europe, many of the most affected countries have very high case fatality ratios, often combined with relatively short delay times. For some of these countries, seroprevalence studies provide estimates of the degree of undercounting of cases during the initial outbreak [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , which can be utilised along with excess death data [35] to estimate the infection fatality ratio.These IFR values are shown in Table 2 along with the correction factors used. Some of the seroprevalence data is preliminary, including studies of Germany, Sweden and Italy, and others are for specific regions of the country and may not be representative. Nonetheless, the estimated IFR values are reasonable: Switzerland and Germany are around 0.6%, above Australia and below Sweden and USA at around 0.8%; Belgium, UK and Spain are between one and two percent; and Italy higher at around 3%. Ioannidis [26] also calculated the IFR for many of these countries using seroprevalence studies, but using only single-time seroprevalence and death data with an assumed delay time (generally a week after the midpoint of the seroprevalence survey); these are also shown in Table 2 and are broadly consistent with our values except where excess deaths are significant (e.g. Spain). Our value for Germany is somewhat higher but we expect that it is more reliable, using the scaling factor for cases [38] with our calculated CFR rather than the absolute number of deaths at a certain date in the German town of Gangelt [26] , which is very low and reflects a date early in the German outbreak.We observe similar effects in various other countries post-July including Japan (reduced to 1.1% and 22 days' delay) and Spain, France and Portugal (all reduced to 0.8-1.3%, 12-29 days' delay). These values are all similar and may reflect a reasonable estimate for CFR when testing is adequate; we would still expect the IFR to be lower by a factor of at least two due to undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases. A decrease in CFR over time may also indicate a change in the demographics of the case load or improvements in treatment or even an increasing time delay between reported cases and deaths, perhaps due to earlier diagnosis.We also find that, in countries where the time delay is significant, the TSD analysis can serve in a predictive capacity for numbers of deaths, using the linear relationship between deaths and time-shifted cases. Figure 9 shows this prediction for the second phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in France from August. Using parameters calculated from TSD analysis for August to mid-October, reported case data can be time-shifted and linearly scaled to predict daily deaths for France for the next three weeks. This is useful for public health planning, as well as decision-making regarding implementation of restrictions.","Australia","first author","2020-10-27",10

Shortly after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020, 1 Australia implemented public health infection control measures by restricting travel, public gatherings, sport and workplace attendance. [2] [3] [4] [5] In turn, the Australian healthcare system responded by postponing elective surgery, expanding telehealth services, establishing dedicated testing facilities to limit exposure to healthcare workers and preserving hospital resources including personal protective equipment (PPE). 6 However, besides decreasing the rate of viral transmission, social distancing has had other consequences.During the initial wave, New South Wales had the highest number of diagnosed cases in Australia, with the majority of those within metropolitan Sydney. Within Sydney, Northern Sydney Local Health District has faced the second greatest burden (522 confirmed cases). 7 Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH) is the largest hospital in this network, and is a tertiary referral trauma centre covering both metropolitan and rural areas. Emergency surgery has continued throughout the pandemic, with new perioperative protocols in place, including negative pressure operating theatres (with anterooms), additional PPE, anaesthetic protocols for aerosolizing procedures and recovery within the theatre itself.The aim of this study is to examine the impact of social distancing measures and local COVID-19 protocols on orthopaedic trauma surgery at RNSH, by comparing patient cohorts from the affected period and the same period 1 year prior. We postulated that the incidence and mechanism of orthopaedic trauma would be altered due to social distancing measures, with similar changes to surgical and anaesthetic durations secondary to amended local protocols.This study was conducted retrospectively. Following ethics approval, an analysis of all patients requiring emergency orthopaedic surgery over a 5-week period after commencement of social restrictions (16 March to 21 April 2020) was conducted via the PowerChart electronic medical record system (Cerner, North Kansas City, MO, USA). All patients with general orthopaedic injuries necessitating surgery were included. Patients who underwent operative management of isolated spinal or hand injuries were excluded, as these are considered separate sub-specialties at RNSH. Patients who had orthopaedic injuries combined with spinal or hand trauma were included.Outcomes assessed included basic demographic and injury information, as well as surgical data (time between injury and intervention, total anaesthetic and surgical times, and personnel involved in the procedure). These were compared to the cohort of patients requiring emergency orthopaedic surgery for the same time period in 2019. Standard protocols regarding the ethical use of patient data were applied. Datapoints were summarized as means with standard deviations where appropriate, or as a percentage of proportions in the case of dichotomous variables. Comparisons were made using the Student's two-tailed, unpaired t-test for continuous variables and using chi-squared tests for dichotomous variables (with Fisher's exact test where the incidence of a particular event was less than 5). Alpha was set at 0.05 for all data points.During the 5-week period in 2020, 146 emergency orthopaedic operations were performed on 135 patients. This was a 15.6% decrease from the 2019 cohort, where 173 procedures were performed on 159 patients. Total orthopaedic admissions (elective and emergency) in this period were 173, diminished by 30.8% from 250 in 2019. There was no significant difference in age or gender between the two groups (Table 1) .There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients whose injuries were sustained by road trauma (which included car, motorbike, cycling and pedestrian accidents), nor was there a difference in the number of patients presenting with a work-related injury. Road trauma was responsible for 25 presentations (14.5%) in 2019, and 29 patients (16.8%) in 2020 (P = 0.2). However, the proportion of the road trauma patients who were cyclists significantly increased. Cyclists comprised 16 patients (11.0%) in 2020, compared to just five patients (2.9%) in 2019 (P = 0.003). There was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients who injured themselves playing sports (organized or social sports, excluding cycling), down to seven cases in 2020, compared to 24 cases in 2019 (P = 0.004) ( Table 1) . There was a decrease in multi-trauma patients (defined as patients presenting with more than one discrete anatomical location of injury) to 13 in 2020, compared to 22 previously; however, this was not significant (P = 0.27). There was no difference in the proportion of patients who presented with geriatric hip fractures during the studied period; similarly, proportions of patients with upper limb or lower limb injuries were unchanged.There was no significant difference in the types of operations performed (Table 2) , nor was there a change in the proportion of cases done out of hours (between 17.00 and 08.00 hours). The mean number of surgical team members involved in the operations was 2.26 and 2.28 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, demonstrating no difference in surgical staffing. However, the percentage of cases that were consultant-led (consultant listed as primary surgeon) significantly increased from 110 of 173 cases (63.6%) in 2019 to 112 of 146 cases (76.7%) in 2020 (P = 0.01). There was a decrease in the mean anaesthetic time (time from commencement of anaesthesia to commencement of surgery) from 44.5 min in 2019 to 39.0 min during COVID (P = 0.02), but there was no significant difference in the total time the patient spent in the operating room (Table 3 ).COVID-19, the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has challenged healthcare systems globally. 1 With no proven therapeutic agent, many governments have focused instead on limiting the spread of the virus via broad public health measures, with varying degrees of social 'lockdown'. 2 Australia's response to COVID-19 commenced on 23 January 2020, with the first case in Australia recorded on 25 January, 8 and the first death on 1 March. 9 Following the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 1 a progressive shutdown of social and economic activity throughout the country over the subsequent 2 weeks was commenced. 10 International travel was banned, and overseas travellers returning to Australia were required to quarantine. 3 Australians were urged to stay home, leaving home only for exercise, food, essential work and study, or to act as a carer.The response of the Australian healthcare system had several goals: to prepare hospitals for high numbers of COVID-19 patients; manage the workforce, assuming large groups of staff may be required to quarantine; and maintain safe delivery of essential care, including conservation of PPE. 10 Non-essential elective surgery in both public and private hospitals was postponed indefinitely on 25 March. 6 Telehealth clinics were established, and patients were encouraged to defer non-essential appointments. During the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia, the number of new daily cases reported peaked at 469 on 28 March before slowly decreasing. 11 Although the aforementioned disease-control measures have had significant societal and economic costs, their implementation has circumvented the overwhelming of the healthcare system. At our tertiary referral institution, local protocols regarding PPE allocation and staffing were developed to safely continue emergency and essential elective surgery. 'Pandemic medicine' treatment protocols for orthopaedic patients were not utilized. All fractures were treated on their merit, with the ability to do so due to maintained capacity in both the hospital and healthcare district (despite treating the second highest number of COVID-19 patients in New South Wales). 7 This is in contrast to the National Health Service (UK), which was in a very different position regarding the available healthcare resources and the burden of COVID-19 patients. In April, the National Health Service clinical guide for trauma and orthopaedic patients advocated for non-operative management to be explored as the primary option, performing surgery as day-only cases wherever possible, and limiting outpatient attendance. 12 A tertiary centre in London that did not alter its threshold for surgery based on this recommendation noted a decrease in surgical cases of one-third compared to pre-pandemic, suggesting that the primary driver of decreased procedures was decreased referral volume, rather than local protocol. 13 Similar decreases in trauma referrals have been recognized in centres in the USA, 14 Spain 15 and India. 16 Physical distancing requirements and mandatory shutdown of businesses, workplaces and gatherings have transformed daily activities. The Citimapper Mobility Index estimates the movement of people within Sydney decreased by up to 84% in March, as fewer people utilized public transport or drove to their places of work. 17 On the basis of these changes, it was hypothesized there would be a decrease in the total number of orthopaedic trauma patients presenting to emergency, and indeed, this was the case in our study. Similarly, we anticipated a drop in patients with workrelated injuries (given a large proportion of workers are now working from home, or unemployed) and sporting-related injuries (given the cancellation of organized sport and group activities), but a rise in trauma related to home 'do-it-yourself' projects. Our findings were as expected for sporting and 'do-it-yourself' injuries; however, work-related injuries remained largely unchanged. This is possibly because the majority of these injuries occurred on construction sites, with most construction continuing throughout the studied period. The number of geriatric hip fracture presentations was also predicted to decrease, given that this population is at higher risk of COVID-19, and would be more likely to adhere to social distancing recommendations by remaining indoors, potentially reducing the risk of falls. However, the proportion of geriatric hip fractures remained unchanged when comparing the two time periods, consistent with prior evidence that the majority of hip fractures occur after a fall at home or indoors, 18 and is similar to international reports during this pandemic. A tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain, found that the volume of hip fractures remained stable despite a decrease in overall trauma presentations. All patients were tested for COVID-19 on presentation given high levels of community spreadthe prevalence in this population was 19.4%, leading to surgical delays and higher in-hospital mortality. 15 By contrast, our 30-day hip fracture mortality rate was not affected during this period (4%, compared with the 2019 national average of 5%). 19 Because of the low prevalence of COVID-19 in our population, patients were only tested if symptomatic, and there were few delays to surgery.Although the volume of road trauma patients was unchanged, the distribution altered significantly, with a small decrease in carrelated injuries, a substantial decrease in motorbike accidents and a large increase in trauma from cycling. The proportion of pedestrians was roughly the same between years. This is consistent with data from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, which, although analysing deaths rather than injury, reflects a similar change in how roads are being utilized during COVID-19. In Australia, road deaths during April 2020 totalled 75, down 25.3% compared with the monthly average in the previous 5 years (100.5 deaths). Motorcyclist deaths were down 8.8%. There was, however, an increase in cycling-related deaths of 21.6% (to 45 cyclists) compared to April 2019 (37 cyclists), despite fewer vehicles being on the road. 20 The decrease in trauma patients from road accidents is easily explained given the restrictions placed on travel. The increased proportion of cycling-related trauma in this group is multifactorial. During April 2020, Sydney City Council reported increased cycle traffic of 25-50%, despite the drop in people movement. 21 Bicycle sales also increased by up to 28% as people took up cycling during the pandemic as a hobby following the closure of gyms, 22 and rising demand for home food delivery led to more cyclists working for food delivery companies. 23 These cyclists may have been inexperienced and therefore more likely to be involved in an accident. 24 As restrictions ease and people eventually return to work, it is expected there will be an increase in commuting and transit via bicycle as people practice social distancing and avoid public transport. For the same reason, more cars will return to the roads, and it is likely cyclists will continue to be vulnerable to trauma in the post-lockdown period.Whilst the number of surgical team members scrubbed during trauma operations was unchanged during the studied period, the proportion of cases that were consultant-led significantly increased. This was not driven by hospital or department policy. At RNSH, there is a high level of consultant involvement at baseline, and there was no observable changes in definitive management or unplanned return to theatres during the studied period. Contrary to our hypothesis, anaesthetic time actually decreased by an average of 5 min per patient. There was a change in the anaesthetic department's protocols for routine anaesthesia, given that aerosolizing procedures carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. As such, there was an increase in consultantdriven anaesthesia, and a change in practice to allow early extubation in theatre, rather than in recovery. Despite the change in protocols, the total length of time patients spent inside the theatre was unaffected.Australian states and territories slowly eased social restrictions from 1 May 2020, which included the recommencement of elective surgery in a restricted capacity and a gradual return to full surgical capacity planned over several weeks to months. 25 RACS estimates that the backlog of elective operations in Australia due to COVID-19 is nearly 400 000 cases, 26 a burden that will take many months to clear, potentially decreasing many patients' quality of life during this time. This is just one of the many challenges that the healthcare systems are facing globally during the recovery period.While there are several studies examining the impact of COVID-19 on elective surgery, few studies analyse its effect on orthopaedic trauma, particularly in Australia. Despite social distancing and travel restrictions, there has been a persistent (although decreased) demand for emergency orthopaedic care throughout the pandemic. This study aids in understanding how human movement and social activities contribute to orthopaedic trauma, both for future resource allocation and for trauma prevention. Future research should further appraise changes in trauma demographics, both domestic and international, as well as whether the trends observed will reverse as the pandemic eases.Annabel Probert: Conceptualization; data curation; investigation; project administration; writing-original draft; writing-review and editing.
