For example, in telecare Nickelsen and Elkjaer (2017) note that in the ICT infrastructure dominated context of providing medical telecare, the ICT infrastructure shapes the work unit community and interactions; thereby, challenging the hierarchy and relationships of the work unit. (Arnold et al., 2019: 368) One of the many impacts of COVID-19 has seen many organisations move their workforce to working from home and the increasing use of technology. This has seen increased commentary from publications such as the Economist, Guardian, UK Financial Times and the New York Times (to name a few) which suggest the end of the traditional ""office"" through the adoption of hybrid type work arrangements, and the benefits of utilising technology and the creation of virtual teams.These changes are not new and have been occurring incrementally since the wider introduction of computers and other technology into the workplace since the 1990s. For example, Hoch and Dulebohn (2017) quote a 2014 RW3 survey of 3000 managers that 40% of their employees spend time working in virtual teams. A 2012 survey of 379 HR professionals by the Society of Human Resource Management finds that 46% of the participants reported their organizations to use virtual teams. Liao (2017) also refers to this latter survey as well as suggesting that co-located teams have increasingly incorporated technologies into work operations and to facilitate communication. Along similar lines, Cogliser et al. (2012) conclude that teams have become more dispersed over both time and space and utilising technology to facilitate this in varying degrees. In earlier research Siebdrat et al. (2009) conclude that such dispersion is not necessarily detrimental but depends on team's processes including team member contribution and coordination.Research on virtual teams has followed that of co-located face-to-face teams through lenses such as trust, communication, teamwork, leadership and collaboration. In a report on developments in China business in response to COVID-19 the McKinsey and Company (2020) suggest that many teams have simply moved from face-to-face and co-located to virtual teams. In the majority of cases, these existing teams have simply recreated their existing work processes through increased utilisation of virtual technologies. While not suggested in the report this does raise the issue of the development of new teams or even the re-purpose of existing teams in the new virtual environment.This short paper introduces a new paradigm for examining the development of virtual teams, arguably one that would facilitate the consideration of technology as part of virtual teams rather than simply as an alternate to the face-to-face teams. That is, viewing the development of virtual teams with embedded technology within an organisation through an innovation framework.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related components of a good virtual team. Section 3 presents theories from the innovation and entrepreneurship viewpoints that are used to guide the discussion in Section 4. Section 5 raises some questions for further discussion. The last section draws the conclusion.Virtual teams refer to the geographically distributed collaborations that rely on technology to communicate and cooperate (Morrison-Smith & Ruiz, 2020). Existing literature on virtual teams is comprehensive (Gilson et al., 2014; Morrison-Smith & Ruiz, 2020) and beyond the scope of this short paper. The following section seeks to introduce some of the key concepts to generate discussion rather than attempting to provide an extensive review of literature. Many of the concepts raised apply to both virtual, dispersed and face-to-face teams. Virtual teams have an added layer of complexity related to the use of technology within the team. The literature below focuses largely on the human behaviour elements of virtual teams, with the role of technology introduced later.Hoch and Dulebohn (2017) suggest that trust is an important component of any team. Shared leadership and collaboration between members increase trust and knowledge sharing, improve functioning and assist with the achievement of individual and unit goals. Shared leadership is considered a mutual influence process to assist the achievement of objectives. However, the authors also conclude that colocated teams work more effectively as a lack of co-located interaction impacted trust, decision-making,Frost & Duan 2020, Wellington Virtual teams, technology and innovation conflict management and the expression of opinions. This is consistent with the findings of Siebdrat et al. (2009) above.The human dimension is also important to the success of virtual teams. Such a dimension maximises collegiality, engagement and civility (Arnold et al., 2019) . For virtual teams, the composition of member personality is important as is conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability (Hoch and Dulebohn, 2017) . Conscientiousness implies a strong sense of direction, self-discipline and good selforganisation skills. Agreeableness is linked with being good-natured and cooperative. Emotional stability suggests a calm, self-confident team member that possesses high self-efficacy, and could also include tolerance of both ambiguity and uncertainty. Siebdrat et al. (2009) suggest that when selecting members, it is important to consider member social skills and the underlying self-sufficiency. This is important for all dispersed and virtual teams as the development of underlying group dynamics is not as extensive as what usually occurs in a face-to-face or co-located setting.Emotional intelligence is a significant predictor of unit effectiveness in face-to-face teams. However, virtual teams observe fewer see verbal and nonverbal clues due to decreased social interaction and emotional expression. Emotional intelligence is a critical driver in successful outcomes within a virtual team. Similarly, this lack of social interaction sees team development occurring more slowly in virtual teams (Pitts et al., 2012) . Gressgard (2011) concludes that highly functioning virtual teams facilitate flexible approaches to product development, shortens innovation processes, which in turn speeds up the time to market, thereby providing a competitive advantage. Furthermore, digital disruption now sees a merging of information systems and processes such that production, distribution, information and communication systems can now be linked together.Leung et al. (2020) suggest that an emerging response from the COVD-19 is hybrid working arrangements, i.e. spilt time between the workplace and home. This may see more discussion on work/life integration as distinct from work/life balance. It will also mean that both existing and new virtual teams may need to repurpose work processes rather than recreate existing processes in the hybrid arrangements. This is consistent with Larson and DeChurch (2020) who suggest that we are now entering a new phase of virtual teams. They suggest that there are four themes linking technology, virtual teams and organisational processes. These are (i) Technology as context -where technology is a fixed feature that sets the context for unit processes, communication and information storage. An example is seen in the 1990s with the widespread introduction of computers in organisations and the 2000s with the evolution and growth of virtual teams. Figure 1 highlights the evolving use of technology since the 1990s.(ii) Technology as socio-material -technology and units are mutually dependent. This is more for sociological considerations that are outside the scope of this short paper.(iii) Technology as a creation medium -where units are formed through technology such as flash teams, project groups relating to the introduction of new automated processes or organisational systems, but also sometimes outside of formal structures like Wikipedia.(iv) Technology as a teammate -this is an emerging theme and occurs where technology has a distinct role as an effective virtual team member or the core that the virtual team is built around. In the above three themes, the virtual teams work with technology through either communication or process. In this theme, technology has a distinct role as a distinct member and may include the use of robotics, algorithms or artificial intelligence. The authors suggest that this may be the next major development in the use of technology.To date, the majority of technological improvement has allowed incremental change within organisations, however disruptive and transformational change can also provide an opportunity for organisations (Gressgard, 2011) . Figure 1 shows the advancement of technologies in supporting virtual teams.In short, the notion of virtual teams is not something new that has simply emerged from COVID-19. Rather there has been ongoing development of virtual and dispersed teams for nearly three decades, with accompanying research on the performance, leadership and outcomes. Attributes of successful virtual teams include shared leadership, emotional stability/intelligence, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Arguably most of this development has occurred in the theme of technology providing a context. Much of the literature on virtual teams have utilised existing face-to-face team literature as aFrost & Duan 2020, Wellington Virtual teams, technology and innovation framework, where teams have been re-creating existing processes and structures rather than as a tool for re-purposing.Utilising the theme of technology as a teammate may provide an opportunity for transformational change within an organisation as it emerges from the impacts of COVID-19. It would see emerging technologies such as robotics, automation and/or artificial intelligence be considered concurrently when team development occurs and how team members could be built these technologies to maximise opportunities. The question is how could organisations enable this? The entrepreneurship literature is extensive and this short paper mainly investigates the organisational process for facilitating the virtual team. Some seminal works on entrepreneurship and innovation are introduced in the following commentary. Entrepreneurship can be considered a process of ""creative destruction"", where the entrepreneur displaces or destroys the existing methods of production and replaces these with new ones, be it in new products or services, new methods of production, new markets, new supply chains or new forms of production (Schumpeter 1934) . Burgelman (1983) defines corporate entrepreneurship as the process where firms (as distinct from individuals) engage in diversification through new resource combinations that extend the firm's activities into unrelated areas, or marginally related to its current operations. Burgelman and Doz (2011) subsequently assed that firms need both order and diversity in their strategy to survive. Order is provided in management and structural processes while corporate entrepreneurship provides a diversity through experimentation and selection. Covin and Slevin (1989) find that in hostile environments a more adaptive entrepreneurial strategic posture can be useful. Covin and Miles (1999) coin the term organisational rejuvenation as when an organisation alters its exiting processes, structures or capabilities in face of such hostile environments. The authors identified that innovation underlies all forms of corporate entrepreneurship, either through a product, service, or part of the wider organisational direction (Covin & Miles, 1999) .The innovation literature primarily examines the adoption and diffusion of virtual teams in organisations and the factors associated with the adoption and diffusion. Prominent theoretical frameworks for investigating the adoption and diffusion of technologies in virtual teams include the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behaviour, the diffusion of innovation theory, the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the motivational model theory, and the technology-organisation-environment framework (Guth and Ginberg, 1990; Zahra 1993; Miles, 1999: 2007; Venkatesh, et al., 2016; Kahn, 2018) . The innovation in virtual teams can be seen as an outcome from a goal (i.e. in process, output, or product, etc.); a mindset (i.e. innovation at an individual level, a supportive team structure and /or culture); or a process (how does it affect current processes) (Kahn, 2018) . Therefore innovation can be internally focused and include cost reduction, product improvement, new markets, efficiency in processes, amended supply chains to name a few. While not stated perhaps technology could also be included in these items as it links easily with all of these processes Miles, 1999: 2007 Both the entrepreneurship literature and the innovation literature provide rich information in understanding different aspects of virtual teams. Considering the new role of technology being the teammate in virtual teams, the overlap of the two streams of research sheds light on the key theories and factors for constructing a framework for understating the new paradigm of virtual teams post COVID-19. The next section will cover the initial discussion on constructing such a framework.As businesses emerge from their amended operational arrangements from COVID-19 they will face a changing landscape to how they have operated pre COVID-19. The implementation of virtual teams, while widely reported in media as a relatively new paradigm, has been incrementally occurring since the 1990s. In many cases, existing teams have simply recreated existing processes to allow for amended working practices, both within the organisation and also with external stakeholders. It is unlikely that businesses will simply return to where they were pre COVID-19. For example, teams may retain an element of dispersion and/or virtual components. The work-life integration of team members may become more prevalent such that team members are working outside existing business hours in the form of hybrid working arrangement.There may be an opportunity to repurpose existing teams as well as develop new teams that also include further adoption of technological features such that technology is considered an effective ""teammate"". This can include the use of existing tools for sharing resources and communication as well as the increased potential use of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. The creation of these teams may require a different mindset around staff recruitment, performance and development, management structures and ways to measure success. There is a general understanding that formal leadership in dispersed and virtual teams require more focus on group and individual communication as well as a focus of group outputs.Recruitment may need to be adjusted to also include technological understanding, emotional intelligence and self-efficacy. Furthermore, formal leaders may need to ensure strong communication channels exist to develop team functioning such that trust and shared leadership emerge.The characteristics for successful virtual team members include factors such as shared leadership, emotional stability/intelligence, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. The majority of these attributes match those of a successful entrepreneur, albeit some more directly than others. Entrepreneurial attributes include independence, self-efficacy, a propensity for risk and opportunity, a drive to achieve, a creative thinker, a problem solver with a high tolerance for ambiguity and/or failure, and have teambuilding skills. All of these attributes would be well suited within a virtual team environment. Figure 2 shows a framework for formulating a high performing virtual team post COVID-19.This suggests that organisations looking to repurpose existing processes post COVID-19 with possible more detailed engagement with technology could do so within an entrepreneurial framework. Namely flexible and entrepreneurial organisational structures, a goal approach to success, and an acute awareness of industry trends. Interestingly the two seminal pieces on entrepreneurship literature occurred in response to significant economic upheavals. This is probably understandable as it links with the commentary on succeeding in hostile environments. A key question is whether current circumstances could be considered something familiar. This short paper introduces a new paradigm for examining the development of virtual teams post COVID-19 with the consideration of technology as part of virtual teams. That is, rather than being an enabler of process, can technology (and how it is utilised) influence the dynamics of a team, all people and process activities related to the team, and the ability of the team to innovate more successfully. Possible linkages between the development of successful virtual teams, and how the attributes of these teams could assist corporate innovation and vice versa are discussed. To inspire further discussion on the new paradigm of virtual teams, open questions are proposed in line with the goals of this paper. Namely, the introduction of a possible framework that businesses could utilise as they grapple with the amended demands of their environment post COVID-19.Arnold ","Australia","first author","2020-11-14","11"

Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and their potential impact and limitations are hotly debated. It is expected that herd immunity (3) (4-6) will play a role in containing the pandemic once a sufficiently high proportion of the world population gains adaptive immunity. Nevertheless, if high morbidity, mortality, and economic catastrophe are to be avoided, the vast majority of the population should acquire immunity through vaccination rather than infection. While global eradication of COVID-19 could be a difficult goal to achieve (7, 8) , a successful vaccination program may target regional elimination in the short-to medium-term. Hence, vaccination uptake will have a direct and critical influence on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ability of the healthcare systems to manage it.In this paper, we argue that the level of vaccination uptake in populations, the effective prioritisation of potential vaccine recipients, and the efficient use of the resources needed by vaccination administration programs, will be the key determinants in how the COVID-19 pandemic is contained and/or eliminated in populations in the coming years. We posit that without widespread uptake, any vaccination program will fail regardless of the efficacy (9, 10) of the vaccine itself. Therefore, what we describe in this paper are conditions under which the vaccination programs can achieve their maximum uptake and effectiveness, and the modelling and implementation approaches needed to help the vaccination programs achieve this.We propose that game theoretic modelling, which is the established theoretical framework for modelling rational decision making (11 -19) , coupled with social network analysis and agent-based techniques for modelling the population and simulating the disease dynamics (4) (20 -24) , will give us the most effective toolset to model the vaccination uptake. This multi-faceted approach will produce a definitive roadmap for the implementation of vaccination programs which will lead to successful long-term management of COVID-19.1.1 In the coming years, the most important factors that will determine the success of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic will be the level of vaccination uptake by the population, and the effective use of resources to administer the vaccine in highly varied and variable settings.1.2 Game theory, supplemented by social network analysis and agent-based modelling, should be extensively used by researchers to model vaccination uptake by populations and guide difficult policy decisions regarding vaccination programs and thus maximise containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.Given the limited availability of vaccines at the initial stages, effective prioritisation and optimal use of resources will be crucial. If the vaccine is of the type which reduces the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, prioritisation should be based on targeting individuals, cities, or states that can act as critical nodes of transmission or superspreaders. Whereas if the vaccine is of the type that reduces symptoms or mortality, prioritisation should be based on targeting individuals, cities, or states that are likely to have poor outcomes if infected.Game theory, together with social networks and agent-based modeling, can be used as a primary theoretical framework in determining effective prioritisation of scarce resources needed in different vaccination programs, depending on a broad range of bounding conditions for successful implementation.Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, production and dissemination are expected to take at least 12 to 18 months (25, 26) . Currently, WHO lists 30 vaccine candidates as under investigation in human clinical trials and 119 in preclinical trials (27) . Efforts to develop vaccines have explored different approaches, ranging from recombinant vaccines and nucleotide-based vaccines to subunit vaccines and others. Most vaccine candidates are aimed at inducing neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which prevent binding to ACE2 receptors of host cells (2) . Eight vaccine candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials at present, with three other candidates in phase 2 or phase 2/3. Among the vaccine candidates which are currently in phase 3, the leading ones are 1) the ChAdOx1 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, 2) the Moderna RNA vaccine, which is designed to induce antibodies against a portion of the coronavirus S protein, 3) the Sinopharm inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 4) the CanSino Biologics Ad5-nCoV vaccine, which employs an adenovirus vector. Pfizer and BioNTech are currently testing their BNT162 vaccine candidate in a combined phase 2/3 trial structure (28) .The current pace of these SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials and their projected manufacture have raised hopes that the conventional timeline for vaccine development and delivery will be significantly reduced (29, 30) . Moreover, the global collaborative effort, COVAX, has been initiated to negotiate and ensure equitable access of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to all participating countries regardless of income levels (28) . Several countries have also made alternative arrangements for procuring approved vaccines directly from the manufacturers. Nevertheless, despite unprecedented levels of accelerated research and international cooperation, no country is expected to procure sufficient doses to vaccinate its entire population for many months following the release of first vaccines.Achieving herd immunity is often a key objective of population-level vaccination coverage (31) . Herd immunity is a population threshold that marks the necessary proportion of the population that needs to be immune to an infection, either through vaccination or through exposure to the pathogen, so that the transmission of the infectious agent is sufficiently disrupted, and the entire population is protected (3). It is not desirable to expose a significant portion of the population to the pathogen in order to acquire herd immunity. Rather the objective should be to achieve herd immunity through vaccination to minimise morbidity and mortality.The level of herd immunity needed to protect a population can be derived from the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which is defined as the number of secondary infections produced on average by an infected index case within a completely susceptible population, assuming there is no human intervention (4) (5) (6) . The epidemic threshold is defined as the inverse of the basic reproduction number (5, 6) . The level of herd immunity needed to protect a population from an epidemic is equal to the complement of the epidemic threshold (i.e. herd immunity threshold = 1 -1/R 0 ).The basic reproduction number R 0 for COVID-19 and the corresponding herd immunity threshold are not yet known definitively, with current best estimates of R 0 ranging from 2.5-3.0 (14) (32 -35), with the corresponding herd immunity thresholds ranging from 60% -67%. Furthermore, much uncertainty remains regarding the nature of the immunogenicity of the pathogen, with important implications for vaccine candidates. It is currently unknown whether humoral or cell-mediated responses drive neutralising immunity or other correlates of protection, and how long any such protection endures (36 -38) . If vaccination does not generate protective immunity in every member of the population who gets vaccinated, then the number of people requiring vaccination for the population to achieve herd immunity will be higher than the number determined by the herd immunity threshold as defined by R 0 . Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity will require greater population coverage than that derived from R 0 , and also may necessitate the administration of booster vaccination. Also, the targeting of epidemiologically influential subgroups will be important, and the relative importance of some of these subgroups is disease-specific. For example, healthcare and other essential workers may be important subgroups to target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination due to their relatively high levels of exposure. According to recent evidence (39, 40) , children also may be more influential to transmission than previously assumed. Therefore, despite the transient immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, targeted vaccination delivery may achieve herd immunity at or below the threshold derived from R 0 if epidemiologically influential subgroups are prioritised. All these aspects of herd immunity specific to COVID-19 will necessarily be foundational to the modeling of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness.Game theory, which is the study of strategic decision making by rational players, is used to study several phenomena and behavioural patterns in human societies and socioeconomical systems, and is applied in fields ranging from evolutionary biology to computer science and project management (4) (41 -45) . Several previous studies have modelled vaccination uptake using game theory in the context of diseases such as influenza, measles, chickenpox and hepatitis (4) . When modelling vaccination uptake using game theory, players usually represent individuals, and the actions involve taking or not taking a vaccine. The payoff is decided by several factors including the perceived risk of infection (perceived prevalence and transmissibility), severity of the disease, financial and non-financial cost of vaccination, and the perceived uptake of vaccination by other players.To reach a decision, individuals either try achieving utility maximization or comparing the payoffs of two strategies. The decision-making process is modelled in two ways: (a) Selflearning (Aspiration game) (65) (b) social-learning (Imitation game) (4, 66) . Through selflearning, individuals rely on their knowledge, memory and personal perception, and awareness of the disease, and switch strategies if their own aspiration level is not met, while imitation dynamics put individuals into an environment where personal decisions are influenced by the choices of the population, and individuals update their strategies by comparing their own expected payoffs with others in the population and switch to the strategy which gives the better payoff (63, 65, 66) . The imitation game can be played in a homogenous population structure representing a well-mixed population, or a heterogeneous population structure, where the influence by neighbours is determined by the number and strength of contacts between the individual and his/her neighbours (67).Levine (46) describes six key drivers that may influence vaccine uptake. These include the epidemic potential of the pathogen, localised transmission potential of the pathogen, safety concerns with the vaccine, strength and flexibility of public health delivery systems, public investment in resources for immunization, and local ownership and individual normative behaviors. The level of vaccine hesitancy by the population (47) , and the local context and its multifactorial determinants also need to be considered.Assuming that safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be available after timely regulatory approvals, countries will still require enormous resources and systems in place to address vaccination program implementation challenges. The challenges in vaccination program implementation include vaccine procurement and supply chain management, developing and deploying vaccine delivery platforms, developing vaccine delivery strategies including identification of eligible/target subpopulations for vaccination, training of frontline workers, and social mobilization (1). These barriers and challenges must also be viewed in light of the shortages of health workers that exist in many parts of the world. The High Level Commission on Health, Employment and Economic Growth of WHO (48) noted in 2016 that there was a global shortage of 180 million health workers to meet the prescribed minimum threshold of 44.5 health workers per 10, 000 individuals. Given these pre-COVID-19 deficits, the optimal management of human resources to meet the increased demands of the pandemic, manage the normal caseloads from other diseases, and still allocate sufficient human resources for the urgent task of vaccination will be a significant challenge to many countries.We posit that strategic vaccine delivery and its uptake comprise the most important determinants of containing COVID-19 successfully, and compare favourably against considerations related to vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percentage reduction of disease in a vaccinated group of people compared to an unvaccinated group, using the most favorable conditions (9) (10). Modelling suggests that a vaccine with partial efficacy may have significant impact and cost-effectiveness with maximal gains achieved with earlier introduction (1). Therefore, we argue that any vaccine candidate which has met the minimum endpoints explicitly defined in their phase 3 protocols must be deployed immediately, and the efficacy of such a vaccine, while important, is a concern secondary to achieving strategically targeted coverage as early as possible.Similarly, we argue that while Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) will retain their significance in containment efforts in the short to medium-term, vaccination uptake will eventually supplant them as the primary means to containing COVID-19. Several countries have used contact tracing and isolation efforts, coupled with mask-wearing and social distancing measures, to contain COVID-19, as an interim measure until reliable vaccines become available (49) . When implemented consistently, these efforts have enjoyed considerable success, but are also both highly resource-intensive and socio-economically disruptive (49, 50) . As such, they may be unsustainable over the long-term due to population fatigue, economic hardship, and the lack of requisite public health resource capital (51) . Therefore, while they are crucial to the containment of COVID-19 in the short term, the importance of vaccination efforts will surpass them in significance in the longterm.There are many compelling reasons why game theory should be employed in the modelling and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake. Firstly, compulsory vaccination is likely to encounter a level of resistance from the public, and there may not be enough vaccines to vaccinate everyone. Therefore, decisions will have to be made by governments and policy makers about who to vaccinate, and by individuals about whether they want to take the vaccine. An individual is likely to get vaccinated only if the policy makers decide to offer vaccination to that individual, and the individual decides to accept it. Game theory can be used to explicitly model the decision making of policy makers (vaccine givers) and individuals (vaccine takers), because it has well-defined branches which model ""public good"" decision making (cooperative game theory) and selfish decision making (noncooperative game theory) (11, 44) .Secondly, game theory can also model the evolution of strategies. In the COVID-19 context, strategies will evolve as more information becomes available about the disease itself and about the vaccines. Different strategies will contest for primacy, and evolutionary game theory (12, 64) can explicitly model this.Thirdly, game theory can explicitly account for ""bounded rationality"" -the limited ability of people to assess reality. Thus, game theory can model the perceived and real payoffs of vaccination and distinguish between them, which is important with respect to COVID-19 because of the amount of misinformation and conspiracy theories present.Finally, game theory can be used in conjunction with other tools, such as prospect theory (52), Monte-Carlo simulation (53) , and agent based models (54) , which will be useful in modelling the COVID-19 dynamics, and computing and predicting epidemic parameters which can then be used as input to model decision making, completing the feedback loop. It can also employ supercomputing resources in calculating equilibrium solutions (68, 69).A complex array of factors, parameters, drivers and attributes, which influence the decision by individuals to take the vaccine, the decision by governments and policy makers to provide a vaccine to certain people, or both, need to be considered in modelling SARS-CoV-2 vaccination uptake. The age and gender distributions of people will influence vaccination uptake, since older people are more likely to be adversely affected by COVID-19, and likely to have higher mortality rates (13, 14) , and thus may have more incentive to take the vaccination. Similarly, some preliminary studies suggest that (15, 16) men compared to women are more likely to be symptomatic with COVID-19 or to have higher morbidity, thus men may have comparatively more incentive to take vaccination. The cost and accessibility of the vaccine will obviously influence the levels of uptake. In some countries, governments may make the vaccination compulsory for certain demographics, such as people above a certain age, and this may reduce the incentive for others to vaccinate voluntarily.The type of vaccine will influence the uptake. We need to model scenarios where the vaccine will be one-off, seasonal, or a chemoprophylaxis. We also need to consider whether the potential vaccine will reduce transmissibility or will reduce the severity of the symptoms and the mortality rate. If the vaccine will reduce transmissibility, then relatively young people, who are more likely to travel and interact with others, should be given preference by policymakers in vaccine access. On the other hand, if the vaccine primarily reduces symptoms or mortality, then older people, and people who have illnesses that increase the likelihood of a poor outcome, will have a higher incentive to take the vaccine, and policy makers will have a higher incentive to give the vaccine to them.Other influential factors are epidemiological metrics, such as COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, and cumulative incidence, and these need to be considered at suburb, city, state and country levels, creating a complex array of parameters. Furthermore, the perceived epidemiological parameters can differ from real parameters if misinformation is being spread, and this difference between perceived and real parameters can be correlated to the 'bounded rationality' (18, 19, 55, 56) of the potential vaccinees, or the level of 'noise' present in the information. All such context and nuance will need to be modelled.The level of interaction a person expects to have with the community in general, and other SARS-CoV-2-infected people in particular, will influence vaccination decisions, and will have to be modelled. For example, a person who travels to work by train, or is employed in a people-facing job such as teaching or food service work, may be more likely to vaccinate compared to a person working from home. Similarly, health workers are more likely to vaccinate.Other factors involve the health of the potential vaccinees. In particular, the perceived and real levels of immunity of people have to be modelled, because people who have relatively higher levels of immunity have less incentive to take vaccination. Similarly, the overall health of the vaccinee, including the presence of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart diseases, and the perceived correlation of these conditions with severe COVID-19 (17, 57) will need to be modelled, as will the perceived and real likelihood of adverse side-effects from the vaccine (especially in individuals with other chronic diseases).Finally, the logistic and human resource management challenges in distributing and administering the vaccine, such as transport of vaccine, storage of vaccine, availability of clinical and support staff to administer the vaccine, and the durability of vaccine after manufacture are factors that need to be considered and modelled in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination uptake.Usually, when the prevalence of a disease decreases, the perceived risk decreases, resulting in a smaller perceived payoff for taking the vaccine, which will in turn result in less vaccine uptake. This may over time result in the re-emergence of disease, which will in turn increase the payoff, so more people will take the vaccine. Therefore, there is a risk that COVID-19 will become endemic, and go through endemic stable cycles (and vaccine uptake will also go through corresponding cycles), if the perceived 'payoff' for taking the vaccine is not high enough on average when the prevalence becomes relatively low (4). It will be important to establish the conditions under which the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination uptake will go through such cycles, in different countries and sub-demographics, so that policy decisions can be made that ensure the payoff for the vaccine is always high enough to avoid such endemic stable cycles. As such, game theoretic modelling of vaccination uptake has to be tightly coupled with high fidelity simulation modelling (20, 21) of population demographics and disease dynamics, using techniques such as agent-based modelling, to gain a holistic picture about vaccination uptake.In particular, large scale agent-based simulation methods (54) can be used to model population demographics, including age, gender, and household distributions of people, commuting and travel patterns, workplace locations and size distributions, school location and size distributions, and the mixing patterns of people (21) (See Fig. 1) . These can in turn be used to estimate epidemic parameters such as transmissibility, basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, incidence, prevalence, and cumulative incidence. An inter-city flux model (4) (22 -24) , populated from census data (20, 21) , could be used to model travelling patterns and their effect on infection spread. The allocation, prioritisation, and distribution of scarce resources needed for implementation will be an important aspect of any future vaccination program, particularly in countries like India and Brazil with large populations and moderate per-capita spending on health (58) . Such resources include human resources, vaccine resources, rolling stock, and storage facilities. As a result, targeting decisions inevitably will need to be made (59, 60) . Therefore, the vaccination program becomes a resource allocation problem, and modelling optimal vaccination resource allocation is essential.In scenarios where limited resources have to be optimally distributed and used, cooperative game theory can be applied with maximum benefit. Often, the outcome of a cooperative game played in a system is equivalent to the result of a constrained optimisation process (61) : therefore, such cooperative games are often solved by using a linear programming framework or other optimisation tools. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, minimisation of epidemic parameters, such as incidence or prevalence, minimisation of economic costs of the pandemic, minimisation of mortality, and minimisation of disruption to daily lives could be some of the goals of governments and policy makers in deploying vaccines. Therefore, vaccination prioritisation could be modeled as a constrained multiobjective optimisation problem in real time (62) , and cooperative game theory, again coupled with simulation modelling techniques, could be used to solve it.Clearly, the multi-objective optimisation will have to take into account the nature of the vaccine: If the vaccine reduces the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, prioritisation should be given to targeting individuals, cities, or states that can act as critical nodes of transmission or superspreaders. Therefore, the goal will be to reduce transmission, or the number of diagnosed cases. Whereas if the vaccine reduces symptom severity or mortality, prioritisation should be given to individuals, cities, or states that are likely to have poor outcomes. Therefore, the goal will be to reduce mortality and morbidity.In this paper, we articulated and discussed the view that vaccination uptake will have the most significant influence in the ultimate control of the COVID-19 pandemic, and effective modelling of uptake using appropriate tools therefore is of paramount importance. We presented the case for game theory, coupled with simulation techniques, social network analysis, and agent-based modelling, to be the most significant mathematical and computational toolset available for this modelling. We highlighted that while the efficacy of the vaccines developed, as well as the efficiency of testing, contact tracing, and isolation procedures, shall remain important factors in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of the vaccination program and the level of vaccination uptake will surpass these factors in significance in the effort to finally contain, locally eliminate, and globally stabilise the COVID-19 pandemic.We discussed the modelling of vaccination decision making in detail, and articulated that this has two components: a) the decision making process by individuals to get the vaccine b) the decision making process by governments and policymakers to choose vaccinees, given the reality of limited vaccine doses at the initial stages of vaccination. We argued that the individual decision-making regarding vaccination uptake is influenced by a range of factors including demographics, physical location, level of interaction, the health of the vaccinee, epidemic parameters, and perceptions about the vaccine being introduced. Similarly, the decision making of the government will be influenced by epidemic parameters, the nature of the vaccine being introduced, logistics, management of human resources needed for the vaccination effort, and the amount of vaccine doses available. We explained that noncooperative game theory is ideally suited for modelling individual decision making behaviour regarding vaccination, while cooperative game theory can be used to inform government decisions regarding prioritisation.We believe that this paper will stimulate research and deliberation among all stakeholders which will aid the successful implementation of vaccination programs against COVID-19 and its decisive containment soon.","Australia","first author","2020-11-12","11"

Bailey et al. [2016] created a test collection for ClueWeb12-B using 100 topics and 10,835 collected query variations; and the recent CC-News English newswire corpus has also supplied query variations [Mackenzie et al., 2020] . Inspired by the double fusion experiments of Bailey et al. [2017] , experts solicited query variations for the Robust 2004 topics [Voorhees, 2004] as well as a few new topics, to be used for the RMIT [Benham et al., 2017 ] runs submitted to the TREC CORE 2017 track [Allan et al., 2017] . RMIT participated again the following year [Benham et al., 2018] , producing the second-best run by AP, using shallow judgments to identify and fuse the most effective query variations. In follow-up work, Benham et al. [2019] show that query fusion can be applied to support boosting effectiveness at query time using CombSUM.In this work, we apply query fusion to efficiently and effectively retrieve answers to questions from the scientific literature collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We dissect the decisions made between submission rounds, using additional judgments gathered for topics appearing in previous rounds. In late 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a health and economic disaster worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to a spike in scientific publications about the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, prompting to create the CORD-19 dataset in order to encourage IR-related explorations into COVID-related scientific outcomes.TREC COVID is the first TREC track to use the residual collection scoring pooling methodology described by Salton and Buckley [1990] (see also Moffat et al. [2007] ). Voorhees [2020] found that the effectiveness of our second first round run RMITBFuseM2 increased 33 positions in the overall system ranking when using P@5 and after additional judgments were gathered for those original topics during later rounds. Here we continue this line of inquiry using a post-hoc analysis and the full judgment set from all six rounds of the challenge.The COVID-19 pandemic differs from previously explored IR contexts by virtue of the rapidly changing new information published daily over an extended period of time. When combined with the wide variety of questions being asked about the disease, creating a practical IR evaluation exercise with the potential to produce valuable insights for future pandemics is a challenge. In the first round of the task RMIT submitted two double fusion runs. The first run RMITBM1 re-weighted relevance scores of documents by freshness, and RMITBFuseM2 served as a control to determine the efficacy of that time-biased approach. Since RMITBFuseM2 contained a proper subset of the techniques applied to RMITBM1, we first describe how that run was built.Processing The Corpus. The first round uses the CORD-19 dataset as at April 10, 2020, with the commercial, non-commercial, custom license, and bioRxiv subsets. The corpus includes a metadata CSV file with various attributes about publications, with fields including but not limited to: the title, authors, an abstract, and the filename of the associated PMC and/or PDF JSON parse of each publication.Participants were instructed to prefer the PMC parse over the PDF parse. Both of these parses were supplied in JSON, where the document text is dispersed in JSON objects with metadata about the context of each sentence in relation to its place in the document. That level of detail is superfluous for the retrieval models we employed, and we extracted the document text from these objects and transformed each parsed document into plain-text.The stipulated list of document identifiers for the first round excluded previously judged documents in an initial pool of three Anserini baselines judged to depth-40 . Many of the documents to be assessed did not have an associated PMC or PDF parse, with an abstract only. Since these records had no document to process we did not index them. (We subsequently found this decision to be detrimental, as abstract-only document records were judged in the first round).We used Terrier to index the corpus, as Kurland and Culpepper [2018] show that it can produce double fusion runs with higher effectiveness than the best submitted run to Robust04. Lin and Zhang [2020] recently showed that Terrier configurations are the most reproducible out of a series of tests applied to popular IR retrieval tools.Query Variations. The TREC COVID task operated with short preparation windows. Each team had roughly a week to submit runs after receiving judgments for the prior round. That short timeframe prevented the design of a crowdworker study to solicit query variations. Instead, the first author of the paper took on the task of creating 10 query variations for each of the initial set of 30 topics.For example the second topic was the query coronavirus response to weather changes, with the associated narrative:Seeking range of information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus viability in different weather/climate conditions as well as information related to transmission of the virus in different climate conditions. After having read that narrative and interpreting the question in the released topic set, these ten queries were created: Bailey et al. [2017] proposed double fusion as a technique to submit query variations to many retrieval models and fuse the results with a rank fusion algorithm. The technique was used previously to create the second-most effective TREC CORE 2018 adhoc run [Benham et al., 2018] .Initially, the aim was to use 16 different retrieval models with and without query expansion, 32 rankings in total. However limitations in the fusion script, and the short time-lines being worked to (meaning that software modifications were risky), meant that only eight retrieval models were used in the first round.Many Terrier retrieval models are derived from the divergence from randomness (DFR) model [Amati and van Rijsbergen, 2002] . Of the available options, the following variants were used to form rankings in the first round submission:• BB2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • BM25 [Robertson et al., 1995] • DFR BM25 (DFR) [Amati, 2003] • DLH (DFR) [Macdonald et al., 2005] • DLH13 (DFR) [Macdonald et al., 2005] • DPH (DFR) [Amati et al., 2008] • DFRee (DFR) [Amati et al., 2011] • Hiemstra LM [Hiemstra, 2001] Running the 300 queries against the eight models with and without expansion resulted in the generation of 4,800 rankings to depth 1,000. To fuse each of the 160 rankings per-topic, CombSUM was then employed [Shaw and Fox, 1995] , as described by Benham et al. [2019] . The run RMITBFuseM2 was the result of fusing across (for each topic) systems and queries.Freshness. Knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving. The second run, RMITBM1, was the result of combining a freshness score with the orderings present in the RMITBFuseM2 run, based on the hypothesis that facts disseminated four months ago are likely to be obsolete compared to an article published on the same topic more recently. With that, we parse the publication date out of the supplied metadata file and calculate the number of days since the paper was published. We then define an exponential decay on the variables days since publication, fitting freshness scores through the two values: (0, 1) and (120, 0.01). Figure 1 visualizes that fitted function, plotting the derived formula:The publication dates in the supplied corpus metadata file required cleaning. Some articles were erroneously published in the future on the last day of 2020; those dates were adjusted to be the last day of 2019. Other future dates corresponded to the date of a conference or when a journal article was to be officially made available, but not when the work was first disseminated. In such instances, where the days since publication produced negative integers, days was set to 0. On rare occasions, the date format would change from Y-m-d to Y, and so, it would be parsed as the first day of that year. Empty date strings were taken to be the first day of 2020.To combine a freshness score with the relevance score of a document assuming equal importance, the document scores in a run are adjusted to be between 0 and 1 with minimax scaling to be cast in the same units of freshness.A simple unweighted linear combination is used, and so, the adjusted document score is score(d, q) = M(s q , 0, 1) + t(days), (2) where M represents the minimax function, and s q refers to the relevance score of the document in response to the query q.After applying Equation 2 to RMITBFuseM2, and sorting the document list of each topic by the respective score(d, q), we get RMITBM1.Analysis. After the first round, the organizers shared the judgments and the evaluation summaries of each submitted run. Each run summary contained the measures: total relevant, total relevant retrieved, average precision, mean BPref, and mean NDCG@10. These measures are based on knowledge of how many relevant documents there are in the collection, which when judging to depth 7 in a residual collection pooling context seems unlikely to provide complete figures. A graph showing deviation of median P@5 indicated that our RMITBM1 run was less effective than anticipated.The organizers later reported rank-biased precision (RBP) [Moffat and Zobel, 2008] in subsequent rounds with an expected viewing depth of the top-2 documents (φ = 0.5). RBP does not rely on knowing the count of relevant documents for each topic -a statistic that has been argued to be untrustworthy for use in pooled evaluation campaigns [Zobel et al., 2009] . Figure 3 shows the monotonically decreasing RBP φ = 0.5 minimum score of each submitted run marked as a circle, with the associated score uncertainty (the residual) marked with a cross. Points marked in green indicate that the system was pooled, and brown points indicate otherwise, a convention used consistently throughout the paper. We were cautiously optimistic about the RMITBFuseM2 run after checking the RBP residuals, as it was more effective than RMITBM1, even though it didn't contribute to the pool of judgments. Figure 2 shows the monotonically decreasing topic Figure 2: Per-topic RBP φ = 0.5 evaluation of our submitted TREC COVID round 1 runs. Circles mark the RBP score, and the corresponding crosses mark the ""RBP plus residual"" score, indicating the maximum possible score for that topic if all unjudged documents turned out to be relevant. On the right, run RMITBM1 contributed to the judgment pool and has small residuals, whereas run RMITBFuseM2 on the left did not, and hence might potentially have identified additional relevant documents and obtained an even higher mean RBP score. scores for each of our two submitted runs. In Figure 2a , although the residual and minimum score are close on some topics, for many there is a wide diverge. In particular, where the cross is near 1.0, it means that none of the document retrieved near the top of the run for that topic had been judged to be non-relevant either. Figure 3 shows that the freshness reweighting function in Equation 2 was not as useful as we had anticipated. Either there were many relevant documents older than four months, or the freshness signal dominated the relevance signal in a way that harmed effectiveness. As only one run per-group had been judged 7 documents deep, there was no in-centive to tune a coefficient in a linear combination of relevance and freshness scores, as we risk overfitting our model to reduce the diversity of our run, and submitting a control run might not be judged.With the uncertainty brought about by the shallow judgments, we now move to discuss the decisions made in submitting our second round run.In assessing risk aspects of the pipeline used in the poorly performing round 1 submission of RMITBM1, we:• remove freshness re-ranking; • disable query expansion; • add extra eight retrieval models; and • include abstract-only documents.Although query expansion is a powerful tool, it often requires additional parameter tuning with relevance judgments to avoid query drift, as these parameters vary across corpora [Billerbeck and Zobel, 2004] . Noting the shallow judgments issue in the analysis provided in the previous section, we abandoned query expansion, uncertain as to whether it was reducing the effectiveness of the query fusion with the default Terrier parameters. We will instead explore this option in future work.As previously discussed, our implementation was able to fuse up to 16 runs for each topic, and with expansion removed, we returned to our original list of systems, adding in eight further alternatives: RBP φ = 0.5 Figure 4 : RBP φ = 0.5 evaluation of the 136 runs submitted to TREC COVID round 2, where circles mark the RBP score, and crosses mark the RBP score plus residual. Our RMITBFuseM1 run generated only average performance.• IFB2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • In expB2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • In expC2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • InL2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • LemurTF IDF [Zhai, 2001] • LGD [Clinchant and Gaussier, 2009] • PL2 (DFR) [Plachouras et al., 2004] • TF IDF [Spärck Jones, 1972] Combining these eight models with the original eight, and not employing query expansion, meant that there were again 16 systems being fused for each topic.Analysis. Figure 4 shows that the resulting round 2 RMITBFuseM1 run was slightly below average in effectiveness relative to other submitted runs. Benham et al. [2018] found that a small pool of judgments used to select the top-5 most effective query variations independently per topic led to effectiveness improvements. But the tight time constraints for TREC COVID, and a lack of medical expertise, meant that undertaking manual judgments was not an option.After inspecting the residuals shown Figure 2 , where RMITBFuseM2 only has one setting turned off compared to RMITBM1, it does not appear that a failure analysis based on the run components will be fruitful at this point. Voorhees [2020] provides a post-hoc analysis after the complete judgments had been shared, showing that the relative system orderings would have changed for RMITBFuseM2:, and noting: RBP φ = 0.5 Figure 5 : RBP φ = 0.5 evaluation of the 143 runs submitted to TREC COVID round 1 using the complete judgments provided at the end, to be directly compared against Figure 3 . Run RMITBFuseM2 was originally ""average"", but moves into the top-quartile. The largest change in the relative ranking of runs is the RMITBFuseM2 run which rises 33 ranks when using P@5 as the measure (21 ranks by NDCG@10, 7 ranks by MAP and none for BPref).The RBP analysis shown in Figure 3 hinted that RMITBFuseM2 could have been in the top-third of first round submissions, but all that could be concluded based on the round 1 judgments was that it was at least average in effectiveness. Figure 5 plots the same first round systems, but using the larger set of qrels, and shows that when measured by RBP, RMITBFuseM2 moves up 35 places. Enjoying the wisdom that comes with hindsight, if we had known that outcome, we might not have disabled the query expansion features mentioned in Section 3 in our second round submission. Figure 6 shows a boxplot of the relative ranking changes of all systems on the RBP φ = 0.5 Table 1 : Comparing the effectiveness of the extreme outlier runs for RBP φ = 0.5 rank changes shown in Figure 6 , where rank refers to the RBP system ranking measured against the first round runs. measure from the smaller first round judgment set to the full set. Most systems have modest changes in rank, however, there are outliers, with the extreme outliers labeled on the graph. Of these outliers: PS-r1-bm25none also generated a query manually from the topic descriptions; sab20.1.blind is a pseudo relevance feedback run without abstracts; and BM25R2 is a BM25 run where the index contains the title, abstract, and paragraph fields combined with Anserini's Covid-Query Generator to generate queries. Table 1 documents these RBP-based relative system orderings, along with the effectiveness scores and residuals for the first round judgment set compared with the complete judgment set. Although the residuals are smaller on the complete judgment set, it is possible that PS-r1-bm25none or sab20.1.blind could outrank our RMITBFuseM2 run with complete judgments, and could, potentially, result in further jumps in system ordering of 8 and 25 places respectively.We have documented our participation in the TREC COVID track. While early evaluation outcomes in the per-round analysis indicated that our runs were at best average, deeper judgments on the first round run RMITBFuseM2 lifted its system ranking by 35 positions (RBP φ = 0.5). We found the residual pooling approach to be a refreshing take on judgment solicitation with feedback, and welcome a similar approach being applied to future evaluation campaigns. Our recommendation would be to have fewer rounds and allow for more judgments per round, where each feedback round is evaluated with fixed pooling conditions. Not only would this reduce the volatility in judgment coverage observed in this year's track, it would also provide a higher quality test collection for detailed failure analyses of system submissions in all rounds. We also encourage the use of residuals as a way of gauging the extent to which measurements derived from pooled judgments can be considered to be reliable.","Australia","first author","2020-11-09","11"

There has been a massive international research effort to discover effective drugs and vaccines for this and other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Design of potent new coronavirus drugs is very important for future disease preparedness. However, for COVID-19, it is only feasible to use drugs that are already registered (off label use) or approved natural products that been through at least phase 1 clinical trials for safety assessment. These agents can be used in man quickly, as their safety and pharmacokinetics are well understood.Computational methods offer considerable promise for rapidly screening such drugs for SARS-Cov-2 activity by predicting their affinities for relevant virus protein targets. Recent papers in prominent journals have reported, for example, the application of computational de novo drug design based on the structures of the SARS-Cov-2 protease. [18] [19] [20] The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a promising target for SARS-CoV In pandemics, computational methods can quickly identify candidate drugs for repurposing, where speed is of utmost importance. Here we show how a well validated molecular docking followed by a high throughput molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) drug screening program can screen a large number of drugs and natural products to produce a short list of RdRp-inhibiting drug candidates. MDS calculations were used to predict the optimal binding poses and binding energies for 80 of the top hits from virtual screening on SARS-CoV-2RdRP. Finally we ranked the top candidates for COVID-19 based on binding affinity and novelty.There have been many computational studies aiming to predict which existing drugs and natural products may be inhibit the main protease, M pro , of SARS-Cov-2, but fewer studies have studied drugs for targeting the viral RdRP. The computational workflow used to estimate the relative binding affinities of drugs for the RdRP binding pocket are summarized in Figure 3 . The combination of robust Vina docking followed by MDS of the top 80 candidates yields improved performance relative to Vina docking alone. 23 The binding free energies calculated by both computational methods (see Methods) correlated very well (r 2 =0.84) and the free energies calculated by the thermodynamic cycle correlate with the Vina docking scores with r 2 = 0.64. The size of the binding site (area 2920 Å 2 and volume 5335 Å 3 ) tends to select larger ligands, many of which are quite flexible. Binding energy penalties due to ligand entropy are likely to be significant. Hence, substantial correlation between the Vina scores and the binding energies from MMBBSA and thermodynamic cycle are important because these algorithms treat ligand entropy approximately and in different ways. 24 Some have had their in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 determined experimentally ( Figure   4 ), further supporting our binding predictions. Two RdRp mutations occurred in the Indian population with prevalence >5% and these were analysed as possible targets for repurposed drugs. Docking using Autodock Vina predicted Elbasvir as the best inhibitor of RdRp in the Indian population, followed by Remdesivir andNatural products and analogues.Given the large degree of interest in repurposing antiviral drugs for use in treating COVID-19, natural product hits are of greater interest given their relative novelty. The drug with the strongest binding affinity to RdRP in our study was the natural anti-helminthic product,Ivermectin. Ivermectin and other avermectins and milbemycins are broad spectrum antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones derived from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis.Ivermectin's mode of action is by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels. Ivermectin has been shown to be effective against several Figure 5 summarizes the main interactions between Ivermectin and the binding site of RdRP and the docking pose from the MDS. 45 The activity of digoxin in these assays was substantially better than that of chloroquine or remdesivir. Figure 6 shows the main interactions of digoxin with the RdRP binding site and how the drug binds to the catalytic cavity. The main interactions are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Novobiocin was also selected as one of the top five best RdRP binders by Choudhury et al.using the MoleGro virtual docker software. 51 .Ergotamine and related ergot alkaloids have been predicted to be high binders to SARS-Cov-2 molecular targets, including the main protease, M pro . 20 There are a few literature reports of its binding to the SARS-Cov-2 RdRP enzyme. 52 There is an in silico predicted SARS-Cov-2 IC50 of 190µM. 53 Figure 9 shows the main interactions between the RdRP active site residues and ergotamine, and also illustrates the binding pose from the MDS. The interactions are also listed in Supplementary Table 2. Wu et al. generated homology models of 18 SARS-Cov-2 viral proteins and two human targets and used structure-based virtual ligand screening to identify potential inhibitors of these targets. 47 They identified a range of drugs and natural products that their computational methods suggested may inhibit the RdRP, including beclabuvir.Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, which blocks viral entry and enhances the antiviral type I interferon response. It has been identified as a potential inhibitor of the SARS-Cov-2 M pro enzyme in many computational studies. 20 We indinavir inhibits SARS-Cov-2 with an EC50 >10 µM and CC50 >50 µM (A549-hACE2 cells) 59 and an EC50 of 59 μM and CC50 >81 μM in Vero cells. 60 Again, this high validation success rate reinforced the view that our virtual screening protocols were able to identify existing drugs and approved natural products, for rapid testing in the clinic against COVID-19. The hits may also have activity against other coronaviruses.The identified drugs may be useful for treating COVID-19 patients and provide a rational computational basis for repurposing drugs for future pandemics and other diseases.The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Figure 11 ) was downloaded from RCSB PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M71) with a reported resolution of 2.90Å. Protein preparation, removal of non-essential and non-bridging water molecules, addition of hydrogen atoms and missing residues and loops for docking studies were performed using UCSF Chimera package (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). 75 AutoDock Tools (ADT) software was used to prepare the required files for Autodock Vina by assigning hydrogen polarities, calculating Gasteiger charges to protein structures and converting protein structures from the .pdb file format to .pdbqt format. 76 . A total of fifty top compounds selected from each of the Drugbank and CHEMBL compounds.Fifteen compounds were common to both database top hits. Molecular dynamics studies were conducted on the unique set of eighty-five compounds from both sets.The top screened compound complexes with protease were minimized with CHARMm force field. The topology files of the ligands were prepared from Swissparam (http://www.swissparam.ch/) 78 and minimized in Gromacs2020 (http://www.gromacs.org/). 79 .Docked complexes of ligands and COVID-19 M pro protein were used as starting geometries for MD simulations. Simulations were carried out using the GPU accelerated version of the program with the CHARMm force field I periodic boundary conditions in ORACLE server.Docked complexes were immersed in a truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules.The solvated box was further neutralized with Na+ or Cl− counter ions using the tleap program.Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions. The cut-off distance for the long-range van der Waals (VDW) energy term was 12.0 Å. The whole system was minimized without any restraint. The above steps applied 2500 cycles of steepest descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. After system optimization, the MD simulations was initiated by gradually Calculations were also performed for up to 100 ns on few compounds to ensure that 20ns is sufficiently long for convergence. Duplicate production runs starting with different random seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be determined.The binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were evaluated in two ways.The traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated SARS-Cov-2 protease and small molecule ligands and that of the bound complex and derive the binding energy by subtraction.ΔG (binding, aq) = ΔG (complex, aq) -(ΔG (protein, aq) + ΔG (ligand, aq)We also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) tool in GROMACS that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of the complex. The method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations. where ΔG (R:L,solv), ΔG (R,solv) and ΔG (L,solv) are solvation free energies of complex, receptor and ligand, respectively.As we noted in a previous SARS-Cov-2 drug repurposing paper targeting the main protease, 20Guterres and Im showed how substantial improvement in protein-ligand docking results could be achieved using high-throughput MD simulations. 23 for p in part:","Australia","first author","2020-11-29","11"

Alternatively, we might ask, what does it mean to develop an ethics in response to the COVID crisis? These are two very different questions, and given the working premise of this essay-namely, that ethics can be defined as the process of ongoing dialogical deliberation on basic normative questions of human practice for the purpose of instituting principles for good action-these questions have very different consequences. It sounds like hair splitting, but the first question, based on what might be called an engaged ethics, I will argue, is critically important. The second, based on a reactive ethics, has the tendency to distort good practice.The key point here is that, rather than being developed ex nihilo or as a narrow response to a particular crisis situation, an ethics should ideally be developed in relation to the human condition as understood both in and across time and place. In fact, I would suggest that a crisis is the worst time to develop an ethics. Crises are arguably times for thinking through and applying already-developed and well-debated ethical frameworks. They are not for thinking and acting on the spot.The current tendency towards taking seriously the question posed in a reactive register seems to be leading either to individualized and crisis-ridden agonism (usually a struggle with oneself) or to ethical algorithmics and systems of codified decision-making (usually a set of precepts handed down to others). I say this carefully. These are tendencies. There is usually a comforting rhetoric associated with such tendencies which disavows the dominant direction of their approaches and which makes it crucial to read them with critical care.The first tendency is illustrated by the difficult and important decisions that individuals are now making every day as they avoid people on the street or decide whether or not to visit a distressed loved one. Does one establish eye contact with a stranger when giving that person a wide berth in the street? Is the other person being antisocial by wearing a mask-or by not wearing a mask? Should you tell those wearers and non-wearers your views on the matter? Is it OK to visit an aged parent during a physical distancing period, or not? Do black lives matter more than possibly spreading the COVID infection? And, if I decided not to go to the ""Black Lives Matter"" rallies, is it now OK to go to the football? All of these are confronting and personal decisions. Ideally, one's responses to them should be based on personal reflection and social dialogue rather than just ""what feels right."" This kind of ethics is a relativizing ethics of agonism-not unimportant but only one way of making ethical decisions. 1 The second tendency is illustrated by the number of discussions initiated during the COVID crisis about who should be supported medically when there are scarce resources. One lineage of modernist ethics reverts to algorithmic-like guides, where the ontological form of that kind of decision-making is left as an uninterrogated black box while the details of how one should act are supposedly made clear. Who should get a ventilator when there are not enough for everyone? Who should be supported by intensive care? Unfortunately, when life-anddeath questions hit us, this constructivist lineage of thinking all too quickly moves to devise guiding codification systems that legitimize and indeed push certain outcomes. For example, they direct a medical practitioner to choose between this or that patient as ""high priority"" or ""low priority."" My critique will become damning here, but just as I do not want to dismiss relativizing ethics altogether, I will also seek to recuperate constructivist ethics (suggesting that both need to be reflexively re-engaged in a larger understanding of what it means to act ethically).Reactive constructivist approaches typically go down the path of resource-allocation frameworks:How Should We Prioritize Patients who are Eligible for Admission to ICU? How exactly this is done may depend on local circumstances. To simplify, we will consider allocation to two main groups:(a) High Priority: Those who, on the basis of their current medical condition, are highly likely to re-cover and would benefit longterm from admission to the ICU. (b) Low-Priority: Those who, on the basis of their current medical condition, may recover after ad-mission to the ICU. This is, mainly, a medical judgement, and as such it will take into account multiple factors about each individual patient, including the medical condition of the patient, their expected tolerance of the treatment, the expected outcomes of treatment, the existence of co-morbidities where these are relevant to expected benefit, etc. Decisions should not be made simply on the basis of age, but other things being equal, length and quality of expected post-ICU life will be relevant. These overall judgements are to be driven, ultimately, by the key idea of ""best value"" use of any resource. (Dawson et al. 2020, Step 3 under ""6. How Should We Decide How to Allocate Scarce Resources?"" [University of Sydney Health Ethics])Why, during a time of crisis, is a patient's recovery potential the key to understanding whom we should prioritize in giving care? In this case the answer to that question is clothed in a (tautological) claim that assumes the self-evidence of the issue. First, say the authors of this document, ""once resources are scarce our primary obligation is to ensure that we gain the best value we possibly can from the expenditure of that resource"" (Dawson et al. 2020, ¶1 under ""6 . How Should We Decide How to Allocate Scarce Resources?""). Second, the meaning of ""best value"" is assumed to coincide with best recovery rate. And why should this be the case? In this document the answer is contained in just one sentence: ""we believe we are obliged to focus on using scarce resources as efficiently as possible, and at this crucial point we must focus on 'best value'"" (Dawson 1 Agonism, referring to the struggle with one's self in the process of deciding what is ""good"" or ""right,"" is treated here as a form of postmodern ethics to the extent that there is afforded no ground upon which to stand except the particularism of where you happen to be or feel at the time. Rosi Braidotti's nomadic ethics (2006) exemplifies this kind of particularistic mobile ethics. Even as, like many postmodernists, she tries to reject the critique of relativism, she offers no standpoint other than that of the ""nomadic, dispersed, fragmented"" subject (2006, 4) . For a more reflective and non-individualistic version of postmodern ethics, see Zygmunt Bauman's Postmodern Ethics (1993 Step 3 under ""6. How Should We Decide How to Allocate Scarce Resources?"", emphasis added). Round and round the modernist efficiency circle the argument goes, with the phrase ""we believe"" offering the only way out of the tautology. In the words of Bryan Mukandi, written in response to a parallel move by different authors, ""They view COVID-19 not as a something that has emerged over time as a result of our social configuration and political choices, but as something that appeared out of nowhere, an atemporal phenomenon"" (2020, ¶1).Lest it be thought that this kind of healthrationalist thinking is unusual, let me quote recent comments by the vice chancellor of Melbourne University, Duncan Maskell, to the Australian national press. ""The question everyone is skirting around here,"" he says, ""is what is the appetite in any country for disease and mortality associated with this virus"" (Le Grand 2020, ¶4). If a decision to lockdown social interaction now, with all its economic consequences, has consequences for future mortality, then it ""would be crazy if, hypothetically, we stop 100 people [dying] from the virus but over the next two years, 200 people died from [the effects of] poverty and mental health"" (Le Grand 2020, ¶6). This is a real question, but it works more like a debating point if it is not located in a larger context. One issue, among many, is that such a position is non-verifiable except perhaps in retrospect. A second is that such consequentialist ethics tends to be blinkered and narrow in its focus. Why has that question of priorities come to the fore when, on the one hand, across the world, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, a child dies every five seconds from poverty-related causes, and on the other hand, our record of financial support is meagre and declining. Duncan Maskell's way out is to turn to an algorithmic health-calculation called QALY-quality-adjusted life years. We should be looking after those who have the longest to live with the best quality of life, he suggests: ""It boils down to a basic but very hard moral philosophy: What is the value of a 90year-old's life versus the value of the continuing livelihood and happiness of a 25-year-old?"" (Le Grand 2020, ¶8).These kinds of judgements-from-nowhere are the basis of one of the most influential contemporary constructivist approaches to ethics-John Rawls' A Theory of Justice (1971). Rawls suggests that agreement about a set of general principles can be achieved through positing a hypothetical group of rational persons from whom all the particularities and identities and attachments of their lives have been abstracted. He places this group behind a ""veil of ignorance."" From that position any knowledge that persons have of their own standing in the world is stripped away. They are, in effect, lifted into the position of being universal persons (aka modern liberals) with no conception of what this world looks like. They are afforded-or, in this case, reactive constructivists afford their systems of decision-making-the condition of supposed neutrality. This allows for different variations on codified processes and lists to take over from the complexity of particular situations, whether it be ""best value"" calculations or QALY assessments.Locating these questions in actual examples shows how dangerous such codified decision-making could be. If, for example, recovery from COVID-19 is affected by the social conditions of health, and if an Aboriginal person and an African-American person are on a ward needing care alongside a middle-class non-Aboriginal person, given that two of those persons are more likely to come from a health-affected background (Millett et al. 2020; Fouad et al. 2020) , then a decision based on the potential for patient recovery as to whether or not they are of a ""high priority"" or ""low priority"" would lead our reactive constructivists down the path of confirming the outcomes of structural racism. By the same argument, if a disabled person is judged as having a lower QALY assessment, and this leads to deprioritizing their healthcare, then we are confirming another kind of abstracted discrimination.Unfortunately, these two alternative orientations to ethics-an agonistic form of relativizing ethics and a codifying form of constructivist ethics-have become central to mainstream ethics with little interrogation of their ontological grounding. And in the current period we tend to jump between the best and worst versions of them according to what we feel seems most appropriate. As individuals we tend towards agonism, and as members of institutions we tend towards semi-systematic codification. Codification is the chosen path of the Sydney University writers and the University of Melbourne vice chancellor, but with the words ""we believe"" or ""my personal view is,"" those authors also allow themselves a flip back into an unstated relativizing ethics.Both directions, the first postmodern in orientation (relativizing the basis of ethics) and the second modern (constructing the terms for ethical judgement), potentially make valuable contributions to ethical dialogue, but each tends to operate as if offers a singular choice. My argument is that these choices are not good in themselves. If, on the one hand, it is argued that the COVID crisis entails remaking the basis for ethical considerations, then we have entered the world in which ethics has been relativized as postmodern agonismthat is, as particularized standpoints, with each having its own validity. In this world, there is no stable foundation to thinking about good action. From this standpoint, persons, communities, and organizations face such new and confounding complexities that ethical issues can only be confronted by thinking on the run.If, on the other hand, it is argued that we should set up codification principles for what amounts to survival of the fittest, we risk returning to the deeply skewed ""neutrality"" of lifeboat ethics. Lifeboat ethics has an inglorious history, most famously used by Garret Hardin (1974) to argue that in these times where the earth's population makes the planet unsustainable there is no point in affording valuable resources to the poor (or elderly). Lifeboat ethics is built on an apparently simple story. Only a certain number of people can fit on the boat that will save lives. Who are you going to choose and on what basis? Will it be the fittest, those who will make the greatest contribution to future survival, or the most vulnerable, etc.? Hardin concludes that we, the rich, need to choose ourselves because otherwise the poor will overrun the planet through excessive procreation. Like game theory and rational choice politics, this kind of ethical standpoint abstracts from social life to give the impression that such situations actually exist in the world. However, even an intensive-care ward is located in a hospital, and a hospital is located in a region, usually with other hospitals, and a region is part of territory with other resources, capacities, and possibilities, all of which are relevant here. In other words, resource-allocation questions should involve layered political and ethical debates across constituents and citizens. Any logic that reduces human value to numeric indicators, as María Antonia González Valerio and Rosaura Martínez Ruiz write, is ""to reduce the possibilities for thought, and abruptly to turn philosophy itself into a hideous ideology of discrimination, exclusion, and necropolitics"" (2020, ¶4).The tension between constructivist and relativist ethics does provide an alternative, but it is one that is largely forgotten in the reactive register-an ethics of care. 2 Its primary orientation is constructivist but without being narrowly codifying. It gives no straightforward answers, but in the version that I would like to project it has the capacity to build upon older forms of ethics-what I will call analogical ethics and cosmological ethics-while responding to the ""end of certainty"" arguments which dismiss the foundational claims of these older approaches.Analogical ethics, once dominant in customary societies, emphasizes the right way to sustain embodied relations between persons and persons, and between persons and animals or things, by working analogically from animated nature-culture. An ethics of care can be developed that emphasizes the relational nature of ethical work without depending upon analogical and perceptual grounding or romanticizing animist understandings. Here lived relations of face-to-face reciprocity, mutuality, and even negotiated boundary-crossing become acutely relevant to contemporary ethics, translated for very different and more abstracted layers of social life.Cosmological ethics, once dominant in traditional societies, emphasizes the Transcendental or Natural basis (in capital letters) of ethical decision-making-for example in the tradition of Christianity, removed from the lives of mere mortals and, at the same time, returned to the flesh as a sustaining lived metaphor of the exemplary-sacred. Cosmological ethics provides a more abstract way of approaching an ethics of foundations than analogical ethics. It tries to get to the bottom of the meaning of life by abstracting from analogical ethics in three ways: firstly, it finds exemplary carriers of meaning such as Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed; secondly, it begins to codify rules for living that are written outside the stories of the law-givers-the Ten Commandments, the Halacha, Sharia, Dharma, and so on; and thirdly, it begins to reflect upon an ethics of care through axioms that are said to be basic to being human. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Show hospitality to others and honour your guest (note here that the words hospital and hospitality are etymologically linked). An ontologically grounded ethics of care has the capacity to work with these generalizing axioms-they are surprisingly common across different traditions-while not necessarily taking on their search for the immanent-transcendental exemplifiers of such practices.Constructivist ethics by comparison sought, more or less, to stand alone by the eighteenth century in relation to these two prior forms, even if many transitional documents such as Thomas Paine's The Rights of Man still appealed to natural law (with ""natural"" now in lower case). Kant's categorical imperative was one turning point here, in effect universalizing the ""do unto others"" injunction as means not ends. While dominant forms of contemporary constructivism take this in a codifying direction, it is possible to develop an alternative pathway, one that is critical of its own rationalism and able to codify but in a contingent way. Writers from Joan Tronto (1993) to Maria Puig de la Bellacasa (2017) have provided us with different ways of thinking that I can only gesture to here, but they require us, at the very least, to consider working back and forth between impure on-the-ground engagement and reflexive consideration of generalized principles that themselves will come into tension with each other.In these terms, an alternative ethics of care would not be making lists, dividing ""high priority"" and ""low priority"" patients, and making pronouncements on whose lives we should be valuing more. It would be working with constituencies and affected communities, and across civil and political society, to initiate dialogue and action on these matters. It might even come up with written principles and guidelines, but it would not start with necro-procedures. And it certainly would not evoke the tragedy of lifeboat ethics or comfortable thinking about the lesser importance of the elderly. What is the value of a ninety-year-old life? A philosophy or politics that begins with that question invites invidious counterquestioning.","Australia","first author","2020-11-09","11"

The clinical disease, COVID-19, was declared a global pandemic by WHO in March 2020 [2] . Data on neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 are limited [3] [4] [5] . The need for respiratory support in infants with COVID-19 is uncertain.Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been a cornerstone treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome for >40 years. CPAP use has extended in recent years to include infants with viral respiratory disease [6] . Bubble CPAP is a popular means of providing respiratory support in these infants. The expiratory limb of the bubble CPAP circuit vents through an underwater seal [7] , creating bubbles. The resulting pressure oscillations are transmitted Davis back to the nares and to the lung; hence, the bubbling delivers a variable rather than constant pressure [8] . These pressure oscillations (frequency) may improve acute respiratory mechanics compared to constant delivery pressure consequent to recruitment of atelectatic alveoli [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .CPAP generates aerosols and therefore may promote transmission of viral particles [12, 13] . Electrostatic filters remove viruses from expired gas, offering protection to health care staff and are recommended in international guidelines [14] . Manufacturers of electrostatic filters recommend electrostatic filter replacement every 24 h [15] . One reason for these recommendations is the possibility of moisture saturation of the electrostatic filter which would increase resistance to airflow, increasing circuit pressure and work of breathing. We hypothesized that progressive moisture saturation of an electrostatic filter placed in humidified bias flow would result in increased circuit pressure. We aimed to determine how the placement and position of an electrostatic filter in a bubble CPAP circuit impacts the magnitude and stability of the delivered pressure in an in vitro model.An in vitro study was conducted at the University of Western Australia in April 2020. A simulated in vitro neonatal lung on a bubble CPAP model was created by connecting a test lung (Dräger, Lubeck, Germany) to a bubble CPAP generator (Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand). An infant nasal CPAP cannula (Size 4, Hudson RCI, Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) was interfaced between the bias flow circuit and the test lung. Humidified bias flow (MR290; Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) was set at 6 L/ min (of air). CPAP was measured at the proximal pressure line connector of the CPAP cannula using a physiological pressure transducer and dome (MLT844; ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia). The bubble CPAP generator and humidifier were set below the test lung, which was maintained on a radiant-heated neonatal cot (Cosy-Cot; Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand). The CPAP generator was positioned below the circuit to promote free water drainage into the generator throughout the experiment without regular intervention. The cot warmer was set at 75% of maximum heat setting on the manual mode. Environmental ambient temperature was 23.9-24.7°C throughout the recording periods.A DAR TM pediatric-neonatal electrostatic filter (size: small; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) was placed at one of 2 points in the breathing circuit: on the CPAP probe immediately before the exit of the bias flow into the water column (pre-generator; Fig. 1b ) or at the bias flow exit point, normally used as the water inlet (post-generator; Fig. 1c ). A new filter was used for each experimental repeat and was weighed before and after each trial. A bubble CPAP circuit without a filter was used as the control (Fig. 1a) for the 2 experimental arms. Each filter position and control was repeated 3 times.The pressure signal was amplified, digitized (ML880; Power-Lab ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia), and recorded continuously for 18 h (LabChart 8, ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) onto a laptop computer. This duration was chosen to reflect likely clinical exposure while remaining within the manufacturer's maximum recommended period for use (24 h) . Pressure and frequency data were collected at 5-min intervals in 10-s epochs at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz.The filter position fail point was defined as a mean pressure exceeding 9 cm H 2 O for >60 continuous minutes. Mean pressure variability in a no-leak bubble CPAP system is 25% greater than the set pressure [16] . Our fail point allowed a 25% increase on top of the set pressure to the nearest integer. The mean pressure and pressure difference (∆P) of the bubble oscillations for each group (pre-generator, post-generator, and control) were compared across the 18 h using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc correction. The frequency oscillations, unique to bubble CPAP, were assessed by transforming the mean pressure time series recording into the frequency domain using power spectral analysis. The mean frequency at the maximum power signal of the 3 circuit configurations was compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc correction. Filter weight and water volume in the circuit and overflow were compared by an unpaired Student's t test and one-way ANOVA, respectively. p values were assessed at a 0.05 significance level by SigmaPlot (Systat, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mean pressure with the filter in the pre-generator position increased progressively throughout the experiment and was significantly greater than control in 15 of the 18 h of the study. ∆P was lower with the filter in the pre-generator position from 3 h after study commencement. In contrast, the increase in mean pressure with the filter at the post-generator position was not significant compared to control. Post-generator ∆P was significantly lower than control only at hours 8, 12, and 17. The mean frequency at maximum power was similar for all circuit configurations (Fig. 2a-f ). The placement of an electrostatic filter in a bubble CPAP circuit changes the stability of pressure delivery. Positioning of the filter either immediately before or after the bubble generator increases the mean pressure delivered above a predefined fail point. Filter failure occurs earlier and is sustained when the filter is positioned im-mediately before the CPAP generator, compared to later and intermittent failure when placed in the post-generator position (point of exit of flow into the environment). Incorporation of a filter did not change the mean frequency of the maximum power in the oscillatory pressure waveform. The filter become more saturated with water when positioned in the pre-generator versus post-generator position. Placement of a filter in a bubble CPAP circuit reduces water accumulation within the circuit; however, the filter increases in weight over time, indicative of water absorption by the filter. Filter saturation increases resistance [17] . This may explain the increased mean pressure and dampened pressure waveform with the filter in the pregenerator position. Microbial filters marginally increase the imposed work of breathing measured over 18 breaths across a range of non-humidified respiratory support devices [18] . In comparison, our recordings were in a humidified system and were conducted over an extended period (18 h); using this more clinically applicable setting we clearly show that time and humidification affect mean pressure when the circuit configuration includes an electrostatic filter, especially when the filter is positioned prior to the bubble generator.Few studies report the volume of airway condensate in infants on CPAP. The estimated median exhaled rate of breath condensate production in moderately preterm infants receiving nasal CPAP is 0.07 mL/min [19] . If extrapolated over 18 h, the exhaled breath condensate would equate to 75 mL of additional liquid into the breathing circuit. This estimated condensate volume is substantially more than that measured in the experiments reported here. The lower volume of breath condensate in our study may be due to the in vitro nature of the study, which did not include a contribution of expired gas from the lung. The added contribution of humidified exhaled air may saturate the electrostatic filter sooner when used in the clinical setting. Thus, the clinician needs to be aware that filter changes may be required even sooner than suggested by our study to avoid potentially adverse increases in circuit pressure due to increased expiratory resistance through the saturated filter.A highly variable or noisy pressure waveform is characteristic of bubble CPAP. Similar to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, the amplitude of the bubble CPAP pressure waveform (∆P) is a fundamental determinant of carbon dioxide clearance [7, 20] . The variable pressure is also fundamental for stochastic recruitment of collapsed alveoli [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Bubble CPAP improved measures of acute respiratory mechanics and reduced lung injury compared to constantly delivered CPAP in preterm lambs [7] . Damping of the ∆P with the filter in the pre-generator position would reduce the efficacy of bubble CPAP for gas exchange and alveolar recruitment.Although the in vitro nature of this study may be considered a limitation, such models are used widely for describing the performance of respiratory support devices, including neonatal respiratory support modalities [16, 18, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Our in vitro experimental setup was a sealed circuit, measuring the stability of pressure without considering leak. Clinically, bubble CPAP pressure delivery is determined by the bias flow and degree of leak at the nares, as well as the degree of mouth closure [16] . Many neonatal units aim to minimize leak by using chin straps (to keep the mouth closed) and colloid dressings over the nares that not only reduce nasal trauma but also markedly reduce leak at the nasal interface. The instability of the delivered pressure over time should concern clinicians considering the use of such filters when treating premature infants with bubble CPAP, particularly when positioning the filter immediately before the bubble CPAP generator chamber.The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care workers is a major concern in the current pandemic [25] . Neonates are at risk of COVID-19, although evidence of infection is sparse. Newborns of mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 require precautions as recommended in recent published international guidelines [26] . Filters reduced the expired viral load from ventilator circuits when tested in previous pandemics [27, 28] and are recommended by several international societies [29, 30] . However, it is essential to consider how such filters impact the efficacy of the respiratory support and to identify required changes in clinical practice, such as frequency of filter exchange, to ensure safety of both health care workers and the patient.We conclude that the addition of an electrostatic filter into the circuit of a bubble CPAP system must be undertaken with extreme caution. The clinical impact of such filters may be the unstable and unintended delivery of excessive airway pressure resulting in unwanted side effects such as air leak. Placement of a viral filter in the expiratory circuit immediately before the bubble CPAP generator chamber is not recommended. The excessive drift in mean pressure delivery and damping of the pressure waveform with the filter in this position presents a safety risk for the infant that outweighs the benefit of preventing cross infection. The addition of the filter at the flow exit point for the CPAP generator (post-generator) may be acceptable but requires monitoring of the pressure in the circuit at regular intervals. The manufacturer of this filter recommends changing it every 24 h. Based on the data presented, changing the filter at least every 12 h, and likely every 8 h, should be considered when used in bubble CPAP.This paper is exempt from ethical committee approval as it was conducted in a laboratory without the participation of human or animal subjects.","Australia","first author","2020-11-27","11"

This project evaluates an expressive writing intervention to help people living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cope with distress related to SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 (i.e., a disease resulting from the virus) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.IBD is an inflammatory condition affecting 3 million people in the United States [1] and 85,000 Australians, with symptoms including diarrhoea, faecal urgency, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and fatigue. IBD is chronic and increasingly considered a disease of braingut interaction, with emerging evidence of the bi-directional brain-gut and gut-brain links [2] , translating into a significant mental illness comorbidity (i.e. >60% of patients report clinically significant anxiety during disease flares [3] ). A large proportion of patients with IBD receive immunosuppressive medication and may be at higher risk of complications if they contract SARS-CoV-2 virus. A recent survey showed that 64% of 3815 respondents reported that immunosuppressive drugs increased risk of infection and 30% believed that IBD itself increases the risk of developing COVID-19 [4] . In addition, the recent COVID-19 related product shortages, specifically those relating to medication, protective equipment and toilet paper, but also challenges in accessing care, have presented a novel and additional stressor for this population. Further, isolation enforced by the governments in some countries or self-imposed to protect oneself from the virus is yet another stressor and a possible contributor to future risks of social anxiety. These factors have resulted in significant distress expressed by the members of the IBD community [5] . For example, a COVID-19 focused survey (n=124) showed that close to 50% of patients with IBD reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and 20% of depression [6] . To date, studies have not documented positive aspects of COVID-19 pandemic for those with IBD but these could potentially include lower distress due to not being faced with anxiety-provoking situations such as lack of knowing where the toilet is, lack of stress associated with travel, work or socialising. Nonetheless, these potential benefits are likely to be overshadowed by the overwhelming fear of catching the virus or infecting others [4] .Psychotherapy trials for those living with IBD who report distress are scarce [7] , with most existing trials testing interventions with unselected IBD samples (i.e. anyone with IBD) and focused on disease activity. No psychological interventions focused on coping with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has been conducted in an IBD population to date. Such interventions can facilitate individual's processing of challenging situations more effectively and facilitate emotional regulation resulting in improved physical and psychological functioning.Disclosing one's thoughts and feelings (experimental disclosure) concerning difficult events through expressive writing has been shown to lead to broad health improvements. A major comprehensive meta-analysis on experimental disclosure (n=146 RCTs) demonstrated significant improvements in psychological outcomes, including distress, anxiety, depression, anger, positive functioning and ability to make sense of a traumatic event [8] . In terms of physiological and health outcomes, significant improvements were seen in immune functions, specific disease outcomes and illness behaviours. Work-related outcomes and social relationships were also significantly improved (with small to medium effect sizes ranging from -0.291 to 0.592). A more recent meta-analysis on expressive writing in cancer (n=13 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof RCTs) showed significant (though small) improvements in cancer symptoms and quality of life [9] . However, while expressive writing interventions are effective for a variety of outcomes and have high satisfaction, some participants do not perceive them as helpful or engaging and their efficacy is dependent on individual differences, e.g., optimists observe greater benefits [8, 10] .Several theories propose how expressive writing may improve a broad spectrum of outcomes. Inhibition theory links its effects to Freudian concept of catharsis where expression of inhibited thoughts and feelings may release stress and consequently improve other biopsychosocial outcomes. However, experimental research has shown that people equally benefit from writing about imaginary emotions and thus it is doubtful that writing helps through releasing unresolved internal conflicts [11] . Cognitive-processing theory posits that writing helps via allowing people to gain insight into what they have experienced, to make sense of a traumatic event and integrate a difficult experience into their self-concept [12] . Self-regulation theory proposes that writing creates opportunities to observe oneself expressing and controlling emotions, boosting one's self-efficacy in regulating emotions [13] . The social integration model experimental proposes that writing interventions work because they change the way people interact with their social world [14] . The exposure model compares writing about a traumatic event to flooding therapy useful in treating PTSD via confronting and relieving trauma and eventually extinction of unpleasant thoughts and feelings [15] . Each of the models has been critiqued in the recent meta-analysis but the greatest support is available for the exposure model [8] .Pennebaker's expressive writing intervention has been one of the first and most influential expressive writing interventions to date [16] , comprising four short writing sessions, with its various derivatives tested widely [8] . In the context of gastroenterology, it has been piloted in one non-randomised trial, which included patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n=103) [17] . Significant improvements at 1 and 3 months were observed in IBS severity. To date, no randomised control trials of expressive writing have been conducted on inflammatory gut conditions, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (subtypes of IBD).Expressive writing offers promise for IBD patients since it may improve immune functions and reduce distress [8] . Following the recommendations from the meta-analyses on expressive writing and the relevant study on IBS [8, 17, 18] , we propose to adapt Pennebaker's evidencebased intervention by adding an element of gratitude writing. Although good-quality systematic reviews are lacking on the effect of gratitude writing, some early trials (n=293) reported its significant benefits [19] on mental health as compared to no intervention controls or expressive writing controls. Gratitude, and a related concept of resilience (i.e. human ability to bounce back from adversity), can protect victims of disasters against post-traumatic stress, with resilience acting to prevent an adverse response to trauma and gratitude promoting positive outcomes post-trauma [20] . In the IBD context, resilience has been associated with lower disease activity and fewer surgeries as well as improved quality of life [21] .Further, since the literature supports the exposure model as the most likely explanation of how writing interventions work [8] , the benefits to those with IBD may be because of the high co-morbidity of IBD with post-traumatic stress disorder [22] and because those with history of trauma (IBD diagnosis is often considered a traumatic experience) respond particularly well to writing interventions [8] . Further, of all the examined outcomes, writing interventions are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof particularly effective for distress, immune parameters, specific disease outcomes, with higher effect sizes reported in those with pre-existing physical health problems [8] . In addition, stress is a significant moderator of the effect of writing interventions, with those reporting high stress receiving greatest benefits. Those with IBD report very high perceived stress which has been associated with poor disease activity [23, 24] .Finally, convincing meta-analytic evidence [8, 18] demonstrates that expressive writing may be:1. particularly useful to participants with poorer health (higher reported health effect sizes than in other populations) 2. more effective when undertaken at participants' home (higher psychological health effect sizes than studies in which participants wrote in a controlled setting) 3. more effective if sessions last at least 15 minutes (larger effect sizes than studies with sessions that lasted less than 15 min) 4. more effective when the intervention includes three or more sessions (marginally larger effect sizes than studies with fewer than three sessions) 5. more effective when participants write about recent challenging events (larger effect sizes compared to older events) 6. more effective when participants are asked to write about specific questions or examples (larger effect sizes than studies that did not give directed questions or examples) 7. more effective when participants are not asked to hand in their writing to the investigators (marginally higher psychological health effect sizes than studies in which participants turned in their writing) 8. equally effective if handwritten or typed. 9. more effective when facilitated rather than unfacilitated. Therefore, we designed our brief facilitator-assisted online intervention, specifically following the above evidence-based strategies and propose to investigate:Whether the expressive writing intervention improves patient distress compared with an active control group at post-intervention and 3 months since baseline.Whether the expressive writing intervention improves patient anxiety, depression, stress, disease activity, quality of life, resilience, self-efficacy and sense of isolation at postintervention and 3 months since baseline.We hypothesise that our expressive writing intervention will have a significant and positive impact on the symptoms of distress as compared to an active control condition.This protocol has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee in May 2020 (Ref. 2020-122). The trial was prospectively registered in the Australian New Zealand Trial Registry on 06 April 2020 (ID: ACTRN12620000448943p). The trial is likely to start recruiting in June 2020 and complete recruitment by July 2021. Figure 1 for a study design overview. A parallel randomised double-blind controlled trial, involving intention to treat analyses will be conducted. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: expressive writing intervention or active control, with a ratio of 1:1. Simple randomisation, with no blocks, using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation) will be used. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule (the study statistician) who is based at central administration site with no access to participants. No stratification is envisaged. Participants, as well as research staff assessing outcomes and analysing the data will be blinded to group allocation, with masking and an active control condition used for participants. Participants in both treatment arms will remain on their current IBD medication. All participants will complete questionnaires before and after the intervention (1 week) and at 3 months since baseline.Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis established using standard criteria (we will ask participants for the details of their gastroenterologist, and these will be verified by our team);  Distress: at least mild distress on K10 (scores 20-29);  Age: 18 years and older; receiving care in Australia, New Zealand or Singapore, able to read and write in English, with access to internet to participate in online intervention, able to download Zoom and available to participate for approximately 30 minutes for 4 consecutive days.Exclusion criteria: No distress based on K10 (scores under 20) as the intervention targets distress.  Severe distress based on K10 (scores 30-50 very high distress) as it is anticipated that these participants would require a more intensive therapeutic approach before benefiting from the current intervention. These participants will be contacted individually by the research team to indicate they are not eligible to participate due to screening highly for severe distress. We will then recommend that they seek additional support from their GP or other appropriate providers.Withdrawal criteria:Participants are free to withdraw at any time. We will ask about their reasons for withdrawal for statistical and reporting purposes but answering this question will not be compulsory. No aspect of participant IBD care will be affected by their decision to withdraw from the study. We will monitor dropout/attrition closely to be able to establish satisfaction with the intervention.Expressive writing intervention -This group will participate in the adapted evidencedbased [25] 4-day writing program. Participants will meet with the facilitator using Zoom four times in one week for approx. 30 minutes (25 minutes of writing time). Privacy of sessions will be ensured by using Zoom passwords and the waiting rooms which allow the facilitator to monitor who joins the session. Daily e-mail reminders about the online sessions will be sent during the 4 days of writing. The instruction each day will be (adapted from Pennebaker [25] ) ( Table 1 ). Participants will not need to share their writing with the study investigators to ensure free expression.Active control -This group will write about trivial untherapeutic topics provided by researchers (Table 1 ) for 4 consecutive days. Participants will meet with the facilitator using Zoom (audio required, video use is optional) four times in one week for approx. 30 minutes (25 minutes of writing time). Daily e-mail reminders will be sent during the 4 days of writing. On request, the active control group will be offered self-directed version of the intervention after the final follow-up.The intervention will be facilitated by Psychology research students. Facilitators will provide the intervention interchangeably to different groups (i.e., each facilitator will deliver intervention in both groups). See Table 1 for detail of intervention structure. Table 2 details the measures used in this study, including their scoring and assessment time.Participants will be recruited online via social media. They will be asked to email the researchers if they are interested in participating. They will then be asked to read and consider the study's Plain Language Statement and, if still interested, to sign a consent form and return to the investigators via email. Participants will then be asked to complete K10 to ensure their distress is within the mild-moderate range. Those eligible will then be asked to complete all the remaining baseline measures. Participants will be given codenames to facilitate data collection at multiple times. Participants will then be randomised to one of the two groups, informed about the starting date and sent the Zoom link with any necessary instructions. During each session, participants will be reminded they are not required to use video. They only need to be able to hear the facilitator. The facilitator will then provide the link to the distress VAS measure and after its completion writing will start. At the end of the session, the facilitator will provide the participants with another link to the distress VAS measure (both via Qualtrics). Sessions will continue for 4 consecutive days and attendance will be recorded each day. After the final day of the intervention the participants will be asked to complete the post-intervention measures. They will then be contacted after 3 months to complete the follow-up measures. Participants who complete the study including the 3month follow-up will be entered into a prize draw for one of ten AU $50 online gift vouchers. At the trial completion, participants will be debriefed about their group allocation.Two large, comprehensive meta-analyses on the beneficial effect of therapeutic writing for psychological distress in chronic disease suggest small improvements to psychological wellbeing compared to control and indicate that the effect is magnified in the presence of facilitators [8, 18] . As such, we power the study for a small but meaningful between-groups effect at post-intervention of standardised mean difference = 0.3. Using an alpha level of .05Journal Pre-proof and 80%, a minimum sample size of n = 128 is required. We assume a drop-out of 20%, so will recruit 154 persons (77 per group).We will use Qualtrics to collect the data at 3 time points and before/after each writing session. The data will then be transferred into SPSS for analysis. The data will be anonymized by adding code names. The files containing personal or identifiable data will be encrypted or password protected. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis, and significance tests will be two-sided at the 5% level. No adjustment for multiple testing will be made to p-values, however, effect sizes for each outcome measure will be presented.The study hypothesis will be tested with a series of linear mixed effects models, which are known to compensate for missing data. In these models, the dependent variable is the outcome measure, with predictors being Time, Group and the Interaction between Time and Groupthe coefficient for Interaction being the formal test of the hypothesis. A per protocol analysis will also be undertaken, with adjustment for adherence to intervention. The latter will be defined as ≥80% of sessions completed. Other adjustments (e.g., age, sex, disease activity, IBD treatment type) will be made, if required.IBD is increasingly considered a disease of brain-gut interaction, with emerging evidence of the bi-directional brain-gut and gut-brain links [2] , which translates into a high prevalence of anxiety and depression [3] . Conversely, anxiety and depression co-exiting with IBD have a significant impact on disease outcomes, such as IBD flares [26] , disease presentation [27] , hospital readmissions and surgery [28] . Even during remission, 28% and 20% of patients report symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively, while these rates rise to 66% and 35% during IBD relapses [3] . Therefore, a large proportion of this population could benefit from psychological screening and treatment. Yet, while the international IBD guidelines [29] and the Australian IBD Standards [30] recommend regular screening for symptoms of mental illness and incorporating mental healthcare in IBD management, very few (12.2%) patients actually receive the psychological help they need [31, 32] .A recent meta-analysis has showed that psychotherapy, and particularly cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT), improves quality of life and symptoms of depression in patients with IBD [7] , but also disease-related outcomes such as pain in other common gastrointestinal conditions [33] . Other psychotherapies, for example those targeting trauma, are increasingly being tested in gastroenterology in hope to identify alternatives for those people not engaging or responding to CBT. One example is emotional awareness and expression therapy which has been shown to reduce bowel symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in a recent RCT [34] . The proposed intervention will further contribute to the enquiry into the role of expressive interventions in gastroenterology populations.Minimal contact therapies have not received much attention in gastroenterology, although the preliminary evidence is promising in terms of reducing healthcare seeking behaviour [35] . In IBD specifically, little research on low intensity or online psychotherapy is available [7] . Given poor access to psychological care reported by people with IBD [36] , minimal contact online and low cost therapies such as the proposed intervention have a potential to fill the current gap in services. Further, the recent meta-analysis highlighted a dearth of interventions J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f focused on people ""in need"" of psychological therapy (e.g. those with comorbid distress), as most available trials have focused on the unselected patients with IBD (anyone with the diagnosis).To date, there have been no studies focused on expressive writing in people with IBD, very few online psychotherapies designed for people with IBD specifically or targeting distress particularly at the time of adversity, for example major disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Offering solutions to address high levels of distress currently experienced by the members of the IBD community is paramount to improving patients' emotional wellbeing. It can potentially also prevent stress-related flares, which can have serious implications for patients but also cost healthcare systems, already weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, more research is needed on moderators of psychological intervention effects in IBD. While a large number of moderators have been examined in previous writing interventions [8] , understanding IBD-specific moderators such as IBD activity and complications (e.g., fistulas), but also broader factors which have not been extensively studied in previous writing interventions for chronically ill cohorts such as disease duration, social support, self-efficacy, and resilience may help explain current limited long-term effects of psychotherapy in IBD [7] and inform future trials of tailored interventions for the subgroups likely to benefit. Other researchers have started pinpointing moderators relevant to gastrointestinal cohorts[37].If effective, this simple intervention can be a useful tool for patients and multidisciplinary health professionals supporting the IBD community. More broadly, the intervention can bring personal and societal benefits, particularly because it is low cost, can be easily implemented online, ensuring social distancing, and be made widely available throughout Australia and internationally, during future disasters and to help with trauma-related distress in IBD.While expressive writing has proven efficacy in reducing distress and improving broad biopsychosocial outcomes in a variety of contexts, many interventions conducted to date have produced small-moderate effect sizes [8] . Effect sizes for psychological interventions are generally low (e.g., 0.2 for psychotherapy [38] ) and the present intervention may produce even lower effects [8] . However, since the present intervention is low effort/cost in comparison to psychotherapy which takes weeks and is facilitated by a therapist who might not be easily available, we believe producing even a small effect is important and might be a good solution for people with no easy access to psychologists. Further, this study is about distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (largely due to fear of the possibility to contract the virus) and our advertising and the Plain Language Statement clearly refer to this source of distress. However, distress may have a variety of sources and not all might respond to writing or psychological interventions equally. The present study's results may therefore only apply to specific disaster-related distress scenarios. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ","Australia","first author","2020-11-04","11"

Day-to-day processes of commerce, transportation, recreation, and social interaction were disrupted and temporarily suspended or curtailed, especially during the imposed periods of lockdown. These disruptions of daily processes resulted in changes to soundscapes in particular to those of urban areas. This is reflected in a reduction of ambient traffic noises [e.g., Hastreiter (2020) ], but also in a reduction of community-wide signal sounds, such as church bells (Eggington, 2020) . Building on research conducted during the pre-pandemic period (Parker and Spennemann, 2020) , we will examine the impact of implemented public health measures on religious soundscapes in New South Wales (NSW) (Australia).We undertook a survey in 2018 to investigate past and current trends of church bell ringing practices across NSW, looking at the six most populous denominations of the Christian faith in 2016 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2017): Roman Catholic, Anglican, Uniting Church, Eastern Orthodox and Presbyterian and Reformed. Our original study used a mixed methods approach to solicit information pertaining to the presence/nature of church bells, frequency/ occasions on which they were rung, augmented with opinions and value judgments regarding bell ringing. While full results of the study are reported elsewhere (Parker, 2018; Parker and Spennemann, 2020) , we wish to highlight important results from this snapshot of 2018, to make a direct comparison to practices currently occurring due to imposed restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.A large proportion of Orthodox (91%), Catholic (78%), and Anglican churches (76%) reported bells on church premises, 1 such as a tower bell, altar/Sanctus bell, sacristy bell, recorded bell, or other bells. Churches from Orthodox and Anglican denominations had the highest representation across the majority of bell ringing activities, and a high proportion of churches from all denominations rang bells for regular services. Weddings saw a high frequency of bell use for all denominations, as did funerals for Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox churches. The majority of Catholic and Orthodox churches rang their bells more than twice per week, with Anglican churches ringing either similarly or once a week. 1 The results from 2018 show that bell ringing at that time was popular in many churches of Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox faith, with a majority of these churches having bells on their church premises, ringing them regularly, and ringing them for both sacred and secular functions. They also show that while churches from Presbyterian and Uniting Church faiths are generally underrepresented with respect to bells on their premises, a large number of churches who have bells rang them for regular services or for yearly events.

On 16 March the NSW Minister for Health and Medical Research introduced the first restrictions on gatherings of people to 500 under the Public Health Act. Two days later, the order was amended to restrict public gatherings, including church services, to 500 people outdoors and 100 people indoors. By 23 March, all churches were closed. 1 Church authorities responded by developing or activating response plans (Fisher, 2020a ) that reflected the changing government provisions (Fisher, 2020c) as well as innovative solutions, such as preaching outdoors from the steps of the churches (Patty, 2020) . Effective 31 March 2020, all of NSW was under Stage 3 lockdown, with public gatherings limited to two persons, and people were not permitted to leave their place of residence without reasonable excuse. Government imposed restrictions were gradually eased from 15 May 2020 (Fig. 1 ). Churches immediately followed suit, recommending the recommencement of services for 10 participants as of 15 May (Fisher, 2020d) , 50 participants as of 1 June (Fisher, 2020e) , and 100 participants as of 2 July 2020 (Fisher, 2020d) .The soundscape generated by church bells depends on the nature of ringing, whether bells are rung as part of liturgical practice, such as calls to prayer or mass, or whether bells are rung as peals, a form of bell music generated by change ringing. While the former requires a single individual to ring the tenor bell, the latter requires a group of bellringers acting in unison, which has obvious implications in times of social distancing rules during a pandemic.In order to ascertain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on church bell ringing, we first sourced denominationspecific directives for NSW churches regarding bell ringing. We then sent a brief targeted questionnaire to church individuals who expressed particular interest from our original 2018 survey, soliciting information pertaining to bell ringing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how ringing patterns have deviated from the norm. We combined these data with information from publicly available sources (including the Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers) to present a narrative on the effects (to date) of the pandemic on church bell ringing in NSW.In anticipation of the Stage 3 lockdown, the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney activated its own response plan aimed at ensuring that liturgical services could be provided during lockdown (Fisher, 2020f) . The diocese directed that bells be rung five times each day at specific times for prayer (4) and the midday Angelus, ""calling on the faithful to unite in a prayer for an end to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" with specific reference that ""the ringing of the bells will remind the faithful of the importance of pausing and uniting wherever they are in prayer for those suffering due to the coronavirus"" (Staff Writer, 2020).In the early stages of incremental restrictions, the Anglican Cathedrals of Parramatta (population 257 197), Sydney [population 2 085 000 (area of diocese only)] and Wollongong (population 295 669) rang their bells not only on Sunday, but also on Mondays and Thursdays to call for public services and prayer (Davies, 2020) , with the services to be delivered from the steps of cathedrals (Patty, 2020) , before their termination with the Stage 3 lockdown.Elsewhere too, bells were used to reaffirm the presence of the church in the community and to provide audible and public emotional support in smaller outer regional communities such as Mudgee (population 10 923 in 2016) (Palmer, 2020) , Glen Innes (population 8836) (Messenger, 2020) , and Moree (population 7383) (Harris, 2020) . This was the case in particular at the time of increasing restrictions, with additional ringing of bells initiated as ""a call to action, but also a way for the church to comfort people stuck in quarantine"" [David Robinson quoted by Messenger (2020) ].In some instances, this occurred daily, as in the case of the Anglican Churches in Moree (Harris, 2020) and Glen Innes, with the daily ringing at 9 am (Robinson, 2020) , and in Mudgee, with the latter ringing its bells seven times at 7 pm (Palmer, 2020) . Daily ringing continued at Glen Innes until restrictions lifted, returning to the usual pattern of weekly services and for special occasions (Robinson, 2020) . Church bells were also rung on special occasions, such as in support of frontline COVID workers, in places like Mudgee (Palmer, 2020) , and for ANZAC Day. Other churches played recordings of their bells, such as St. Matthew's in Albury which played 25 min of change ringing for Victory in the Pacific Day (Jefferies, 2020b) .Other congregations, however, fell silent during lockdown. Some Catholic churches, such as Albury (Wallace, 2020) and Leeton (Murphy, 2020) not only stopped calling mass (as there was none), but also stopped ringing the Angelus. Not surprisingly, it was noted that ""[d]uring the lock-down, it was quiet and unusual"" (Wallace, 2020) . For other churches (e.g., the Anglican church in Albury), the lockdown restrictions meant that manual ringing was prohibited, while technical failures also prevented electronically activated ringing of bells (Jefferies, 2020b) .Once the church services gradually resumed, bell ringing was no longer mentioned in the pastoral letters (Fisher, 2020e,d,b) , however, the physical activity of bell ringing continued to be restricted/regulated from 1 July 2020 by the requirement of a COVID-19 safety plan (MHMR, 2020; NSW Health, 2020). While many churches returned to normal services as soon as, or very soon after, regulations permitted (e.g., Catholic and Anglican Dioceses Sydney), in some instances the silence prolonged well past the reduction in restrictions. The Anglican Church in Tamworth, for example, did not resume services and thus bell ringing until mid-August 2020 (146 days of silence) (Bovis, 2020) . There are churches that have remained closed for services since the government order of 23 March and have not reopened since. For example, in consequence the tenor bell of the Uniting church in Albury, which until then had been rung every Sunday, has fallen silent (Jones, 2020).Imposed regulations also affected the convention of change ringing in many churches. Rapid change of events is clearly evident in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. With cathedral services suspended on 20 March 2020, the usual bell ringing associated with the Sunday services was no longer required, and a 5 min ringing was undertaken from midday for bi-weekly outdoor prayer services instead. Regular weekly evening bell practices were suspended two days later, with training limited to a maximum number of six ringers in the tower, until the cessation of all bell ringing activities on 30 March 2020 (Bosman and Perrins, 2020) . Other churches affected include: St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, where the bells were silenced on 19 March 2020 and ""rung down"" on 5 April, before an almost two month hiatus, with their return on 7 June with strict rules in place including the operation of the ropes by local members, and single operation of a rope by one individual (Hill, 2020) ; St Paul's, Burwood, where bell ringing was limited to four members in the tower from 7th June 2020 after an approximately three month hiatus-apart from a tenor bell which tolled regularly for all services at the church (including appropriately physically distanced internal and external services) save for a short period when church services were distributed electronically (Brock, 2020) ; and Hoskins Uniting Church, Lithgow, where all bell ringing was completely suspended until the creation of a Bellringing Management Plan and subsequent conditional return of limited ringing from July 5 2020 (Musgrave, 2020) . Interestingly, the aforementioned plan allows bells to be rung for regular church services only (limited to 6 ringers), but precludes ringing for other occasions, including practice sessions, for visitors, and for weddings or funeral services (Lithgow Bellringers, 2020).The major inhibitor for a return to full pre-pandemic ringing practices is the public health mandate to (a) maintain a 1.5 m separation between individuals and (b) that any room needs to provide space at a ratio of 4 m 2 per person. In essence, as most ringing rooms are too small and the ropes are usually less than 1.5 m apart, ringing is either completely suspended (Jefferies, 2020a) or limited to a reduced number of bell ringers (Perrins, 2020) . At the height of the pandemic, 64 towers from the Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers (ANZAB) had suspended all ringing due to imposed restrictions. On 15 August 2020, 21 NSW towers connected to ANZAB were still suspended, equating to 65.6% of change-ringing, or pealing towers in the state (Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers, 2020).The changes in church environment soundscapes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are not homogenous across regions or denominations. Some churches increased their frequency of bell ringing in communal support for the medical staff and humanity in general, almost in defiance against the difficulties at hand. In cases where churches increased bell ringing, soundscapes here would be richer in this sense, especially in comparison with the expected reduced occurrence of other urban environmental sounds as a result of movement restrictions. Such an example would be the soundscape of Glen Innes, with a seven-fold increase in bell ringing at the Anglican church, coinciding with regular ringing of the Catholic church (twice daily) and the Uniting church (weekly) (Robinson, 2020) (Fig. 2) . On the opposite end of the spectrum were churches that fell totally or largely silent during the lockdown period until they recommenced church services, either because it was unnecessary or unfeasible to ring bells, resulting in a reduced richness of soundscape. This applied, for example, to Anglican and Uniting churches in inner and outer regional areas such as Leeton (population 11 168), Tamworth (population 42 872) and Albury (population 54 477). In Leeton, the typical bi-weekly broadcast of recorded bells of St Peter's Anglican Church ceased for 70 days while the church was closed, apart from one calling at Easter (Murphy, 2020) . Setting aside additional ringing for weddings and funerals, St John The Evangelist Anglican Church, Tamworth, rang the bells thirteen times a week prior to COVID-19, with Saturday the only day the bells could not be heard (Bovis, 2020) . For the next twenty weeks its bells were silent. The resulting soundscape was likewise heavily affected at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, where not only the frequency of bell ringing was decreased (from 2.5 h to five minutes per week), but also with a reduced intensity of the sound source and subsequent sound richness (from 12 bells proficiently rung in tandem to a solitary bell rung by an office worker) (Perrins, 2020) . In some communities the change in soundscape was profound. Prior to the COVID lockdown, the Catholic Church in Albury had rung the Angelus daily at noon (Wallace, 2020) , the Anglican church had rung the Angelus three times each day and its peals at least twice a week (training and Sundays) (Jefferies, 2020a; MacLeod-Miller, 2020) , and the Albury Uniting Church its tenor bell every Sunday (Jones, 2020) . During lockdown the Albury soundscape was devoid of any church bell ringing sounds, and since lockdown ended, the only church bell was that of the Catholic Angelus being rung only on Sundays.There was a distinct lack of bells rung for weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this correlates with the lack of church-based weddings over this time. Whilst this is expected to partially correlate with imposed restrictions on the numbers permitted at weddings in NSW, many churches reported that the period of June-August (winter) was also generally poorly represented in 2019. It would be interesting to see how bells are represented for this activity and the resultant soundscape in NSW as Australia approaches spring and into summer.The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how a stochastic disruptive event can dramatically alter community soundscapes. With the reduction in ambient transportation noises due to the reduction in human activity during the lockdown period, the ringing of church bells created a stronger audible presence than otherwise. Likewise, the absence of church bells sounds made the COVID-19 silence even more pronounced.Unlike soundscapes that are a by-product of human activity and thus sensitive to changes in that activity (e.g., aircraft and traffic sounds), church bell ringing creates a soundscape that is directly influenced by purposive human action. We have shown elsewhere the myriad of values imparted by society on church bell ringing in NSW, being both religious and secular in origin (Parker and Spennemann, 2020) .The COVID-19 induced changes to urban soundscapes have brought to the fore the role and power of the individual. Some clergy acquiesced to the situation and embraced the physical shutting down of services as new reality, pausing all church bell sounds in the process. For others, however, COVID-19 enkindled a sense of defiance, whereby the ringing of the bells was construed as a public signaling system to alert the community of the continued presence of the church.It remains to be seen to what extent the pandemic engenders a ""new normal,"" with durably altered soundscapes, or whether old patterns reemerge once the community has put the pandemic behind it.","Australia","abstract","2020-11-01","11"

The subfamily coronavirinae contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Masters & Perlman, 2013) . The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recently adopted additional changes to the nomenclature of Coronaviruses to include the inclusion of subgenera replacing the elsewhile lineage classification system (Siddell et al., 2019) . Under this new system the genus Betacoronavirus was further classified into five subgenera Sabecovirus, Merbecovirus, Norbecovirus, Embecovirus and Hibecovirus (Siddell et al., 2019) . Betacoronaviruses generally infect animals such as mammals and birds, they are the causative agents of many pathogenic diseases such as transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBD), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Saif, 2004) . Coronavirus have been reported as early as 1930 (Masters & Perlman, 2013) but the earliest report of human coronavirus was in the year 1960, where two strains namely hCoV229-E and hCoVOC43 were described (Hamre & Procknow, 1966; McIntosh et al., 1967) . Generally Betacoranvirus have been observed to cause paucisymptomatic disease in man and are largely known to be zoonotic. It was not until after the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong and parts of China in 2003, that studies into the zoonotic origin of the incriminated pathogen SARS CoV revealed that the Chinese Rinolophid bats maintained a genetically related strain of the SARS CoV (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) . This finding sparked up interest in bat CoV research. Another coronavirus termed Middle East severe respiratory syndrome virus (MERS CoV) was reported in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) . Genetically similar strains to the MERS CoV were also isolated from Pipistellus, Tyloncteris and Neoromica bats (Annan et al., 2013) .In Africa large scale surveillance studies have identified diverse strains of coronavirus (CoV) circulating among African bats from Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria (Drexler, Corman & Drosten, 2014) . Studies have also provided evidence that the human coronavirus hCoV229E originated from African bat CoV (AfrBtCoV) (Corman et al., 2015) . Also, the rich fauna and biodiversity in Africa has made it a hotspot for emerging viral diseases. It is also inhabited by a diversity of bats which have been identified to serve as a reservoir of high consequence zoonotic diseases such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and Rabies (Annan et al., 2013) . Recently, a novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 was identified to be the cause of a pandemic which originally broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (Zhou et al., 2020) . Some studies have also postulated that the SARS CoV-2 probably spilled over into human population through a zoonotic event involving Chinese SARS-related BtCoV (Zhou et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) .The recent evidence of African bats as a potential reservoir host for several Betacoronaviruses (βCoV) gave rise to the conceptualization of this study which aims to investigate the spatial dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of βCoV among African bats.We searched for and downloaded partial or complete gene coding regions for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase sequences (RdRP) of Afr-BtCoV from GeneBank and the Virus Pathogen resource database https://www.viprbrc.org/. The data set generated contained African bat βCoV from eight countries, namely Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroun, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Madagascar and South Africa (n = 94), BtCoV from China, Hong Kong and Philippines in Asia; and France, Spain, Netherland, Italy and Luxemburg in Europe (n = 95). Mexico and Brazil (n = 3), Australia (n = 1) and reference African CoV OC43, CoVHKU1, MERSCoV, and alpha coronavirus from Africa (n = 35). Information such as country of origin, Host species, and date of collection were combined with the sequence information for the purpose of accurate phylogenetic determination. The final data stets had information from seven African countries, four European countries and three Asian countries. All the data used in this study can be assessed in Table S1 . Majority of the African BtCoV sequences were generated by nRT-PCR using primers targeting the 440 bp partial RdRP gene region (DeSouza et al., 2007) and Sanger sequencing. Full genome sequences of ZBCoV were generated by both Sanger and ultra high throughput sequencing (UHTP) sequencing (Quan et al., 2010) .Sequences were aligned using clustal W version 2.1 using default settings, the final alignment was 400bp in length. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in MEGA 7.0 software www.megasoftwre.net using the maximum likelihood method with a general time reversible GTR with a gama distributed rate variation (T 4 ) and a p-distance model with 1,000 bootstrap resampling. The final trees were then visualized in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).Aligned sequences were analyzed for evidence of sufficient temporal clock signal using TempEst version 1.5 . The relationship between root-to-tip divergence and sampling dates supported the use of molecular clock analysis in this study. Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayasian inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 (Suchard et al., 2018) . We partitioned the coding genes into first+second and third codon positions and applied a separate Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY+G) substitution model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity among sites to each partition (Hasegawa, Kishino & Yano, 1985) . Two clock models were initially evaluated strict and relaxed molecular clock, with four different tree priors, constant population size, exponential population size, Bayesian Skyride plot and Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot. Each selected model was run for an initial 30,000,000 states. Models were compared using Bayes factor with marginal likelihood estimated using the path sampling and stepping stone methods implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 (Suchard et al., 2018) . The relaxed clock with Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot (GMRF) coalescent prior was selected for the final analysis. The MCMC chain was set at 100,000,000 states with 10% as burn in. Results were visualized using Tracer version 1.8 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), all effective sampling size ESS values were >200 indicating sufficient sampling. Bayesian skyride analysis was carried out to visualize the epidemic evolutionary history using Tracer v 1.8 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). To reconstruct the ancestral-state phylogeographic transmission across countries and hosts, we used the discrete-trait model implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 (Suchard et al., 2018) . The Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach (Lemey et al., 2009 ) was used to explore the most important historical dispersal routes for the spread BtCoV across their countries of origin, as well as the most probable host-species transition. The spatiotemporal viral diffusion was then visualized using the Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics SPREAD3 software (Bielejec et al., 2016) .We analyzed βCoV sequences from eight African countries distributed among eight bat species as shown in Table 1 . The most abundant bat species sampled in this study was Micropteropus. pussilus, and Cameroon had the highest distribution of bat species sampled in this study. This result does not necessarily represent the true picture of bat species diversity in Africa, as some countries lack sequence information for bats due lack of surveillance.Phylogenetic analysis of Bt-βCoV sequences revealed a significant proportion of the African strains, isolated from fruit bats fell within the sub-genera Norbecovirus formerly known as lineage D consisting of strains from Cameroon, DRC, Kenya, Madagascar and Nigeria (Fig. 1) . Root to tip divergence showed the data set had a positive temporal signal ( Fig. S1 ) with the correlation coefficient = 0.0286 and R 2 = 0.0818. The edited version of the final alignment of all sequences is available in Supplemental File 2. The MCC tree of the Afr-βBtCoV strains shows clearly the two major sub-genera Norbercovirus, and Merbecovirus (Fig. 2) . We also observed that majority of the Sabecovirus (formerly lineage B) BtβCoV were isolated in Europe, precisely France and Spain and also China (Fig. 3) . The TMRCA for African Norbecovirus dating back to 1973, 95% HPD , and the TMRCA for Merbecovirus strains 2007 95% HPD (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . This shows that Merbecovirus is relatively recent and probably evolved from the existing Norbecovirus strains. Evolutionary rate of the African BtβCoV was set at 1.301 × 10 −3 , HPD (1.064 × 10 −3 -1.434 × 10 −3 ). This is slightly higher that the evolutionary rate for the ongoing SARS CoV-2 which has been estimated to have an evolutionary rate of 8.0 × 10 −4 (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global). Phylogeographic dispersal of the Bat β-CoV revealed numerous inter-continental spread events from China and Hong Kong into Central Africa (DRC and Kenya), Cameroun in West Africa, and South Africa, and also Mexico and Argentina in the Americas into West Africa Fig. 4 . The AfrBtCoV strains displayed steady state population demography as depicted by their Bayesian Skyline plot (Fig. 5) . Few studies have been carried in Africa on CoV among bats leaving a huge gap in epidemiologic information regarding BtβCoV in Africa. Our report of Norbecovirus dominance among AfrBtCoV strains is in agreement with a previous report which identified the widespread circulation of Norbecovirus (Lineage D) among fruit bats in certain African regions (Leopardi et al., 2016) . However, it was identified that isolates consisting largely of strains isolated among Neomoricia South African bats clustering within the sub-genus Merbecovirus (formerly Lineage C) together with strains isolated from Italy and Spain (Fig. 1) . The phylogenetic classifications utilized in this study is based on the partial RdrP group unit (RGU), utilized for the rapid classification of field isolates of βCoV (Tao et al., 2012) . The species-specific phylogenetic clustering observed among the Neomoricia bats suggests limited inter-species βCoV transmission and host specific evolution among these species of bats in Africa as previously reported for BtCoV (Wertheim et al., 2013) . Larger epidemiological studies are needed among these species of bats to shed more light as to the cause of this observed trend in Africa. Studies have shown that βCoV of subgenera Merbecovirus such as MERSCoV are capable of both intra-species transmission and inter host transmission (Min et al., 2016) . In this study there seemed to be inter-species transmission among the Norbercovirus (lineage D βCoV), evidenced by circulation of same Norbecovirus clade within different species of bats from same country around with the same year of isolation. For instance from Fig. 2 it can be seen that Cameroonian bat species Micropteropus pussilus, Epomophorus gambianus and Epomophorus franquenti, were infected by the same Norbecovirus clade, isolated around the year 2013. This is also observed among bat species from DRC (Fig. 2) . This type of event allows for potential recombination and rapid evolution of this lineage, as previously reported (Tao et al., 2017) . This type of observation was also reported in an earlier study of an inter-species transmission event of alpha CoV HKU10 in bat species of different orders .Majority of the Sabevovirus strains reported in this study consisted of SARSr viruses from France, like EP11 strains which have been previously reported to be widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia (Ar Goulih et al., 2018) . The absence of Sabecovirus subgenera among the AfrBtCoV in our study seems to support the hypothesis that highly pathogenic CoV's such as SARS evolved outside the African continent. Although the lack of Sabecovirus in this study does not imply that this group of viruses is not currently circulating among African bats, as the closest subgenra Hibecovirus which was also formerly classified under Lineage B was identified in African Bats from Nigeria and Ghana (Quan et al., 2010) , clustering with an Australian isolate ascension no: EU834950. This simply reflects the information gap in molecular data of BtCoV owing to poor surveillance in Africa. This also extends to information human coronaviruses such as hCoVOC43, hCoV229E, in which sequence data is limited to just a few countries such as Kenya and South Africa (Sipulwa et al., 2016; Abidha et al., 2020) . Phylogenetically the genus Rhinolophus (Horse shoe bat) exhibited highest potential for intra-host diversity for BtCoV with the genus co-circulating both Sabecovirus and Norbecovirus strains Fig. 3 . Our observation was similar to that of a study from Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015) and supports the theory of diverse intra/inter-host transmission among different bat species which has been reported in previous studies (Chu et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010) . Although we did not find this type of intra host genetic diversification among the African bat species in this study, it is believed that Rhinolophus bats are well distributed in Africa and are capable of zoonotic transmission of pathogenic hCoV such as SARS, as evidenced by a study that identified SARSrCoV antibodies among Rhinolophus bats in Africa (Müller et al., 2007) .The evolutionary rate reported in this study 1.301 × 10 −3 subs/site/year is slightly higher that the evolutionary rate for the ongoing SARS CoV-2 which has been estimated to have an evolutionary rate of 8.0 × 10 −4 (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global). This is also slightly higher than the evolutionary rate reported for the partial RdRP gene of HuCoV OC43 of 1.06 × 10 −4 (Vijgen et al., 2006) . A similar topology was also observed for the MCC tree which included βCoV from Asia and Europe, with a MRCA of 1915 (HPD 1880 (HPD -1950 for all the strains, with the African strains showing the consistent TMRCA as described above (Fig. 3) . The African Norbecovirus strains seemed to emerge from their parental strain at around the year 1960 (HPD, 1930 (HPD, -1970 this observation supports the hypothesis that Norbecoviruses could have been circulating in Africa long before they were first isolated. Whereas for the South African Merbecovirus (lineage C) strains seemed to emerge from their parental lineage around the year 1987 (Fig. 3) , indicating a more recent introduction into Africa, however studies have dated their origin based on partial RdrP gene to as back as 1859 (Lau et al., 2013) .The long distance spread events observed in our study such as the trans Atlantic and trans Mediterranean spread, may not necessarily represent actual transmission events, such as inter/intra-host transmission by migrating bat species, as bats have not been known to migrate across the Atlantic Ocean. However reports have shown the possibility of African bats to cover long distances during migration (Ossa et al., 2012) . These observations simply represent genetic similarity and gene flow pathways of BtCoVs, which may due to other factors such as international trade in exotic and wild animals serving as intermediate host of these viruses. There were also dispersal of these viruses between France and some African countries such as Cameroun, South Africa and the DRC. There was also dispersal from Spain into Kenya, South Africa and Madagascar. We also observed dispersal across the Atlantic from Europe to Brazil, as well as across the Indian Ocean from Australia into East and Southern Africa. One limitation to this study is that we were unable to collect consistent data on the bat species from the reference isolates from other continents. Hence the data presented serves as a hypothetical model reflecting genetic dispersal of BtCoV and not species specific movements. The only dispersal event from Italy into Africa was into Nigeria. Studies have shown the potential for African fruit bats to migrate long distances covering thousands of Kilometers, for instance a study using satellite telemetry in Zambia showed that Elodiun hevium is capable of covering thousands of kilometers during migration (Richter & Cumming, 2008) . Another study showed that African bats were capable of migration exceeding 2,000 Km (Ossa et al., 2012) . Intra-continental dispersal events were observed between Cameroun, DRC and South Africa, as well as direct dispersal from Cameroon into Madagascar. The population demography reported in this study might not represent the true picture of the virus population, as the dataset utilized is limited by its size and might not represent the true demographic population of BtCoV in Africa.We have presented data on the phylodiversity and evolutionary dynamics of Afr-βCoV and their possible dispersal across the continent. Mutiple dispersal pathways were identified between Europe and East/Southern Africa; there were also evidence of spread of BtCoV strains from Asia into Africa. We also identified three CoV sub-genera (Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Merbecovirus) circulating among African bat species with the probability of inter-species transmission among bats. We also identified multiple corona virus sub-genera co-circulating in China among the bat specie Rhinolophus sinicus, with the capability of zoonotic transmission (Yuan et al., 2010; Müller et al., 2007) . Study limitations include the lack of sufficient sequence data in GenBank covering AfrBtCoV, the relatively short genomic fragment analyzed and our inability to analyze spike protein sequence data of these viruses, as a result of paucity of African BtCoV spike protein sequences in established databases; this would have shed more light on their evolution in relation to infectivity and transmission.

Clinically, the underlying bilateral inflammatory lung injury seen in ARDS is typified by rapid onset of hypoxemic acute respiratory failure and reduction in the respiratory system compliance (Crs) (2) . Crs may be associated with the severity of ARDS, as it grossly reflects the size of normally aerated lung volume (3) or functional lung size (4) . The prognostic value of Crs in relation to mortality, however, remains uncertain (5) (6) (7) . The ARDS Berlin definition taskforce considered Crs as an ancillary variable but could not include Crs in the final definition because of the lack of evidence for its predictive validity at the time (1) .Recently, on the basis of preliminary observations during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it was postulated that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who satisfied the Berlin criteria of ARDS, presented with an atypical form of ARDS or a distinct phenotype, characterized by a dissociation between relatively wellpreserved Crs and severity of hypoxemia (8) . This raised doubts regarding the applicability of conventional and proven ARDS support strategies among such patients. Furthermore, a novel model of two primary phenotypes, a phenotype with low elastance or high Crs (""phenotype L"") and a phenotype with high elastance or low Crs (""phenotype H""), was postulated on the basis of differences in Crs, lung weight, and lung recruitability (9, 10) .It is unclear whether such Crs-based phenotypic patterns existed among patients with ARDS before the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this, we set out to determine the range of Crs on the first day of ARDS, the degree of hypoxemia, and the prevalence of associated Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes among patients with ARDS enrolled in the LUNG SAFE (Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure) study (11) . Our secondary objective was to closely examine the relationship between Crs and ARDSrelated mortality.The LUNG SAFE study was a prospective observational multinational cohort study of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. The detailed study design and main results have been published previously (11) . All participating ICUs obtained ethics committee approval and either patient consent or an ethics committee waiver of consent. National coordinators and site investigators (see Appendix E1 in the online supplement) were responsible for ensuring data integrity and validity.Patients receiving mechanical ventilation during the study period were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were age , 16 years or inability to obtain informed consent (when required). For the current report, we restricted analyses to the subset of patients who were classified as having ARDS within 48 hours of the onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU and who received invasive mechanical ventilation with controlled ventilation modes, lacked spontaneous breathing effort (where the total respiratory rate was equal to the set respiratory rate 61 on the mechanical ventilator), did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and had available data for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), VT, and plateau pressure.Data on arterial blood gases, type of ventilatory support with ventilator settings, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were collected at the same time each day. Data on ventilatory settings were recorded simultaneously with the arterial blood gas. Decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments during the ICU stay and the time at which this decision was taken were recorded. Patient survival was evaluated at hospital discharge, or at Day 90, whichever occurred first. Clinician recognition of ARDS was assessed on Day 1 of study entry, and when patients exited the study.The Crs (ml/cm H 2 O) was defined as the VT (milliliters) divided by the difference between plateau pressure (cm H 2 O) and PEEP (cm H 2 O) (1). Driving pressure (cm H 2 O) was derived as the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP (12) . Patients were partitioned into three groups on the basis of the recently proposed Crs thresholds (9, 10) (11) (12) (13) .The primary outcome was the range of Crs on the first day of ARDS, specifically the prevalence of Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes, among patients with ARDS enrolled in the LUNG SAFE study. The secondary outcome was the relationship between Crs and mortality at hospital discharge after adjusting for relevant confounders.Descriptive statistics included proportions for categorical and mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables. Plateau pressure was either specifically measured or the peak inspiratory pressure was considered to be the plateau pressure when this specific measurement was unavailable and a patient was ventilated on a pressure-controlled mode and lacked spontaneous breathing. As a sensitivity analysis, in cases where plateau pressure was not specifically measured, the plateau pressure was alternatively estimated as a function of the peak inspiratory pressure using a generalized additive model introducing a penalized spline term of peak inspiratory pressure. To assess differences among the three phenotypic groups, we performed the chi-square test (or the Fisher's exact test) for discrete variables and performed ANOVA (or the Kruskal-Wallis test) for continuous variables. Bonferroni correction was applied to determine significance in the setting of multiple comparisons. The chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) or Student's t test (or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) were used to assess differences between groups in discrete and continuous distributions of parameters, respectively. The relationship between Crs and the Pa O 2 /FI O 2 ratio was investigated using a regression model introducing a penalized spline term for the Pa O 2 /FI O 2 ratio, and the proportion of variance explained by independent variable was assessed with adjusted r 2 . The locally estimated scatterplot smoothing method was used to inspect the relationship between mortality and Crs. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between Crs and hospital mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders. In each regression model, the independent predictors (demographic characteristics and clinical parameters measured on the first day of ARDS) were identified through a stepwise regression approach. This approach combines forward and backward selection methods in an iterative procedure (with a significance level of 0.05 both for entry and retention) to select predictors in the final multivariable model. Independent variables used in the stepwise approach were age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, ARDS risk factors, illness severity parameters at Day 1 (Pa O 2 /FI O 2 , Pa CO 2 , pH, and nonpulmonary SOFA score adjusted for missing values), ventilatory settings at Day 1 (VT, PEEP, Crs, FI O 2 , volume Assist-Control mode, and standardized VE), and use of adjunctive measures at Day 1 (prone position, neuromuscular blockade, and corticosteroids). Patients with Crs . 150 ml/cm H 2 O were considered as outliers and were excluded from the final regression model to reduce uncertainty at extreme values. However, a sensitivity analysis after including these outliers was also performed. To facilitate interpretation, adjusted marginal probabilities of hospital mortality were plotted across the range of Crs. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted on the subset of patients who continued to meet ARDS Berlin criteria on the second day. Results were reported as the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. All P values were two-sided, with P values , 0.05 considered as statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with R, version 3.5.2. (R Project for Statistical Computing) and SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).Of 2,377 patients who developed ARDS within 48 hours of the onset of acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU, 1,117 patients were included in this study ( Figure 1 ).Baseline characteristics, including measures of illness severity, for the phenotypic groups are displayed in Table 1 Table 2 displays the ventilatory settings and adjunctive therapies among phenotype groups. The mean VT varied among groups: 7.5 6 1.6 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) in phenotype H, 7.8 6 1.8 ml/kg of PBW in the intermediate phenotype, and 8.5 6 2.1 ml/kg of PBW in phenotype L (P , 0.05). The mean PEEP levels were similar across the three groups, but the plateau pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, and driving pressure were all significantly higher, with correspondingly lower Crs, in phenotype H versus phenotype L (P , 0.05 for all). The use of proning and neuromuscular blockade, but not corticosteroids, was more common in the group with phenotype H. Table 3 summarizes the clinical outcomes for each phenotypic group. The groups behaved similarly in terms of the progression of ARDS from Day 1 to Day 2.There were no differences among the groups regarding decisions on limitation of life-sustaining therapies or measures. Surviving patients with phenotype L were liberated from mechanical ventilation earlier than those with phenotype H. Mortality rates in the ICU and hospital differed significantly among the three groups, with higher mortality among patients with phenotype H ( Figure 3A ). In multivariable analyses (Table 4) , older age, immune incompetence, higher nonpulmonary SOFA score, presence of chronic liver disease, and presence of risk factors for ARDS were associated with higher odds of hospital mortality. Increasing body mass index and increasing pH were associated with lower odds of hospital mortality. Increasing Crs was independently associated with lower odds of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio per ml/cm H 2 O increase, 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.979-0.996; P = 0.005). The adjusted marginal probability of hospital mortality decreased linearly with increasing values of Crs, with no clear transition point for any particular Crs threshold ( Figure 3B ).These results remained robust when Crs derivation was based on plateau pressure that was modeled, when not specifically measured, as a function of peak inspiratory pressure while receiving pressure-controlled mode ventilation.

ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; Crs = respiratory system compliance; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.ventilatory parameters, and outcomes among the phenotype groups based on this method of Crs estimation are shown in Tables E2-E6, and Figures E1 and E2 . The multivariable analysis after including outliers (i.e., patients with Crs . 150 ml/cm H 2 O; n = 7; 0.6%) showed similar results, as in Table 4 , in terms of independent predictors of mortality (Table E7) . Furthermore, the key findings from the sensitivity analyses of the subset of patients (n = 791; 71%) who continued to meet ARDS Belin definition on the second day, remained unchanged compared with the main analysis (Tables E8 and E9 and Figures E3 and E4 ).In this secondary analysis of LUNG SAFE study patients with ARDS, a wide range of Crs was observed. One in eight of these patients had preserved Crs (phenotype L) and three in four had poor Crs (phenotype H). Moderate-to-severe hypoxemia was present in a significant proportion (43%) of patients with preserved Crs. There was no relationship between the degree of hypoxemia and Crs among these patients with ARDS. Compared with those classed as having phenotype H, patients classed as having phenotype L had fewer comorbidities, were less sick, and had lower mortality rates. Decreasing Crs on the first day of ARDS was independently associated with higher mortality. The Crs-mortality relationship lacked a clear transition point for any particular Crs threshold, suggesting that such set thresholds are arbitrary. Although our analysis shows that Crsbased phenotypic patterns are present in non-COVID-19 ARDS, there are some important observations to be made when comparing our results with those of recent reports on phenotypes in the context of COVID-19. Preserved Crs (or phenotype L) was reported to be more common in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (9), but other recent small studies showed that Crs in COVID-19 ARDS is similar to that observed in non-COVID-19 ARDS (14) (15) (16) . The median Crs for our cohort with non-COVID-19 ARDS is also similar to that reported in these studies on COVID-19 ARDS (14) (15) (16) . Moreover, these studies did not specifically exclude spontaneously breathing patients, which could have potentially overestimated the Crs among some patients.There are good arguments to be made to identify different ARDS phenotypes on the basis of clinical, radiologic, biologic, and/or outcome characteristics (17) . ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome, and the most optimal treatment and mechanical ventilation strategy are likely to be different for different subsets of patients. Different ARDS phenotypes have been described on the basis of a parsimonious sets of predictors, comprising plasma biomarkers, genetics and clinical variables, and latent class analysis (18) . Another study showed two distinct ARDS phenotypes that responded differentially to randomly assigned fluid-management strategies (19) , and distinct metabolic endotypes in ARDS have also been described (20) . More recently, a classifier model was validated to identify two distinct ARDS phenotypes, hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory, which had significantly different mortality rates (21) . Future studies might find it useful to explore whether the proposed phenotype H, whether present in the context of COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 ARDS, shares any other characteristics, besides high mortality rates, with the hyperinflammatory ARDS phenotype.To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective data set to demonstrate a significant association between Crs and mortality in patients with ARDS, with no clear transition point or step for mortality risk at any particular threshold across the Crs spectrum. This is consistent with the relationship between plateau pressure and mortality (22) and is also consistent with the observed relationship between driving pressure and mortality, as driving pressure is a function of VT scaled to Crs (4 (10), to provide a frame of reference for other studies investigating the phenotypic distribution in COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, our data provide reassurance that a phenotype of preserved Crs in combination with hypoxemia also exists in non-COVID-19 ARDS, and the current evidence-based best practices involving ""lung-protective ventilation"" with a limited VT strategy would still be applicable for such patients.A post hoc analysis of clinical trials in ARDS did not reveal a safe threshold for plateau pressure below which the strategy of limiting VTs had no beneficial effect (22) .The data for this study were collected prospectively before Crs-based phenotypes were postulated and are therefore unlikely to be biased toward any particular phenotype.The key study findings remained robust in all sensitivity analyses that were performed. There are other limitations of the LUNG SAFE study that have been well described (11) (12) (13) . Importantly, given the observational nature of the study, causal inferences for any reported associations cannot be drawn. More specific to this report, the conditions for measuring the Pa O 2 /FI O 2 ratio, PEEP, plateau pressure, driving pressure, and Crs were not standardized. These were assessed as clinicians use them in real-life practice. These global measures are also unable to account for regional lung heterogeneity, chest-wall stiffness, and patient position (2) . Furthermore, the lead-time bias in the form of time period for which patients fulfilled Berlin criteria or had ARDS before the assessment on Day 1 remains an unmeasured confounder. It is possible that patients categorized as having phenotype H during the initial 48 hours of ARDS could have been further along on the scale of the disease evolution process than those categorized as having phenotype L. Furthermore, our a priori decision to exclude patients with an increased likelihood of spontaneous breathing, which was done to ensure the reliability of Crs data, could have resulted in underestimation of the prevalence of patients with phenotype L. About 9% of patients were further excluded because of missing data for PEEP, VT, or Crs. However, we do not have reasons to believe that these missing data were not randomly distributed among those excluded. We admit that the proposed type L and type H phenotypes have characteristics other than just Crs, including shunt fraction, lung weight (assessed by computed tomography scanning), or lung recruitability, that were not available in our data set. However, we submit that because a high degree of correlation was shown previously among Crs, lung weight, and potential for recruitability (25) , our groups are likely representative of these phenotypes. Lastly, this report was a secondary analysis. However, it was hypothesis-driven rather than exploratory, and the results are highly relevant for clinicians who will be managing patients with either COVID-19-related or non-COVID-19-related ARDS.In a large cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS, a wide range of Crs was observed. Approximately one in eight of these patients had preservedCrs, which was similar to those with phenotype L described in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia. There was a near complete dissociation between the degree of hypoxemia and Crs among patients with ARDS. A significant proportion of patients with preserved Crs had moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. Lower Crs on the first day of ARDS was independently associated with higher mortality. Importantly, the Crs-mortality relationship lacked a clear transition point for any particular Crs threshold under 100 ml/cm H 2 O, suggesting that such set thresholds are quite arbitrary. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.","Australia","first author","2020-11-01","11"

Examinations are conducted in collaboration with Centre Against Sexual Assault (CASA) advocates, who provide support to patients during the forensic examination, as well as counselling and aftercare. As a consequence, there is considerable CFP movement between the six Melbourne forensic medical examination sites.CFP movement is further complicated by frequent travel between police stations to examine alleged perpetrators and complainants of physical assault, warranting forensic medical examinations, photography, and/or biological sample collection. CFPs are also routinely requested to attend hospital emergency departments, inpatient wards or intensive care units to examine patients with injuries.In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives were introduced by the clinical team to decrease the number of sites attended by CFPs for sexual assault examinations to just three geographically suitable locations (two hospitals and the multi-disciplinary centre). The aim of the site reduction was to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19 to hospital sites due to CFP movement. It also enabled the clinical team to focus their attention on the rapidly evolving local protocols of a smaller number of examination sites as emergency departments restructured to create designated COVID-19 zones.Globally, concerns have been raised about the compounding effects of the pandemic, on those vulnerable to violence, specifically women and children, who are living in lockdown conditions [1] ; UN Women have described this phenomenon as a 'shadow pandemic' [2] . There are fears regarding the ability of complainants to report violence as they isolate within their homes, often in the presence of the perpetrator [3] . A recent Australian Institute of Criminology online survey of 15,000 Australian women suggests the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the onset of domestic violence for many women. In one third of respondents who reported experiencing physical or sexual violence during that time, it was the first time their partner had ever been violent towards them [4] .As the COVID-19 situation varies between jurisdictions and evolves rapidly depending on case numbers and government restrictions, it is not possible to predict the sustained effect on forensic medical examination caseload. On the 16th of March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Victoria [5] . At this time, returned overseas travelers represented the majority of COVID-19 cases and mandatory quarantine measures were introduced. Australia closed its borders to non-citizens on the 20th of March 2020. Further restrictions were imposed and by the 31st of March 2020 there was a downward trend in new COVID-19 case numbers. At this time, returned overseas travelers represented 58.5% (536 cases) of the total 917 Victorian confirmed COVID-19 cases [6] . During this phase our unit experienced an initial decrease in acute sexual assault case referrals. As time progressed and restrictions were lifted, the forensic medical examination caseload began to increase.Following the lifting of restrictions in Victoria, by late June the number of community-acquired COVID-19 cases escalated, and of the 8700 new cases between July 1 and August 1, only 21 were acquired in returned overseas travelers [6] . Stage 3 restrictions were re-introduced in metropolitan Melbourne and one of the regional shires in early July 2020, and interstate borders were closed to Victoria [7] . By the beginning of August, Stage 4 restrictions were implemented, including stay at home orders and curfew [6] .The climb in COVID-19 case numbers in Melbourne necessitated the development of protocols by the clinical team in anticipation of examining patients suspected or confirmed of being infected with COVID-19 (S/COVID-19 patients) in hospital hot zones.Our unit has been involved in the clinical forensic medical examination of S/COVID-19 patients in Victoria. As an example of the processes employed in examining such patients, we present the following de-identified case.A patient who was sexually assaulted in July 2020 was referred to our service. This individual had injuries which required medical assessment prior to forensic examination so they were taken to a hospital emergency department. The alleged incident occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, with local escalating rates of community transmission. The patient had symptoms and signs of a respiratory illness, including hoarse voice and cough, and upon testing, was found to be COVID-19 positive. The patient was admitted to a designated COVID-19 ward ('hot zone'). Due to the patient's symptoms and COVID-19 positive status, it was determined that the forensic medical examination would take place within the hot zone.Given the unfamiliar environment and extra infection control precautions that the examination would require, a dual practitioner approach was employed. The aim of this approach was primarily to significantly reduce the time spent by any one practitioner in a COVID-19 environment, as well as to have a 'spotter' through the donning, examination and doffing processes in the event that hospital staff were not available. The concept of a dual practitioner approach may not be practicable for all clinical forensic units, as staffing availability considerations would need to be taken into account. This approach could be tailored in accordance with staffing numbers and practitioner level of experience, and availability of hospital staff to assist with donning and doffing procedures.We obtained a history of the claim from the patient over the phone with the assistance of an emergency department social worker. Our established protocol required that the forensic sampling equipment was prepared in a nearby 'cold zone', adhering to DNA contamination minimization principles. We attended the hot zone donning/doffing station, where we donned the provided PPE (personal protective equipment -gown, N95 mask, goggles/face shield, gloves) and entered the hot zone to examine the patient and collect forensic samples. We then proceeded to conduct a modified procedure of packaging, sealing and labelling the specimens to enable them to be safely collected and removed from the hot zone.We preserved the chain of custody of the forensic samples and the handover occurred in an outdoor isolated area of the hospital carpark to prevent unnecessary police presence in the hospital. The samples were then conveyed by Victoria Police Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team (SOCIT) members to the Victoria Police Forensic Services Centre for DNA analysis.Even in a COVID-19 hot zone, the principles of DNA contamination minimization are paramount in order to prevent inadvertent transfer of DNA material. The standard sexual assault examination principles, in which sources of DNA contamination are minimized from the examiner, examination surfaces, and other people in the room, should be adhered to at each step. Similarly, measures ordinarily taken to maintain the integrity of chain of custody must also be followed (Fig. 1) .The significant risk of transmission of COVID-19 within the community posed Melbourne-based CFPs with a unique and challenging scenario-forensic medical examinations of S/COVID-19 patients. A sexual assault examination in a designated COVID-19 hot zone represents a precarious balance between a number of concurrent priorities:-The need to address patient well-being in an unfamiliar and potentially dehumanizing environment following an incident of inter-personal violence. Staff are dressed in full PPE and patients are unable to be accompanied by support persons. This can add to the physical and emotional trauma they experience. The task of safely removing biological samples and other evidentiary items (such as clothing) from a COVID-19 contaminated area was arguably the most important modified aspect of conducting a forensic medical examination in a hot zone. Ordinarily, the forensic medical examination kit, [8] . Thus, modifications to normal packaging procedures were imperative, to prevent the forensic samples themselves inadvertently becoming fomites, and presenting a risk to examining practitioners, police and the receiving forensic scientists.The experience of the S/COVID-19 patient undertaking a sexual assault examination is unfortunately likely to be markedly different to that provided by the usual best-practice examination conducted within specialized sexual assault units. A designated emergency department COVID-19 hot zone is a foreign and noisy environment. All health care workers will be covered in personal protective equipment including masks and face shields, as well as adhering to physical distancing where possible. All of these measures may be perceived as a dehumanizing experience. Patients may not have the opportunity to receive face-toface contact with police and sexual assault counsellor advocates that would normally be provided. They may perceive the request to disclose details of their alleged sexual assault via phone or videoconference as confronting. The patient may have been in isolation prior to, or subsequent to the incident, and may not have the means to seek connection with their usual support networks. In addition, they may be in a shared ward, with limitations to privacy. These challenges may be augmented for patients with additional needs i.e. hearing impairment, psychiatric conditions, cognitive impairment and people who require interpreters.It is of vital importance that the patient's experience be kept in the forefront of the CFP's mind. In this unique scenario, CFP's must be empathic and strive to establish rapport and an authentic human connection within the limitations of their interactions in a COVID-19 hot zone context. Recognizing these issues, our unit has introduced the use of disposable stickers (10 × 7 cm) with the clinician's name and head shot, to be worn on the outside of the PPE gown.It is commonplace for a significant time period, many months or even years, to lapse between a claim of sexual assault, and the case progressing through the criminal justice system. With current jury trials suspended in Melbourne, it is not clear how timeframes of these cases will be affected in the months and years to come. It is imperative that COVID-19 pandemic-related deviations from routine forensic protocols be clearly documented. This is essential for future court proceedings, to ensure forensic evidence obtained in a COVID-19 context is held to accepted quality standards to guarantee admissibility in the criminal justice system.The authors note that guidelines have been provided by various clinical forensic representative bodies and jurisdictions which reflect these principles [9, 10] . Published guidelines largely provide for a controlled, ideal situation in which a COVID-19 positive patient can attend a designated sexual assault examination suite or is isolated in a private room. Modified protocols currently support telehealth or telephone consultations with the patient prior to physical examination and forensic sample collection in order to minimize practitioner face-to-face time.Similarly, in the examinations we conducted, one practitioner explained the purpose and process steps of the forensic procedure, obtained verbal consent, and conducted the history over the phone. A phone consult, although practical in terms of reducing practitioner time in the hot-zone and exposure to the virus, limits visual cues and face-toface development of rapport. This rapport developing step is usually considered fundamental when conducting an intrusive examination on a traumatized patient and this limitation requires acknowledgement and adjustment by the practitioner.Additional inherent limitations to taking a phone history that have been encountered in such cases include: hot zones are often open ward settings with wall barriers on each side of the patient with only a curtain separating them from busy passageways; constant background noise and activity; poor telephone reception; poor patient speaking volume due to a sore throat and hoarse voice. All of these limitations required contemporaneous documentation. Even if a dedicated forensic sexual assault examination suite is available for use with adequate PPE and environmental precautions in place, the patient may be too unwell to be transported into that setting, or transfer may not be considered feasible or safe in a COVID-19 positive symptomatic patient.Prior to entering hot zones and conducting forensic medical examinations, it was essential to practice the modified dual practitioner process and anticipate possible variables that may be encountered. It should be expected that in the context of a pandemic, local hospital procedures will be significantly modified, with makeshift wards and rapidly evolving protocols.Based on our review of processes after conducting a forensic medical examination in a COVID-19 hot zone, we propose the considerations outlined in Table 1 , which can be modified to suit local circumstances:All forensic examination kits in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria are now identified with brightly colored 'COVID-19 risk' stickers, to be clearly displayed on forensic sample collection kits or patient clothing bags when suspected COVID-19 or positive cases are examined (Fig. 2) . This alerts police and forensic sciences staff to the potential risks of handling the evidence and the need for cold storage of the specimens to prevent DNA degradation from being sealed in plastic. Table 1 Considerations for forensic medical examination in COVID-19 hot zones a The process for removing forensic specimens from the hot zone may require modifications based on the components of the forensic examination kits in each jurisdiction and the interface between the contaminated and clean surfaces outside the hot zone 1. Establish contact with a hot zone 'on the ground' treating staff member (e.g. nurse, doctor, social worker)• Establish the patient's medical status, and the value/urgency of a forensic medical examination • Obtain information about anticipated examination location • Request assistance with locating a nearby 'cold zone' set up area 6. Exiting the hot zone • At the conclusion of the examination, exit the hot zone to the doffing station, where the contaminated larger outer box is discarded, followed by hand hygiene • Doff PPE, and ensure each practitioner is being observed (spotted) to doff correctly • Acknowledging that the small box may have fomite contamination, utilise clean gloves and hand hygiene to handle the small box a • The small box is sealed with tamper proof seals to maintain evidentiary standards, labelled with COVID-19 risk stickers, and inserted into the clean/clear plastic bag being held open by the second practitioner, followed by hand hygiene 7. Handover of forensic samples to police • Avoid police entering a hospital hot zone solely to receive forensic samples: consider an alternative, discrete handover location (such as the hospital car park) • Complete chain of custody paperwork in the presence of police 8. Healthcare provision • Address the medical needs of the patient in conjunction with the treating doctors, including treatment of injuries, emergency contraception and relevant sexual health follow up • Ensure psychological support has been offered 9. Other considerations • Consider deferring collection of buccal reference swabs until the patient has recovered • If photography of injuries is required, place the camera in a disposable plastic bag, use gloves when handling, and clean camera with disinfectant wipes at doffing station • Consider photography as the basis of injury documentation. If injury documentation on a paper examination proforma is required, consider placing the completed proforma into a separate clean plastic pocket upon exiting, at the doffing station.Hand hygiene should be repeated following handling of the documents (the plastic pocket can be sealed and opened after a cautionary three-day decontamination period to prevent fomite viral transmission on paper/cardboard)The increased complexity of modifications to usual practice in health care is omnipresent in all areas of patient-facing services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These modifications include additional risk assessment at triage, rapid upskilling in PPE competency, and well-rehearsed modified protocols. The value of practitioner debriefing following examinations in this context is perhaps more crucial than ever. In addition, consideration must be given to a potential reduction in health care staffing levels. For these reasons, our service has restricted COVID-19 positive forensic examinations to day and evening shifts and a formal debrief between clinicians is conducted the following day at a video handover meeting.Even in the setting of a global pandemic, sexual assault and interpersonal violence are still occurring and are likely to be increasing in the context of a ""shadow pandemic"". It is essential that forensic medical services rapidly evolve their standard processes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive planning, communication, and modifications to usual service provisions are required. Principles of optimizing the patient experience, preserving evidentiary standards, minimizing DNA contamination, maintaining clinician safety, and preventing forensic sample fomite transmission are imperative. Forensic medical services should be encouraged to collaborate with other jurisdictions, and share information regarding evolving protocols, to continue to best serve the community and criminal justice system.1 Even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that forensic medical practitioners continue to provide quality and timely services to those affected by sexual and interpersonal violence. 2 It is imperative that forensic medical services modify procedures in order to achieve a balance between the maintenance of the integrity of forensic samples, prevention of viral contamination of specimens, and preservation of practitioner safety. 3 A modified protocol for sexual assault examination in a COVID-19 hot zone is presented.

Lung and breast cancer are most prominently discussed, and the most concerns were expressed regarding delayed diagnosis, cancellations, missed treatments, and weakened immunity. All patients expressed significant negative sentiment, with fear being the predominant emotion. Even as some lockdown measures ease, it is crucial that patients with cancer are engaged using social media platforms for real-time identification of issues and the provision of informational and emotional support. The Oncologist 2020;25:1-3The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of human society with more than 10 million confirmed cases and more than half a million deaths in 180 days after the first case was reported. Following stringent social distancing and lockdown measures, hospital systems have increasingly transitioned to telemedicine for nonpandemic health care services. Oncology patients in particular have been severely affected by this transition as they are disconnected from a formal and familiar health care setting that is intertwined with their cancer trajectory. Despite many research endeavors on cancer and COVID-19, such as the severity on immunocompromised patients with cancer [1] , cancer care management [2] , nonpharmaceutical interventions [3] , and hospital hygiene [4] , none has focused on this disconnect and the corresponding impact on mental health and emotional well-being. In fact, patients with cancer have addressed this void by seeking informational and emotional support on diverse social media platforms. Twitter has been the most widely used platform, with more than two million tweets during this pandemic.Although the short-form expressions on Twitter are well suited for the fast-evolving nature of the pandemic and associated challenges, more substantial conversations and discussions are taking place on online cancer support groups (OCSGs). Given that mental health and emotional well-being of patients with cancer are underreported and underexplored, we postulate that patient-reported information on these social media platforms can be used for real-time analysis of patient needs and expectations for the delivery of effective oncology care during this period.Patient-reported information during COVID-19 (from February 1 to April 30) was extracted and compiled in the form of two data sets: 2,469,822 tweets from Twitter and 21,800 posts from a combination of general and specific OCSGs. All data sources are publicly available, and the entire data extraction process was anonymized. We applied a validated artificial intelligence framework, the Patient-Reported Information Multidimensional Exploration (PRIME) framework [5, 6] on both data sets. The PRIME framework has After the initial application of PRIME on the Twitter data set, we observed a sharp threefold increase in the volume of tweets on March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Most of these tweets focused on the propagation of guidelines issued by health care providers, such as the criticality of social distancing for patients with cancer and the anticipated delays in access to formal care. The next level of analysis was the type of patient with cancer contributing this increase in volume. We observed that the highest was 38.3% related to lung cancer and second highest was 23.8% related to breast cancer.In applying the PRIME framework on the OCSG data set, we analyzed the emotional burden of the pandemic on patients with cancer, based on more substantial discussions, which were semantically rich and context-aware in comparison with tweets. We used an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to extract two sentiments (negative and positive) and eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) [8] . As visualized in Figure 1 , the overall positive sentiment gradually decreased from February 1 to April 30. The most prominent emotions were ""fear"" and ""joy,"" with ""fear"" being consistently expressed during this period, whereas ""joy"" underwent a significant drop soon after the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decrease with occasional spikes of positivity that were triggered by media releases on the development of treatments for COVID-19.In terms of patient needs, we used the natural language processing techniques followed by artificial intelligence algorithms in PRIME to explore the key patient issues expressed in both data sets, based on high-level themes and corresponding topics. Tweets mainly focused on treatment delays, diagnosis delays, and weakened immunity, whereas cancellation of consultations, missed scans, and risks of undergoing chemotherapy were the main focus in OCSG discussions. These concerns align with a recent study that reports individuals on active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer, and patients with blood or bone marrow cancers are the highest risk group [9] . Delays in diagnosis of hematologic cancers such as acute leukemia, which require immediate treatment, put patients' lives at more risk and lower life expectancy [10] .Going beyond these medical concerns, both data sets contained a significant volume of concerns expressed on mental health, adjusting to the ""new normal,"" and daily physical activity. We formulated these findings of patient needs in terms of key themes and corresponding topics as illustrated in the sunburst diagram (Fig. 2) . The inner circle represents the themes, the intermediate circle denotes the emotions for each theme, and the outer circle represents the topics of concern for each theme. The themes are ordered 1 to 6, in descending order of most significant to least. The most prominent emotion across all themes is ""fear,"" except ""ongoing care,"" which is positive with ""anticipation"" at 30% intensity.We have successfully applied the PRIME framework to develop a deep understanding of the ""pulse"" of patients with cancer in terms of their information needs, health care expectations, mental health, and emotional wellbeing during this pandemic. These findings are particularly significant as they formalize the health care value of online patient-reported information during a time when formal care is compromised and clinical resources are exhausted. The robust correlation between the sustained threefold increase in social media participation and the steady decrease in positive emotions is a grave concern for the effective management of cancer care during the pandemic. We have demonstrated how PRIME can be used to precisely detect emotions in real time, including sensitive emotional fluctuations due to media announcements on coronavirus treatment development. This means that telemedicine and remote health care technologies can be used to provide proactive and responses to patients with cancer in distress and actively prioritize patients who require urgent support. The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, and it is prudent and practical for formal health care systems to incorporate the findings of this study for the real-time identification and delivery of effective care for oncology patients.","Australia","first author","2020-11-26","11"

Across the globe, substantial variation is seen within populations across factors including age, sex and geography. 1 However, perhaps the most problematic, emblematic and ultimately preventable disparities in chronic disease burden are observed between ethnic groups living within a given population. For example, in the United States, African Americans are more likely to have a substantial comorbidity burden compared to White Americans 2,3 ; while South Asians living in the United Kingdom are more likely to have diseases such as coronary heart disease compared their White counterparts. 4 Indigenous Australians are more likely to have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disease and cancer compared to the nonindigenous population. 5 In New Zealand, a recent report on the health of indigenous Māori New Zealanders (the WAI-2575) noted that Māori were more likely to have rheumatic heart disease, cancer, asthma, chronic pulmonary disease and diabetes than non-Māori New Zealanders. 6 Previously, the landmark Hauora IV report showed that Māori were substantially more likely to die from chronic conditions including cardiovascular, respiratory and endocrine conditions. 7 In the cancer context, we have previously observed that Māori cancer patients are more likely to have comorbidity than non-Māori patients, 8 with subsequent implications regarding access to treatment and mortality outcomes. 9 Each of these reports (and others) have provided important snapshots of the morbidity landscape in New Zealand, and how this is strongly patterned by ethnicity.In this manuscript, we provide broad and comprehensive information regarding the prevalence of more than 60 individual morbidities within New Zealand, using two distinct population-level measures of morbidity. We use nationallevel data to describe how the prevalence of chronic conditions is patterned by ethnic group, and consider which conditions occur most commonly for each group. We compare the likelihood of individual conditions between ethnic groups, and also examine whether there are differences in the age-specific prevalence rates between them. We also examine disease prevalence rates according to level of socioeconomic deprivation, stratified by ethnic group. Finally, we examine disparities in rates of conditions relevant in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, including those that would exacerbate the impact of COVID-19 on health outcomes. [10] [11] [12] [13] The study population corresponds to the study population in a previous paper on the epidemiology of multimorbidity in NZ. 14 This covers all NZ adults (aged 18þ) defined as having an active National Health Index (NHI) number, which includes individuals registered with a Primary Healthcare Organisation (PHO; 94% of the population) and also those with recent who had healthcare interactions in the preceding year. The dataset covered the prevalence of conditions as at the 1st of January 2014 based on past hospital admission and pharmaceutical dispensing data (further described below). Demographic characteristics of the study cohort are shown in Table 1 .All study data were taken from the New Zealand Ministry of Health's National Collections. The study population was determined based on whether an individual had an active NHI based on these collections, including the NHI master table (used to define denominator for calculating rates), National Minimum Data Set (NMDS, covering publiclyfunded hospital discharges and many privately funded discharges from larger private providers), and PHO registration data (the latter two datasets used to define the numerator, i.e. the presence of conditions). Conditions were coded separately for the two study indices used, the M3 and P3 indices, which respectively draw on in-hospital diagnostic codes and pharmaceutical dispensing data. 15, 16 The M3 index uses ICD-10 coded diagnoses from NMDS hospital discharge records to code 61 long-term conditions for the 5-year period prior to the study date. 15 The P3 index uses pharmaceutical dispensing data covering all community-dispensed medications for the study population in the year prior to the study date, coded using a modified version of the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) system. 16 The specific codes used in determining the conditions lists are given in the corresponding papers. 14-16As detailed above, individual condition prevalence was determined by having a condition-specific code recorded in the M3 or P3 index data source. Ethnicity was established from the NHI master table and reported using a modified total ethnicity approach, following standard ethnicity coding processes in the NZ health system. 17 In this system, individuals are included in the numerator and/or denominator for each category they identify with (e.g. a person with Maori and Pacific ethnicity is included in both groups). To allow for comparison, an exclusive 'European/ Other' group was constructed which only included people not identifying as Māori, Pacific, Asian or Middle Eastern/ Latin American/African (MELAA). This European/Other group is almost exclusively comprised of NZ European and European ethnicities (<0.1% of this group in 2013 Census had an explicit 'Other' ethnicity). 18 A total of 192,910 individuals had missing ethnicity data (5.5% of cohort), and were removed from further analysis.Age group and sex were taken from the NHI master table, and used for direct age-and sex-standardisation of rates, and also for reporting patterning of condition prevalence stratified by ethnicity and age group. Age was grouped into five relatively broad ranges for standardisation (to avoid empty age-sex cells in direct standardisation) at 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65-74 and 75þ; and in narrower ranges for age-specific prevalence (18-24; 25-29; 30-34; and continuing in 5-year age bands up to a top band of 85þ).The data preparation stage (coding of conditions and demographic categories) was drawn from earlier work examining at the prevalence of multimorbidity in NZ. 14 Data coding and preparation was conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and calculation of crude rates, agesex standardised rates and rate-ratios was conducted in R 3.6 (R Institute, Vienna, Austria). Direct age-sex standardisation for each total ethnicity group used the epitools package, 19 with groups standardised to the age and sex profile of the total study cohort (i.e. the adult NZ population with an active NHI). Rate ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals.Conditions were analysed separately by data source (M3/P3 index), for two reasons: (1) conditions only partially between these indices, and (2) separate analysis allows for interpretation in light of the differential strengths and weaknesses of the two data sources.To assess differences in the age at which key conditions are found between ethnic groups, we determined agespecific rates stratified by ethnicity. We also examined the deprivation-specific prevalence rates of these conditions, separately for each ethnic group.Finally, given the timing of this manuscript, we considered it sensible to specifically describe disparities in rates of conditions relevant in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. [10] [11] [12] [13] Therefore, in addition to presenting data for those conditions that were most common, we have also ensured that we have presented data ethnic disparities in the prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, obesity, complicated diabetes, chronic liver disease and chronic renal disease.Crude and age-sex standardised prevalence rates of each condition within the cohort are shown in Online Supplementary Material 1 (M3 conditions) and Online Supplementary Material 2 (P3 conditions), along with age-sex standardised rate ratios comparing the rate of each condition for a given ethnic group to that observed for the majority European/Other group. To highlight those conditions imparting the largest burden on each ethnic group, we have presented the 10 conditions with the highest age-sex standardised rate by ethnic group in Figure 1 (M3 conditions) and Figure 2 (P3 conditions). To assess the absolute rate of a given condition against the relative disparity when compared to the European/Other group, we plotted age-sex standardised rates (x axis) against age-sex standardised rate ratios (y axis) for each ethnic group, with European/Other as the reference (separate figures for Māori in Figure 3 For brevity, and because each condition paints a similar picture, we have only presented the six conditions with the highest age-sex standardised rate for Māori.Overall, the rate of morbidity was substantially higher for Māori and Pacific New Zealanders compared to all other ethnic groups, and lowest for the European/Other group. Of the 30 most-common M3 conditions observed for Māori, the age-sex standardised rate was higher than the European/Other rate for 28 conditions (26/30 for Pacific peoples). For the M3 Index, the conditions that made up the top-10 in terms of age-sex standardised rate were broadly similar across ethnic groups, and primarily included cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive system conditions ( Figure 2 ). Broad similarities were also observed for the P3 Index conditions across ethnic groups ( Figure 2 ). For each of the top-10 conditions (both for M3 and P3), we observed substantial disparities for both Māori and Pacific in comparison to the European/Other population (Figures 3 and 4) . The relative burden of both M3 and P3 conditions for the Asian and MELAA ethnic groups compared to the European/Other group was less stark, although diabetes in particular remained comparatively much higher in these groups.When looking at differences in the prevalence by age profile between ethnic groups, we observed that the age at which both Māori and Pacific peoples were observed to have any of the top-6 conditions was substantially younger than other ethnic groups, manifested as earlier peaks in these prevalence curves ( Figure 5 ). When examining the prevalence of these conditions according to area deprivation, we made two key observations: (a) that the prevalence of these conditions tended to increase with increasing level In keeping with trends across most conditions, there were substantial disparities among Māori and Pacific compared to European/Other peoples for conditions that would exacerbate the impact of COVID- 19 We used whole-of-population data to estimate the comorbidity burden experienced by ethnic groups within the New Zealand population. To summarise our key findings, we found: (1) that the comorbidity burden is highest among Māori and Pacific New Zealanders and lowest for the majority European/Other population; and (2) the age at which Māori and Pacific peoples develop these morbidities is shifted much younger than the European/Other population. These key findings are discussed in more detail below.We observed broad similarities between ethnic groups in terms of the most commonly diagnosed conditions, with the possible exception of congestive heart failure and obesity (both among the most-common for Māori and Pacific, but not European/Other). However, the burden of these conditions was not equally shared between ethnic groups. Māori and Pacific New Zealanders were substantially more likely to have morbidity than other ethnic groups, particularly the European/Other group; this was emphasised by our observation that the age-sex standardised rate of 28 of the 30 most-common M3 Index conditions for Māori was substantially higher than that for European/Other peoples -with a similar finding for Pacific peoples (26/30 M3 Index conditions). When focusing on the 10 most-common conditions for Māori and Pacific New Zealanders, we observed substantial disparities in rates compared to European/Other population. This means that these conditions are both (a) important causes of morbidity for Māori and Pacific New Zealanders (since they are most common), and (b) these groups are disproportionately burdened with these conditions relative to the European/Other population.We argue that these disparities are ultimately the result of disparities in access to the factors that drive good health. Proximally, Māori and Pacific peoples are considerably more likely to live in socioeconomic deprivation, 7 and therefore have poorer access to the resources required to maintain good health. The impact of deprivation on health is pervasive, and systematically disadvantages these populations. As one example, Māori and Pacific peoples are more likely to face transport barriers, 20 which limits available resources (such as clean-green spaces for exercise, well-priced nutritious food outlets, high-quality and affordable primary care services) to those in their immediate vicinity. However, Māori and Pacific peoples are also more likely to live in areas with a low density of these health-positive resources and a concomitant high density of health- negative factors (e.g. increased density of alcohol and fast food outlets). 21 The pathway to disparity illustrated above shows how unequal distribution of the social determinants of good health can disproportionately and systematically impact one or two groups within a population. As illustrated by Jones 22 and contextualised for New Zealand by Robson and Harris, 7 the three-step recipe to the creation of a health inequity is: (1) the passive or deliberate development over time of systematic differences between groups in terms of the determinants of health, or in exposures that lead to disease; (2) amidst such differences, the embedment of differential access to health care services between populations; and (3) amidst access differences, the embedment of differences in the quality of health care received between populations (manifested as poorer access to early symptom recognition and disease management). The substantial disparities observed for burden of morbidity experienced by Māori and Pacific New Zealanders is the result of a consistent and cyclical repetition of this chain of events within New Zealand society.Our age-specific rate analysis suggests that the age profile for both Māori and Pacific peoples with a given condition is substantially younger than that for other ethnic groups. This has two key ramifications: (1) the earlier onset of these conditions is a likely contributor to poorer life expectancy of Māori (males 73 years, females 77 years) and Pacific (males 75 years, females 79 years) peoples compared to the majority European/Other population (males 81 years, females 84 years) 23 ; and (2) the earlier onset of these conditions means that Māori and Pacific peoples experience a far greater cumulative burden of these conditions over time -in other words, more time living with conditions that both reduce quality of life and increase health care needs.When stratifying age-sex standardised prevalence rates by our marker of socioeconomic status (NZDep), we noted a clear relationship between increasing levels of deprivation and the rate of a given condition. In terms of differences between ethnic groups, we noted that the prevalence of the examined conditions remained higher for Māori and Pacific peoples than any other ethnic group at each given level of deprivation. Furthermore, for each of the examined conditions, the prevalence rate among Māori and Pacific peoples living in the most affluent areas remained higher than that experienced by European/Other peoples living in the most deprived areas. In other words, Māori and Pacific New Zealanders experienced greater prevalence of morbidity than the majority European/Other population regardless of the level of deprivation.We observed substantial differences between the European/Other group and all other ethnic groups for prevalence of depression and anxiety/tension using the pharmacy-based (P3) index. This may indicate that these conditions are indeed more prevalent among the European/ Other population; however, it may also indicate that this population has better access to health care and medications for treating this condition. Previous evidence from selfreport surveys in New Zealand observed that Māori and Pacific peoples are more likely to have high-risk depression and anxiety scores on mental health screening questionnaires, but are less likely to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety. 24 This suggests that the prevalence rates in our study may indicate under-diagnosis (and thus under-treatment) of these conditions among Māori and Pacific New Zealanders.We note that there some conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and others) that were much more common among European/Other peoples than among Māori and Pacific peoples. In some cases, lower prevalence is clearly related to reduced exposure to risk factors (e.g. lower rates of melanoma among Māori and Pacific peoples); but in other cases, because of how morbidity is measured in this study, it is difficult to disentangle lower disease prevalence from poorer access to care for some of these conditions.We considered the ramifications of our findings in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example of the impact of long-term conditions in the broader health context. It is thought that the severity of COVID-19 illness (including mortality risk) is heightened among those with underlying morbidities including pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal and endocrine conditions. [10] [11] [12] [13] We observed substantial disparities in the rate of each of these conditions for Māori and Pacific peoples compared to other ethnic groups. This disproportionate burden of COVID-19-relevant morbidities sits alongside other relevant disproportionate burdens shouldered by Māori and Pacific peoples, including increased risk of infection via poor housing, overcrowding and inter-generational living. 25 In combination, these factors increase the risk that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health outcomes will inequitably impact Māori and Pacific New Zealanders, as has already been observed during influenza pandemics. 26 The current study used national-level data for the total New Zealand population, including all publicly funded hospital admissions (and most privately funded admissions) and all subsidised community prescription data. As such, the rates presented here can be considered estimates of condition prevalence within the population.However, due to the nature of the available data these prevalence estimates should not be considered perfect measures of community-level prevalence. The M3 Index uses ICD coded data from people admitted to hospital in the last 5 years, and so represent New Zealanders likely to have more severe illness. Thus the prevalence data reported for M3 conditions will underestimate the true condition community prevalence, though these still provide a picture of high-needs individuals. On the other extreme, the P3 Index will tend to capture more low-level disease since it is based on prescriptions filled in the community, and thus aligns more closely with primary-level care needs. However, these estimates will be influenced by access to primary care and ability to collect prescriptions (both partially user-pays in New Zealand). Given known ethnic disparities in both types of access, 20 prevalence is likely underestimated for Māori and Pacific groups -which would mean that the reported inequities are underestimated when using the P3 index.These differences in data sources explain why we observe much lower condition rates for the M3 Index than for the P3 Index for relatively similar underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes). Given both indices rely on treatment for a condition (and/or hospitalisation for an unrelated condition in the case of the M3 index), neither index will provide a fully accurate picture of the prevalence of these conditions in NZ. Absolute prevalence of conditions should thus be interpreted with caution when considering the prevalence of conditions (likely under-estimation). However, the conditions captured within each of these indices have an established independent relationship with mortality within their respective data sources [14] [15] [16] ; and it must be emphasised that under-or over-estimates of condition prevalence will not explain the substantial relative disparities highlighted in the current investigation.There are some additional issues regarding the denominator data for this study, where the study population covers those with an active NHI (enrolled with a PHO or a relevant recorded health interaction in the last 12 months). While PHO enrolment alone is expected to cover over 94% of the target population (other estimates have suggested in excess of 97% of the population 27 there will be some individuals who are not capture in these data, which will affect the denominator. The limitations from this undercount in denominator should be relatively small, especially considered in the context of undercounts in the numerator due to the data sources (as described above).Finally, while the presented results are from a 2014 cohort from our prior work, [14] [15] [16] and we might expect some increases in the absolute prevalence data for the conditions we have reported here, we believe it is unlikely that the relative inequities reported would have changed in a meaningful fashion.Using two measures of morbidity and national-level data for the total New Zealand population, we observed substantial disparities for Māori and Pacific peoples compared to other ethnic groups for the vast majority of commonlydiagnosed morbidities. These disparities appeared strongest for the most-common conditions -meaning that Māori and Pacific peoples disproportionately shoulder an increased burden of these key conditions. We also observed that prevalence of these conditions emerged at earlier ages, meaning that Māori and Pacific peoples also experience disproportionate impact of individual conditions on the quality and quantity of life.

The Reagan/ Thatcher models of economic liberalization featured deregulation, privatization, and the transformation of social protection regimes-all underpinned by a faith in free markets.Twenty-first century capitalism has shifted in important ways that belie this earlier orientation. Key features of the contemporary era include the outsized role of intangibles in the global economy (e.g., intellectual property, services, financial instruments such as derivatives and securities), the rise of financialization, the quest for profits over economic growth, and the pursuit of competitiveness-not competition-in global markets. Twenty-first century capitalism has reduced advanced capitalist democracies' (like the US and the UK) capacity to offer robust and effective responses to . COVID-19 has exposed profound weaknesses in the structure of contemporary capitalism and offers an opportunity to re-think its role in shaping global health.Going beyond the broad 'neoliberalism' label, John Braithwaite has described capitalism as 'variegated'; he identified two aspects that are particularly relevant to global health-'Wall Street' capitalism and 'monopoly capitalism' (Braithwaite 2019) . Wall Street capitalism captures the globalization of finance and the increased economic and political power of the financial sector. Financial markets, motives, institutions and elites have come to dominate the global economy affecting everything from production, consumption, regulation and health (Epstein 2005) . Monopoly capitalism, or 'intellectual monopoly capitalism' (Pagano 2014) , captures intellectual property (e.g., patents, copyrights and trademarks) owners' preference to avoid competition. Ownership of intellectual property (IP) gives owners the right to exclude others from using the IP, reduce competitive supply and increase prices.The quest to be competitive in global markets has led to economic concentration, oligopolies and a reduction in competition (Azmanova 2018) . Economic power has shifted from the mainstays of the real economy (commodity producers and traders) to the controllers of global value chains (GVCs) who own intangibles such as intellectual property and financial instruments. According to Medeiros and Trebat,'the ""core"" business of every TNC (transnational corporation), irrespective of its particular branch, is to control and capitalize on these intangible assets' in order to maximize shareholder value and generate large rents (Medeiros and Trebat 2017: 407) . Firms that are relatively immune to competitive pressure are 'less compelled to invest' in the real economy (Durand and Milberg 2018: 34) . As Azmanova points out, 'competition-induced productivity … does not condition growth on employment' and has resulted in socalled 'jobless growth' and 'jobless recovery' after economic crises (Azmanova 2012: 453) . Economic globalization has reduced the power of labour and has accelerated an increase in 'labour flexibility' that translates into precarious employment. Post-the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, austerity programs, cuts in social spending and labour market transformation have had negative effects on health outcomes and health equity (De Vogli 2014) .Financialization has altered the behaviour of non-financial corporations. It prioritizes value extraction over value creation to maximize shareholder value. It sees innovation as a means to generate wealth, not to respond to people's health needs; it does not see health innovation as a way to facilitate the emergence and diffusion of higher-quality products at competitive cost (Mazzucato and Roy 2019) . This has fundamentally reshaped the pharmaceutical industry from one characterized by multiple vertically-integrated firms, including everything from in-house R&D to clinical trials, to one that features far fewer firms that are horizontally integrated and expand largely through mergers and acquisitions (Gleadle et al. 2014; Busfield 2020) . William Lazonick points out that in 2018 Merck and Pfizer grew large by acquiring blockbuster drugs developed by other companies, and then 'milking them for revenues over their remaining patent lives' (Lazonick 2018) . Pharmaceutical executives' compensation is based on the price of company shares, so they have every incentive to boost it. They do this by buying back shares of their own stock on the open market, which became legal in 1982. For instance, in 2016 John C. Martin, CEO of Gilead Sciences earned $98.4 million, of which 96% was stock-based pay (Tulum and Lazonick, 2018: 294-5) . In just 3 years, 2017, 2018, and 2019 pharmaceutical firms spent $28.6 billion on stock buybacks and just $10 billion on R&D (testimony of US House Representative Katie Porter, discussed in Wilkins 2020).The strategic priority has changed from 'delivering value to customers (in the form of marketable products) to delivering value to creditors and shareholders' (Gleadle et al. 2014: 71) . In the past firms would re-invest profits in their companies to develop new products and retain skilled personnel, but now most of the profits go to the creditors and institutional investors such as State Street and Black Rock that own majority shares (Busfield 2020) . The three largest makers of N95 respirator masks, 3M, Honeywell and Kimberly-Clark, have also pursued this financialized approach and have tightly held the multiple patents on the masks (Lazonick and Hopkins 2020) . Critical shortages of personal protective equipment such as N95 masks and ventilators have been partly due to the exclusive rights that IP confers. This has slowed down the production and distribution of this vital PPE. Ventilator production was hampered when larger firms acquired smaller innovative companies that were producing affordable ventilators in order to quash the potential competition and maintain the larger firms' higher prices (Kulish et al. 2020 ).In the late 1970s and early 1980s, US-based IP owners lobbied for regulatory and legislative reform to expand IP protection. Pharmaceutical, software, publishing and entertainment producers argued that their industries provided America with competitive advantages in global markets. They sought the incorporation of IP into the trade regime to ensure that their IP would be remunerated in global markets and that trading partners would respect and enforce their 'rights'. By 1994 IP owners had succeed in globalizing their preferences through the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) in the World Trade Organization (Sell 2003) . TRIPs is hard law; it is binding and enforceable. It mandates 20 years of patent protection for pharmaceutical products. Violations result in trade sanctions.The institutionalization of intellectual property protection in the global trade regime cemented the shift from Reagan/ Thatcher neoliberalism to intellectual monopoly capitalism. When we talk about 'trade' these days, we are really discussing the role of intangibles such as IP and financial services. The main beneficiaries of contemporary trade agreements are those who control global value chains (GVCs), including international banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Food and Transnational Corporations. Lead firms in GVCs promote stricter IP requirements in trade agreements to 'contain the risk of IP appropriation resulting from the international fragmentation of production' (Durand and Milberg 2018: 21-22) . Most of the post-TRIPs trade agreements in which IP-rich nations are involved feature IP provisions that extend well beyond the TRIPs obligations in the WTO. Today, 'profitability is a function of a firm's ability to extract monopoly rents from complex value chains using their control over IPRs' (Schwartz 2017: 197) . For example, Apple extracts the lion's share of value from every iPad sold whereas the manufacturers in China receive only pennies on the dollar. Big Pharma routinely blocks pro-health initiatives aimed at promoting the use of TRIPs' flexibilities, such as compulsory licensing and parallel importation, that would make essential medicines affordable and accessible; these would threaten their profits and reduce shareholder value (Correa 2006) . The profit imperative of financialized capitalism has meant that Big Pharma has invested far more in lifestyle diseases such as erectile dysfunction and baldness than in diseases of the Global South. As Feldman argues, 'our incentive structure is badly misaligned with societal goals' (Feldman 2018) .Patent protection increases prices and reduces access to medicines, diagnostics, vaccines, medical devices and PPE. Strategic behaviour aimed at blocking generic competition contributes to rising drug prices. Pharma firms routinely engage in 'evergreening' to extend patent protection terms. A firm may have a popular drug with an about-to-expire patent, and then offer a 'new' formulation-from a tablet to a gel cap-of the same drug and obtain another 20 years of protection. This strategic behaviour does not affect everyone equally. For example, during the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the late 1990s/early 2000s as deaths plummeted in affluent countries an estimated 12 million infected Africans were left to die, 'waiting for enough life-saving drugs to reach the continent' (Nkengasong et al. 2020: 198) . India and South Africa have both asked the World Trade Organization to waive TRIPs provisions to allow them to engage in compulsory licensing and parallel importation of COVID-19 therapies (Reuters 2020). Their past experiences with HIV/AIDs and the swine and avian influenzas have bred understandable suspicion about the barriers to access that IP can create. As COVID-19 tests, therapies and vaccines are developed there is legitimate concern that 'intellectual property rights and reluctance to share related know-how may act as barriers to the rapid scale up for timely supply at affordable prices in all countries' (Tellez 2020) .The competitive scramble for COVID-19 vaccines is in full cry, with many affluent countries negotiating advance purchasing deals and raising concerns that the Global South will once again be 'left to die' (Torjesen 2020) . The pandemic has exposed supply chain bottlenecks and overreliance on too-few suppliers that reduce the availability of needed inputs. Current collective efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines, including the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), and GAVI (the Vaccine Alliance) are promising and 167 countries have already signed up to it. The aim is to produce and distribute heavily subsidized vaccines to protect health care workers and vulnerable populations even in poor nations. However, questions about intellectual property protection remain and competition for vaccines is evident. The U.S. has made its own deals with several private firms; high-income countries have signed contracts with individual companies to buy vaccines, and the partnership between Oxford University and AstraZeneca raises questions about the non-profit versus for-profit future of vaccines in development (Nkengasong et al. 2020: 197; Garrison 2020) .Microsoft founder Bill Gates's generosity as a philanthropist has been remarkable, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to focus on health. However, the prominence of Bill Gates in the vaccine space also raises questions; he has been a major benefactor and ardent promoter of intellectual monopoly capitalism. The outsized role of global plutocrats such as Gates, whose personal wealth has increased by over $10 billion during the pandemic, raises questions about governance for equity and the public good (McNamara and Newman 2020: 10; Schwab 2020). The Gates Foundation has invested over $250 million in dozens of companies working on COVID-19 responses and stands to reap significant financial gains as a result. The financialization dynamic is evident in his $40 million investment in CureVac, a German company. Just two days after CureVac's Initial Public Offering in August 2020, its stock value jumped 400%, allowing investors to extract value (Schwab 2020). Given the Gates Foundation's outsized role in the pandemic response, its financial stakes should be accompanied by greater transparency and accountability. As a core beneficiary and supporter of both Wall Street and Monopoly capitalisms that have extravagantly enriched the few at the expense of the many, his role raises legitimate questions about the likelihood of further entrenching a badly skewed system during a global pandemic. Gates' preference for exclusive licenses for intellectual property does not bode well for widespread access over time. South Africa and India recognize this, as reflected in their request for TRIPs waivers in COVID-19 time.The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the lethal consequences of the sharp rise in economic inequality, the concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands and the increasing precarity of labour. For example, as COVID-19 slammed Manhattan, members of the top 1% flocked to their beach retreats in the Hamptons to ride out the contagion (Sellinger 2020) . Meanwhile, 'essential workers' at the bottom of the contemporary economic hierarchy had no options but to continue to show up for work and face exposure to the deadly virus. First responders, bus drivers, nursing home workers, janitors, postal workers, grocery stockers, agricultural workers, Wal-Mart employees, Amazon warehouse workers, delivery drivers, and meat packers-many earning minimum wage and most without employer-subsidized health insurance or other benefits-had to keep working.As Bertha Bradley, a food service worker in North Carolina stated, 'I don't get health benefits, I don't get sick time, I don't get paid vacations, I don't get a living wage' (Jaffe and Chen 2020: 126). Katie Pine and Kate Henne refer to them as 'new risk workers', many of whom are given mandates for minimizing risk but few resources to implement them (Pine and Henne 2020). For example, in the John H. Stroger Hospital in Chicago, nurses were being told to reuse N95 masks, 'sometimes up to forty-five days' (Jaffe and Chen 2020: 138). By contrast, knowledge workers could work from the safety of their own homes and reduce their risks of becoming infected.COVID-19 has disproportionately attacked communities of colour, compounding economic inequality and systemic racism. It is clear that 'race matters for the way that markets have been built historically and function today' (McNamara and Newman 2020: 6). As Presidential candidate Joe Biden pointed out during the presidential debate in September 2020, 1 out of every one-thousand African Americans in the US has died from COVID-19. In Chicago about 70% of the COVID deaths were African Americans (Jaffe and Chen 2020: 140). The UN Secretary-General António Guterres pointed out that COVID-19 'is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere … the delusion that we live in a post-racist world, the myth that we are all in the same boat' (Guterres 2020). In September, Citigroup released a report that systemic racism, discrimination against African Americans, has cost the economy $16 trillion (Akala 2020).Many of the precariat are people of colour, recent immigrants and undocumented workers. By May 2020 slaughterhouses around the world became virus hot spots and exposed multiple layers of dysfunction. The meat processing industry is highly consolidated, dominated by global multinational corporations including Cargill, JBS, Smithfield and Tyson. Since the 1980s this industry has pursued the financialized model of consolidation and vertical integration, 'aimed at increasing profits through efficiency and low wages' (van der Zee et al. 2020). Many migrant workers in these plants live in communal housing; crowded working conditions, large plants and cramped housing, and lack of paid sick leave all exacerbate the spread of coronavirus in these environments. Viewed from a structural perspective, twenty-first century capitalism presents daunting challenges for imagining a more compassionate future. Globalization, economic interdependence, intertwined global supply chains, and concentrated economic and political power present a difficult web to reshape or even to untangle. Wall Street and Monopoly capitalisms powerfully shape the global political economy.One may think of a spectrum of options from re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to wholesale structural reform. Corporate social responsibility initiatives and philanthrocapitalism lie on the 'deck chair' end of the spectrum, regulatory reform lies in the middle, and a dramatic refashioning of capitalism to support global human and planetary health lies on the far end. The sheer scale and lethality of the COVID-19 pandemic, a virus that recognizes no class, nation, race or gender as immune, may provide us with an opportunity to rethink the system that has been laid bare in its face.Wall Street capitalism has skewed the ratio of risk and reward with negative effects on innovation and distribution. Financialized capitalism excels at extracting value rather than creating it. This is clear in the pharmaceutical industry in which the focus on shareholder value has created warped incentives for executives to engage in stock buybacks to inflate stock prices and executive compensation. Value extracted in this way is typically not re-invested in the enterprise to retain skilled employees and innovate, but rather is used to pay out dividends and buy up small potential competitors or innovative firms. As Braithwaite suggests, the current system has increased 'political and economic power of banks and the rentier class (rentiers who live off income from investments in property or securities rather than from producing anything)' (Braithwaite 2019: 559) . Huge tax cuts on capital gains, that Wall Street lobbyists have secured, have led to jobless recoveries and a severed link between productivity and job growth.Meaningful regulatory reform of the banking sector and financial markets would include reforms to covert 'roaring banking' back into 'boring banking' (Epstein 2018) . From the 1940s to the 1970s banks were boring in that they were restricted in the risks that they were permitted to take. Banking featured public missions to provide long term credit and housing finance, caps on interest rates and a moderate rate of return and stability in the sector (Epstein 2018) . Creating a firewall between basic retail and investment banking, by reviving the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, would prevent the contagion and collapse that spread from the shadow banking sector to the regulated banking sector in 1929 and in 2007 -2008 (Fahri and Tirole 2020 . Reducing the size of 'too-big-to-fail' banks and taxing financial transactions would also help curb the contemporary risky behaviour and damaging excesses in this sector. Returning to a model of economic growth rather than profit would include progressive taxation; 'in 1952 the highest income tax bracket in the United States was 92% and the economy grew faster than ever' (Bregman 2020) . Rescinding the US Securities and Exchange Commission's 1982 rule permitting stock buybacks would be a positive step to change incentives. Implementing curbs on capital flows and tax evasion would also serve to support policy space and additional resources to address public missions such as health care.Robust antitrust or competition policy could boost IP reform to curb abuses of monopoly power across a range of sectors from Big Pharma, Big Food, and Big Tech among others. Beyond competition policy, a frank accounting of the value proposition of pharmaceutical products that is transparent about the percentages of public sector money behind the development of pharmaceutical products and medical devices would be a step in the right direction. As Mazzucato (2013), Mazzucato and Roy (2019) , and Lazonick and Hopkins (2020) have all pointed out, most pharmaceutical innovation has been engineered by the 'entrepreneurial state' and funded by taxpayers. The public sector has taken the risks and the private sector is reaping nearly all of the rewards. This risk/reward ratio must be re-aligned to reflect the real value provided by public financing. Such transparency should serve to reduce the costs of essential medicines so that taxpayers do not end up paying twice for medicines. Alternative financing for drug development, such as prize funds, and the expansion of patent pools could be pursued. Intellectual property rights could be relaxed for public health needs, especially in a case such as COVID-19, as India and South Africa are requesting at the World Trade Organization. Relying on charity, and philanthro-capitalists whose fortunes and worldview reflect Wall Street and Monopoly capitalisms presents uncertain, unsustainable and even dangerous possibilities. Private interests and public interests are bound to clash to the detriment of the public at some juncture.Addressing inequality and precarious labour has prompted calls for more structural reforms. The rhetoric of 'essential worker' offers an opportunity. Those designated as 'essential workers' during this pandemic are among the most poorly paid, most exposed to potentially fatal risks and lack access to basic health care and benefits, such as paid sick leave, that would help to protect themselves and others. Essential workers are those who take care of those who are most important and vulnerable, infants and children, elderly parents, the disabled and everyone else who needs stocked grocery shelves, home deliveries of food and medicine, education, and first responders. It is noteworthy that the Wall Street titans who retreated to the Hamptons during the Manhattan outbreak have not been designated as 'essential'. This pandemic offers an opening to rethink what 'essential' really means and how essential work should be compensated. Living wages should be a basic human right. Albena Azmanova, a political theorist, calls for a 'more direct examination of capitalism' to identify 'points of fracture in today's capitalistic fabric' (Azmanova 2014: 357-8) . She argues that those who seem to have conflicting grievances of ' 'labour-market insiders' who have good jobs but feel pressured to work harder and longer, and 'labour-market outsiders' (the unemployed and those in precarious employment) are mutually related via a political economy which increases and generalizes commodification pressures' (Azmanova 2014: 359) . Thus, even the apparent 'winners' in the current system face increasing employment insecurity and these pressures indicate that 'something is wrong with our model of wellbeing' (Azmanova 2014: 359 ). The current system of competitive production of profit has produced 'systemic forms of injustice and domination such as the precariousness of livelihoods across the class divide' (Azmanova 2018: 8) .The neoliberal/libertarian mantra of individual responsibility and self-reliance has tattered social bonds and communal responsibility. It provides an excuse or rationale for the public sector to step back. Social safety has been removed as a legitimate public responsibility (Azmanova 2014: 361) . And yet, as Bregman points out, 'humankind evolved to cooperate' and this insight can provide the basis for moving toward 'a government based on trust, a tax system rooted in solidarity, and the sustainable investments needed to secure our future' (Bregman 2020) . Around the globe, governments have stepped up to provide temporary social protection in the pandemic at a massive scale. This has demonstrated that the public sector can mobilize vast resources in times of crisisthis time not to bail out banks that were too-big-to-fail, but to provide more social safety nets. The crisis has resuscitated serious conversations about a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to create conditions of economic certainty.The rise of populism on the left and the right reflects a fear of freedom in a world that seems out of control. In the centre many are calling for reform to make capitalism more inclusive. But some call for a radical overhaul of the socio-economic system to develop a 'political economy of trust' to counter the 'systemic logic of domination at work in the contemporary modality of capitalism' (Azmanova 2014: 362) . To begin to build such a system of trust, Azmanova advocates that those seeking to transform contemporary capitalism should challenge the rules that generate and sustain injustice rather than political actors (parties, states, foreigners etc.) (Azmanova 2018: 10) .This brief analysis of some of the structural aspects of contemporary capitalism(s) and the way they shape pandemic response highlights the importance of incorporating political economy into our discussions about public health.Understanding key features and pathologies of the current system can inspire constructive countermeasures to build resilience in the pandemic. For example, African experts from the African Center for Disease Control are mobilizing to deepen capacity to produce vaccines and manufacture PPE in the shadow of past negative experience with monopoly capitalism during the HIV/AIDS pandemic when so many were 'left to die ' (Nkegasong et al. 2020) . They have already developed testing capacity and have trained thousands of contact tracers. Robinson and Gilbert have called for the development of an 'economic bioethics' to illuminate 'how large structural changes-financialization, for example, or market consolidation … increasingly structure both clinical decision-making and the decisions of individual scientists on the ground' (Robinson and Gilbert 2018) . They call for bioethicists to engage with structural analysis to understand how macro-economic structures intersect with medical research and practice. This article seeks to contribute to promoting these types of connections by offering several illustrations of how twenty-first century capitalism intersects with COVID-19 and offering some glimpse into both the pathologies and opportunities for change going forward.","Australia","first author","2020-11-06","11"

The agitation was mild, and he did not require medication treatment. Repeat neurological examination on day 7 of admission demonstrated ocular flutter (see Video S1) and opsoclonus (earliest section of Video S1) and truncal ataxia without limb ataxia or long-track signs. There were no other additional brainstem or cerebellar ocular eye movement abnormalities. Myoclonus was not observed. Noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging on day 9 of admission (day 17 since SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis) showed chronic white ischemic change on background of moderate cerebral atrophy without abnormalities in the cerebellum or brainstem. Cerebral spinal fluid examination was not obtained as he would have required anesthetic support, which was unavailable at the regional hospital. At this juncture, C-reactive protein and lymphopenia had normalized. Remote tele-neurological consultation was sought, and SARS-CoV-2 encephalopathy with parainfectious opsoclonus was diagnosed. The patient was managed expectantly with initial improvement of his cognitive function and resolution of the eye movement abnormality (second part of the Video S1). However, the encephalopathy subsequently declined, and he was discharged to high-level care 35 days after admission and passed away from general physical decline 43 days after SARS-CoV2 diagnosis. A postmortem examination was not performed. A timeline of the his clinical and laboratory features is presented in the Figure 1.Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a rare immunemediated neurological manifestation comprising opsoclonus, myoclonus, and ataxia and is usually parainfectious or associated with an active malignancy. 3 OMS and ocular flutter have been described in the setting of a range of infections, predominantly viral, as part of a postinfectious or parainfectious autoimmune phenomenon. 4,5 A summary of the reported cases in the past 30 years in the English literature is presented in Table S1 . Myoclonus and/or opsoclonus may not be present in these 5 cases, and so the absence of myoclonus and predominance of flutter over opsoclonus in the present case is not atypical.Two cases of SARS-CoV-2 myoclonus and ocular flutter associated with brainstem encephalitis have been reported, 7, 8 and the present similar case with ocular flutter, opsoclonus, and ataxia, but absence of myoclonus, adds to the clinical spectrum. Management in non-malignancy-related OMS is symptomatic, with or without immunosuppressant therapy, with significant improvement or resolution of neurology symptoms in majority of patients. 4 Opsoclonus comprises omni-directional back-to-back saccades without an intersaccadic interval, whereas the related phenomenon, ocular flutter, comprises purely horizontal saccadic oscillations without an intersaccadic interval. 9 The pathophysiological mechanism underlying ocular flutter and opsoclonus is not certain. Earlier suggestions that lesions encompassing the omnipause neurons in the pons have not been substantiated by neuroimaging or neuropathological examination. Current thinking is that these phenomena relate to either membrane instability of saccadic burst neurons in the brainstem or, perhaps more likely, disinhibition of the fastigial nuclei of the cerebellum. 4 The time course of manifestations suggests SARS-CoV-2 as the causative etiology in the patient's neurological presentation. Neurological involvement is observed in approximately one third of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and can be the presenting feature in patients without typical SARS-CoV-2 respiratory or systemic symptoms. Although encephalitis in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be via immune-mediated cytokine and chemokine release triggered by direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, other neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, are likely to be parainfectious. 9, 10 That is, in these cases it is presumed that autoimmune cross-reactivity is the mechanism as in other viral infections with similar parainfectious manifestations. 8, 10 In the same vein, we suggest that the present case of saccadic oscillations and ataxia is related to immune-related dysfunction within the brainstem or cerebellum.This case adds to the expanding spectrum of SARS-CoV-2associated neurological manifestations.

The disease is caused by virulent biotypes of feline coronaviruses (FCoV), known as the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Addie et al. 2009; Drechsler et al. 2011; Pedersen 2014a) . FIPV arises through unidentified genetic alterations in FCoV leading to an enhanced capacity to replicate within the monocytes and macrophages (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2009 ). While FIP can affect cats of any age, its incidence is greatest amongst cats less than three years of age, particularly, those aged between four and sixteen months (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2009 ). The true prevalence of FIP is not known. While some authors cite that approximately 12%, or one out of nine FCoV-infected cats, will progress to clinical signs of FIP (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2014b) , this figure has been extrapolated from veterinary hospital studies, rather than the domesticated feline population at large, and is not congruent with field estimates of the number of cases seen relative to the population. Other studies provide a lower prevalence of FIP. In a case-control study spanning a ten-year period from 1986 to 1995, out of 397,182 accessions presented to North American veterinary medical teaching hospitals, approximately 0.55% of new feline and 0.36% of total feline accessions were cats with FIP (Rohrbach et al. 2001 ). These FIP patients were significantly more likely to be purebred, young and sexually intact males (Rohrbach et al. 2001; Pesteanu-Somogyi et al. 2006) . In a study investigating feline accessions at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine over a sixteen-year period from 1986 to 2002, of the 11,535 cats of known breed that were examined, the prevalence of suspected or confirmed FIP in the mixed breed cat population was 0.35% versus 1.3% in the purebred cat population (Pesteanu-Somogyi et al. 2006) . For some of these studies, the diagnosis of FIP was made on the basis of clinical examination alone and without confirmatory diagnostic tests (Rohrbach et al. 2001; Pesteanu-Somogyi et al. 2006) . In an Australian study, young cats were significantly overrepresented amongst FIP cases (Worthing et al. 2012) . Domestic crossbred, Persian and Himalayan cats were significantly under-represented compared to the Australian cat population, while several breeds were over-represented, including the British Shorthair, Devon Rex and Abyssinian breeds. A significantly higher proportion of males had FIP (Worthing et al. 2012) .FIP is categorised by its clinical presentation as either a wet (effusive) or dry (non-effusive) form (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2009 Pedersen , 2014a . The wet form is characterised by immune-mediated, fibrinous-granulomatous serositis, often with protein-rich effusions in the thoracic or abdominal cavities (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2009 Pedersen , 2014a ). In contrast, the dry form is typified by pyogranulomatous lesions found in multiple body organs and around blood vessels (Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2009 Pedersen , 2014a .FIP-associated mortality is extremely high once clinical signs appear (Pedersen 2014b) . As noted by Pedersen (2014b, p.133) , 'the onset of overt disease is a signal that the cat's battle with the virus has been lost.' Even though some cats can live with FIP for weeks, months or sometimes, years (Pedersen 2014b) , survival times generally vary from days to weeks for effusive FIP and weeks to months for noneffusive FIP (Fischer et al. 2011; Tsai et al. 2011; Hugo and Heading 2015) . Providing a definitive ante-mortem diagnosis of FIP is challenging, particularly as current diagnostic tests cannot differentiate between FCoV and FIPV (Fischer et al. 2011; Pedersen 2014b) . Furthermore, as a confirmed diagnosis relies on positive immunostaining of FCoV antigen by cytology or histopathology, invasive diagnostic tests to collect tissue biopsies might be necessary in sick cats, making confirmation of the diagnosis more challenging at times (Tasker 2018) . The reader is directed to recent reviews on more detailed information on the diagnosis of FIP (Drechsler et al. 2011; Pedersen 2014b; Tasker 2018; Kennedy 2020) . In reviewing treatment options for FIP, numerous older studies describing potential treatments are mostly based on cases without a confirmed diagnosis of FIP and hampered by the lack of well-controlled clinical trials (Hartmann and Ritz 2008) . Likewise, the use of other reported treatment options is currently only supported by in vitro studies rather than through in vivo clinical studies (Choong et al. 2014; Doki et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2017; Takano et al. 2017) . Despite recent antiviral studies with GC376 and GS-441524 showing great promise against FIPV in naturally and experimentally infected cats (Murphy et al. 2018; Pedersen et al. 2018 Pedersen et al. , 2019 , these agents have not yet obtained registration for veterinary use (Wogan 2019a (Wogan , 2019b . Consequently, no effective treatments against FIP are currently legally available to veterinary clinicians (Pedersen 2019a).There is currently great interest in the potential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect animals, including reports of domesticated and zoo-housed wild cats testing positive for this virus (Hosie et al. 2020 ; United States Department of Agriculture 2020; . The coronaviruses are single strand RNA viruses (Lundstrom 2020) classified within four genera based on genotypic and serological characterisation (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus; Woo et al. 2012) . Whereas FCoV is an Alphacoronavirus (Felten and Hartmann 2019), SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a Betacoronavirus (Chakraborty and Maity 2020; Lai et al. 2020) . Coronaviruses have both a high frequency of recombination and inherently high mutation rates which allow them to adapt rapidly with a heightened potential to infect new hosts (Woo et al. 2006 ). Viral recombination is mediated in part by the proofreading activity of the nsp14 exoribonuclease, which previously has been shown to hinder the development of nucleoside-based coronavirus treatments (Agostini et al. 2018) .Domesticated cats that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 positive owners or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive owners (Halfmann et al. 2020; Newman 2020) . A small number of SARS-CoV-2 positive domesticated cats have demonstrated upper or lower respiratory signs (Sailleau et al. 2020 ), whereas others have had no overt clinical signs (Newman 2020; Sailleau et al. 2020; Sit 2020; Sit et al. 2020) . In limited experimental studies in which large viral inocula are used, it has been reported that cats can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats housed in the same facility via the airborne route (Shi et al. 2020) . Another study reported that inoculation and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 leads to nasal shedding in cats and that cats without clinical signs are capable of direct transmission to other cats (Halfmann et al. 2020) . Currently, there is no evidence that cats can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans (Hosie et al. 2020) .Although there are some antivirals described below that have demonstrated activity against FCoV, it is tempting to extrapolate that they may also reduce shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in rare instances of feline infection. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no published in vivo studies to verify their SARS-COV-2 antiviral activity in the cat.In practice, three major approaches, used either individually or in combination, have been employed to treat FIP (Pedersen 2014b ). The first approach seeks to modulate the patient's immune system non-specifically in order to reduce the clinical effects of the virus through a robust immune response (Pedersen 2014b) . The second approach relies on the use of immunosuppressive drugs to dampen the inflammatory response that is central to the pathology in this disease (Hartmann and Ritz 2008; Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2014b) , whereas the third approach centres on the use of antiviral agents to inhibit viral replication (Murphy et al. 2018; Pedersen et al. 2018 Pedersen et al. , 2019 . Although each of these major approaches can be used simultaneously, each will be addressed in turn.Non-specific immunostimulants have been used as treatments for FIP for many years, often due to unsubstantiated anecdotal reports claiming that such regimens either can improve survival times or serve as an outright cure for FIP (Pedersen 2014b) . The over-arching aim of this approach is to encourage the patient to produce an immune response strong enough to reduce the viral load sufficiently to reduce clinical effects of the infection. However, it is somewhat paradoxical that the use of immunostimulants is often paired with immunosuppressive agents, given that some of these drugs may work at crosspurposes to one another (Pedersen 2014b ). Examples of non-specific immunostimulants administered as FIP treatments include staphylococcal A protein (Pedersen 2014b) , Propionibacterium acnes (an immunomodulatory compound derived from gram positive bacteria) (Weiss et al. 1990) , lymphocyte T-cell immunomodulators (such as omega [x] interferon) (Pedersen 2014b ) and plant extracts such as polyprenyl immunostimulant (PI) (Legendre and Bartges 2009; Legendre et al. 2017 ). All of these agents have been unsuccessful or have had limited success as FIP treatments. For example, with respect to the biologic plant extract PI, the use of this agent was originally suggested by Legendre and Bartges (2009) , after three cats with the dry form of FIP were reportedly cured after long-term treatment with PI. However, these researches conceded that the treatment had no effect on cats with more severe FIP (Legendre and Bartges 2009) . A later field study of PI in 60 cats showed improved survival times with four of these cats surviving over 300 days with an improved quality of life (Legendre et al. 2017) . The study also showed that survival times with PI were significantly longer in cats that were not treated with corticosteroids concurrently (Legendre et al. 2017 ).The use of immunosuppressive agents to dampen the inflammatory response to FIPV stands as something of a therapeutic placeholder. That is, a lack of access to safe and effective alternatives can leave veterinary clinicians with very few options other than to rely on immunosuppressive therapies to control the clinical signs of FIP (Hartmann and Ritz 2008; Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2014a) . Examples of immunosuppressive agents as FIP treatments include glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone) (Disque et al. 1968; Addie et al. 2009 ), cytokine inhibitors (e.g. pentoxifylline and propentofylline) (Fischer et al. 2011 ) and alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) (Bilkei 1988; Addie et al. 2009 ). Although glucocorticoid administration reduces clinical signs in cats with FIP, there is no evidence that they are curative for infected cats (Addie et al. 2009 ). Claims that agents such as glucocorticoids are effective against FIP have been disproved by placebo-controlled, double blinded studies by Ritz et al. (2007) and Fischer et al. (2011) . In these studies, investigating the effects of feline interferon x (Ritz et al. 2007 ) and propentofylline (Fischer et al. 2011 ) on the survival time and quality of life of FIPaffected cats, all cats (including those in a placebo group) received dexamethasone and/or prednisolone. The respective authors reported that there was no significant difference in survival times between those FIP-affected cats that received either feline interferon x (Ritz et al. 2007) or propentofylline (Fischer et al. 2011 ) (median survival time of nine days for feline interferon x and eight days for propentofylline) and those in the control group administered glucocorticoids only (median survival time of eight days in both studies). Given the co-administration of dexamethasone and/or prednisolone in both of these studies, it is difficult to determine the effects of feline interferon x or propentofylline as a single therapeutic agent. Feline interferon x has been shown to inhibit FCoV replication in vitro (Mochizuki et al. 1994 ). An uncontrolled trial with feline interferon x and glucocorticoids yielded a promising result with 67% of cats achieving complete or partial remission, but FIP was not confirmed in these cases (Ishida et al. 2004 ). When recombinant human leukocyte alpha interferon or feline fibroblastic beta interferon were used alone, neither reduced the mortality in treated cats compared to controls (Weiss and Toivio-Kinnucan 1988; Bolcskei and Bilkei 1995; Ritz et al. 2007 ). However, when a high dose of alpha interferon was used in combination with Propionibacterium acnes, the mean survival time was prolonged, but only by three weeks (Weiss et al. 1990 ). Overall, although interferons are frequently used in cats with FIP, their efficacy is questionable. Likewise, the use of cyclophosphamide also has been investigated in cats with FIP in combination with prednisolone and ampicillin (Bilkei 1988 ). Seventy-six of 151 cats were regarded as 'healthy' after therapy. However, cats included in this study had no confirmed diagnosis of FIP. Another study investigating the use of cyclophosphamide in addition to prednisolone and ampicillin in suspected FIP cases reported that 29-80% of cats died in three years (Bolcskei and Bilkei 1995) . Again, FIP was not confirmed in these cats. Ozagrel hydrochloride (a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor) has also been used as an immunosuppressive agent against FIP (Watari et al. 1998) . Although it was shown to have a beneficial effect in two cats, FIP was not confirmed in either of these patients (Watari et al. 1998 ).The third approach to the treatment of FIP involves the administration of antiviral agents to target either the cellular mechanisms that viruses co-opt for replication, or alternatively, a specific aspect of virus activity related to infection and/or replication (Hartmann and Ritz 2008; Addie et al. 2009; Pedersen 2014a) . Antiviral drugs that inhibit FCoV have been identified but many have not been successfully trialled in infected patients (Weiss et al. 1993; Hartmann and Ritz 2008; Addie et al. 2009; McDonagh et al. 2014; Pedersen 2014b ). However, a new therapeutic breakthrough using the nucleoside analog GS-441524 as a direct acting antiviral drug for FIP has been reported (Murphy et al. 2018; Pedersen 2019a Pedersen , 2019b Dickinson et al. 2020 ). GS-441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir, is an RNA-chain terminator of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Murphy et al. 2018; Pedersen et al. 2019 ) and has been found to strongly inhibit FIPV both in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies as well as in cases of naturally occurring FIP (Murphy et al. 2018; Pedersen et al. 2019) . Utilising an in vitro approach, Murphy et al. (2018) determined that GS-441524 was non-toxic in Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells at 100 mM concentrations whilst still being able to inhibit FIPV replication in both cultured CRFK cells and naturally infected feline peritoneal macrophages at 1.0 mM concentrations. In a companion in vivo study in cats experimentally infected with FIPV (serotype I FIPV m3c-2 strain), GS-441524 was administered once a day (5.0 mg/kg BW or 2.0 mg/kg BW as a subcutaneous injection [SC]) for two weeks once the disease course became established (Murphy et al. 2018 ). Requiring at least two weeks of treatment, this regimen led to a rap id reversal of clinical signs and a return to normality in all subjects. No toxicity was noted. Building on this work, Pedersen et al. (2019) investigated the in vivo therapeutic effects of GS-441524 on naturally occurring FIP, including both the wet and dry forms of the disease. In this study, 31 cats (26 with effusive FIP and five with non-effusive FIP) were recruited and administered a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg BW SC once daily for at least 12 weeks. The dosage was increased to 4.0 mg/kg BW SC once daily when indicated by deteriorating clinical signs. Four cats were euthanised or died within the first five days of the experiment as a result of the severity of their infection. A fifth cat was euthanised after 26 days due to a lack of treatment response. The remaining 26 cats successfully completed the twelve-week (or longer) trial. Eighteen of the cats remained healthy after one course of treatment whereas the remaining eight suffered relapses within 3 to 84 days. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage whilst five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg BW. The five cats treated with the higher dose remained healthy. Of the remaining three cats treated at the original lower dose, two of them relapsed a second time and required a third treatment with the higher dose. These two cats remained healthy after the second dose. The third cat relapsed after a second round of the lower dose and was euthanised due to the severity of its neurological disease. Ultimately, the study produced 25 long time survivors. Injection site reactions were the most common side effect (Pedersen et al. 2019 ). Based on these findings, the authors concluded that GS-441524 is a safe and effective treatment for FIP when administered at a dosage of 4.0 mg/kg BW SC once a day for at least 12 weeks (Pedersen et al. 2019) . A higher dosage of 5.0 to 10.0 mg/kg BW SC once a day for 12 weeks has been recommended for neurological FIP cases as determined by the treatment of four clinical cases (Dickinson et al. 2020) . Given the consistency of its reported efficacy, a burgeoning global black-market for GS-441524 has arisen since it has not been formally approved for commercial use anywhere (Pedersen 2019b) . Interestingly, GS-441524 has also displayed in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Cho et al. 2012) .Likewise, remdesivir (GS-5734), a prodrug of the parent adenosine nucleoside analog, GS-441524 (Amirian and Levy 2020), has been granted emergency use authorisation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with a severe infection. This emergency authorisation was based on a randomised, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (NCT04280705) and a sponsored openlabelled trial that evaluated different durations of remdesivir (NCT04292899). Another randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial conducted in China also showed that the use of remdesivir in adult patients with COVID-19 was associated with a reduction in time to clinical improvement when treated early, although statistically significant clinical benefits were not observed . Clinical trials of remdesivir and many other antivirals are currently underway in many countries for the treatment of COVID-19 (Amirian and Levy 2020).Whilst not related to the direct treatment of FIP, a medication proposed for reducing FCoV may be a likely precursor to FIP prevention. An antiviral product called MutianV R X, a synthetic adenosine analogue, whose exact nature is a 'commercial secret', has been shown to stop faecal feline coronavirus shedding in chronically infected cats when administered orally at 4.0 mg/kg BW, once daily for four days (Addie et al. 2020). Addie et al. (2020) suggested that a combination of probiotics and interferon may have reduced feline coronavirus shedding in two cats in the same study. Feline interferon x has been shown to reduce viral excretion of feline coronavirus in retrovirus infected cats (Gil et al. 2013) .Other candidate compounds have also been trialled for their antiviral activity against FIPV. For example, the antiviral ribavirin was tested in vivo in cats experimentally infected with FIPV and found to possess marginal antiviral activity against FIPV and toxicity to cats (Weiss et al. 1993] . Cyclosporin A, a cyclophilin inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit replication of feline coronavirus in vitro although the mechanism of its inhibitory effects is unknown (Pfefferle et al. 2011; Tanaka et al. 2012 Tanaka et al. , 2013 . Cyclosporin was administered to one cat with effusive FIP and a reduction in pleural fluid and viral load was observed after treatment. The cat died of respiratory failure on day 264 but the cause of death was not determined (Tanaka et al. 2015) . Likewise, two compounds, galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and nelfinavir (a protease inhibitor) when used in combination were able to inhibit FCoV replication in vitro (Hsieh et al. 2010 ). Yet, ultimately, neither of these compounds was found effective when tested under conditions simulating FIPV-infection. Similarly, based on promising findings concerning 3 C-like protease inhibitors efficacy against FCoV (Kim et al. 2013 (Kim et al. , 2015 (Kim et al. , 2016 , a field trial of GC376 was undertaken with 20 cats with various forms of FIP, excluding those with neurological signs . Cats were administered a dosage of 15.0 mg/ kg BW, SC, twice a day for a minimum of 12 weeks. Whilst results were encouraging (with seven cats achieving a mean disease remission of 11.2 months), side effects developed, including transient pain upon injection, subcutaneous fibrosis, alopecia and abnormal development of permanent teeth in cats treated before 16-18 weeks of age . Other protease inhibitors have been shown to target the 3 C-like protein of coronaviruses (Rathnayake et al. 2020; Theerawatanasirikul et al. 2020) .The antifungal itraconazole has demonstrated in vitro anti-FIPV activity at low drug concentrations (2.5 mM) (Takano et al. 2019) . A recent in vivo study investigated the effects of a combination of itraconazole (50 mg/animal per os, once a day) and an antihuman TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (10 mg/animal) for the treatment of three cats experimentally infected with FIPV . Although two of the three cats showed improvement from FIPVrelated clinical signs, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count and a decrease in alpha-1acid glycoprotein were identified after treatment began. The third cat was euthanised due to its failure to respond to treatment. The authors concluded that this combination of drugs may be useful until more effective anti-FIPV agents become available. Itraconazole, in combination with prednisolone, have been used to treat effusive FIP in a three-month-old male Scottish Fold kitten, leading to a reduction in pleural effusion (Kameshima et al. 2020 ). However, this cat showed neurological manifestations and was euthanised due to status epilepticus after 38 days of treatment (Kameshima et al. 2020) . Moreover, other agents have also been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against FCoV, including an anti-feline TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (Doki et al. 2016 ); U18666A (a cholesterol transport inhibitor) ; diphyllin (a vacuolar ATPase blocker) and its nanoformulation (Hu et al. 2017 ) and a circular triple helix forming oligonucleotide RNA (Choong et al. 2014 ). However, no in vivo studies have been reported using these compounds.The human antimalarial drug chloroquine also inhibits FIPV replication in vitro (Takano et al. 2013; McDonagh et al. 2014 ). Chloroquine has long been known to possess both anti-inflammatory and in vitro antiviral properties against a diverse range of viruses (Takano et al. 2013 ). Yet, despite its good in vitro efficacy, chloroquine displayed poor antiviral efficacy against in vivo experimentally induced FIP infection (Takano et al. 2013) . In their study, Takano et al. (2013) found that chloroquine treatment was associated with an improvement in clinical scores and a slightly increased, but not statistically significant, survival time of cats infected with the highly virulent FCoV FIPV1146. Additionally, increased activity levels of alanine aminotransferase in the chloroquine-treated groups indicated a potential problem with hepatic damage. The dosage of 10 mg/kg BW twice weekly SC was extrapolated from human dosing protocols and not based on any known pharmacokinetic studies in cats. Recently, hydroxychloroquine's antiviral activity against FIPV has also been studied in vitro. When used with recombinant feline IFN-x, hydroxychloroquine showed increased antiviral activity against FIPV infection ). Hydroxychloroquine has also been investigated in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment in people (Lundstrom 2020) . However, this drug has resulted in controversial results, leading to the current conclusion that its clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 has not been verified to date (Lundstrom 2020) . McDonagh et al. (2014) screened 19 candidate compounds used in the treatment of other coronavirus infections for their cell toxicity and effectiveness at inhibiting FIPV replication in infected CRFK cells. In this in vitro study, a resazurin-based cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition screening test was developed to investigate antiviral efficacy against two strains of FCoV: FECV 1683 and FIPV 1146. Other assays, including plaque reduction, virus yield reduction and viricidal suspension were used to evaluate the antiviral effects of the candidate compounds. Ultimately, the study identified three compounds (chloroquine, mefloquine and hexamethylene amiloride) that substantially reduced the viral load of FIPV in infected CRFK cells without cytotoxic effects at 10 mM concentrations. Moreover, preliminary experiments suggested that the antiviral mechanisms of all three compounds acted at an early stage of viral replication.Given the potential impact of these results for the treatment of FIP, further investigation of these compounds is warranted (McDonagh et al. 2014) . Both chloroquine and mefloquine are commercially available pharmaceutical agents registered for use in people. Each has an extensive body of supporting literature regarding their pharmacokinetics and safety in non-feline species and some information is now available on mefloquine's pharmacokinetic profile in cats (Izes 2019; Izes et al. 2020a Izes et al. , 2019 Izes et al. , 2020b Yu et al. 2020) . Considerably less is known about hexamethylene amiloride, particularly with respect to its safety (McDonagh et al. 2014 ). As Takano et al. (2013) previously discounted the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine as an antiviral agent for FIP, clinical trials of mefloquine to treat infected cats could be considered. Recent in vitro pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that mefloquine undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism, but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism, when catalysed by feline hepatic microsomes and therefore is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats (Izes et al. 2020a ). Mefloquine's pharmacokinetic profile in cats has been investigated in anticipation of undertaking clinical trials to inhibit feline coronavirus and feline calicivirus in those cats clinically affected by these viral infections . Further research on the clinical efficacy of mefloquine in FIP-confirmed cats is underway.With respect to all these antiviral agents, it is important to note that a combination of therapeutics may be required to be administered to patients to inhibit monotherapy selection of viral resistance.Despite the absence of their commercial availability, antivirals such as GS-441524 and GC376, have been shown to be efficacious treatment options against FIP. Whilst pending the regulatory approval of these agents, other commercially available agents, such as mefloquine and itraconazole, need to be investigated more thoroughly through in vivo studies to ascertain their true potential as FIPV antivirals. Moreover, whilst to date, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had little reported impact on veterinary medicine, a global One Health approach dictates that a vigilant watch is kept on therapeutic advances in the fight against coronaviruses as the information may ultimately be useful across species.","Australia","first author","2020-11-13","11"

T cells are reported to be pivotal in mounting a successful immune response against COVID-19 as recovered individuals exhibit SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell memory and T cell dysfunction, and imbalance has been reported as a hallmark of severe COVID-19 (4, 5) . Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been implicated in COVID-19 with CD4+ T cells being broadly Th1-like by the secretion of cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and CD8+ T cells also secreting TNF and IFN- as well as effecting direct target cell lysis through the secretion of perforin and granzymes (6) . Cross-reactive T cells between other human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, suggesting the potential role for T cell cross-protection in COVID-19 (7, 8) . Here we investigated whether cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can arise from Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-derived peptide sensitization.BCG vaccine containing live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, hereafter referred to as BCG, typically vaccinates against tuberculosis (TB). It can also induce cross-protection against pathogens unrelated to TB. The cross-protective effects have shown to reduce all-cause mortality in children and respiratory tract infections in adults (9) (10) (11) (12) . One mechanism of cross-protection is through BCG epigenetically modifying innate immune cells in the form of trained innate immunity lasting up to one year (13, 14) . The heterologous effect of BCG vaccination on T cells has been demonstrated in other viral infections such as murine vaccinia virus and HPV papillomatosis (15) (16) (17) (18) .Given the heterologous effects of BCG vaccination, more than 15 clinical trials are currently underway globally to test the cross-protective effect of BCG in COVID-19, most notably the BRACE study involving 10,000 healthcare workers in Australia and the Netherlands (1). Although reports from these prospective trials are still forthcoming, large country-level epidemiological analyses have shown a negative correlation between BCG vaccination status of a country and COVID-19 disease severity or case growth (19) (20) (21) .Here we show that the observed benefits of BCG vaccination in the context of COVID-19 can be attributed, in part, to T cell cross-reactivity.T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 are being increasingly characterised and recognised as pivotal in mounting a successful immune response to COVID-19 (6) . To study the extent that BCG-primed T cells could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and promote viral clearance, we first performed NCBI Protein Blast searches against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, restricting results to BCG proteins.Regions of protein sequence homology were identified between BCG sequences and the nonstructural proteins NSP3 and NSP13 located in ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1 and table S1 ). When processed as 15mers for MHCII presentation, these regions exhibit up to 60% identity and 73.3% similarity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2 (table S1). Percent identity and similarity of constituent 9mers for MHCI presentation are up to 88.8% and 100%, respectively, permitting cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.Amino acid sequence alignment of the peptide pairs (PP) of BCG (top sequence) and SARS-CoV-2 (bottom sequence) used in this study. Red coloured amino acid -identity. Yellow coloured amino acid -similarity. Grey coloured amino acid -no identity or similarity.To determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of these BCG derived peptides across diverse HLA-types, we selected 10 healthy HLA-typed blood donors with different HLA types (Table S2b) .Based on IEDB population coverage, our collection of HLA-typed individuals gave a global MHC Class I and II coverage of 97.21% and 99.97%, respectively (27) . In addition, binding affinity predictions of the homologous peptides to HLA alleles from the 10 HLA-typed donors used in this study were analysed (Figs. S1 & S2). Based on homology and strong binding, a selection of eight different 15mer peptide pairs (PP1-8) were chosen for subsequent experimentation on human donors (Fig. 1) . To determine if HLA-typing was necessary, we also tested the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the BCG derived peptides on 10 non-HLA-typed persons.To determine if priming with BCG peptide enhances T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we compared CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV2 peptides using cells that were either primed with a control peptide (invariant chain peptide, CLIP) or BCG peptide. CD3+ T cells were isolated from donors (n=20, table S2a) and co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro (Fig. 3) .All individuals (n=20) exhibited a positive response to at least 7 out of 8 SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Fig.   2 ). The enhanced positive cross-reactive response confirms the prediction of high HLA binding affinity and we confirm these cross-reactive peptides are immunogenic as they elicit CD4+ Th1like responses and robust CD8+ responses.Heat map of individuals representing global HLA coverage shows improved SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide.

We found that CD8+ T cells primed with BCG-derived peptides had an enhanced perforin expression upon SARS-CoV-2 restimulation when compared to control primed cells (Fig. S5b ). Cross-reactive perforin expression in responders was significantly increased across all 8 peptide pairs with a mean foldincrease ranging from 1.9-fold (PP1) to 47.2-fold (PP4). Thus, cross-reactive CD8+ T cells can effect an antiviral response by target cell lysis.In order to mount an effective T cell response to COVID-19, antigen-specific T cells need to become activated and undergo clonal expansion. To assess whether T cells pre-stimulated with BCG-derived peptides exhibit enhanced T cell activation when restimulated with SARS-CoV-2 homologues, expression of early T cell activation marker CD69 was assessed by flow cytometry.To assess whether T cells primed with BCG derived peptides show enhanced T cell proliferation upon SARS-CoV-2 peptide restimulation, cell proliferation dye CTY was used to assess the proliferation after BCG priming followed by CTV to assess the proliferation after SARS-CoV-2 restimulation. All donor samples primed with a BCG peptide developed enhanced T cell proliferation to at least 3 out of the 8 SARS-CoV-2 peptides tested (Fig. 2) . The magnitude of the enhanced proliferative response was also assessed in BCG-primed individuals who responded SARS-CoV-2 restimulation. Specifically, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 peptide induced proliferation in cells that were first sensitized with BCG peptide or with control peptide. In all of the tested peptide pairs (PP1-PP8) and across both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, BCG peptide sensitized cells developed significantly enhanced proliferation to its SARS-CoV-2 homologous peptide ( Fig.   4 ). In the responders, T cell proliferation was enhanced in CD8+ T cells between 19% (PP3 and PP5) to 51% (PP6) and in CD4+ T cells by 11% (PP5) to 39% (PP8). Therefore, we show that BCG peptides have the ability to cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2 by T cell activation and heightened T cell proliferation.To confirm and establish the T memory cell phenotype of proliferated T cells after BCG stimulation, the proportion of T effector memory (Tem), T central memory (Tcm) and T effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) cells were determined based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression patterns on the proliferated CD4+ or CD8+ cells (Fig. S7 ). Across all 8 tested BCG peptides, greater than 99% of proliferated BCG-stimulated cells exhibited Tcm, Tem or TEMRA memory phenotype at day 16, the rest being naïve phenotype (CD45RA+, CCR7+). Of these memory cells, Tem was the predominant phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. CD4+ cells exhibited a minor subpopulation of Tcm and few TEMRA and CD8+ cells exhibited a minor subpopulation of TEMRA and few Tcm. Therefore, T memory phenotypes predominate in BCG-stimulated T cells providing an explanation for their potential to heighten recall responses.Although the self-reported BCG vaccination status of our donors was known (n=10), we found no significant difference in responses from BCG vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals (data not shown). The co-culture assay was not designed to test the direct ex vivo recall response of prior BCG vaccination but rather to simulate vaccination in vitro by pre-stimulating with BCG-derived peptides. We analysed an equal number of males and females in this study (n=10 each) and no significant sex-specific differences were found in the parameters measured (data not shown).The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee project ID 25834. All donors provided written informed consent.No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample size. The experiments were not randomised. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and assessment of outcomes.Seven donors underwent high resolution class I and II molecular sequence-based typing performed by the Australian Red Cross Victorian Transplantation and Immunogenetics Service by next-generation sequencing. Three donors underwent low-resolution HLA-DR typing at the same provider. HLA typing results are contained within table S2b.Global allele coverage of HLA-typed donors was assessed at IEDB Analysis Resource -Population Coverage (27) . NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0 were used to predict binding affinity of homologous peptides to a globally representative collection of MHCI or MHCII alleles plus the alleles of our HLA-typed donors using artificial neural networks (24) (25) (26) . For each region of homology, 9mers for MHCI and 15mers for MHCII overlapping by 1 amino acid underwent affinity analysis. Affinity rank was generated that normalizes prediction score by comparing to prediction of a set of random peptides. An affinity rank score of < 2 was called a strong binder. An affinity rank score of ≥ 2 and 10 was called a binder. An affinity rank score of > 10 was called a nonbinder.Protein BLAST search of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (sequence ID NC_045512.2) restricted to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) was performed using the NCBI blastp suite (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).Protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 NSP315mer peptides were synthesised with an N-terminal free amine (H-) and a free acid group at the C-terminus (-OH). Peptides were ≥ 90% pure as assessed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Mimotopes). Peptide sequences used in this study can be found in table S1 and control peptide CLIP103-117 (PVSKMRMATPLLMQA). Lyophilized peptide was reconstituted in sterile MilliQ water with 5% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma). Final concentration of peptides used in culture was 10g/mL and final concentration of DMSO in the cultures was 0.005% (v/v).Human PBMCs were freshly isolated from whole donor blood in K2EDTA anticoagulant Vacutainers (BD) using Lymphoprep density gradient medium (Stemcell) and SepMate tubes (Stemcell). PBMCs were enumerated in a haemocytometer with trypan blue 0.4% (Sigma) and the CD14+ CD16-monocytes were then magnetically separated using EasySep Human Monocyteisolated monocytes were then enumerated in a haemocytometer with 0.4% trypan blue and differentiation culture was established to differentiate the monocytes into dendritic cells using ImmunoCult Dendritic Cell Culture Kit following instructions of the manufacturer (Stemcell).Human CD3+ T cells were isolated from fresh whole donor blood in K2EDTA tubes using RosetteSep HLA T Cell Enrichment Cocktail according to instructions of the manufacturer (Stemcell). Isolated CD3+ T cells were enumerated in a haemocytometer with 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma). CD3+ T cells were then used in the ICS and proliferation co-cultures.Then 10,000 freshly-cultured, human mature DCs were added per well with 10g/mL of SARS-CoV-2 peptide from PP1-8 (Fig. 1) or control peptide CLIP103-117. Positive assay control received anti-human CD2, anti-human CD3, and anti-human CD28 coated MACS iBeads at a ratio of 1 bead:2cells. Negative assay control received no peptides. Co-culture was incubated at 37C in a CO2 incubator for 7 days then harvested for flow cytometric analysis. The entire culture system was setup to be autologous.Flow cytometry data was exported from FlowJo 10.6.2 (BD) and analysed using R Studio version 1.3.959 before being analysed in GraphPad Prism 7 (Graphpad Software Inc.). A Shapiro Wilk test was used to determine normality followed by a two-tailed, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test to compare the responses of BCG primed with control primed samples from responders.

Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of more than 5,000 chemicals/carcinogens/toxins [2] , and is one of the major sources of exposure to chemicallymediated diseases in humans, and perhaps in other living organisms [3] . Smoking is one of the risk factors for the development and worsening of multiple respiratory diseases, including infections [4, 5] . In particular, tobacco smoking is one of the main contributors to respiratory diseases that include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer [6, 7] .Smoking is also an independent risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to disruption in the repair of respiratory epithelium and reduced bacteria clearance from the airways [8, 9] . Furthermore, epidemiological studies have highlighted the role of smoking in the establishment of active tuberculosis (TB), reduction in anti-TB immunity, and TB-related mortality [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The WHO presented worrying statistics that lung-related deaths due to smoking, including second-hand smoke, totaled 3.3 million in 2017 and included 1.5 million people dying from chronic respiratory diseases and 1.2 million deaths from cancer (tracheal, bronchus and lung) [15] .Smoke exposure results in infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue, which in turn induces the excess production of mucus, causes epithelial-cell hyperplasia, interrupts tissue repair, thickens the small airway walls, induces emphysema, and impairs lung function including gas exchange [16] . Inflammation and injury to the pulmonary epithelia are induced when the airways are exposed to inhaled particulates (e.g. cigarette smoke; CS) [16] . This leads to the activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the airway J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f epithelium [16, 17] . During this process, CS also interrupts the TGF-β signaling, which causes alveolar macrophages to release pro-inflammatory mediators, facilitating inflammation and fibrosis in the airway [16, 18] .CS exposure also activates and stimulates production of various inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β from infiltrating immune cells. CS and these cytokines induce the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which further amplify inflammation, leading to mucus hyper-secretion and alveolar wall destruction [19, 20] . The various ROS, along with the proteolytic enzymes, cause further tissue damage [21] . CS also induces the release of various mediators that activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [22, 23] . This leads to metaplasia of normal pseudostratified epithelium into goblet cells because of the altered expression of mucins, whereby the COPD patient experiences abnormal sputum production and chronic cough [22, 23] .CS-induced injury to airway epithelial cells also causes the release of various danger-associated molecular patterns. These signals are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on epithelial cells, which trigger non-specific, inflammatory responses including the release of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8, and the influx and activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells at the inflammation site to commence the innate immune response [24, 25] .Cigarette smoking, including active, passive and third-hand smoke exposure, is an important risk factor for upper and lower respiratory tract infection [26, 27] . A large meta-analysis of nine studies (n=40,685) reported that current smokers are five times more likely to develop influenza J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection than non-smokers [28] . A history of smoking has also been significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalisation due to influenza infection, particularly in the elderly [29] .Crucially, an association between second-hand smoke exposure and influenza-associated hospital admissions in children below 15 years of age has been reported [30] . This highlights that both active and passive smoking could substantially increase influenza infections in all age groups.Similarly, infections with human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are more pronounced in smoking or exposed individuals than those who are non-smokers [31] . HRVs are major viral pathogens that cause exacerbations of COPD and asthma. Venarske et al. have reported that asthma patients hospitalised for HRV-induced exacerbations are more likely to be current smokers than nonsmokers (odds ratio: 11.2) [31] .There are multiple mechanisms through which smoking or exposure to cigarette smoke may increase the risk of viral infections. These include alterations in airway biology, such as activation of the epithelium and hallmark structural changes in the respiratory tract such as impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, fibrosis and epithelial barrier dysfunction, as well as alterations in the immune response [28, [32] [33] [34] [35] .Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) has been shown to modulate chemokine production, with increased IL-8 and reduced IL-10 production, from human airway epithelial cells when stimulated experimentally with HRV [36] . This could potentially result in an altered immune cell profile in the airway lumen. Another study showed that HRV-treated bronchial epithelial cells exhibited a marked downregulation of the IFN-STAT-1 and SAP-JNK pathways and the suppression of CXCL10 and CCL5 production that accompanied increased viral RNA expression [37] . Importantly, CS has been shown to affect the cell-mediated immune response through elevated peripheral immune cell counts, CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio in the lungs, phagocytosis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f impairment, and Natural Killer cell dysfunction [38] [39] [40] [41] . Moreover, CS is also known to disturb the humoral immunity, with lower immunoglobulin levels in serum but higher levels in the lungs, in both human and animal studies, which have been reviewed elsewhere [42] . Another potential mechanism by which CS increases the risk of viral infections could be upregulation of viral adhesion receptors in the respiratory tract. For instance, smoking has been shown to increase the expression of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is a known receptor for HRV [43] . Crucially, blocking ICAM-1 with anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody has been found to inhibit HRV-induced exacerbations of lung inflammation in an experimental mouse model [44] .Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 31 December 2019, the WHO Country Office in China notified the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office of several cases of unusual pneumonia that occurred in Wuhan, China [45] . On 11 January 2020, China announced its first death from the virus [45] . However, at that time, no evidence was reported that the virus was spread by human-to-human transmission. Soon after, other countries including the United States of America reported confirmed cases of the virus [45] . On 23 January 2020 Wuhan city with a population of over 11 million was closed off by the Chinese authorities by which point, over 570 people had been infected and 17 had died [45] . WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [45] . At the time of writing, more than 42.4 million worldwide cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, with over 1.1 million deaths [46] . The United States of America is one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to date, with over 8.7 million cases and more than 229,000 deaths reported as of 24 October 2020 [46] . In a major spike in new COVID-19 cases, India became the nation with the world's second-highest share of cases (>7.8 million) with more than 117,000 casualties, surpassing Brazil (>5.3 million cases and >156,000 deaths) [46] .Common early symptoms of COVID-19 include high fever, sore throat, dry cough, body ache and fatigue [47] . The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus initially targets key areas of the lungs and airways that usually allow the transfer of oxygen into the blood circulation [47, 48] .Affected individuals with pre-existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, are considered to be at greater risk of acquiring severe forms of the infection [49, 50] .During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health professionals are urging smokers to quit [51, 52] .Moreover, in response to the pandemic, the Anti-smoking Centre of the National Cancer Institute of Milan and Bedfront Scientific Ltd has developed a portable carbon monoxide analyser known as ""Smokerlyzer"" which is used for smoking cessation assessment without the need for close contact with subjects [51] , assisting health professionals in conducting assessments and the follow-up of smoking cessation programs [51, 52] . Nevertheless, the risks associated with smoking and COVID-19 are somewhat unclear but a number of recent publications have reported that smokers were under-represented in hospitalised COVID-19 cases and even suggested that a potential protective effect for nicotine [53, 54] .Based on the currently available data, this article focuses on and discusses the potential relationship between smoking and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection as well as severity of COVID-19 symptoms.Smoking is well established as having an adverse impact on lung health. As outlined above, research has shown that smoking is detrimental to the immune response within the respiratory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f system, causing smokers to become more prone to infectious pathogens [55] . Previous studies have identified smoking as one of the risk factors associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection and mortality [42, 56] . A significantly increased risk of MERSrelated mortality was reported in smokers when compared to non/never-smokers (relative risk:, although the data were based on only eight smokers [57] . As both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the same Coronaviridae family, there is increasing attention on the potential for smoking to predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection or a worsened COVID-19 prognosis.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 78 COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals in Wuhan, China between 30 December 2019 and 15 January 2020 [58] . The investigators reported that a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking exhibited a rapid deterioration in health during their admission compared to non-smokers (27% versus 3%, p = 0·018), suggesting that smoking may have a harmful effect on COVID-19 prognosis [58] .Multivariate logistic regression analysis supported a significant association between history of smoking and severe disease progression (OR 14·3 [95% CI: 1·58-25·0]) [58] .Another retrospective cohort study conducted in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak on 140 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan between 16 January and 3 February 2020, found that smoking was associated with more severe forms of the disease [59] .Other factors that related to progression of COVID-19 included older age, a higher body temperature at admission, higher respiratory rate, reduced albumin and elevated C-reactive protein levels [58] . A study involving a larger cohort of 1,099 patients with COVID-19 across 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through to 29 January 2020 determined that a greater proportion of current and former smokers were among severe J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cases of COVID-19 (16·9 and 5·2%, respectively) than among non-severe cases (11·8 and 1·3%, respectively) [47] . Additionally, of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an ICU, needed mechanical ventilation, or died, 25.8% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers as compared to 11.8% and 1.6% of patients, respectively, without these adverse outcomes. confirmed COVID-19 patients, that active smokers with COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate, and were more likely to have severe complications, compared to non-smokers [63] .One of the largest cohort studies conducted to date from the UK reported an increased risk for inhospital COVID-19 death in ex-smokers compared to never-smokers (HR 1·8 [95% CI 1·7-1·9]) when adjusted for age and sex [64] . This association was found to be significant even after adjustment for additional risk factors, such as body mass index, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic heart disease (fully adjusted HR 1·25 [95% CI 1·18-1·33]).In addition, current smoking was found to be associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (age and sex adjusted HR 1·25 [95% CI 1·12-1·40]), which however decreased to 0·88 (0·79-0·99) when fully adjusted. They reported that the decrease in risk was largely driven by While most of the studies to date have indicated an association between smoking and a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, there are reports that have suggested an inverse relationship between smoking and COVID-19. In particular, smoking prevalence among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be lower than the smoking prevalence in the general population. Using hospital data from NHS England and APHP Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital from [71] . However, the authors also found that an unknown smoking status was associated with a higher hospitalization risk (OR 1.43 [95% CI: 1.16 -1.75]) which may indicate difficulty in establishing the smoking status of patients [71] .Two preliminary systematic reviews investigated the effects of smoking on severity of COVID-19 and reported a negative association. A meta-analysis of 1,399 patients with confirmed COVID-19 found no significant association between smoking and COVID-19 disease severity (OR 1·69 [95% CI 0·41-6·92]), despite a trend towards higher risk [72] . Guo later cited issues in the data collection that may have affected the meta-analysis and concluded that an updated metaanalysis suggested that active smoking is significantly associated with the risk of severe COVID-19 [73] . On the other hand, Vardavas and Nikitara did not find a significant association between smoking and severity of the disease upon analysis of five studies (RR 1·4 [95% CI: 0·98-2·00]) [74] . However, they did report a statistically significant association between smoking status and the primary end-points of mortality, admission to ICU, or ventilator use (RR 2·4 [95% CI: 1·43-4·04]) [74] .A follow-up study also documented that COVID-19 disease prevalence and progression was not directly correlated with smoking status [75] . Some researchers are questioning the validity of these studies, highlighting flaws in the statistical analyses [76] and potential bias with regard to the smoker populations selected in the analyses [77] . Lo and Lasnier have underscored the inappropriateness of using null hypothesis significance testing to conclude an absence of smoking effect on COVID-19 progression, and recommended the use of an estimation approach as a more clinically informative statistical approach for interpreting the OR results [76] . In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f addition, some studies have not made statistical adjustments for confounders such as age, gender and co-morbidities.While data on the association between smoking and COVID-19 is mixed, the available evidence suggests that smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. One of the challenges for studies on COVID-19 is to have sufficient sample sizes to allow adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases, which are closely associated with tobacco smoking. Thus, welldesigned population-based studies are needed to determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 among smokers.Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-II has attracted worldwide attention in relation to COVID-19 [4] . Constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, myocardium, and gastrointestinal tract, ACE-II is a type II transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase that metabolizes angiotensin II into multiple metabolites, such as angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-(1-7) [78, 79] . In human respiration, ACE-II is expressed on the surface of type-II pneumocytes [80] . It plays an essential role in regulating blood pressure and cardiac function, but its role in the respiratory system remains more obscure [81, 82] .While a recent study showed that there is no significant correlation between ACE-II genetic polymorphism with COVID-19 infection, several studies demonstrated that its receptor does play a key role in the infiltration of coronavirus [83] [84] [85] [86] . Coronavirus contains large type-I transmembrane spike glycoproteins, which contain 2 distinct domains, S1 and S2 [83] . S1domain shares a similar homolog to the ACE-II receptor binding site, while the S2 domain J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f facilitates fusion between cell and virus membrane [83, 84] . Studies have shown that such characteristics appeared in several coronavirus family members, including SARS-CoV, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 [83] [84] [85] . Recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly higher affinity in binding with the ACE-II receptor; hence, it is more likely to bind and infect human cells than other coronaviruses [80, 87] . Importantly, studies have shown that smokers have increased expression of the ACE-II receptor, compared to non-smokers [4, 88, 89] . Similar events were also observed and reported in recent RNA expression profiling for patients with confirmed COVID-19 [90] . Collectively, this information suggests that smokers may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to elevated expression in ACE-II receptors.Should elevated ACE-II expression be confirmed as a factor that increases the vulnerability of smokers to COVID-19 disease, therapeutic targeting of ACE-II may present new pathways in the treatment of COVID-19, particularly in smokers, as shown in Figure 1 . In recent work that utilised human recombinant soluble ACE-II (HRS-ACE-II), Monteil et al. reported that this approach was able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 recovery by a factor of 1000-5000 in kidney organoids under in vitro conditions, suggesting that HRS-ACE-II could potentially inhibit the invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 [91] . HRS-ACE-II is currently undergoing a phase 2 clinical trial as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19 (NCT04335136), and hence, its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, with and without a smoking history, remain to be determined [92] .Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce the biosynthesis ACE-II enzymes allowing greater number of free ACE-II receptors, there were initial concerns about the potential of an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality or severity among patients taking these drugs for cardiovascular conditions. Nonetheless, authorities including the Cardiac Society of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) recommends the continuation of ACEIs in patients with hypertension, heart failure and other cardiovascular related diseases, as discontinuation of these life-saving medications could potentially be harmful [93] .While we are still in the early stages of establishing the pathogenesis of COVID-19, several studies have implicated an association between tobacco smoking and poorer disease prognoses in COVID-19 patients. Further research will be required to validate these initial findings and also establish the mechanisms underlying the presentation of more severe symptoms of COVID-19 in smokers. In addition, clear evidence of a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to smoking has not been established to date and this will need to be carefully examined in future epidemiological studies. A role for the ACE-II receptor during infection of host tissues by SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed but exactly how this fits into initiation or progression of COVID-19 in smokers has not been demonstrated. Until then, clinical treatments for COVID-19 that target ACE-II are premature, except in those who require the medication for management of comorbidities. In conclusion, more extensive research is required to interrogate the potential role of tobacco smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the development of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as the validation of new therapeutic targets. This will require substantial ongoing investment in the global research capacity to obtain answers and solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Recent available data indicate that individuals with a smoking history are more likely to acquire more severe COVID-19 outcomes, including intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality, than non-smokers. Moreover, research findings also indicate that smokers exhibit increased expression ACE-II receptors, which acts as a binding site for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence, therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 / ACE-II interaction may offer a path for the","Australia","first author","2020-11-19","11"

Role of mitochondria, oxidative stress and the response to antioxidants in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: a possible approach to SARS-CoV-2 'long- haulers'?","A significant proportion of patients recovering from the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, termed 'long-haulers' or 'Long COVID', are reporting a broad range of persistent and debilitating symptoms centred around fatigue but also including symptoms such as 'brain fog', pain, breathlessness, and dysrhythmias, that have extended several months into the post infection period. 1, 2 These symptoms are a characteristic of an already well-documented, potentially devastating and largely unexplained post-viral illness, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This disease is already known to be associated with other viral infections such as Epstein Barr or glandular fever. 3 ME/CFS is a disease of unknown pathophysiology affecting 0.2-2% of the world's population. 4, 5 It is characterised by severe post-exertional fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and as well as pain, severe cognitive dysfunction, insomnia and/or lack of restful sleep, and sensitivity to light and sound, lasts for longer than six months. 6 There is now growing belief that, with millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, there will be a spike in ME/CFS, with some people's post viral fatigue developing into the a long term illness that is symptomatically the same as ME/CFS -the unknown question is how many will be affected?Knowing how many ME/CFS patients there are is difficult: withdrawal from society is common, 7 especially as one in four individuals can be bed-or house-bound lifelong, and many more whilst in the acute phase. 4, 5 Demographic data collection is also hampered because there is no simple diagnostic test for this disease, (twenty published, differing clinical definitions exist). 4 It is approximately two to six times more common in females than males, 8 and affects all ages, socio-economic groups, ethnic groups and geographical locations. 4 It is unknown, as yet, whether the 'long-haulers' from SARS-CoV-2 infections with ME/CFS like symptoms will share the same gender bias and other characteristics.Similar conditions to ME/CFS have been known for the last two centuries but not recognised as such. 9 In 2019, the Senate of the United States passed a resolution acknowledging that ME/CFS was a serious disease that affected many people and in great need of more research 10 . Spurred on by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, research into ME/CFS may see such a resurgence. This would be a cruel irony for long-term ME/CFS sufferers if their condition, which has taken so long to be acknowledged as a serious debilitating disease, now gets ready acceptance through COVID-19.The lack of a known aetiology or pathophysiology, the variability in the symptoms and the lack of outward physical signs of the illness have all contributed to the societal stigma of ME/CFS. 11 It has often been referred to as an 'invisible disease', [13] [14] [15] as people may appear outwardly healthy and well, but be severely ill. 11, 15 Previous classification of ME/CFS as a psychiatric disorder has hindered the care of sufferers of the disease and their interactions with their physicians and the public for many years. 15, 16 It is hoped the SARS-CoV-2 'longhaulers' will not have to undergo these experiences before their illness is properly acknowledged. A 2016 survey found that 60% of affected individuals were not diagnosed for at least one year and this delay can worsen the psychosocial impacts of the disease. 4 These diagnostic difficulties make it hard to know whether the syndrome is a single disease entity with a range of symptoms, rather like multiple sclerosis (MS), or rather several different diseases with very similar and overlapping symptomatology. For example, Booth et al 17 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f argues for two or more distinct pathophysiologies that are grouped together as ME/CFS. ME/CFS can have a number of initiating triggers, the most common being a viral infection.The focus of this review is the links between some of the dysfunctional pathways found in ME/CFS -specifically mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress -and the possible therapeutic effects of antioxidants levels upon these pathways. Simple remedies like antioxidants that are readily available and that can control oxidative stress might prove helpful to improve the lives of ME/CFS patients, as well as those suffering from post-viral illness as a result of SARS-CoV2 infections before other therapies become available.Mitochondria are organelles that are present in every cell of the body and produce 90-95% of the body's total energy. Mitochondrial respiration produces the energy-carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which drives all the necessary chemical reactions in the body. Cells only contain a small steady state concentration of ATP molecules in cells which needs to be constantly re-generated because of energy demands. This is done by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or by glycolysis. 18 Maximal mitochondrial respiration increases with stress, and there can be up to a 100-fold increase in ATP consumption during vigorous activity compared with sleep. Mitochondria are also involved in a wide range of other important cellular actions including redox signalling and cell danger responses. 19, 20 Dysfunction in any of these functions may possibly account for clinical symptoms in ME/CFS, 20 however, mitochondrial bioenergetics is the main area of focus of this review, because dysfunction in mitochondrial respiration and metabolic changes have been found in ME/CFS, 21-23 and these give a biologically plausible link to some of the symptoms seen in ME/CFS. 24 A recent review 25 has looked at mitochondrial changes in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls across 19 studies. They concluded that it was difficult to establish the role of mitochondria in the pathology of ME/CFS due to inconsistencies across the published studies. They argued for future studies to be well-designed, with patients diagnosed with the same ME/CFS clinical case definition and with analyses using the same methods. Despite this review, we argue that there is evidence of mitochondrial disturbances in ME/CFS and our review focuses on the potential of exploiting these for therapeutic approaches to alleviating both this complex disease and for SARS-CoV-2 chronically ill patients.The search for peer-reviewed articles was conducted using Medline and Google Scholar up to March 2020. The following search terms were used: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), MitoQ, bioenergetic health index (BHI), oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction. Variations of these terms were used to ensure all possible papers were found. Inclusion criteria included the English language.A growing body of literature has investigated mitochondrial bioenergetics in ME/CFS patients, and is reporting evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction 21,26,27 but with varying results. 25,28 Since mitochondria produce most of the body's energy, they could contribute to ME/CFS symptoms of muscle pain, weakness and cognitive decline. 29 Mitochondrial dysfunction found with classical mitochondrial disease caused by genetic mutations, share symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, cognitive decline and a waxing and waning pattern such as seen in ME/CFS. 29 A range of different markers has been used to measure mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS including the levels of certain mitochondrial proteins, 30 production of ATP 17,27,31 and more recently, oxygen consumption of live plated cells using a new technology with the Seahorse Analyzer. 21,22,32 The earliest evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS was structural changes seen in the skeletal muscle cell mitochondria. 33 This study observed branching and fusion of cristae within the mitochondria, and variable shape and size in these patients.Lawson et al 34 also found condensation of cristae, but no difference in the shape and size of the mitochondria in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Both studies concluded that the increased energy demand in ME/CFS caused this excess branching of cristae in mitochondria.Dysfunctional energy producing pathways have been shown in ME/CFS. 17 Tomas et al 21 found that OXPHOS in PBMCs of ME/CFS patients was significantly depressed when compared to controls, and Booth et al 17 found decreased ATP production by OXPHOS. Missailidis et al 22 determined that ATP synthesis, as a percentage of basal respiration, was decreased in ME/CFS compared to controls which suggested a defect in ATP synthase (complex V) in ME/CFS. They inferred this was causing compensatory increases in the rest of the electron transport chain (ETC) (Figure 1 ), as they found increased levels of other complexes: this suggested mitochondria were unable to increase energy from baseline when required. Two studies 21,35 found mitochondria had a lower reserve capacity for energy production in ME/CFS compared to healthy controls, and also suggested mitochondria in ME/CFS are unable to meet energy demands during exercise or acute stress, giving a potential reason for the severe post-exertional fatigue seen in patients.Lawson et al 34 and Tomas et al 32 found no differences in the levels of specific complexes I-IV of the ETC between ME/CFS and healthy controls, despite finding changes in OXPHOS as a whole in their previous paper. 21 They suggested that any dysfunction, therefore, was not due to these complexes but instead to an external stimuli or other cause such as oxidative damage.Oxidative damage may be a contributor to the dysfunction seen in mitochondrial pathways. 36 Castro-Marrero 37 reported higher lipid peroxidation as a cause of lowered ATP levels in ME/CFS compared to healthy controls. Morris Oxidative stress is a condition of increased amounts of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. It is an important pathological feature of many acute and chronic diseases as well as the normal aging process. Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants which causes an increase in free radicals. 37 Free radicals have an additional unpaired single electron, which is unstable and can cause damage to biological proteins and DNA. 39 Free radicals are also produced in normal physiological cell action and signalling. 40 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules which include free radicals and at least one oxygen atom, such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Antioxidants are scavengers that remove free radicals and are necessary to prevent cellular damage. 39 Mitochondria are a major producer of ROS in the cell, which makes them very susceptible to damage by oxidative stress. 40 In the mitochondrial ETC, electrons en route to oxygen may be diverted in the conversion of oxygen into superoxide. 41 In the mitochondria there are enzymes and coenzymes, such as vitamin E and CoQ10, that remove ROS to prevent damage. If there is damage or dysfunction in the ETC and/or in the ROS-removal system of mitochondria -for example with low levels of CoQ10 -ROS will increase causing further damage. 40Increased oxidative stress is important in causing and perpetuating a range of pathologies. 42 Jammes et al 43 showed increased markers of oxidative stress in 38 ME/CFS participants and also showed these individuals had greater oxidative stress after exercise. Richards et al 44 also found an association between increased levels of oxidative stress and ME/CFS symptoms in 33 patients. Castro-Marrero et al 37 found increased signs of oxidative damage and decreased antioxidants (CoQ10) in mitochondria from patients with ME/CFS. Miwa and Fujita 45 found levels of oxidative stress were increased in the relapse state of ME/CFS. Oxidative stress found in ME/CFS could be contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory pathways, and brain dysfunction. 36 Suitable biomarkers of oxidative modifications of disease are oxidation products that are stable, can be measured, and which correlate with disease severity so that they can be used as As more knowledge of the mitochondrial effects has been learnt, potential treatments are being targeted to improve mitochondrial health. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] Teitelbaum et al 50 has investigated the effect of D-ribose, the sugar moiety of ATP that stimulates energy production, on ME/CFS symptoms in an uncontrolled, open-label study. They found significant improvement in fatigue as measured by visual analogue scales. ME/CFS patients taking methylphenidate (Ritalin®) with vitamins and minerals which support mitochondrial function, reported some improvement in fatigue scores, although this was non-significant when compared to placebo. 51 In an uncontrolled, open-label study, 45% of participants had reduced fatigue when treated with sodium dichloroacetate, a pyruvate dehydrogenase/ glycolysis inhibitor 52 .These studies may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 recovering patientsCoQ10 (also called ubiquinone) is a potential treatment under investigation. It is an important antioxidant in the mitochondria. CoQ10 is the only lipid-soluble antioxidant that is endogenously synthesised in humans. 56 It consists of a quinone head which can complete reduction-oxidation reactions and a long polyisoprenoid lipid tail making it extremely hydrophobic; this allows it to move freely within the phospholipid bilayer. 56 Ubiquinol (reduced CoQ10) acts as an antioxidant by reducing ROS, or by regenerating other antioxidants such as vitamin E. 57 After neutralising an oxygen radical, enzymes in the ETC can recycle and reduce CoQ10 back to ubiquinol. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A significant proportion of CoQ10 (50%) is found in the mitochondrial membranes, 58 but it is also present in all membranes of the body and in the plasma where it is carried in the lipoproteins low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). 59 CoQ10 is found in the highest concentrations in highly metabolic tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle. 58 When a person is well, quantities of CoQ10 in tissues are thought to be sufficient due to the endogenous production. 69 Beal 70 suggested that the level of CoQ10 in membranes reaches a saturation level in young animals, so that supplementation with CoQ10 does not further increase brain tissue levels. CoQ10 levels did increase in the brain tissue of older individuals and it was suggested that supplements may be beneficial in humans with decreased synthesis such as the elderly or for those with primary CoQ10 deficiency or other diseases. 71 can occur in ME/CMS.There is reported evidence that CoQ10 levels are decreased in ME/CFS. 37 CoQ10 has been shown to restore respiration and act as an antioxidant. 79 Oral supplementation of CoQ10 has been researched in low-CoQ10 conditions including J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mitochondrial disease, 80 neurodegenerative diseases 81 and ME/CFS. 47 A systematic review 82 on sixteen studies of the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on fatigue for both healthy and cohorts with disorders, concluded that CoQ10 was better at decreasing fatigue in some disorders such as fibromyalgia and statin-related fatigue rather than ME/CFS.there was a non-significant trend for decreased perception of fatigue following exercise when CoQ10 was taken. They did find significant improvement in physical testing in CoQ10supplemented groups compared to control groups, and suggested it was due to its antioxidant or OXPHOS roles. However, Orlando et al 65 Bioavailability may account for this confusion (at least in part). CoQ10 has low bioavailability, due in part to its low water solubility and high molecular mass (M=863 g/mol), which may explain why supplement studies have not always been consistent in producing clinical effects. It is also better absorbed if taken with a fatty meal, like other lipidsoluble supplements such as vitamin E. 58 Langsjoen and Langsjoen 84 found that ubiquinol had a greater bioavailability than ubiquinone in healthy subjects. Vitetta et al 67 also showed a non-significant trend for greater plasma CoQ10 levels at 2 hours after ubiquinol capsule J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f supplementation compared to ubiquinone capsules in healthy individuals. Therefore, when assessing whether CoQ10 supplements might be beneficial for ME/CFS, the oxidative state of CoQ10 is important as well as the mode of administration.Another important aspect to consider is the uptake of CoQ10 by tissues from plasma supplementation. In many clinical trials the extent to which CoQ10 enters cells is unknown. It has been found in rodent models that CoQ10 supplementation can increase tissue levels in the liver and spleen, but much higher doses are needed to increase levels in brain and muscle tissue. 58 Niklowitz et al 85 found that supplementing with CoQ10 increased levels in white blood cells and platelets but not in red blood cells. This low uptake in highly metabolic tissues may be a limitation of CoQ10 supplementation, as these are the tissues most influenced by CoQ10 deficiency. 56 Knowing how the molecule distributes across body tissues may be critical for CoQ10 to be used as an effective treatment for ME/CFS.A CoQ10 analogue, mitoquinol mesylate (MitoQ ® 86 ), developed originally as a tool to target molecules to mitochondria, 87 is a powerful antioxidant and may be helpful in ME/CFS. 78, 87 It is now sold commercially as a supplement to improve health, energy levels and promote healthy aging. MitoQ is known 'to manipulate mitochondrial ubiquinone content in vitro. 87 It has better bioavailability than CoQ10 due to its higher water-solubility. MitoQ consists of a CoQ10 molecule covalently attached to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) cation.The positive charge allows MitoQ to accumulate in the negatively charged mitochondria 88 at a concentration 50-1000 times higher than CoQ10. 87 This higher accumulation in the mitochondria and higher bioavailability accounts for its much lower recommended daily supplemental dosage of 10 to 20 mg compared to 200 mg for CoQ10. Thus, MitoQ may be a better candidate for mitochondrial therapy compared to CoQ10, as it may overcome the bioavailability and pharmacodynamic challenges of CoQ10 described above.In the mitochondria, MitoQ is reduced by complex II of the ETC to form its reduced or ubiquinol state, becoming an antioxidant. 79, 87, 88 Unlike CoQ10, it cannot be easily reduced by complex I or oxidised by complex III because the TPP+ tail stops effective binding to these complexes. MitoQ does not restore respiration in the electron transport chain/ OXPHOS asCoQ10 does, and is therefore not consumed by this process, allowing higher concentrations of its reduced state to persist within the mitochondria. 89 Kelso et al 87 including a lack of ability to confirm the diagnosis, the usage of self-reported data and an inability to confirm compliance with the study. By contrast, another group of participants who took MitoQ without a matching placebo group, by purchasing the supplement themselves, found significant results and a reduction in clinical symptoms. So far, this online study is the only published study investigating MitoQ for ME/CFS.The Bioenergetic Health Index (BHI) is an emerging measure in biochemistry that has been referred to as the 'new BMI' by the American Physiological Society. 95 It is a representation of mitochondrial health derived from calculating the 'spare respiratory capacity' multiplied by the 'ATP production of mitochondria under stress', divided by the 'measured proton leak' multiplied by the 'non-mitochondrial respiration' (glycolysis). Chacko et al 96 discussed the use of BHI as a marker of disease progression in particular for areas such as cancer, cardiometabolic syndromes and neurodegenerative diseases, which are now being found to be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f affected by mitochondrial dysfunction. 97, 98 BHI is sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore may reflect changes in oxidative stress in these diseases. 96 BHI may help predict who is more susceptible to these diseases and who may benefit from emerging therapies targeting mitochondrial health. For example, post-cardiac surgery patients with the larger decreases in BHI values measured in leucocytes collected from their pericardial fluid were more likely to have cardiac complications (atrial fibrillation), than those with less significant changes in BHI values. [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] As mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage have been implicated in ME/CFS, 28,29 BHI could be a potential biomarker for revealing how well the mitochondria are functioning over time and whether mitochondrial therapies such as MitoQ could be useful in ME/CFS. Only three analyses of BHI with ME/CFS patients have been completed with contradictory results. 21, 22, 32 Key papers regarding mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress and supplementation trials with ME/CFS patients are summarised in Table 1 .The relatively high proportion of people chronically infected with SARS-CoV-2 ('the long haulers'), who do not make a straight-forward recovery in the post viral period of their illness, almost certainly reflects damage done by the host response to the initial infection. A severe body response such as a cytokine storm can give rise to oxidative and inflammatory damage and generalised oxidative stress, and this suggests that the antioxidant therapies discussed in this review might be beneficial. Antioxidant therapy is known to improve the levels of the abundant natural antioxidant, glutathione (which is important for redox balance), and to strengthen the immune response. 105 Physiological changes in SARS-CoV-2 that enhance the production of reactive oxygen species could be ameliorated by free radical scavengers. 106 Oxidative stress and ongoing pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 are almost certainly linked. 107 Research into mitochondrial function of ME/CFS has been increasing in recent years and appears to hold potential for better understanding this enigmatic disease that may be increasing its prevalence as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Novel strategies were required.During disasters or crises, a range of psychological symptoms may appear in health professionals. 4 Medical students may have a pre-existing vulnerability, with higher levels of psychological distress often reported during clinical practice years. 5 International students face additional challenges of living away from family members. Student welfare and well-being needed to be prioritised at this time. 6 The University of Queensland's psychiatric teaching staff aimed to provide not just a substitute for the usual course, but rather a comprehensive, enriched online course as well as a supportive and contained environment for the students. Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the students taught during COVID-19. The following is an outline of the modifications that were made to teach psychiatry remotely during the pandemic.Teaching medical students remotely during a pandemicwhat can psychiatry offer?The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Herston, QLD, Australia; and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, QLD, AustraliaExisting lectures and interactive online cases using Articulate 7 and Blackboard 8 were supplemented with recorded clinical interviewing techniques, mental state assessments and formulation presentations to replace face-to-face teaching. A modified curriculum was developed to take into account missed ward exposure. Multiple articles and resources were provided online, and to facilitate critical appraisal of the material, resources were linked to associated content with annotated notes or prompt sheets. 9 Students were able to access this material throughout their placement and semester.Videoconferencing using Zoom 10 provided group learning and discussion. Students were placed in small groups (maximum of eight) to encourage greater dialogue. Teaching staff expected the small groups to demonstrate a high level of engagement, as had previously been found when teaching small groups face to face. However, the group dynamics in online sessions were different -students needed more encouragement, and sessions were draining for the moderators, perhaps because of the communication barriers associated with the technology. 11 The usual written and viva psychiatry examinations were adapted to an online platform using simulated patients and software with invigilation. 12 The viva component was replaced with a brief observed interview with a simulated patient via Zoom videoconferencing. It was not feasible to offer real patients for the viva given the student numbers. The written examinations consisted of (a) a 60-item multiple-choice questionnaire, and (b) a long answer case requiring a formulation and management plan of a hypothetical patient. Challenges with these examinations included difficulties with the internet and technology, and privacy concerns as invigilators could see into students' homes. Pleasingly, performance on end-of-semester written examinations was found to be comparable to previous placements.Suspended hospital placements meant there was a loss of the usual structure and daily routine. Additional sessions were provided which included a weekly wrap-up online to consolidate learning. A structured daily timetable assisted with time management, with time allotments for each task and links to associated resources. No tasks were assigned to afterhours or weekends promoting a clear demarcation of working hours. Senior staff prioritised self-care during online teaching sessions.Access to patients via teleconferencing was not feasible due to the lack of videoconferencing facilities on the ward and the pressures on the ward clinicians during the pandemic. In the absence of ward exposure, a rapid substitute for teaching psychiatric interviewing skills was required. Videos of clinicians conducting patient interviews were uploaded to Blackboard. The use of simulated patients in medicine has become widespread as it allows students to practice skills in a low-risk environment without the fear of distressing the patient. 13 Clinicians engaged in role-play with students to simulate patient interviewing. Immediate feedback was given, and students could attempt the interview several times to shape their skills. However, on review, it was felt this was an insufficient substitute and instead we chose to employ a trained simulated patient. A detailed script was developed to ensure consistency, and the sessions were moderated by a senior psychiatrist.As traditional pastoral care was not possible during COVID-19, alternatives were required to assist students facing social isolation. 14 Techniques that can reduce psychological distress during disasters, such as limiting exposure to media, sleep hygiene, exercise and nutrition, and the resumption of normal routines and roles, were incorporated into online discussions. 15 Resources about self-care were provided to promote well-being and improve adaptation to adversity. A closed social media group was set up to provide dynamic, synchronous communication. 16 This replaced the pre-COVID-19 drop-in style sessions where students could ask questions, clarify concerns, query timetable changes or make comments. Staff provided information and posted links to both clinical and well-being resources. The group was monitored to ensure appropriate interactions.Students were provided with access to reduced cost psychiatric care and pathways to access mental health services. Note. *FTE = full-time equivalents.Staff were able to provide remedial tutorials and referral to appropriate agencies if required.Careful attention was given to the tone of online interactions, with the aim of promoting collegiality and modelling authentic engagement. Borrowing from the work of Bion, clinicians focussed on providing containment in teaching sessions and allowing for the identification and processing of projected feelings from the students. 17 These feelings could then be returned to students in a modified way that could be reintegrated. Sessions were deliberately less formal. Distress and uncertainty were acknowledged, expressed and validated by using praise, guiding self-care and emotional mirroring and validation (see Table 2 ). Students responded positively to the social media group in feedback given at the end of placement evaluations.An integral part of teaching psychiatry is addressing and reducing stigma. Relevant TED talks and documentaries were provided to encourage discussion and provide exposure to those with lived experience with mental illness.Videoconferencing allowed increased opportunities to provide additional sub-specialty teaching with expert staff in forensics and eating disorders. Numbers were capped at eight students to promote discussion, and these sessions proved to be one of the most popular changes to the course. High achieving students were catered for with the provision of additional resources that were not required reading but that offered an extension of knowledge.What challenges were identified in the move to online teaching?The move to a fully online psychiatry course until restrictions lifted was not without difficulties. When restrictions eased, face-to-face teaching and ward exposure resumed in a limited form in line with hospital requirements. Students remained able to access the online resources. A short supplementary placement (5 weeks) was arranged at the end of the year for students affected by the lack of patient contact. The placement focused on improving interviewing skills. Modifying the course to an online platform took considerable effort, especially with the development of new content, timetables and linked resources. The move to multiple small group sessions was time intensive. Clinicians were not exempt from emotional strain during the pandemic. Weekly teleconferenced debriefings were instituted to prevent staff burnout. Teaching staff relied on the advice and encouragement from the course coordinator who was readily available for advice and support. Novel teaching approaches such as the use of social media were welcomed. Teaching and administrative staff learnt to use new technology in the absence of infrastructure support. Internet and bandwidth issues were common. The costs of technology were significant for licenced software. See Table 3 .As the world comes to terms with COVID-19, it seems clear that remote teaching will continue to play a significant role in medical education and innovative ways to provide surrogates for clinical contact will need to be found. Attention to student welfare and containment of psychological distress will continue to be an important role for educators. Remote learning is improving rapidly; however, it is unclear how it compares to direct ward teaching for specialties such as psychiatry. In particular, interviewing skills are more difficult to teach without face-to-face patient contact. Alternative methods to teach medicine will need to be explored, such as using social media to maintain connectivity and virtual ward rounds.Delivering a fully online course was costly, time intensive and did not translate well to large class sizes. The loss of social interaction for students may have longer term impacts, necessitating ongoing adaptation and consideration of how best to encourage social cohesion and support networks in novel learning environments. Psychiatrists are in a unique position as medical specialists with a deep understanding of the human condition and specialised knowledge of the ways in which people respond to and adapt to stressful environments. Utilisation of such knowledge can optimise the way we teach our future health professionals as we adapt to these challenging times. ","Australia","first author","2020-11-24","11"

Rickets remains a significant and preventable cause of global morbidity and, sadly, even mortality. The most common form, nutritional rickets, is still widespread, and there are vast numbers of ongoing cases across the world (1) . While our understanding of rickets has advanced significantly in terms of underlying causes, pathophysiology and treatment, translating this knowledge into practical community health programs to work towards the elimination of nutritional rickets remain underdeveloped and ineffective. While far less common, inherited causes of rickets, relating to dysregulation of phosphate and/or calcium metabolism, are often missed, leading to inappropriate therapies and poorer clinical outcomes (2) .The contributors to this Research Topic have demonstrated varied approaches to considering the issue of rickets. Hochberg and Hochberg took an evolutionary approach, reflecting on the strongly conserved nature of the vitamin D receptor gene from phytoplankton to mammals, the changes in skin pigmentation with historical migration, and the natural selection disadvantages in those with severe Vitamin D deficiency, both for childhood rickets sufferers (with marked disability and reduced survival) and in pregnancy. Lessons for today's society conclude their thought provoking article, including the role that technology and modern lifestyles play in reducing our sunlight exposure and thus exposing us to greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency. This article was penned before COVID-19, but given the number of countries across the globe that have used lockdowns and prolonged periods of home isolation to help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, it is even more apt to now consider how important adequate supplementation is for prevention, and how lifestyle factors play a vital part of in our risk of developing Vitamin D deficiency.Wheeler et al. also chose to focus on the historical perspective of rickets, and how despite centuries of knowledge, nutritional rickets continues to be seen in the 21 st century. While rickets was first described as a clinical entity in the 17 th century, there are references to rickets in medical writings from Ancient Greek and Roman times, and skeletal changes consistent with rickets seen in skeletons from preindustrial Europe. It is the spike in rickets seen with industrialization that provides the greatest lessons for us today, with overcrowding, increased time indoors, poor air quality and reduced calcium intake likely contributing greatly to the increase in presentations at that time. With the discovery of Vitamin D and the effectiveness of cod liver oil in the early 20 th century, we now had a means of treating nutritional rickets.Wheeler et al. conclude by drawing parallels between eras, with many of the conditions that drove rickets in previous centuries echoed in today's society, such as: reduced exposure to sunlight, the end result of increased time spent indoors; protection from the sun due to valid concerns about the risk of skin cancers; and increased migration of those with deeper skin pigmentation to subtropical and temperate climes. As with the Hochberg's article, by exploring the mirroring of today's risk factors with those from the past, hopefully it will encourage us as clinicians to drive public health campaigns to counteract modern changes in lifestyle with increased fortification of foodstuffs with Vitamin D, and ensuring adequate supplementation in high risk groups, particularly at times of high demand for Vitamin D such as pregnancy and infancy (especially for those that are breast fed).By contrast, Michigami and Ozono explored the fundamental molecule implicated in rickets by examining the roles of phosphate in the skeleton. They discussed the number of different ways that hypophosphatemia may be involved in the pathophysiology of rickets. Most directly, phosphate is required for the formation of hydroxyapatite, the basis of mineralization. However, phosphate is also required for apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, and without this there is disorganization of the process of endochondral ossification, and therefore development of rickets. Finally, the role of phosphate in regulation of gene expression was discussed, including the intriguing finding that phosphate has a role in promoting FGFR transcription, which in turn leads to increased production of FGF23. Therefore, it may be that, in some forms of hypophosphatemic rickets, impaired phosphate sensing may be driving the clinical phenotype.Finally in this series, Nicolescu et al. provided some clinical perspective, highlighting that even with rare forms of rickets, novel therapeutics are increasingly available to help ameliorate the biochemical, and hopefully in future, the clinical features of these conditions. They describe a case of Vitamin D resistant rickets with a heterozygous mutation in the VDR gene, and outline the treatment challenges with conventional therapy of high dose calcium and calcitriol replacement. They also note previous case reports where the use of cinacalcet, a calcimimetic, has been successful, as the skeletal changes are driven at least in part by the secondary hyperparathyroidism that results from reduced gut absorption and subsequent low serum calcium. They chose a strategy of intravenous calcium absorption, and then added cinacalcet once the calcium levels had stabilized. This led to a normalization of PTH, calcium, phosphate and ALP levels, with improved clinical state (able to ambulate) and resolution of rachitic features on Xray. Clearly there is a need for more systematic study of this approach, which given the rare nature of this condition will require the collaboration of many specialist Paediatric bone centres. This approach will also allow exploration of concerns over the use of cincalcet on the QT interval. In general, for rare bone disorders, it is only by undertaking multicentre studies that we will be able to properly evaluate novel management strategies and assess both their efficacy and safety.Overall, our topic demonstrates that rickets remains an active, if not growing, area of clinical need. Promotion of public health strategies for prevention of nutritional rickets remains essential, and learning from the lessons of the past will help us improve the future for many children across the globe. Improved molecular understanding of the role of crucial molecules like phosphate will hopefully led to novel therapeutic approaches, such as we have seen with the recent development of monoclonal antibody therapy for X-Linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). Finally, only by collaborating across sites and countries can we explore the outcomes of novel therapeutics in rare hereditary forms of rickets. Hopefully this Research Topic will stimulate us all, as clinicians and/or researchers, to continue to strive to eliminate nutritional rickets and improve outcomes in hereditary rickets, for the benefit of millions of young people around the world.","Australia","first author","2020-11-23","11"

It draws on a unique qualitative interview dataset that was collected from New Zealand religious leaders, as the country rushed into a COVID-19 related National State of Emergency and lockdown. As such, it draws an emerging and diverse picture of how New Zealand religious leader's understanding of COVID-19 evolved as the lockdown response impacted their communities and worship practices. Our data suggest four central challenges emerged for these religious Together, the nascent global literature suggests that until the virus is better understood, mitigated new forms of religious practice and communal gathering need to be developed. We find that the extant literature suggests four primary social challenges for religious communities posed by the risk of COVID-19 infection.1. The requirement to reassess worship practices. 2. The need to mitigate any potential for community transmission. 3. Significant difficulties related to social distancing for communal religious practices. 4. Welfare and pastoral concerns for congregations and others in need.Our research sets out to understand how these four challenges played out for New Zealand religious groups as they were placed into COVID-19 lockdown and to assess whether there were any additional challenges experienced by these communities.New Zealand is a small island nation with a population of five million people. Since the 1960s, there has been a steady decline in the number of New Zealanders who identify as Christian, dropping from 95% of the population in 1956 to 38% in 2018 (Stats NZ 2019) . In general, the religious affiliations of the population are no longer Christian per se, rather they should be understood as religiously diverse (Hoverd 2019) . Non-Christian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Sikhism have increased in number, leading to such initiatives as the New Zealand Human Rights Commission's Statement on Religious Diversity in 2007, and the launch of a Religious Diversity Centre in 2016. It has been observed that New Zealand has evolved into a very secular society (Pratt 2016; Troughton 2016; Ward 2013 ). Troughton argues ""…if the numbers are to be believed, New Zealanders have in recent decades become a pretty godless lot (Troughton 2016, p 11) ."" Census figures from 2018, bear out Troughton's statement with 48% of the population indicating they have no religion (Stats NZ 2019) . However, many who identify as having 'no religion' are not necessarily atheists. Findings from the International Social Survey Programme have indicated that individualized spiritual experiences are more important than belonging to a formal religious institution (Vaccarino et al. 2011 ). These findings are backed up by an Australian study which found many youths identified as 'spiritual but not religious,' a category obscured by census data (Halafoff et al. 2020) . Given these demographic shifts, studies need to include a diverse range of religious groups and include non-religious perspectives.To date, there has been little systematic investigation into the potential relationships between religion and health in New Zealand. Nevertheless, amongst the nation's doctors, there has been a strong historic tradition of Christian belief (Franklin 2018; Irvine 2015) and an increasing religious diversity (Henning et al. 2015) . There is a rigourous understanding of the contemporary issues facing chaplaincy (Carey et al. , 2014 Carey and Cohen 2015; Carey 2012) , which in contexts such as the New Zealand Defence Force (Hill et al. 2016) needs to carefully craft pastoral care for a spiritually diverse constituency. Studies of the relationships between religion and health in New Zealand have found weak correlations between religion, spirituality, and well-being (Zhang 2020; Hoverd and Sibley 2013) . This extends to the relationship between religious belief and coping (Zhang and Zhang 2017; Krägeloh et al. 2012) . However, others have struggled to discern meaningful findings between secular and spiritual approaches to health in New Zealand (Lauricella 2016) . Our qualitative data add to this literature by reporting on how New Zealand religious communities responded to the COVID-19 transmission threat during the move into lockdown.In New Zealand, the response to COVID-19 has involved a lockdown, restrictions on mass gatherings, and the ongoing requirement for social distancing in combination with the implementation of strict border controls ). Preliminary national studies of how the population have responded to COVID-19 suggest a high trust in government, but potentially higher rates of mental distress (Sibley et al. 2020 ). On January 28th, 2020, the Government set up the National Health Coordination Centre as a preemptive response to monitor the global transmission of the COVID-19 virus (MoH 2020a). On February 28th, the first New Zealand case was confirmed (id., 2020b). On March 21st, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a new Pandemic Alert Level System. The New Zealand Government Alert Levels are:Level 1: Prepare-The disease is contained in New Zealand. Level 2: Reduce-The disease is contained but risk of community transmission remains. Level 3: Restrict-High risk the disease is not contained. Level 4: Lockdown-Likely that the disease is not contained (NZ Government 2020).On March 21st, Ardern explained that the country was then at Level 2-Reduce. This meant that the disease was currently contained, but the risk of an outbreak, and community transmission was a threat (Cheng 2020a ). On March 23rd, the number of cases rose to N = 102 and it was declared that there was suspected community spread and the national alarm level was raised to Level 3-Restrict (Otago Daily News 2020).On March 25th, Level 4-Lockdown was implemented with the infected numbering N = 205 (NZ Herald 2020a; Cheng 2020b). Ten days later, on April 5th, the total population infections numbered N = 1039. Virus prevalence data were released by ethnic group: Pākehā (Europeans) = 74%, Asian = 8.3%, Māori = 7.6%, and Pasifika = 3.3%, with 6.8% unreported (Andelane 2020b ). On April 20th, infections numbered N = 1440, and the Level 4-Lockdown was extended until 11:59 PM, April 27th, 2020. The transmission rate was now 0.48, in that on average one infected person would infect 0.48 other persons, thus indicating that the virus transmission was declining (Roy 2020) . On the April 27th, the alert level was reduced from Level 4-Lockdown to Level 3-Restrict, because transmissions were slowing with N = 1469 (MoH 2020c). On May 14th, Level 2-Reduce was declared, N = 1497 (Cooke 2020; MoH 2020d). All data for this research were collected between March 1st and April 27th, 2020. This manuscript was prepared between May 19th and 30th, 2020, during Alert Level 2-Reduce.This research combines interview data collected as New Zealand moved into Level 3 and then Level 4-Lockdown with two forms of media analysis (Facebook and online news media) to understand how religious leaders and their communities responded to COVID-19 restrictions.Initially, the interviews did not set out to study how religious leaders responded to COVID-19. When they were first designed, the focus was a comparison between the cities of Wellington and Christchurch investigating how the State engages with religious communities, in terms of responding to the Christchurch Mosque attack and the removal of the words 'Jesus Christ' from the parliamentary prayer. However, the participant selection and the interview process coincided with, and was directly affected by, the rapid entry into the COVID-19 Level 3 restrictions and then the Level 4 lockdown. Directly, after our first interview, it was apparent that COVID-19 was the primary community concern and fell under the broader research question of the relationship between religious communities and the State. Consequently, after Interviewee 1, we explicitly included a two-part question to address how religious communities were responding to COVID-19. Interviewee 1 did discuss COVID-19 and those general responses were included in the dataset (Table 1) .Interview participants were initially selected by employing census data to identify the largest religious groupings (Stats NZ 2018; Hoverd and Kühle 2018) . Utilizing a comprehensive search of digital media, we contacted 34 religious communities across these two cities to participate in our interviews. These communities included Anglicans, Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodists, Pentecostal, Latter Day Saints, Buddhists, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Humanists. There were University ethical restrictions 1 regarding conducting interviews with the Muslim community because of March 2019, Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre attacks where 51 people were killed (Hoverd 2019) . Therefore, Muslim communities were not contacted.All communities were initially contacted by email, on March 10th, with a request to participate in an interview. Follow-up emails, and later phone calls, were sent to those who did not respond. At this stage, March 17th, we encountered challenges in accessing participants due to the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 concerns and pressure on religious organizations to cease communal worship. Consequently, the communities were working from home, and their offices could not receive our emails or pick up our phone calls. Sixteen communities did not respond, six were not interested in participation, and 12 communities agreed to participate.Just prior to and throughout the Level 4 lockdown, 12 interviews were conducted (Anglican = 2, Catholic = 2, Pentecostal = 2, Latter Day Saints = 1, Buddhist = 1, Jewish = 1, Sikh = 1, and Humanists = 2). Four face-to-face interviews were conducted before Level 4, the last eight were conducted via Zoom during the lockdown. Given the unprecedented disruption for both the communities and researchers of moving suddenly into Level 3 and then Level 4, between March 19th and March 29th, no interviews were conducted.Initially, we employed 19 semi-structured questions. These questions were in five parts, divided by theme. These were; 'Background' (3 items), 'Change of the Parliamentary Prayer' (4 items), 'Social Media/Online Extremism' (3 items), 'Christchurch Attack' (5 items), 'Questions about the New Zealand State and Government' (3 items), and then asking if the respondent wanted an interview transcript. Once it was recognized that the rise in COVID-19 was the primary concern of our interviewees, we added an additional question; ""Concerning COVID-19, what has your community been talking about? And what have you been doing?"" At the beginning of the interview, all participants were advised that an additional question regarding All the interviews were recorded either by voice recorder (in person) or via Zoom recording (virtual). Prior to the lockdown, we obtained written consent (in person), and during Level 4, consent was given and recorded verbally (via Zoom). Our informants remain anonymous, but some risk of identification remains because we interviewed religious leaders in a relatively small nation. The interviews were doubly transcribed, meaning one person did the initial transcription and another went through afterwards for accuracy.Additionally, we reviewed the public Facebook pages of the twelve communities we interviewed to create a supplementary dataset. We noted and recorded any Facebook posts relating to the community's experience of and response to COVID-19. We reviewed content posted between March 1st and April 27th, 2020. All relevant posts were copied and a hyperlink to them was referenced for subsequent analysis. In total, we found 151 Facebook posts made by our interview groups; Anglican = 22, Catholic = 33, Pentecostals = 12, Latter Day Saints = 14, Buddhist = 2, Jewish = none, Sikh = 13, and Humanists = 55.To contextualize the interview and the Facebook data, we also collated an online news media review of 31 media articles relating to religious groups and COVID-19 published during this time. This was used to create a national overview of how other religious groups outside our dataset responded to the lockdown. The collection took place from March 1st to April 27th, 2020.From our review of the current literature, we derived four social challenges for religious communities posed by the risk of COVID-19 infection. (1) The requirement to reassess worship practices, (2) the need to mitigate any potential for community transmission, (3) difficulties related to social distancing for communal religious practices, and (4) welfare and pastoral concerns for congregations and others in need. We now discuss these in detail:The Requirement to Reassess Worship Practices Here, we outline where certain New Zealand religious leaders and communities discussed the reassessment of worship practices. This is important because there was a religious community link with one of the first New Zealand cases when it was reported on March 17th that ""The sixth coronavirus case in New Zealand shared communion with several others at Mass, days [March 8th] before he tested positive (Block 2020) ."" Further discussion of this early incident showed that at that stage, worship practices had changed within that Church.Hand sanitizer was in use during the service and the people would not have sipped from the same location on the rim of the chalice, Fr Murphy said. ""We always turn the cup so you're not drinking from the same place (Block 2020) .Hand sanitizer was made available and communion chalices were objects of concern, but droplet transmission worries from communal singing were never reported. More broadly, after this case, it was evident in New Zealand that religious worship practices were a potential locus for virus transmission and that change would be required.Once lockdown occurred, many leaders found that Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype offered a new alternative for their communities to virtually undertake religious worship together (Towle 2020; Fountain and Troughton 2020; NZ Catholic Bishops 2020). How to stay connected and maintain relationships (both with the divine and within communities) without being physically together was a critical question for several religious communities. One group arranged for 'bubble' churches, in which every family participated in the meetings from home via Zoom. For one interviewee, it was an immediate priority to get every locked-down family a Zoom account (Interviewee 10).Easter fell between our first and last interview and had to be celebrated at home without communion (Tan 2020) . Lyndsay Freer of the Catholic Diocese of Auckland explained;Because our churches are in lockdown, we are attempting to provide recorded daily Masses to our Catholic people via our diocesan website and the Bishop's Facebook…we are negotiating to have some television time during this period, and are very grateful that this is likely to be a possibility (ibid., 2020).On Easter Sunday, April 12th, the national news site The Herald Online posted an article discussing the meaning of Easter and linked to over 30 different online sermons (NZ Herald 2020b). Darren Gammie, National Secretary of the Assemblies of God, called their Easter service the ""Bubble Church"" and stated; ""This year most churches would be hosting online prayer meetings, sharing encouragement and devotions and live streaming services through their websites and social media throughout Easter weekend."" (Foon 2020) . For Easter, one of our interviewees uploaded to YouTube a video about the importance of partaking in the blood of Jesus Christ as the ultimate healing and absolving element in the universe (Jesus for NZ 2020). Another uploaded Easter video focused on love as a binding solution for the spirit and for addressing concerns around COVID-19 (1 News 2020). Of the Facebook posts made, eleven of the 151 related to this theme of reassessing worship practices in the light of COVID-19 lockdown. While some communities found the transition to virtual worship relatively seamless, others found aspects of virtual worship problematic. However, the virtual practice of the sacrament of shared communion was particularly troubling for one community, because the medium did not allow for communal sharing.We can't do communion virtually, it is a physical, real thing. It is not an experience that you can replicate online, so we have had to work out other ways of doing that, so all of our services are now online… Instead communion is a prayer that we are saying together, where we say that we long for communion, but we know that we can't at the moment. So, that has made us look at what our faith is quite differently. So, we have really had to think, and go deeper into other parts of our tradition to find that. (Interviewee 12) The leader went on to explain how they experienced the 'feeling' of conducting the sacrament all alone when they streamed the services:Okay, I will stream the Masses every day, and I did a few of them, and I was on my own of course, and there are major rules about that in our Church, you are not allowed to do it on your own, that is a rule. Now, my Bishop had said; '…you can do it, fine, you are not going to get in trouble even if it is breaking a rule'. But I noticed, day after day of doing it, it started to feel really wrong, it felt wrong not just because I was breaking the rules, because I've always thought those rules were stupid. It felt wrong that here I am, having communion, and my people however many were watching, were just watching me have communion, I mean, this is daft right? (Interviewee 12)In this example, we can see that hierarchical permission was given to change the Church rules around communion practice as their worship moved online. However, this leader reflected both upon the bending of the Church rule (where the rule once overturned was viewed as 'stupid') and then despite this permission, the leader found that the new practice it allowed (virtual communion) created too much spiritual distance between him and his virtual community, consequently diminishing the practice.Not all leaders were willing to change their worship practices. One leader (before entering Level 4) resisted the threat posed by COVID-19, and at that time refused to change.We are not doing anything in particular, because I believe that this thing will go as quickly as it started. If you look at it, to me, it is fear driven. A lot of stuff is fear driven, and that is spiritual, right? Because my Bible tells me, we have not been given a spirit of fear as a Christian. Fear breeds control. And so, you have all these regulations and rules coming in immediately, to contain something that is not even going to happen, probably. (Interviewee 4)This leader was sceptical about the virus threat and discounted its relevance for his community. He argued that to change his Church and community's worship, practice was unnecessary. Ultimately, for this leader, one could find appropriate strength, focus, and resilience within their biblical tradition and thus temporal and/ or Government concerns about COVID-19 simply were a distraction.As noted earlier, from March 17th, evidence that a coronavirus patient had shared communion whilst likely infectious (Block 2020) indicated that religious communities needed to mitigate any potential transmission. Despite one interviewee's scepticism about the transmission threat of COVID-19, across our participants, we found a general desire for identifying people at risk, whether it was the elderly, already sick, or people with immune deficiencies. In our first interviews, several leaders prioritized identifying vulnerable community members in advance of any increased virus transmission (Interviewee 3). Although, with large congregations, one leader noted that identification can be difficult when not every member is known by name or contact information (ibid.)Given international publicity about churches being potential loci for community transmission overseas, some churches decided to stop handing out flyers and written material, because it was suggested that the virus can survive on paper for at least 24 hours (van Doremalen 2020). For example, one leader related a discussion that they had with their Bishop about mitigating community transmission:The first line that came out from the bishop and his responses was we as a church want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem… so there was a real desire to be quite strict in order to be safe and protect life. (Interviewee 5) Many leaders were cognizant that their worship practices might create risks for community transmission. One leader described how the community delivery of dinners for the elderly had to be cancelled before entering lockdown (Interviewee 3). Before Level 4, religious leaders were cancelling services due to the fear of community spread, with their concern mainly focused on vulnerable people and/or the elderly. For example: Sunday the 22nd [March] we were going to be worshipping, but then found out that on Saturday the 21st those who are 70 or older shouldn't be at worship and those who do come along should be two meters apart, we could have done that, but we decided to not worship that day because we thought there was a concern that some older folk or some compromised people might come along anyway thinking that it is actually not a big worry. (Interviewee 5) This type of concern for community transmission, particularly to the elderly and vulnerable, also led to the cancellation of events. Our Buddhist community had to cancel a major celebration. They were expecting a high-level delegation from Japan to come with various events planned, but the visit was cancelled due to the outbreak in Japan (Interviewee 6). The traditional Maori Catholic Easter celebration Hui Aranga (Murray 2020) had to be cancelled as well due to COVID-19 lockdown. It was expected to have 1500 participants, and one interviewee stated that the cancellation required that the community refocus on the meaning of the festival, instead of just the social gathering aspect: ""I think the community itself is shifting towards protection of kaumātua [elders] so that's a really good thing"" (Interviewee 3). All in all, the cancellation of events, whilst regrettable were framed by interviewees as being 'the best' thing for the community.With the commencement of Level 4-Lockdown, all religious organizations closed. Several groups had closed earlier, e.g. the Church of Latter-Day Saints had suspended their Sunday gatherings across the world on March 13th (Perich 2020) . Nine out of 12 communities made a Facebook post confirming and explaining the closure following the news on March 20th. Furthermore, all communities, except the Jewish community (who did not comment), stated on Facebook that they cancelled an event. Thirty-five of the 151 Facebook posts discussed cancelled events whether they were regular services, major events, or engaging with international guests. Only one example in the data was found where a religious individual engaged in faithrelated behaviour that intentionally flouted the Level 4 rules, when on April 10th, a woman from a Baptist Church violated lockdown rules by proselytizing door-todoor resulting in the Police being called (Mather 2020) .Difficulties Related to Social Distancing for Communal Religious Practices As we saw above, a great deal of social media attention was given to the cancellation of events. Twenty-two of the 151 posts are related to how to have communal religious practices with social distancing. Ultimately, the cancellations of religious practice and the subsequent shift to virtual community meant that social distancing was less important for participants. Social distancing was a nonissue during the State ordered Level-4 lockdown. Most communal religious practices moved to a virtual forum, either via Zoom or YouTube. For example, in the media analysis, Equippers Church Auckland suggested on March 19th that services should be streamed. ""Executive Pastor Matt Gregory said given the congregation sizes they could still meet but they've chosen to be proactive"" (Fusitu'a 2020).Prior to Level 4, one interviewee from a large group noted that in a nation where earthquakes are a present danger, they already had an established and adaptable emergency response plan (Interviewee 2). However, that plan involved creating communal hubs and centralized service distribution and with COVID-19, the need for social distance and the risk of transmission invalidated this entire approach (ibid.).One New Zealand religious community was publicly resistant to closing or complying with government COVID-19 guidance. Destiny Church Leader Bishop Brian Tamaki was quoted as saying: ""I'm not about to let a filthy virus scare us out of having church. To equate fear with common sense is nonsense"" (Andelane 2020a) . It was reported that Destiny intended to keep their churches open for as long as possible, though with added precautionary measures (Tokalau 2020) . Once Level 4 was announced, Destiny Church did close its doors.How to effectively continue to maintain welfare services and pastoral care for those in need was a major challenge for our interviewees. Religious communities running local food banks, such as St Vincent de Paul, had to change their way of both receiving and distributing food before moving into Level 4 (where activity ceased). Many volunteers were over 70 years of age and thus at high risk of contracting COVID-19.How does St. Vincent de Paul, which is one of the main charitable groups here, have food to be able to support people? How do they shift from, 'you can come down to our food bank and pick it up', to where we try and get it from their place to somebody's door?…St Vincent de Paul, most of their volunteers are over the age of 70 so they won't be the people that we send, so we need to find another group of people to do that. (Interviewee 3) For the foodbank, they were normally reliant on people dropping donations of food to them, now they needed to ask their 'younger' volunteers to do both the pickup of food from suppliers and then deliver it to those in need (ibid.) Under Level 4, pastoral concerns arose around maintaining their community's well-being through virtual methods. One leader explained that Zoom offered the following pastoral function:The big issue, I think, has been about how we continue to be caring to our community. So, we are not only socializing, and using social networks as best as we can. But we also have programs that we put into place to keep our people well connected. For example, we have Zoom home groups, small groups, so everyone in our congregation, our community, is being regularly connected visually or by phone or whatever. (Interviewee 7)The key challenge here was how to continue providing pastoral 'care' and keep virtually 'connected.' Moreover, with the forced switch to virtual platforms, leaders were worried about losing contact with elderly congregation members, many of whom did not have internet access (Interviewee 5).Another community noted that their fasting practices allowed them spiritual reflection and the opportunity to donate the cost of those meals to those struggling to find food during lockdown. For example:We believe in fasting and that is where we go without meals and we donate a cost of, well we hope it is more generous than the cost of those meals, but we donate that to the welfare. Not just for our members, but people who aren't members of our church. And there is a spiritual aspect to fasting where we also fast to be relieved from reflection, such as COVID-19 and things, so we are definitely fasting on that front but also the welfare front is important. (Interviewee 10)Here, fasting allowed the individual to reflect and meditate upon temporal matters (often COVID-19 related) as well as spiritual concerns. Overall, our Facebook data indicated that twenty-eight of the 151 posts were related to some form of volunteering or assisting with welfare organizations. Notably, the humanists produced twelve posts and were promoting a diverse range of causes including international humanist organizations in countries badly hit by the virus and the need for domestic assistance for groups such as immigrants who could not access State supplied welfare.New Zealand's sixth coronavirus patient had shared a communion cup while likely infectious on March 17th, 2020 (Block 2020) . From this date onwards, the risks associated with COVID-19 community transmission were a salient issue for religious communities. Overall, New Zealand religious communities stood united and in agreement with the State response to COVID-19. In our pre-Level 4 interview data, there was clear evidence that religious communities did not expect to enter a lockdown, but that they did expect to have to mitigate significant transmission risks, particularly for their elderly and vulnerable populations. Moreover, our data suggest prior to lockdown, groups were unsure about how to effectively social distance in order to continue to maintain pastoral contact with the elderly and safely supply welfare to those in need. When the Level-4 lockdown occurred, all groups shut down and restricted their services in compliance with the Ministry of Health guidelines (Stewart 2020) . Our data evidence sustained religious innovation in terms of virtual worship. There was a clear shift to social media communications and the continuation of worship practices online, albeit reassessed. These findings are broadly in line with our review of the current (albeit nascent) global literature on religious communities and COVID-19. This literature indicated that there were four primary social challenges for religious communities posed by the risk of COVID-19 infection. They are:1) The requirement to reassess worship practices, 2) the need to mitigate any potential for community transmission, 3) difficulties related to social distancing for communal religious practices, 4) Welfare and pastoral concerns for congregations and others in need.Our interview data suggest that community welfare and pastoral concerns were front and centre in our leader's minds, particularly in terms of the elderly and vulnerable. This concern was echoed in the Facebook analysis, but not evident in the Online News media data. This is unsurprising considering that we focused on how religious leaders understand their communities (interview and Facebook data) and then contextualized these concerns with a broader online news review which tended to focus on stories that would generate wide readership.Our data suggest that the four COVID-19 social challenges for religious communities should not always be understood as distinct, separate categories. There is significant overlap between them. For example: concerns over the spiritual purpose of fasting were reassessed and consequently, the meal money saved was directed into donations for those most in need under lockdown. This example encompasses both the reassessment of religious practice with welfare and pastoral concerns for the broader community. Likewise, concern around infection of primarily elderly volunteers impeded the ability of some welfare groups to distribute food. Additionally, in our communion example despite sanctioned moves that reassessed virtual religious practice, it was not always deemed pastorally to be in the best interests of the community's spiritual needs. The four categories list distinct issues for religious communities, but ultimately, COVID-19 concerns around transmission, pastoral care, changed worship, and social distancing are all interrelated.In our data, social distancing was less of a discussion than it will be in other studies, this is because most of our interviewee's communities were closing or already under lockdown during the interviews. However, as New Zealand's religious groups have now moved from lockdown into a period of sustained social distancing, we expect that future research could focus on how the need to socially distance in religious communities might lead to changed theology and/or practice. Lastly, we suggest that further research should investigate whether virtual religious communities and practice are sustained once the lockdowns are lifted.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-11-03","11"

The reported mortality in patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation is high [2, 3] . Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV ECMO) may serve as a lifesaving rescue therapy, particularly in young patients with single organ failure.Globally, 813 patients with the SARS CoV-2 virus have been managed with ECMO. Two hundred and sixty-one patients have been decannulated, and of those, 46% have been discharged alive [4] .The only Australian case of COVID-19 supported with prolonged VV ECMO in conjunction with prone ventilation, who was successfully decannulated after forty-one days, is described.A 55-year-old female, height 151cm and weighing 61kg, who recently had returned from the Philippines, presented at a small regional hospital in suburban Syd-ney, Australia with a one-week history of fever, cough, lethargy and myalgia. On presentation, she was febrile with a temperature of 42 o C and gave a past medical history which included mild asthma, sleep apnoea and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral hypoglycaemics had been prescribed for her diabetic condition. She was a non-smoker.The results of nasopharyngeal swabs, taken at the time of presentation, were found to be SARS CoV-2 PCR positive. A CT chest scan demonstrated patchy bilateral air-space infiltrates with scattered ground glass density consistent with a diagnosis of COVID-19 ( Figure 1-A, B) .She was transferred for ongoing management to a large quaternary referral centre and university hospital in Metropolitan Sydney, Australia.Her respiratory status deteriorated on Day 4 of hospital admission requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), semi-elective intubation and initiation of lung-protective ventilation (Figure 2-A) . After that, she progressed to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.On Day 5, her oxygenation and metabolic derangements continued to deteriorate despite a high PEEP, deep sedation and paralysis with the neuromuscular blocker cisatracurium (Pfizer Pty Ltd, Australia) in intravenous bolus doses of 10 mg followed by a continuous infusion. She was then referred for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).At the time of referral, her Fi02 was 90%, PEEP 20 cm of H 2 O, with a P/F ratio of 62 (Figure 2-B) . Echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, mild right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction, mild RV dilatation and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction Score (RESP) [5] was 1, with a predicted survival of 57%. A decision was made to commence VV ECMO on Day 10 post-admission.Cannulation was carried out via a femoral-femoral approach using a 21F return cannula and a 23F drainage cannula. Ventilation was reduced to a rest setting of tidal volume 2ml/kg, PEEP 10 cmH 2 O and a respiratory rate of 10 bpm.At the time of cannulation, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) identified a thrombus transiting through the right atrium. Despite this, there was an almost immediate improvement in the patient's haemodynamic and RV function.The following clinical events defined her course on ECMO.By Day14 post-admission, and after five days of VV ECMO, she had a complete loss of tidal volumes and was ultimately ECMO dependent.A high-resolution chest CT (HRCT) performed on Day 20 post-admission and after 11 days of VV ECMO, demonstrated a minimal amount of potentially recruitable lung and extensive and near-complete consolidation and collapse of the lungs bilaterally ( Airway bleeding leading to complete proximal airway occlusion occurred on Day 23 post-admission/ Day 14 of VV ECMO. At this time, the patient was anticoagulated with intravenous heparin (Hospira Pty Ltd, Australia) as an infusion for the ECMO circuit, and her coagulation profile was consistent with that of mild heparinization, with the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time measured at 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.The airway bleeding was treated with nebulised tranexamic acid (Pfizer Pty Ltd, Australia) 500 mg of the intravenous solution and the cessation of heparin (Hospira Pty Ltd, Australia).On Day 23 post-admission / Day 14 of VV ECMO, following bronchoscopic removal of thrombus, fibrous tissue strands extending proximally into both main stem bronchi were observed via further bronchoscopy.Cryotherapy was performed on Day 23 post-admission/ Day 14 of VV ECMO along with direct injection of tranexamic acid (Pfizer Pty Ltd, Australia)1g of the intravenous solution injected intravenous-intrabronchial and epinephrine (Juno pharmaceuticals, Australia),500 micrograms of 1:10,000 intravenous solution injected intra-bronchially.Cytology of the bronchial tissue, taken on Day 23 post-admission, day 14 of VV ECMO revealed bronchial cells. Due to ongoing oozing in the right lower lobe, lung isolation with a bronchial blocker and later a double-lumen endotracheal tube was performed. This treatment was continued for the next three days. Repeat bronchoscopy on Day 26 post-admission / Day 17 of VV ECMO demonstrated ongoing albeit reduced bleeding and ongoing sloughing of the bronchial mucosa.Argon plasma coagulation (APC) was also used to remove fibrin debris obstructing main stem bronchi, facilitating bilateral lung recruitment. (Figure 2 -C).Once airway bleeding had stabilised, prone ventilation was commenced on Day 27 post-admission, day 18 of VV ECMO aiming to facilitate ongoing lung recruitment (Figure 2-D) . By the fifth cycle of prone ventilation, a chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated an improvement in the aeration of lung fields. Prone ventilation was typically well tolerated with minimal cardiorespiratory support. The final trial of decreased ECMO gas flow was continued for 27 hours with stable gas exchange.On Day 51 post-admission and 42 days of VV ECMO, the patient was transferred to the operating theatre where the ECMO cannulas were removed. At the same time, an open repair of the femoral veins was undertaken by the vascular surgery team.From Days 52-62 post-admission and after 21 days post-ECMO decannulation, the patient slowly continued to improve. A surgical tracheostomy was undertaken on Day 55 post-admission and after seven days of ECMO decannulation, to facilitate ongoing pulmonary rehabilitation. After that, she was successfully weaned off ventilator support. She was able to phonate via insufflation of oxygen into the supraglottic port of the tracheostomy tube (Figure 1-F and 2-F) . By Day 60 post-admission, from a neurological perspective, she was awake, obeying commands, actively participating in her rehabilitation and interacting with her family.Providing complex therapies such as VV ECMO during a pandemic has its unique challenges. VV ECMO is a resource-intense form of respiratory support. Extracorporeal resources during a pandemic can become rapidly overwhelmed, posing ethical challenges as to timing and determination of which patients receive support [6] . Case numbers of COVID-19 in Australia have remained low, and ICUs have not exceeded their capacity, allowing VV ECMO to be offered to eligible patients in keeping with both WHO and Australian guidelines [7, 8] .However, while ECMO is one of the treatment options in severe ARDS and was utilised effectively during the H1N1, SARS and MERS pandemics [9] , its role in the management of COVID-19 remains unclear [10] .The data regarding mortality, complications and duration of ECMO support in COVID-19 remains incomplete. In one series Sultan (2020) described two patients successfully taken off support ECMO and seven patients remaining on support [12] . In their case series, both Ruan (2020) [13] and Yang [11] both describe a 100% mortality among patients supported by ECMO.In one of the more extensive reported case series describing thirty-two patients supported with ECMO, five patients were successfully taken off support, and seventeen patients remained on ECMO [14] . Amongst those no longer on ECMO, the longest ECMO run was fifteen days. It is currently too early to appreciate the anticipated clinical course and duration of ECMO support in these patients or the effect this intensive form of respiratory support will have on the outcome. However, the patient described in the presented case report, had a 41-day ECMO run, in a setting of predominantly single-organ failure and continued to improve three-weeks post-decannulation. A unique aspect of this case is the prolonged use of ECMO. Whilst the efficacy of VV ECMO is well recognised as a bridge to lung recovery in ARDS, the evidence supporting the use of prolonged ECMO runs in this setting is not so well established. The ELSO Registry (2016) reported that the average ECMO run for viral pneumonia was 13.5 days [15] .The ELSO registry data from 2009 to 2018 reported 4,361 adult patients who underwent prolonged ECMO for respiratory failure, 88% of which received VV ECMO. The median ECMO duration was 22 days with a mean of 28±20 days. Prolonged ECMO periods varied, with over 30% being longer than one month. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 51%, and the duration of ECMO support did not differ between survivors and non-survivors [16] . Other studies have shown that prolonged ECMO support was not an independent risk factor for increased mortality [15, [17] [18] [19] . There has been a significant improvement in prolonged ECMO survival over recent years due to technological advances, experience and better prevention and management of complications. While the assessment to continue ECMO support in this patient population is multifactorial, time on ECMO should not be the sole factor in this challenging decision.The use of prone positioning has been demonstrated to improve oxygenation as well as survival in patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxaemia [20, 21] . While ultra-protective ventilation is used in ARDS-patients on VV ECMO [22] , it results in increased alveoli collapse and therefore, poor ventilation of the dependent lung tissue [23] .Unfortunately, the patient in the present case report initially was unable to be proned due to haemodynamic instability. Eventually, when the patient became more stable, successive 16-hour sessions of prone positioning over seven days was performed. Her tidal volumes improved from 40-50 ml to 250-300 ml with acceptable driving pressures. Progress CT chest demonstrated marked improvement of the bilateral collapse/consolidation with no overt signs of fibrosis [ Figure 1 -E]. In this patient, proning was an essential aspect of being able to commence and sustain ECMO weaning.Anticoagulation management was challenging for this patient, due to the need to balance the competing goals of minimising clot formation within the ECMO circuit with major airway bleeding in a prothrombotic milieu of COVID-19 infection [2] .After one month on ECMO, a rising lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, bilirubin and falling fibrinogen were noted. In contrast, transmembrane pressures were low and stable, the post-membrane PO2 was > 400mmHg [53kPa], and there were only minor visible clots peripherally on the oxygenator membrane. Despite seemingly optimal oxygenator function, given the biochemical evidence of haemolysis, it was decided to replace the oxygenator with resultant rapid resolution of the markers of haemolysis.Several reviews correlate the causes of haemolysis during ECMO support with either high negative access pressures, high pump flows, small cannula size, or pump head thrombosis and high transmembrane pressures with a loss of oxygen transfer [24] [25] [26] . It is interesting to note that haemolysis occurred in this case in the absence of all of these factors.In the late phase of her ECMO run, the patient developed persistent hypercalcemia with normal parathyroid hormone, phosphate, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and thyroid hormone levels. This was attributed to prolonged bed rest and immobilisation, resulting in excessive bone resorption.Another consideration is that of heparin-induced osteoclastic bone resorption, given her prolonged time on ECMO, requiring extended therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. Hypercalcaemia is a well-documented complication of prolonged ECMO support in both neonatal and paediatric populations but has not been described in adults on prolonged ECMO support [27, 28] . The hypercalcemia in our patient was attributed to prolonged bed rest and immobilisation, resulting in excessive bone resorption. Another consideration is that of heparin-induced osteoclasts bone resorption, given her prolonged time on ECMO requiring extended therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin.This case report provides a unique insight into the potential clinical sequelae of COVID-19 infection, supported in an intensive care environment which was not resource-limited at the time. The case adds to the evolving experience of prolonged VV ECMO support for ARDS with a goal of native lung recovery.","Australia","first author","2020-11-07","11"

In Australia, preventative measures, including staying at home if feeling unwell, social distancing, self-isolation for international arrivals, and cancellation of large gatherings were instituted from mid-March (2) . In Queensland specifically, all but essential services were shut down by the end of March, with gradual easing of restrictions commencing in early May.From a global perspective, the pandemic has resulted in significant reconfiguration and reduction of routine healthcare services. Often, only life-saving and emergency procedures were available with cessation of routine screening programs and elective surgery.Unfortunately, this strategy has resulted in significant unintended consequences -delay in cancer diagnosis, poor control of chronic cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and profound psychological stress amongst others. In maternity care however, consequences of the imposed restrictions have been mixed. Early reports from some countries suggest that although stillbirth rates increased (3) (4) (5) , rates of preterm birth actually decreased (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . It is not clear if there is a similar trend in Australia.The aim of this study was thus to investigate preterm birth rates and trends and stillbirths during the lockdown period in a single tertiary perinatal centre in Queensland.This study was performed at the Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane. This is a supraregional tertiary perinatal centre with ~10,000 births per year. Ethical and governance approvals were obtained from the institution's Human Research Ethics Committee and Governance and Privacy office respectively (Ref No: HREC/MML/61799). We analysed preterm birth rates during the strictest period of lockdown (30 March-1 May; ""late""). To examine effects of earlier mitigation measures, we also analysed an equal 33-day period commencing two-weeks earlier (16) (17) April; ""early""). Each period was compared with the exact same calendar period for seven years (2013-2019) preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed stillbirth rates during the entire study period .Deidentified obstetric and neonatal data were extracted from the hospital's electronic healthcare records database. Women with singleton pregnancies who birthed between 16 th March to 1 st May in years 2013-2020 were included in the main analyses. Preterm births were categorised as follows: 23+0-27+6 weeks (extremely preterm); 28+0-31+6 weeks (very preterm); and 32+0-36+6 weeks (moderate/late preterm) and only livebirths were included.The comparison group was live infants born at term (≥37 weeks' gestation). Preterm birth rates were also analysed according to birth onset: planned (Caesarean section or induction of labour) or spontaneous. Fourteen-day rolling averages (7 days prior to 6 days after) were calculated for the percentage of preterm births from January to June each year. To eliminate effects of whole-year shifts in preterm birth prevalence, rolling averages were also presented as a percentage change from the average preterm birth for that year. For singleton stillbirths reported, all gestational ages were included.Logistic regressions were performed for each restriction period to compare the probability of preterm versus full-term births in 2020 compared with consolidated 2013-2019 data. This was also performed for planned and spontaneous births separately. Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to assess the odds of being born in each preterm category versus the reference full-term category in 2020 compared with consolidated 2013-2019 data. The odds of preterm birth in each preceding year was also compared using logistic regressions, with year 2020 set as the reference year. Covariates in the adjusted models were key contributors to preterm birth, including maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, parity, socioeconomic status, and history or current asthma, diabetes mellitus, and/or hypertensive disorder based on signal differences (P≤0.25) in the distribution of cases between years by ANOVA (scale) or Chi-square testing (categorical). Socioeconomic status was represented by tertiles of the Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA, 2016) index of relative socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage scores for the maternal postcode of residence (lower, middle, upper). Maternal smoking status around the time of conception and/or the first trimester of pregnancy were not included in the adjusted model as these did not differ between the years. Information pertaining to alcohol consumption around the time of conception and/or the first trimester of pregnancy was also not included in the adjusted model as data was available for only 50% of the population each year. The prevalence of stillbirths was compared between the years using Chi-square testing.year was compared with year 2020 using a logistic regression. Maternal ethnicity and socioeconomic status were included in the adjusted model based on signal differences (P≤0.25) in the distribution of cases between years by Chi-square testing.We then separated the analyses by type of birth onset. A reduction in planned, but not spontaneous, moderate/late preterm births was seen during the ""early"" period compared with consolidated 2013-2019 data (aOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, P<0.01; Table 3 ). When 2020 was set as the reference year, the adjusted odds of planned moderate/late preterm birth during the ""early"" period was 2.2-3.3-times greater in all preceding years (Supplementary Table 2 ).The reduction in planned moderate/late preterm birth was less pronounced during the ""late"" period (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.99, P<0.05; Table 3, Supplementary Table 2) .To capture the two-week spike in spontaneous preterm births in 2020 (26 April to 9May), a logistic regression was performed. Compared with 2020, the odds of preterm versus full-term spontaneous birth was lower only in 2014 (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24-1.07, P=0.07) and 2017 (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22-1.10, P=0.08, Supplementary Table 3) .In this study, at a tertiary perinatal hospital in Queensland, Australia, a significant reduction in preterm births was observed following the implementation of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The reduction was driven primarily by a decline in moderate/late preterm infants, and the greatest impact was seen during the earliest period of restrictions.Furthermore, this reduction appeared to be attributed to planned, but not spontaneous, preterm births. These findings pertain to singleton, and not multiple, pregnancies. Our data contribute to the growing evidence from other countries (5-9) and, together, may reveal novel factors linked to preterm birth.During early restrictions, planned births for moderate/late preterm infants reduced by more than half when compared with the preceding seven years. Given that infection is an indication for planned preterm birth (10), it is possible that reduced physical contact and increased hygiene contributed to our findings. Furthermore, self-isolation may have resulted in reduced work-and social-related stress, improved sleep quality and/or diet, with an overall improvement to pregnancy health, such as controlled blood pressure, and reduced requirement for a planned preterm birth. Other reasons may include more tele-health antenatal appointments and a possible reduction in care-seeking behaviour by pregnant women. Furthermore, given the uncertainty of the situation at the time, and the close locality of the maternity hospital to the general adult's hospital, it is possible that women avoided seeking care for antenatal concerns that would normally be grounds for a planned preterm birth. Importantly, we did not observe an increase in stillbirth rates during this time.subsequently went into spontaneous preterm labour. Further analyses of preterm birth rates by gestational weeks using a larger dataset may support this observation. No neonatal deaths were reported during the rise in spontaneous preterm births.The earliest period of restrictions, before the government-imposed hard lockdown, had the greatest influence on reducing planned preterm birth rates. In Australia, there was a remarkable spike in the ""panic index"" in early March (11) . This did not coincide with any major restrictions to movement or travel, nor local COVID-19 cases, but was likely related to observations by the general population of the international impacts of COVID-19. At this time, hand sanitisers and antibacterial handwashes sold out in most parts of the country, highlighting the magnitude of behaviour change. This timing is somewhat consistent with a large nationwide study from the Netherlands, which reported reductions in moderate/late preterm births in the 2-4-month period following initial mitigation measures, but not when stricter measures were introduced 1-2 weeks later, albeit there was no separation by planned and spontaneous preterm births (7).We did not see a persistent level of reduction in moderate/late planned preterm births later in the pandemic, following the implementation of more formal lockdown measures.Given that COVID-19 cases did not rise as initially expected in Australia, it is possible that attending hospital for antenatal concerns in these later weeks was no longer avoided.A nationwide study in Denmark found no effect on moderate/late or very preterm births during the strictest month of lockdown compared with the same calendar period in the previous five years (6) . However, a significant reduction in extremely preterm births was observed. Similarly, in a designated area of Ireland, the proportion of extremely-and verylow-birth-weight infants was unusually low in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period in the preceding 19 years (8) . It is difficult to ascertain why the Danish and Irish observed reductions in the earliest and smallest infants (6, 8) while we, the Dutch (7), and Italians (5) This was a retrospective data collection approach using a hospital database that had some missing data. We included all livebirths ≥ 23 completed weeks' gestation, as active resuscitation and support is usually offered from this gestation depending on parental wishes.preprint.","Australia","first author","2020-11-28","11"

In Ireland, COVID-19 has placed additional strain on an already stretched healthcare system. If left unchecked, it was feared that COVID-19 had the potential to overwhelm the health service. For this reason the Irish government opted to implement a host of restrictive measures aimed at curtailing the spread of the disease.On 27 March 2020, the Irish government commenced a national lockdown in an attempt to ""flatten the curve"". Non-essential services were shutdown, with widespread travel restrictions, closure of public spaces, and cancellation of sporting events. 3 These restrictive measures have affected the day-to-day living of every citizen in the country, and the resultant behavioural changes have never before been witnessed in the history of the state.Nevertheless, trauma is an inevitability and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a complex impact on the delivery of trauma care worldwide. In the UK, the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) have released guidelines pertaining to the management of acute trauma during these unprecedented times. Similarly, the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland (RCSI) have acknowledged the potential impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Ireland and have released recommendations for the delivery of trauma services. 4 Internationally, anecdotal evidence from Italy and research from New Zealand and the UK have reported a significant decrease in the number of trauma cases presenting during the COVID-19 lockdown. [5] [6] [7] However, no research exists examining the impact of the national lockdown on the Irish cohort.As such, the aim of this study is to quantify the impact of the national lockdown on trauma presentations to a model-3 hospital in Ireland. It is hoped that this research may provide an indication of the temporal change in acute trauma care during the COVID-19 lockdown and as such assist in allowing appropriate allocation of resources during these unprecedented times.Hospital, which is located in the Dublin west suburb of Blanchardstown. Connolly Hospital is a model-3 hospital, which provides emergency medical services to the north Dublin catchment area with an estimated population of 331,000 people. 8 Data was collected using the hospital's electronic patient database. All patients presenting to the emergency department during the one-month period from 27 March 2020 to 27 April 2020 and from 27 March 2019 to 27 April 2019 were identified retrospectively from a prospectively collected database. Patient IDs were cross-referenced against the National Integrated Medical Imaging System-Picture Archiving Communication System (NIMIS-PACS) radiology platform to identify patients with radiologically proven fractures. The mechanisms of injury and locations of injury were documented in emergency department notes, imaging requests, or as part of routine outpatient follow-up post-injury.Data was compiled, anonymized, and analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) on a password-protected departmental computer. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all desired variables. Associations between patients characteristics, treatment outcome, mechanisms of injury, and locations of injury were then examined in bivariate analysis using χ 2 tests. Ethical approval was granted by the hospitals Research Ethics Board (REC). results trauma presentations. The findings of this study can be seen in Table I . A significant reduction was observed in trauma rates during the lockdown period. 136 patients presented to ED with radiologically proven skeletal trauma during the study period in comparison with 174 patients during the same period in 2019, representing a 22% in trauma rates (χ 2 (1, N = 310) = 4.66, p = 0.03).During the COVID-19 lockdown, 39 patients required inpatient admission for trauma management. In comparison, during the same period in 2019, 66 patients required hospital admission. This equated to an overall 40% reduction in hospital admission rates for trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown (χ 2 (1, N = 105) = 6.94, p = .002). Sex and age band. A significant reduction was observed in rates of musculoskeletal injury among males during the COVID-19 lockdown. Of the 2020 cohort, 46% (n = 62) were male, while 54% (n = 74) were female. In comparison, in 2019 the cohort was 55% (n = 96) male and 45% (n = 77) female, representing a 35% reduction in trauma among males (χ 2 (1, N = 158) = 7.32, p = < 0.001).During the COVID-19 lockdown, the mean age of patients was 54 years and the median age of the cohort was 55 years. The cohort from 2019 had an average age of 49 years, with a median age of 44 years. Irrespective of time period analyzed, the majority of trauma in the 16-64-year-old age group occurred in males. Similarly, in patients aged 65 years or older, females were predominately affected, with no significant differences observed between groups.In all, 61% (n = 83) of patients presenting during the COVID-19 lockdown were aged 16 to 64 years, while 39%(n = 53) of patients were aged 65 years or older. Similarly in 2019, 69% (n = 120) of patients were aged between 16 to 64 years, while 31% (n = 54) were aged 65 years or over. Mechanism of injury. Variations in the mechanism of injury are outlined in Figure 1 . Falls of less than two metres which were mechanical in nature were termed ""mechanical falls"" and this was the most common injurious mechanism across both time periods. During the COVID-19 lockdown, 46% (n = 62) of patients cited a mechanical fall as their mechanism of injury, followed by injuries from sports and recreation (11%, n = 15), falling down stairs (8%, n = 11), pedestrian injuries (7%, n = 9), blunt trauma (8%, n = 6), falls from ladders (7%, n = 5), inversion injuries (4%, n = 5), with crush injuries, road traffic accidents, and assaults cited as the injurious mechanism in 3% of cases.In comparison with the 2019 cohort, there was an approximately 60% reduction in patients sustaining injuries during both recreational and road traffic accidents during the COVID-19 lockdown. A similar reduction was seen in injuries resulting from assaults, approximately 43% however owing to the relatively low numbers observed in both groups, these results did not reach significance.A significant reduction was seen in sports-related trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown in comparison with 2019 (χ 2 (1, N = 54)= 10.66, p = 0.001).Interestingly, a 70% increase was noted in patients presenting with trauma as a result of falls from height during the COVID-19 lockdown, specifically, reports of falls from ladders at home increased threefold. However, these results were deemed non-significant, owing to the low-numbers. These findings are outlined in Figure 2 . Place of injury. Home was the most common location of injury across both cohorts; however, large variation was seen between the two time periods. In all, 60% (n = 81) of patients cited home as the site of injury during the COVID-19 lockdown, while 39% (n = 67) sustained trauma at home during the same period in 2019.A significant reduction was observed in patients sustaining injuries in public spaces during the COVID-19 lockdown (χ 2 (1, N = 41)= 14.05, p = < 0.001). A reduction in volume of injury was seen across all other locations analysed, excluding nursing homes which was the location of injury for eight patients in both groups.On 27 March 2020, the Irish government commenced a national lockdown in an attempt to ""flatten the curve"" of COVID-19 spread. While the goal of this lockdown was to curtail the spread of this deadly pandemic it appears to have had knock on effects on the incidence of traumatic injuries in Ireland.On comparison of our patient cohort with that of the Irish Major Trauma Audit (MTA) in 2016 our patient group appear grossly comparable to the national average. 9 The mean age of patients identified by the MTA was 55 years, while that of our cohort was 54. Similarly, the MTA concluded that the predominance of injuries suffered in patients aged 0 to 54 years were male, with females being the predominant sex injured in those aged 54 years or older. 9 These findings were replicated in our study.The aim of our study was to assess for variation in the number and manner of trauma presentations to our hospital during the COVID-19 national lockdown. Our study found that fewer patients presented with radiological proven skeletal trauma during the lockdown, and of those patients who presented with trauma, fewer required hospital admission.Variation was seen in the mechanism of injury when comparison was made with data from 2019. As would be expected a significant reduction in injuries from sports and recreation was observed during the lockdown (χ 2 (1, N = 54) = 10.66, p = 0.001). A marked reduction in road traffic accidents was also observed, with smaller reductions also seen in injuries resulting from assaults. The majority of differences observed in mechanisms of injury failed to reach statistical significance, which is likely due to the relatively small sample size.Variation was also observed in the location of injury during the national lockdown. A large increase was seen in patients sustaining injuries at home. Domestic injuries were most commonly due to mechanical falls, falls down stairs, and falls from ladders.While there is a relative dearth of research in this field, the results of this study are paralleled in research conducted in both the European and Australasian context. Thornton noted a 25% reduction in accident and emergency (A&E) department presentations during the first week after lockdown in the UK. 6 The authors postulated that the reduction in A&E presentations was potentially due to the effect of social isolation and lower vehicle use during lockdown. 6 The effect of national lockdown on trauma in New Zealand was reported by Christey et al, 7 and their results are grossly comparable to this study. Authors noted a 43% reduction in trauma admissions during national lockdown in New Zealand. Similarly, a reduction in injuries sustained by males under the age of 65 years was observed. 7 Furthermore, the authors observed a reduction in both sports-related injuries and road traffic accident-related injuries. 7 As with our study, mechanical falls represented the most common cause of trauma, most frequently occurring in the over 65 years age group. 7 The findings of this study have important public health implications. While instituting a national lockdown has predictably led to a decrease in trauma among the more mobile under 65 years population, trauma rates among the elderly remain unchanged and rates of domestic injuries have increased. The home is the still the most common site of injury and falls from a less than two metres in height are the most common injurious mechanism. The need for a public health initiative to reduce the risk of falls at home has been acknowledged by the Irish government. The AFFINITY National Falls and Bone Health Project was commenced in December 2019. 10 Particular emphasis should be placed on public health initiatives like this during the coming months. These initiatives increase awareness of the preventable nature of falls, and aim to reduce the rate of falls among the elderly. A reduction in falls among the elderly in the coming months would contribute greatly in reducing the strain on our health system as a whole during the COVID-19 crisis. 10 In the UK, a dedicated public health initiate has been launched by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) to decrease the rates of domestic injuries during the COVID-19 crisis, and to reduce rates of domestic injuries on a national leve. 11 Furthermore, consideration should be given to the need for a public health initiative highlighting the potential dangers of do-it-yourself (DIY) activities during the national lockdown. A large increase in purchasing of DIY products such as paint, ladders, and gardening tools was reported in the lead up to the lockdown. 12 This coincides with a marked increase in falls from a height during the lockdown, specifically falls from a ladder. Governments should consider issuing specific warnings to highlight the potential dangers of DIY activities during lockdown, particularly highlighting ladder safety.This study also has important implications for resource allocation and consolidation of trauma care services in Ireland. We observed a 40% reduction in trauma admissions during the study period. A decrease in trauma admissions reflects decreased demand on trauma services during the national lockdown. This could feasibly allow temporary redeployment of some orthopaedic doctors to areas of higher demand during this global pandemic should the need arise.The restrictions imposed on Irish citizens as a result of the national lockdown have had profound effects on the dayto-day life of the entire population. Naturally, as a result of stringent travel restrictions and advice for elderly individuals to ""cocoon"" fewer traumas are occurring outside of the home. However, trauma is an inevitability and a large increase in home-based injuries were seen in our cohort, specifically occurring as a result of mechanical falls, falling down stairs, and falls from ladders.This study has some obvious limitations, we chose to only include patients presenting with fractures. Additionally, assumptions regarding trends of injury pattern with regards to location and mechanism should be interpreted with caution in some instances owing to the relatively low numbers of patients. Future studies would ideally identify all patients with musculoskeletal trauma and classify them according to injury severity, likely over a more prolonged period to identify a larger patient cohort.However, this study contributes data to a field in which there is dearth of evidence at present. While similar results have been seen in New Zealand and the UK this is the only paper in the literature reporting the impact of national lockdown on the Irish cohort. 6, 7 As such, this paper could have important implications at both a local and national level, and allow for appropriate division of resources and planning of trauma services over the coming months and into the future if further lockdowns are required.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-11-01","11"

Total of 19,000 cases in greater Melbourne, and 1,000 in regional Victoria, to 30 th October 2020 [7, 8] .An individual-based model capturing the demographics and movement patterns of individuals within an Australian city, together with SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission data from the early outbreak in Wuhan, China prior to social distancing activation [9] , was developed and applied. This was used to analyse the effectiveness of a broad suite of non-pharmaceutical, social distancing interventions, by varying their strength, their time of activation, and their duration. Individualbased (c.f. agent-based) modelling is an appropriate methodology to adopt for this task. It permits the effect of four key social distancing measures to be readily captured at a high degree of detail: school closure; reduction in workplace participation; community-contact reduction; and case isolation. This modelling method has been applied previously, to quantify the impact of pandemic mitigation strategies [10] [11] [12] [13] , and to inform policy decision making [14] [15] [16] [17] .This study utilised a model of Newcastle, a city in New South Wales, Australia (population 272,407), whose population demographics reflect Australia as a whole and results were scaled to greater Melbourne, population ~5 million, following an approach used previously [11, 12] . Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data were used to capture age-specific demographics of every household in the community. [18, 19] ABS workplace data was used to assign adults to workplaces [20] , and State Government schools data was used to assign children to age-specific classes [21] . These data were used to model the time-changing contact patterns for each individual, as they move between their household, school/workplace contact hub and in the wider community.Model parameter settings were calibrated to reflect the transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic: an incubation period averaging 6 days, from infection to symptom emergence (if any); a latent period averaging 5 days, from infection to infectious; an infectious period averaging 4.5 days, the first day being asymptomatic; and 35% of cases are asymptomatic. The probability of virus transmission from infectious to susceptible individuals was derived from a R0 of 2.25, based on SARS-CoV-2 transmission characteristics from Wuhan, China prior to introduction of containment measures [9, 22] , following the method applied for pandemic influenza [23] .Model outputs obtained by running the simulation software produced the infection history of every individual in the community, generating the daily (and total) number of infectious individuals, and determining where and when infection occur, as described previously [14, 17] . Modelling analyses were conducted for alternative social distancing strategies, by varying the strength of measures and their activation timing. This quantified how alternative mitigation strategies may have performed, allowing us to contrast alternative mitigation strategies with those that were used. The difference in total case numbers provides a measure of the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the outbreak.Our model depends on a small number of stochastic parameters, including the probability of virus transmission between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual, and the random seeding of infectious individuals into the community to initiate an outbreak. This results in variation between successive simulation runs. From experience with prior, related analyses of mitigation strategy effectiveness for pandemic and seasonal influenza [14, 15, 23] , averaging infection data generated from multiple runs stabilises after approximately 16 runs. The results presented here were obtained from multiple simulation runs for each social distancing scenario evaluated.Four social distancing measures are available to health authorities, and were combined during the Melbourne COVID-19 outbreak. School closure (SC): reduction in school attendance. Workplace non-attendance (WN): a percentage of all persons in the workforce remain at home during working hours. Community contact reduction (CCR): contact in the wider community is reduced by a given percentage to reflect strength of intervention. Case isolation (CI): a percentage of adults and all children withdraw to the home on becoming symptomatic. Stage 2, Stage 3 and Stage 4 measures applied in greater Melbourne are described in Table 1 and the Supporting Information [3-5, 24, 25] . These have increasing strength, with Stage 4 lockdown restricting individuals to their homes unless they have approved occupations, require healthcare, or require to shop for essential supplies. The sequence of changes to social distancing measures in the State of Victoria are as follows: Stage 2 measures were activated on 25 th March, and given absence of community-wide transmission started to be eased on 26 th May, with some students returning to schools. From 26 th June all schools closed, mirroring Stage 2 measures. Stage 3 measures were introduced from 2 nd July onwards, first to limited areas of greater Melbourne, designated by their postal codes. Stage 3 measures were then extended to all of greater Melbourne on 10 th July, however schools reopened on 13 th July for years 11 and 12, and for all ages on 20 th July. As daily case numbers continued to increase over that period, Stage 4 lockdown measures were activated on 3rd August.Calibrating diagnosed cases to new SARS-Cov-2 infections in the simulation model used a process which applied the infection timeline parameters (see Supporting Information, Table S1 ). The daily set of currently infectious individuals generated by the model was used to calculate the daily number of (simulated) diagnosed cases, assuming a given percentage of COVID-19 positive cases are tested and reported. By adjusting seeding of infectious individuals into the model in early June 2020, and under the social distancing measures then in place, the model was calibrated to case numbers appearing at a later time.The calibration process was conducted in two steps, to reflect an increased testing regime beginning in early July. The first calibration phase resulted in approximately a third of all infected individuals being diagnosed, the remaining two thirds being in either the latent period, or asymptomatic, or exhibiting mild symptoms, and thus not accessing a testing facility. In the second phase, when a more aggressive testing regime involving increased contact tracing was initiated from 2 nd July 2020 onwards, we assumed a steady increase in the (positive case) diagnosis rate, as the overall testing coverage increased. This ratio, between infections and the percentage of infections being diagnosed and reported as cases, was used to convert daily infection data generated by the model into predicted case numbers.Simulation experiments were conducted by running model software, after adjusting the strength of social distancing measures to reflect introduction of Stage3 and Stage 4 restrictions. Random seeding of infectious individuals into the model was used to capture the effect of localized high transmission events, resulting from a number of large gatherings in late June 2020 [2] . The following were determined to replicate daily outbreak case dynamics up to 1 st August 2020.Prior to increases in social distancing measures on 9 th July 2020, we assumed 30% of school-age children were not attending school (SC30) and workplace attendance and community contact were both reduced by 20% (WN20) and (CCR20) respectively, as in Table 1 . This weak Stage 2 social distancing arose from previous easing of measures, given low levels of virus transmission throughout Australia. Simulations were run from 17 th June 2020 onwards with approximately 10 infections seeded daily, and with social distancing at (SC30+WN20+CCR20), as above. From 28 th June an additional 180 infected individual were seeded daily to model the rapid growth in infections due to large-scale family gatherings [1, 2].Following a significant increase in diagnosed cases in late June 2020, the Victorian Government announced Stage 3 restrictions to apply from 9 th July 2020. All schools, cafes, restaurants and bars closed, and public gatherings and sporting events stopped, estimated to give a 60% communitywide contact reduction (CCR60) coupled with 100% school closure (SC100), as detailed in Table  1 . Case isolation at home was assumed to have compliance of 70% for adults and 100% for children (CI70). The 20% workplace reduction continued, resulting in a (SC100+WN20+CCR60+CI70) Stage 3 social distancing strategy.Calibrating our model to case data up to the beginning of August, and continuing simulations into 2021, allowed us to analyse the effectiveness of a range of alternative social distancing strategies, and to compare these with those applied by the Government of Victoria.The Government of Victoria adopted a ""stepped"" response to their second wave COVID-19 outbreak, from Stage 2 to Stage 3, then to Stage 4. This is illustrated by the yellow epidemic curve in Figure 2 , which realistically predicts the dynamics of the reduction in daily case numbers up to 30 th October 2020, as seen in diagnosed case number data, Figure 1 .The rapid increase in diagnosed cases in greater Melbourne from 13 th June 2020 onwards (see Figure 1 ) suggests that an opportunity existed to move from Stage 2 measures directly to Stage 4. For reference, between 19 th June and 29 th June case numbers were doubling every 7 to 10 days. This exponential growth phase in diagnosed cases numbers may be observed in Figure 1 . Figure  2 , and data in Table 2 , highlight the potential benefit of early activation of Stage 4 ""lockdown"" social distancing measures, on 19 th June, 29 th June, and 10 th July, the date when Stage 3 was activated, the blue, orange and grey curves respectively. These results illustrate the benefit, in terms of case number reductions, that may have been achieved by these early activation strategies, when compared with the actual date of Stage 4 lockdown on August 3 rd , yellow curve Figure 2 .The following data sequence, taken from daily COVID-19 case data published by the Government of Victoria [7]; 5 cases on 11 th June, 10 on 13 th , 20 on 16 th , 25 on 19 th , 33 on 24 rd , 40 on 26 th and 61 on 29 th June 2020, 98 on 5 th July, 122 on 7 th , 143 on 9 th and 218 on 14 th July [7, 8] . Note that reported case data is known to vary day-to-day, as seen in Figure 1 , depending on numbers attending testing facilities. However, a clear pattern can be seen with this data sequence, with cases doubling approximately every 7-8 days from 11 th June to 9 th July, giving an exponential increase, then increasing linearly until mid-August, as illustrated in Figure 1 [8] . The above results suggest that the exponential increase in diagnosed cases during that period could have been used to trigger hard lockdown measures. If used, this triggering approach is predicted to effectively reduce virus transmission and resulting case numbers.The State of Victoria responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by increasing social distancing measures in two steps; Stage 3 measures on 10 th July 2020, and given the continuing increase in case numbers, strengthened measures to Stage 4 on 3 rd August 2020 [25] . Modelling was conducted to analyse the impact of this stepwise series of measures, and contrast these with the situation had they not occurred. Stage 3 measures introduced on 10 th July 2020, namely (SC100+WN20+CCR60+CI70), were strengthened to Stage 4 on the 3 rd of August, estimated to increase workplace non-attendance to 50% and further reduce community-wide contact to 20%, an 80% reduction. This gives social distancing scenario (SC100+WN50+CCR80+CI70), the grey curve in Figure 3 .Further modelling experiments were conducted to evaluate whether less restrictive Stage 4 strategies may have had a similar benefit, orange and yellow curves in Figure 3 . The aim of these measures would be to lessen the economic impact of businesses closing due to hard lockdown, by increasing workplace attendance. This was achieved by a) allowing small service businesses to reopen, i.e. cafes with staff returning, and b) larger workplaces increasing numbers working insitu, rather than remotely. We evaluated two scenarios: 1) reducing workplace non-attendance to 30% (so increasing attendance to 70%) and lessening the community contact reduction to 75%, and 2) having workplace non-attendance at 35% and community contact reduction staying at 80%. These result in the orange and yellow epidemic curves in Figure 5 , respectively. For all three lockdown strategies, these changes in social distancing are predicted to result in minimal virus transmission from mid-January 2021 onwards, with diagnosed case numbers at zero or one for all three strategies (see Table 3 , Figure 3 ). The strategy reducing case numbers most rapidly corresponds to the Stage 4 measures that were adopted, and described previously ( Figure  2 , Table 2 ).These data indicate that the slightly earlier activation of Stage 3 social distancing measures fails to significantly reduce the duration of virus transmission, with transmission continuing to at least June 2021. This supports the decision by the Government of Victoria to then strengthen measures to Stage 4 lockdown, with our modelling estimating cessation of transmission by the end of 2020.Early and robust application of social distancing measures are known to be an appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020 such responses were highly effective in minimizing case numbers and the rate of epidemic growth at the early stages of the pandemic, as in Korea and China [26] [27] [28] . Similarly, slow responses have resulted in significant first and second pandemic waves, e.g. in Italy, Spain and the UK [29] .This study's aims were to provide further evidence on the benefit of, and need for, early and robust interventions to contain second waves of coronavirus infections. We quantified the effectiveness of a range of response measures, in terms of the reduction in case numbers, and thus resulting hospitalisations and deaths. These results are intended to help inform the hard COVID-19 containment decisions that need to be made by politicians and public health authorities, until an effective vaccine becomes available. A challenge in responding to COVID-19 second waves is to balance the effect of necessary lockdown measures, in protecting the health of the population, with the negative impact which strict social distancing measures have on a country's economy. A fundamental issue highlighted in this study is the delay between increasing coronavirus transmission rates, and the time when these manifest themselves as an increase in diagnosed cases.Our study was fortunate in having access to comprehensive case data from the rapidly developing COVID-19 second wave in greater Melbourne, Australia from June 2020 onwards. Genomic sequencing has shown that most infections in this second wave result from a breakdown in hotelbased quarantine, followed by two large family gatherings [1, 2] . To our knowledge, there were no further introduced infections. This provided an ideal test-bed with which to analyse the effectiveness of the mitigation measures taken, determine their failings, understand why the second wave spread so rapidly, and to evaluate alternative mitigation strategies as to their effectiveness in reducing the scale of a second wave. These analyses were facilitated by the absence of introduced cases into the modelled population; the lack of ""noise"" from ongoing infection introduction allowed us to assume that all infections resulted from the single source.Using second wave outbreak data, we demonstrate how the methodology used realistically modelled SARS-Cov-2 transmission from 1 st August to 30 th October 2020, when daily diagnosed case numbers had reduced to zero. This prediction of outbreak dynamics provides validation of how lockdown social distancing measures were modelled. That is, the impact which lockdown measures had on reducing transmission over the same period of time. This validation provides evidence as to the robustness of the modelling methods used, and gives credence to the results obtained.Results indicate that the most effective response, which significantly reduce cases and second wave duration, would be the activation of Stage 4 lockdown measures much earlier, when case numbers were first seen to increase exponentially, on or before 29 th June 2020. This approach is estimated to result in ~11,000 cases, compared to ~25,000 for the strategy taken, in a population of approximately 5 million ( Table 2 ). The second most effective strategy would have been to activate Stage 4 social distancing measures on 9 th July, the date of the first response to the second wave, which increased social distancing measures to Stage 3. This is estimated to reduce total cases to ~16,000 (Table 2 ). These two highly effective strategies involved moving directly to Stage 4 measures from Stage 2, rather than the step-wise approach adopted, from Stage 2 to Stage 3 to Stage 4. They highlight the need to ""catch"" increasing transmission rates before infections are widely distributed, with early and robust social distancing contributing to the rapid reduction in virus transmission. The need for timely introduction of lockdown measures is discussed in a short overview of the situation in the UK at the end of October 2020, by Elisabeth Mahase [30] . It appears that the UK has been too slow to introduce hard lockdown, repeating the situation which occurred in greater Melbourne, but on a much larger, country-wide scale. Significantly, the easing of social distancing measures in the UK without high levels of testing and tracing has been shown in a recent modelling study to result in a second COVID-19 wave [31] , predicting the situation which now appears to have occurred [30] .Our analyses support the decision by the State Government to subsequently introduce Stage 4 lockdown measures, which rapidly suppressed ongoing transmission and shorten the duration of the second wave. Once transmission reaches a level where social distancing measures can be safely eased, and new cases managed by highly efficient test, track and isolate systems, this will permit an earlier reopening of businesses and a more rapid increase in economic activity.It should be noted that the COVID-19 situation in Australia differs from most other countries, and while our key findings are widely applicable, they may not be as effective in other settings due to import of infectious cases. Prior to the second wave there was effectively no community transmission in Australia, due to early and strict border closures. Many countries in Europe, for example, failed to close borders, allowing infectious individuals to spread widely, with resulting widespread transmission, Secondly, the second wave of SARS-Cov-2 transmission was confined to the State of Victoria, particularly to the greater Melbourne area, and ongoing travel restrictions prevented introduction of further infections. This has resulted in the effective eradication of the virus, by early November 2020 [7].A further limitation of our study is the use of daily diagnosed case numbers as a surrogate for coronavirus transmission occurring between 5 to 15 days earlier, an approximate propagation time period from date of infection to symptom emergence, time to be tested, and the return of results. Diagnosed case data has a shorter propagation delay than daily hospitalisation and mortality data, and so gives an earlier indication of increasing levels of transmission, and can act as a trigger to increase social distancing measures, as described above. However, this use of case data suffers from the need to make assumptions on the percentage of the population who are asymptomatic following infection, and the percentage of symptomatic individuals who attend testing facilities. In this study we assumed that 35% of those infected were asymptomatic, and that approximately half of the remainder were diagnosed. COVID-19 hospitalisation data may act as a more accurate snapshot of previous rates of transmission, but with a longer propagation delay from time of infection.The effect of social distancing measures on transmission rates was modelled directly, by reducing person-to-person contact in schools, workplaces and the wider community. These measures assumed that household contact remained. Case isolation was modelled by stopping movement of diagnosed cases out-with the home, allowing for a certain percentage of non-compliance. We assumed 70% compliance by adults and 100% for children, in the absence of published data sources. Availability of contact pattern survey data during the pandemic may have improved the fidelity of our model, and there is a hope that such data will be obtained and available for future pandemic situations.In the absence of prospective testing, policy makers rely on diagnosed case, hospitalization and mortality data to inform decision making. All three metrics have inherent (and increasing) time lags; between date of infection and becoming infectious, and the possibility of being diagnosed, hospitalized or dying, with case data having the shortest ""propagation delay"".This study used a discrete COVID-19 second wave in Australia to demonstrate how exponentially increasing diagnosed case numbers, numbers that doubled every 7 to 10 days, could have better predicted the need for a significantly earlier activation of lockdown measures. Using daily case data as a lockdown ""trigger"" reinforces the need for a comprehensive and rapid testing program, as described in a related study of lockdown and exit strategies in France [10, 32] . As of early November 2020, many countries worldwide still lack highly effective testing and contact tracing systems, so limiting their ability to gain early warnings of a rapid growth in case numbers, and respond as indicated in this study.A significant challenge for many countries facing second waves of COVID-19 cases is how to balance the negative effect which lockdown measures have on an economy, against the health of the population. It is clear there is a hesitancy by decision makers to introduce robust social distancing measures, as evidenced by the step-by-step approach adopted by the Government of Victoria, Australia, and evaluated in this study. This hesitancy is understandable. Long-duration school closure impacts education outcomes, particularly among those from low socio-economic backgrounds. Closure of cafes, restaurants and bars results in under-employment of young adults, and has a knock-on effect on the economy. Closure of service and transport industries results in increased unemployment, with these measures and home isolation impacting on the mental health of those affected.","Australia","abstract","2020-11-18","11"

The sudden adoption of lockdown measures changed our social behavior and support networks overnight. Older adults are the most at-risk group for COVID-19 because its mortality risk increases with age, particularly in those with chronic conditions [1] . In New Zealand, as of the end of September 2020, 25 people had died of COVID-19; most of them are older adults. The lockdown measure urged adults aged 70 years old and above to avoid social contact and stay home. Such drastic measures can have many direct and indirect effects on the health and psychosocial well-being in the elderly. For example, older adults who were previously mobile but are now housebound are at risk of developing frailty [2] . Furthermore, the World Health Organization suggested that older adults in isolation might become more anxious, angry, stressed, agitated and withdrawn during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak or while in isolation [3] .Some older adults in self-isolation can also become lonely if they live alone and/or cannot access their usual community programmes and support [1, 4] . Loneliness is a serious public health concern. It is a well-recognized risk factor for premature mortality, and poor physical and psychological wellbeing [5] [6] [7] [8] . For example, previous studies have demonstrated that loneliness in older age is associated with reduced quality of life [9] , higher rates of adverse health outcomes and higher mortality rates [6] . Moreover, social isolation possesses a premature mortality risk similar to the risk associated with maintaining an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and smoking [6] . It has been suggested that the impact of even short-term social distancing measures merits further study in populations where there is an existing high rate of loneliness and isolation [10] .Loneliness is relatively common in our community. Two recent studies found that one in five older New Zealanders assessed with the interRAI Home Care (interRAI-HC) assessment reported feelings of loneliness [11, 12] , which is nearly twice the rate (11%) in the general older population [13] . For those interRAI subjects who were lonely, 27% had significant depressive symptoms and more than half (56%) stated poor or fair self-rated health [11] .interRAI-HC is a standardised geriatric assessment tool developed by health researchers in over 30 countries. New Zealand is the first country in the world to implement a mandated interRAI-HC for all people assessed for publicly funded home support services and aged residential care. Health professionals in the 20 District Health Boards (DHBs) use interRAI-HC to help determine which level of support older adults living in the community need. There were 36,000 interRAI-HC assessments completed in 2018/ 19 [14] , while 10 and 40% of all New Zealanders aged 65 years and 85 years respectively have had an interRAI-HC during the same period. interRAI-HC contains information on about 250 demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors, which can be used to support care planning, resource allocation, quality measurement, and outcome evaluation [15] . It takes up to one and a half hours to complete an interRAI-HC assessment face-to-face in a person's home. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, interRAI New Zealand advised DHBs that they could use a shorter version of assessment, interRAI Contact Assessment, in place of interRAI-HC, between 25th March to 30th June 2020. The shorter version can be completed in 20 min over the telephone and allowed the assessment of patients urgently, reliably and efficiently.Older adults assessed for home support services and aged residential care typically have physical illness and/ or functional impairment [16] . Functional limitation is one of the main aetiological factors for loneliness in older adults [17] [18] [19] . Given the pre-existing high rates of loneliness, depression and poor/fair self-rated health in the interRAI population [11] , we hypothesise that this population is at-risk of experiencing further decline in their health and psychosocial well-being as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and self-isolation. The aims of this study are to (1) track the impact of COVID-19 on self-reported mood, self-rated health, other health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization of people who have an interRAI assessment during the first year of COVID-19; (2) compare these indicators with the same indicators in people who had an interRAI assessment in the year before COVID-19; and (3) report these indicators publicly as soon as data analysis is completed every 3 months.The interRAI COVID-19 Study (iCoS) is an observational longitudinal study of routinely collected national health information.interRAI data collection and data access interRAI data are collected by trained interRAI assessors working in DHBs and approved community agencies that provide home support services. interRAI assessments are usually completed using a laptop computer, providing immediate outcomes at the time of assessment. There is a national competency framework that supports interRAI assessment and provides quality assurance for interRAI assessment. interRAI assessors must be clinically registered and signed off as competent to use the instruments by interRAI New Zealand. inter-RAI assessment competency is achieved by participating in training that involves a mixture of knowledge and skills, including completing real life assessments, passing an evaluation and achieving an acceptable quality review outcome. One of the competency standards is to 'accurately record assessment information' whereby an inter-RAI assessor uses multiple sources of information for example referral notes, person interview, observation, discussion with family or carers or health professionals to gain accurate information. The item domains of the interRAI Home Care version have been shown to have good inter-rater reliability [20] .interRAI data are entered in real-time to the Technical Advisory Services (TAS) data warehouse. Based on the 2018/19 figures, we estimate there are 9000 interRAI assessments per quarter (Fig. 1 ). We will compare the four post-lockdown quarters with the respective prelockdown quarters.Primary and secondary outcomes interRAI data will be de-identified and analysed for each of the quarters shown in Fig. 1 . The primary outcomes are self-reported mood (feeling sad, depressed or hopeless, 0 = no, 1 = yes) and self-rated health (0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor). We will also analyse sociodemographics, other secondary health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization. Table 1 shows a summary of these variables and the re-coding performed to allow some direct comparison between both versions of interRAI assessments (Home Care and Contact Assessment) in the pre-and post-lockdown periods.The primary outcomes analysis Initially, we will conduct descriptive statistics for primary outcomes and other indicators for each of the eight quarters (−Q4, −Q3, −Q2, −Q1, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) in Fig. 1 . For example, rates of depressed/hopeless mood and fair/poor self-rated health. This analysis will describe the study sample and the distribution of explanatory variables to inform multivariate analysis strategies.To have comparable groups, we will adjust for confounders or modifiers such as demographic characteristics and factors associated with the assessment process using weights or propensity score matching methods.Next, we will compare the pre-lockdown quarters with the post-lockdown quarters (−Q4 vs Q1, −Q3 vs Q2, −Q2 vs Q3, −Q1 vs Q4) by using regression models to control for the effect of demographic variables, physical or clinical factors, social indicators, lifestyle factors, or time of assessment. These factors will be incorporated in the model to test for significance.The impact of COVID-19 measures on self-reported depressed mood (yes/no) will be evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Self-rated health (0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor) is an ordinal outcome and will be evaluated using ordinal logistic regression. If propensity score matching methods are used, we would use conditional logistic regression approaches. A stepwise selection of predictors will be used for inclusion in the model. Significant factors will be allowed to stay in the final model at p-value of less or equals to 0.05. Estimation approaches used for the regression models mentioned will be mixed models and generalized estimating equations (GEE). These approaches enable us to incorporate repeated measures in the analysis.The fit and the validity of the models will be done by evaluating the deviance via goodness of fit tests. Multicollinearity will be tested using the variance inflation factor (VIF), which assesses how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if predictors are correlated. A VIF between 5 and 10 indicates high correlation that may be problematic. R Statistical Software will be used for all analyses.We will perform additional data analysis for the following at-risk subgroups: living alone, cognitive difficulty and the older age group (age 80+).We will develop and publish an interactive report of key health and psychosocial indicators. The report will be publicly available as soon as data analysis is completed for each quarter in the 12-month post-lockdown period. TAS has existing infrastructure using Microsoft Power BI Service to publish interactive reports and dashboards such as interRAI reports available online at https://www. interrai.co.nz/data-and-reporting/. Power BI is a group of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to transform unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights [21] . The objectives of this Power BI report are to (i) provide interactive descriptive analysis to monitor self-reported mood, self-rated health, other health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization of the interRAI population every 3 months in the first year of COVID-19, and (2) allow pre-and post-COVID-19 comparative analyses of selected indicators. The research team will work with a TAS web designer and data visualization specialist to report our results on the interRAI New Zealand website.There has been a call for urgent action to mitigate the physical and mental health consequences of COVID-19 self-isolation in older adults [4] . The 'flattening the curve' approach adopted by the New Zealand Government, including strict border control and quarantine was successful in practically controlling community transmission of COVID-19. The COVID-19 alert system implemented in New Zealand (Level 2 to 4) advises highrisk people to remain at home (e.g. those over 70 or those with other existing medical conditions). However, by easing some of these measures, many parts of the world are experiencing a second or third wave of COVID-19. Without this rapid translation of routinely collected national interRAI data, the health and psychosocial well-being of vulnerable older New Zealanders might be left un-monitored. If COVID-19 indeed has an impact on their health and psychosocial well-being, the New Zealand public health and social services and nongovernment organizations can ramp up their resources to address and minimize these problems at a national and/or community level as soon as our quarterly inter-RAI indicators become available. These rapid and effective responses could prevent further deterioration of the health of older New Zealanders, and decrease the impact on New Zealand health services. For example, evidencebased interventions to maximize mobility in older adults in isolation have been suggested [2] , along with the use of a range of digital technologies for social engagement and measures to facilitate physical activity and nutrition [4, 22] . Physical illness, social isolation, and loneliness are well-recognised risk factors for late-life suicidal behaviour [23] , especially during pandemic outbreaks [24] . For example, the rates of suicide among older adults increased in 2003 during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong [24] . The effects of it lasted for the following years, since it was found that the suicide rates did not return to preepidemic rates [25] . In New Zealand, suicide rates of older men aged 85 years and above between 2011 and 2019 were the second highest amongst all age groups [26] . The social isolation and loneliness to which older adults are exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand could have important implications in increasing the already high suicide rates. interRAI includes information on self-rated health and depressed mood, which are two of the indicators we will report on. Many of the evidence-based late-life suicide prevention programmes target better screening and treatment of depression [27] .This study is a collaboration between the University of Auckland, interRAI New Zealand and TAS. interRAI New Zealand and TAS have expertise in interRAI data retrieval, analysis and dynamic reporting including web designing and data visualisation. interRAI Contact Assessment, a shorter version of interRAI-HC, replaced interRAI-HC in the first 3 months of the Level 4 lockdown in New Zealand. As shown in Table 1 , some health indicators are not routinely collected by the inter-RAI Contact Assessment and this will result in missing data in the first post-lockdown quarter. Self-report mood and self-rated health are chosen as the two primary outcomes because they are included in both versions of interRAI assessments, which allows some direct comparison in the pre-and post-lockdown periods. This study will generate a large health dataset that could be used to test other hypotheses. There is also an opportunity to link this dataset to other administrative datasets such as the Ministry of Health's National Minimum Dataset (NMDS) for public and private hospital discharge information and Mortality Dataset for underlying causes of all registered deaths.

A critical step in extinguishing the pandemic will be vaccination a high proportion of the population in the context of increasing misinformation, vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in science. In this paper we present evidence from a large nationally representative survey of vaccination intentions to a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. We document the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behaviour correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. We focus on lower and higher levels of hesitancy and resistance to vaccination, as tailored public health information campaigns may well be more effective for those who are less hesitant.Herd immunity of populations is a product of several factors, the infectivity of the coronavirus (R0 = 3.1, Yadav & Yadav, 2020) , the effectiveness of the vaccine and the percentage of the population vaccinated. Estimates of infectivity of the coronavirus suggest that with a 100 per cent effective vaccine, 67 per cent of the population needs to be vaccinated (Randolph & Barreiro, 2020) but that vaccination coverage needed varies by infectivity (55 per cent when R0 = 2.2 to 82 per cent when R0 =5.7 (Sanche et al., 2020) . Simulations suggest that solely relying on a vaccine to extinguish a COVID-19 epidemic would require vaccination coverage of 100 per cent with vaccine effectiveness of 60 per cent (Bartsch et al., 2020) . For 80 per cent effectiveness of a vaccine, coverage of 75 per cent of the population would be required (Bartsch et al., 2020) . Assuming that initial vaccines are less than 80 per cent effective (flu has been found to have an average effectiveness of 67 per cent, Osterholm et al., 2012) then very high vaccination rates are needed to ensure eradication or control of the coronavirus in populations.Research to date suggests that COVID-19 vaccination intentions vary substantially between countries (e.g. Neumann et al., 2020) . Vaccine hesitancy (being unsure about getting a vaccine) usually accounts for a more substantial share of the population who will not be vaccinated than vaccine resistance (those who object to vaccines). For instance, in the United States 21 per cent were probably willing and 31 per cent were not willing to have the COVID-19 vaccine (Reiter, Pennell, & Katz, 2020) while nationally representative surveys in the United Kingdom reported 25-27 per cent were hesitant, and 6-9 per cent resistant (Murphy et al., 2020; Sherman et al., 2020) and in Canada reported 19 per cent somewhat likely, 9 per cent did not know and 14 per cent unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available (Frank & Arim, 2020) . A cross-national representative survey of over 7,000 participants in seven European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK) reported that across these countries 19 per cent were hesitant (not sure) and 7 per cent would not get vaccinated (Neumann et al., 2020) . However there was substantial variation between countries with vaccine hesitancy 12-28 per cent while resistance ranged from 5-10 per cent (Neumann et al., 2020) . In Australia vaccine hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine has been reported at 9 per cent and vaccine resistance 5 per cent however this evidence was from a non-representative online survey (Dodd et al., 2020) . suggested governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy 'hotspots' based on social and behavioural insights (Hickler, Guirguis & Obregon, 2015) . Therefore, nationally representative information is important for an agile response to COVID-19 vaccination. Using a representative longitudinal survey of over 3000 participants from Australia we examine the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behaviour correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. We distinguish between those who may get the vaccine but are not sure (hesitant) from those who will definitely get the vaccine because they are usually a large percentage of the population, and unlike vaccine resistant individuals, are likely to be convinced about public health messaging and information about vaccine safety (Dubé, Vivion & MacDonald, 2015) . We also examine those who will not get the vaccine (resistant). Given the Australian government has indicated that the COVID-19 vaccine would be provided free to the population, consistent with previous research on vaccine hesitancy (Murphy et al., 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020) we hypothesise that confidence in government and science, attitudes towards COVID-19 and adherence with public health messages, conservative and authoritarian political attitudes will be more important than demographic characteristics (Murphy et al., 2020; Sherman et al., 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020) . We also test whether downloading the COVID-Safe app was related to vaccine hesitancy or resistance.The remainder of the paper is as follows, Section 2 outlines the methodology including the study design and participants, survey questions and statistical analyses. Section 3 shows the results and Section 4 discusses the results in the context of previous research and their implications.The primary source of data for this paper is the August ANUpoll, which collected data from 3,061 respondents aged 18 years and over across all eight States/Territories in Australia, and is weighted to have a similar distribution to the Australian population across key demographic and geographic variables. Data for the vast majority of respondents was collected online (94.1 per cent), with a small proportion of respondents enumerated over the phone. A limited number of telephone respondents (17 individuals) completed the survey on the first day of data collection, with a little under half of respondents (1,222) completing the survey on the 11 th or 12th of August.The contact methodology for offline Life in Australia™ members was an initial SMS (where available), followed by an extended call-cycle over a two-week period. A reminder SMS was also sent in the second week of fieldwork. Taking into account recruitment to the panel, the cumulative response rate for the most recent survey is 7.8 per cent, a slight decline from previous waves of data collection in 2020. Unless otherwise stated, data in the paper is weighted to population benchmarks. For Life in Australia™, the approach for deriving weights generally consists of the following steps:1. Compute a base weight for each respondent as the product of two weights: a. Their enrolment weight, accounting for the initial chances of selection and subsequent post-stratification to key demographic benchmarks b. Their response propensity weight, estimated from enrolment information available for both respondents and non-respondents to the present wave.Adjust the base weights so that they satisfy the latest population benchmarks for several demographic characteristics.We make use of a limited amount of longitudinal data in this paper. Of those who completed the August 2020 wave of data collection, 2,916 individuals (95.3 per cent) also completed the May 2020 ANUpoll, 2,833 individuals (92.6 per cent) also completed the April 2020 ANUpoll, 2,828 individuals (92.4 per cent) also completed the February 2020 Life in Australia TM survey i , and finally, 2,790 individuals (91.1 per cent) also completed the January 2020 ANUpoll (during the height of the Black Summer Bushfire crisis). Consistent with previous literature on vaccine acceptability, we define those who are definitely not going to get the vaccine as vaccine resistant (Murphy et al., 2020) . High levels of hesitancy was defined as those who would probably not get vaccinated while low levels of vaccinated was categorised as low levels of hesitancy because of the uncertainty given that the decision was about a vaccine would be safe and effective (Murphy et al., 2020) .Detailed descriptions of independent variables included in the analyses are provided in the Appendix. Demographic variables included sex, age, indigenous status, born overseas (English speak or non-English speaking country), speaks a language other than English at home, education, socio-economic status of the area, capital or noncapital city, employed, and household income. The state of Victoria was experiencing an outbreak in August 2020 marked by a score of 79.7 on COVID-19 Stringency index compared to 52.3 and we identified participants living in Victoria through a dummy variable (Hale et al., 2020) . As a point of comparison the COVID-19 Stringency index was 67.1 in the United States and 69.9 in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2020. Health related variables included self-rated health and disability or chronic illness. COVID-19 related variables included been tested for COVID-19, worried about yourself or family or friends contracting COVID-19, extent of social distancing behavior, downloaded the COVID-Safe app and considering that there was too much worry about COVID-19. Political, and social attitudes included voting intentions, populism, authoritarianism, religiosity, attitudes towards immigration, social trust, altruism, confidence in Federal government, state government or hospital and health system.This research was supported by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).Almost three-in-five Australians (58.5 per cent) would definitely get the vaccine. We divided vaccine hesitancy into two levels. Low levels of vaccine hesitancy were those who indicated they were likely to get the vaccine but not certain (28.7 per cent) and high levels of vaccine hesitancy those who will probably not get the vaccine (7.2 per cent). We defined those who were resistant as those who indicated that they were definitely not going to get the vaccine (5.5. per cent).Descriptive statistics for covariates in the statistical modelling can be found in the Appendix. Table 1 shows the marginal effects from model 1, which included demographic, socioeconomic and geographic variables.Females were less likely than males to intend to get the vaccine, and more likely to be hesitant and resistant. Those who were older (55-64, 65-74 and those over 75 years) were less likely to be resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated when it became available than those aged 35-44 years old. Compared to those had Year 12 only, those with an undergraduate or postgraduate university degree were less likely to be resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to be vaccinated.Health and disability status were not associated with vaccine intentions (model 2, see Appendix).In model 3 COVID-related variables were included as well as demographic variables (see Appendix). Contrary to other research on the likelihood of getting vaccinated to COVID-19 (Thunstrom et al., 2020) individual concerns or concerns about relatives or friends contracting COVID-19 were not related to vaccination intentions. Being tested for coronavirus was also not related to vaccination intentions.People who reported greater levels of social distancing behaviour were less likely to be resistant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Similarly, those that had downloaded the COVID-Safe App were less likely to be resistant (-3.0 percentage points lower) or hesitant (high: -2.7 percentage points and low: -5.1 percentage points) and more likely to intend to get vaccinated (+10.8 percentage points). Those who thought too much fuss had been made about COVID-19 were more likely to be resistant (8.1 percentage points) or have high levels of hesitancy (4.2 percentage points) and less likely to intend to get vaccinated (-14.9 percentage points less likely).In Model 4 we added political and social attitudes to demographic characteristics (see Appendix). There were no statistically significant differences by levels of social trust, altruism or support for authoritarianism. Compared to those who voted for the Coalition, those who voted for Labor were less likely to be resistant (-1.6%, p<0.10), hesitant (high: -1.5%; low: -3.2%) and more likely to intend to get vaccinated (6.3%, p = 0.05).The final model included statistically significant variables from models 2 to 4 and demographic variables (Table 2) . Females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated while those aged 55 and over were more likely to intend get vaccinated. Those with higher household income were less likely to be resistant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Differences by levels of education observed in model 1 were explained by other variables. Neighbourhood differences by socio-economic index for areas were evident with those living in the most disadvantaged area more likely to be resistant or hesitant (at high levels) and less likely to intend to get vaccinated.People exercising greater levels of social distancing were less likely to be resistant and more likely to be vaccinated. Those who downloaded the COVID-Safe App were less likely to be resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Those who reported too much fuss had been made about COVID-19 were still more likely to be resistant or hesitant and less likely to intend to get vaccinated.Those who had confidence in their state or territory government or confident in their hospitals and health system were less likely to be resistant or hesitant (at high or low levels) and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. People who were more supportive of migration were more likely to get vaccinated.In August 2020 36 per cent of Australians are hesitant and 6 per cent resistant to being vaccinated with a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 if one was available. Given previous research suggests that the factors associated with vaccine resistance might be different to vaccine hesitancy, we examined demographic, health, COVID-19 related health behaviour and attitudes, and political and social attitudinal correlates.Many factors were associated with vaccine resistance and hesitancy. Consistent with previous research, females, those with lower levels of household income and living in disadvantaged areas were associated with increased likelihood of vaccine resistance or hesitancy (Murphy et al., 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020) . However, in contrast to previous research, younger people were not less likely to intend to get vaccinated than those aged 35-44 years.(a one standard deviation increase). Given that many governments have tracking surveys about social distancing, this information could be used to support targeted campaigns to encourage vaccination in areas of low social distancing.Consistent with other studies of COVID-19 several variables that could be considered associated with broader societal dissatisfaction and anti-establishment sentiments were also associated with vaccine resistance or hesitancy. Specifically in this study, attitudes about too much fuss being made about COVID-19, lack of confidence in state or territory government, and having more populist sentiments (Murphy et al., 2020; Rozbroj Lyons & Lucke, 2019) . Other studies have also independently reported that religious beliefs associated with declining a COVID-19 vaccine (Thunstrom et al., 2020). For many with low levels of hesitancy, providing information about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine will be critical as other studies have highlight this as important hesitancy (Thunstrom et al., 2020). Our analyses suggest that those with resistance or hesitancy are likely to lack trust in those providing health services (e.g. state governments or health systems) and therefore the misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine that will occur may be even more effective for these groups. Pre-emptively using cognitive inoculation techniques and pre-bunking techniques (Habersaat et al., 2020) to actively work against the likely misinformation that will be generated in the development and preparation phase of a vaccine for COVID-19 will be important but probably requires more targeted and nuanced public health messages by trusted members of the community (e.g. community or religious leaders).Those with higher vaccine resistance or hesitancy are more likely to have a set of strongly held beliefs, a lack of trust in those responsible for health (state or territory government and hospitals or health systems) and lower levels of compliance with public health advice for COVID-19 (e.g. lower levels of social distancing, not downloading the COVID-Safe App). If large scale surveys collect information on the extent of compliance with health advice, further nuanced targeting could be employed. Beyond more sophisticated and nuanced public health messaging, it should be noted that a systematic review of research on compulsory vaccination policies suggests that the majority of the population supports these programs (Gualano, Olivero, Voglino et al., 2019) . However, none of the studies in the systematic review were conducted during a pandemic where civil liberties were restricted due to lockdowns (Gualano et al., 2019) so it is unclear whether public sentiment would be different during the current pandemic.While we used a rich set of variables to predict vaccine intentions some factors were not collected in our surveys. In particular, we did not collect information about concerns about vaccine safety which may be important determinant of vaccine hesitancy and may also explain why females were more likely to be hesitant or resistant than males. Another robust correlate in other studies of vaccine intentions is previous vaccination such as for influenza (Thunstrom et al., 2020) . Vaccine safety and public discourse will likely be particularly important as media and public scrutiny of vaccine trials is unprecedented for COVID-19 vaccines and further monitoring of public sentiment (Murphy et al., 2020) .In conclusion, given that over 75 per cent of the population are likely to need to be vaccinated with a highly effective vaccine to extinguish the epidemic (Bartsch et al., 2020) our findings that only 59 per cent of Australians will definitely get vaccinated is sobering and suggests that as noted by WHO (Hickler et al., 2020) , proactive measures need to be adopted by countries to encourage vaccination in the community. Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a further significant proportion of the population, and can be addressed by public health messaging. However for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs that are the likely drivers of vaccination intentions, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.Demographic variables included sex, age (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75 years or more), indigenous status, education (less than Year 12, Year 12, above Year 12 but below a bachelor's degree and bachelor's degree or above), born overseas (English speak or non-English speaking country), speaks a language other than English at home, capital or non-capital city, and employment status (employed, not employed). Continuous household income was estimated based on an interval regression model using responses to a categorical income question (with ten possible income categories). Socio-economic status of the area: Socio-economic indexes for areas (SEIFA) quintiles from most disadvantaged to most advantage. SEIFA was measured using the Index of Relative Social Advantage or Disadvantage (ABS, 2016).Health related variables included self-rated health and disability or chronic illness. Self-rated health was measured using ""How is your health in general? Would you say it is…?"" with participants reporting very good, good, fair, bad or very bad. Disability or chronic illness was measured using an item from the European Social Survey ""Are you hampered in your daily activities in any way by any longstanding illness, or disability, infirmity, or mental health problem?"" Participants reported ""Yes, a lot"", ""Yes, to some extent"" or ""No"".Social distancing: Participants were asked whether they did any of the following in the past week: avoid crowded places, avoid public places, keep your distance from others (1.5 metres), quarantine yourself if you have symptoms, wore a face mask indoors when in a public place, and wore a mask outdoors when in a public place. These variables were highly correlated with each other, and were combined using principal components analysis to create a COVID-19 behaviour index that has been scaled to have mean of zero and standard deviation of one.Tested for COVID-19 was measured by the whether participants reported that they had been tested by a doctor or nurse for COVID-19.Concerns about COVID-19 was measured by ""You felt anxious or worried for the safety of yourself, close family members or friends, due to COVID-19"".Scepticism about the COVID-19 was captured by asking participants the extent to which they agreed with the following statement ""There has been too much unnecessary worry about the COVID-19 outbreak"" (strongly agree to strongly disagree).COVIDSafe app. The Australian Federal Government developed the COVIDSafe app to help state and territory health officials to quickly contact people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. However, some people have expressed concern about the security of the COVIDSafe app and whether it will be used for mass surveillance so therefore we asked a question about the whether participants had downloaded the app. We asked ""Have you installed the COVIDSafe app on your phone?"", participants could respond yes or no.Religiosity was measured using the following item from the European Social Survey ""Regardless of whether you belong to a particular religion, how religious would you say you are?"" on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 10 (Very) asked in February 2020. Support for migration was measured by asking ""Is Australia made a worse or a better place to live by people coming to live here from other countries?"" on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 10 (Very). Participants were asked this item in February 2020 and is taken from the European Social Survey.Social trust was measured using the following questions ""Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?"", ""Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?"", and ""Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?"". For each item participants were asked to rate these items on a scale of 0 to 10 and for our analyses we averaged ratings on these three items.Confidence in the Federal, state government and hospitals and the health system was rated by each participant (1: a great deal, 2: quite a lot, 3: not very much, 4: none at all).Populism was measured using items from the June 2019 Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES): ""What people call compromise in politics is really just selling out on one's principles"", ""Most politicians do not care about the people"", ""Politicians are the main problem in Australia"", ""The people, and not politicians, should make our most important policy decisions"", and ""Most politicians care only about the interests of the rich and powerful"" (reversed). Respondents were given five options: 1. Strongly agree; 2. Somewhat agree; 3. Neither agree nor disagree; 4. Somewhat disagree; and 5. Strongly disagree and items were added to form an index.Authoritarianism was asked in February 2020 using the following item from the European Social Survey: ""Having a strong leader in government is good for Australia even if the leader bends the rules to get things done"". Participants were asked to rate strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree.Notes: Descriptive statistics from Ordered probit model.

Because there is no known treatment for this virus, we are being asked to observe social distancing, wash our hands frequently, and curtail our activities with those outside our household. Most businesses that include person-to-person contact have been closed.Despite this grave situation, some chiropractors have advocated a misbelief that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) or ""adjustments"" can boost immunity and thus should be offered as a preventive measure for viral infections. The World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC) noted this development on March 17th 2020 and refuted this in a public statement: ""… .there is no credible scientific evidence to support this notion and to suggest otherwise is potentially dangerous to public health"" [2] . Nevertheless, some chiropractors continue promoting misinformation on social media putting the chiropractic profession at odds with scientific evidence.Evidence-based chiropractic care provides management of musculoskeletal disorders, offering an array of clinical services for a limited range of conditions [3, 4] . The literature demonstrates the deleterious impact of musculoskeletal disorders world-wide [5] [6] [7] . The evidence based approach to the delivery of chiropractic services has made it possible for the chiropractic profession to contribute to health care as an accountable profession, rooted in science, increasingly steeped in academia, and continuously seeking to improve the efficacy and safety of the clinical services it provides [4] [5] [6] . This is precisely the role ascribed to chiropractors by the general public [8] . The relevance of the chiropractic profession in this context is not in question.However, some ""traditional""(according to the Oxford dictionary: ""being part of the beliefs, customs or way of life of a particular group of people, that have not changed for a long time"" [9] ) chiropractors uphold the historical belief that adjustments can correct spinal lesions (subluxations) [10, 11] , responsible for almost all disease [12] , and that adjustments will improve the brain-bodyenvironment communication [13] . Recent studies suggest that approximately 20% of chiropractors have this focus [14, 15] . Many of their claims relate to relatively benign conditions [16, 17] or ones where a musculoskeletal origin is at least possible [18, 19] .The issue of making false claims by chiropractors has previously been raised as a matter of concern both from outside the profession [20] and from within [21] . While inappropriate claims made by ""traditional"" chiropractors are never in the public's interest, the specific claims of boosting immunity during the COVID-19 crisis presents a fundamentally different level of risk of harm to patients and public health. Misinformation about adjustments and immunity taints public understanding of viral prevention, undermines the coordinated efforts of health authorities, and has become a cause for concern among researchers and public health authorities [22, 23] .Statements related to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that the chiropractic profession includes two distinct groups that have little in common and that mainstream chiropractors can no longer accept and protect the ""traditional"" fringe, because it presents a danger to the public [24] .Thus, the purpose of our article is to explore scientifically unsubstantiated statements by ""traditional"" chiropractors to stimulate discussion and address any tolerance shown by mainstream chiropractors and regulators. Thereafter, we discuss where the responsibility lies for stopping this type of misinformation.Over an 11-day period between 16 March and 26 March 2020, a group of 19 chiropractors searched social media and the internet for instances of chiropractors making claims related to immunity, chiropractic care and COVID-19. The material was sent around to colleagues, and the search snowballed from there, i.e. every post we came across led to a search to ""dig further"" for other types of misinformation. All in turn contacted their own professional networks with the intention of collecting as many different examples as possible in order to document which deleterious statements/claims were made concerning adjustments and the COVID-19 pandemic. Screenshots were taken in each case and the material was categorized according to claim and argument. Thus, we did not systematically search social media or the internet and kept no record of how many sites we examined.Material from individual chiropractors and chiropractic clinics written in English, French, Swedish, Danish or Norwegian were gathered over a period of 11 days, after which saturation of statements and arguments was achieved. However, an extra statement was brought to our attention on April 10th. The examples provided herein are presented without identifying information, but screenshots and dates of capture are kept on record.Thereafter, websites of all the Councils on Chiropractic Education (CCE), some CCE-accredited chiropractic teaching institutions, some chiropractic associations and regulatory boards were searched. These were assessed for unsubstantiated claims regarding COVID-19 and immunity boosting through adjustments. For convenience reasons, we limited this search to Europe, North America, South Africa, and Australia.In this convenience sample, 99 relevant statements were identified from individual chiropractors and chiropractic practices, as posted on social media. An overview of the origins (platforms and countries) for these posts is presented in Fig. 1 . However, this figure should not be construed as an estimate of prevalence, which is essentially unknown. It reflects the highly selective results of specific online searches and social media surfing in an eleven-day time period.It should be noted, however, that the searches did not focus on general statements about COVID-19 but rather collected inappropriate or scientifically inaccurate statements about chiropractic, i.e. it's supposed effect on immune function and, in particular, it's supposed effect on COVID-19. Thus, all retained posts were in direct opposition to the WFC statement concerning COVID-19 [2] . Therefore, this work does not intend to provide information on the prevalence of messages that were opposed to the WHO guidelines [25] . Rather, it provides a series of cases of unsubstantiated claims.The common element of the collected media statements is that adjustments boost the immune system. About half did not mention any public health intervention. However, the other half also mentioned factors such as hygiene, sleep, and stress management. Examples of such claims are provided in Fig. 2 [26] .Many claims (28% of the statements) could be traced directly to the more than 100-year old chiropractic concepts of the healthy spine and its purported effect on general health, including immune function (e.g. Figure 3 ) [27] . We are not aware of any scientific clinical evidence to support such beliefs.The type and quality of ""evidence"" provided to support these statements were not sufficient to validate the claims. Figure 4 [28] shows an example of an explicit reference to a specific scientific article. In this reference, the clinical meaning of the study's results is not known, and, in fact, the article does not provide evidence that adjustments enhance or confer immunity, as previously summarized in a rapid review from the WFC [29] .The most extraordinary claim that we found (17% of the statements that purported to be supported by evidence), was that mortality related to the Spanish flu epidemic after World War I was reduced among individuals who consulted chiropractors. According to the chiropractors who cited this study, patients treated with adjustments were less likely to die from the influenza than those treated by medical doctors. One example from a chiropractor's website is shown in Fig. 5 [30]. However, the evidence for this claim seems to be an article from the January 1920 Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, reprinted in the May 2013 edition [31] . This paper claimed that patients with influenza or pneumonia attended by osteopaths died at 1/40th the rate of those attended by medical doctors. The mortality estimates for patients receiving medical care were collated using information obtained from 148 state and city health commissioners in the United States. Osteopathic mortality estimates were generated using self-reported data from 2445 members of the American Osteopathic Association. Anecdotal work with spurious comparison of blatantly incomparable groups would not be published in a modern reputable journal. Misquoting and misinterpreting this biased information to the public during a pandemic is irresponsible.A common finding (29% of the statements ""supported by evidence"") was that several claims referred to unspecified evidence by stating ""research shows"" or ""evidence shows"" (Fig. 6 ) [32] . To our knowledge no such generally acceptable and clinically relevant research exists to support such statements. It would be helpful if the chiropractors who make such claims would provide references for this anecdotal information. One chiropractor boldly stated that ""experience"" shows that chiropractic treatment has a positive effect on the immune system. This was supported by patient testimonials. Testimonials are questioned as a marketing tool in many areas of medicine [20, 33, 34] , as it is not possible to confirm such claims empirically and may lead readers to disregard valid health information [35] . Further, because of their propensity to mislead, testimonial use by health care providers, including chiropractors, contravenes advertising laws in some jurisdictions [20] .Other claims (4%) questioned undisputed and established science, such as the germ theory, and did not use ""evidence"" to back their claims. An example is shown in Fig. 7 [36] .A few (12%) of the statements were not accompanied by any argument at all as seen in Fig. 8 [37].One statement concerned the risk to the unborn child, resulting from prenatal stress caused by COVID-19. A chiropractor claimed that pregnant women should get chiropractic care in order to minimize consequences on the baby (Fig. 9) [38]. To our knowledge, there is no compelling clinically relevant evidence to support such a statement.Information was collected from the websites of all chiropractic regulatory agencies in the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand, and Australia. None advocated chiropractic care to improve immunity or to treat this viral disorder. Most had information from local health authorities concerning COVID-19, pertaining to washing hands, disinfecting equipment, and/or closing down practises. In Table 1 , the statements are listed from the six regulators that specifically state that they support the WFC statement on chiropractic and immunity. The General Council on Chiropractic in the UK threatens regulatory action if chiropractors breach the requirements of the chiropractic code of practice. The regulatory boards of Minnesota and West Virginia both state that claiming chiropractic care is beneficial to prevent or treat COVID-19 is in violation of state statue pertaining Fig. 4 An example of referring claims that chiropractic adjustment boosts the immune system to a specific scientific paper to the scope of practice and advertising and the Chiropractic Board of Australia mentions unlawful advertising.Information was collected from all the websites of CCEaccredited chiropractic teaching institutions in North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Europe. At the time of data collection, most institutions had not posted any messages relating to advice on the pandemic. However, those which did, supported the WFC statement. Therefore, we do not further describe their contribution.To explore what chiropractic associations disseminated in terms of information on the pandemic, we also searched the websites and Facebook of chiropractic associations from Europe (some), Australia (both), New Zealand (one), the US (all), and Canada (all), searching for information on the pandemic or the immune system in general.Many national chiropractic associations clearly supported the WFC statement [2] : The American, Canadian, French, Norwegian and Swedish Chiropractic Associations, Chiropractic Australia, the General Chiropractic Council in Britain and the UK Chiropractic Council, as did the US associations in Illinois, Alabama, California, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Texas.A search of the web-pages for the four CCEs (responsible for Europe, Australia, Canada and the US, respectively) and the International umbrella organization (I-CCE), did not reveal the use of inappropriate information relating to chiropractic treatment and viral disorders.Some ""traditional"" chiropractors are making claims that could harm the public. In our opinion, the concept of adjustment-immunity boosting lacks biological There are of course situations where the scientific evidence is lacking and the biological plausibility is disputed, where high-quality randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation may prove relevant. However, infectious disease is not one of them; the risks to the public are too high. Presently there is no generally accepted and clinically relevant evidence that adjustments protect against, nor impact, viral disease. Nevertheless, the ""traditional"" chiropractic approach, which forms the basis for the treatment to improve the immune system, survives among some chiropractors, despite scientific advancements over the last century. Some studies suggest that there has been a reluctance to denounce the ""traditional"" faction of the profession because the majority, middle-of-the-road chiropractors and some of their organisations purposely accommodate all perspectives under the title ""chiropractic"" and avoid internal conflict [39, 40] .The authors of this article, in line with modern-day concepts, assert that contemporary healthcare cannot be based on ideological beliefs and dogmatic contentions. When ""traditional"" chiropractors note the lack of evidence, we have observed that they often respond with a science type cliché: ""absence of evidence is not evidence Fig. 7 An example of claims stating: it is not about the germ, it's about the immune system. This poster has been withdrawn. Not due to misleading information, but because"" it was used outside the practise"" of absence"". This cannot be used as an excuse to discard biological principles, common sense, and critical appraisal. If claims are extraordinary and contrary to other generally accepted existing knowledge, the evidence provided must be especially convincing [41, 42] .Correcting misinformation is particularly important, because misinformation reaches more people and spreads more rapidly than accurate news [43] . This is especially true for health care misinformation [44] , identified by the WHO as ""infodemic"" [45] . However, ""traditional"" chiropractors, who believe in and spread misinformation, seem particularly motivated to reject correction, especially if it poses a threat to important aspects of their cultural identity [46] . Therefore, it would be important to identify the origins of this problem in the chain of responsibilities, from educational institutions to individual clinicians, professional associations, and regulatory bodies. In all professional groups there will be outliers, people who do not fit in with the mainstream. This is probably unavoidable. However, how likely is it that a substantial group of medical practitioners still believe in the practise of bloodletting and still reject the germ theory? In our opinion, we as a profession must take stronger measures to combat the dangerous anti-science sentiment that remains as a small but prominent part of the chiropractic community.Chiropractors should reflect on their personal beliefs and what it means to be a health care professional, entrusted with ensuring public benefit from their services. Those who make unfounded claims breach a fiduciary agreement that allows for professional selfregulation and permits professionals a great deal of autonomy, provided they adhere to the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty of disclosure. For health care professionals, this means that they must put patient interests ahead of their own, stay up to date with current best practises, and fully inform patients of treatment options, including risks/benefits of any given procedure. Chiropractors who put their personal beliefs ahead of evidence or who selectively choose evidence that supports their belief system fail to reach these standards and breach their professional duties, are legally negligent, and do not act in the best interests of their patients.We would argue that the chiropractic teaching institutions are obligated to set the example for best practice by taking public stances on issues such as the present COVID-19 crisis. Teaching institutions, with their staff of highly educated and clinically experienced experts, are sought out for guidance, particularly at times of controversy and crisis [47, 48] . Therefore, they bear a responsibility to act as prominent advocates of science and reason and must emphasize the teaching of evidencebased care and de-emphasize historical beliefs. Most of the institutions that posted information on the COVID-19 pandemic did so in a responsible manner.Four CCEs are tasked with accrediting chiropractic programs within their respective geographical region. However, the standards and processes of these CCEs are not internationally homogeneous and concerns have been raised about some accredited chiropractic programs and the subsequent practice patterns demonstrated by their graduates [12, 13, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Further, some CCEs have created a"" big tent"" approach to their accreditation standards and processes, resulting in all types of understanding of the term chiropractic [21, 22] . This approach can make it difficult to define the practice and scope of chiropractic [34] . It has been argued that some CCEs have failed to wholeheartedly embrace an evidence-based approach to education and practice [35] [36] [37] . For example, only 35% of students in some chiropractic programs agree that immunization is an effective disease prevention and 9% believe that SMT is an effective primary treatment for AIDS [49] . Further, many chiropractic students internationally have difficulty identifying non-indications for SMT [50, 51] .The COVID-19 crisis highlights the need for all CCEs to be agile in times of crisis and adopt the standards of Fig. 9 The claim that effects of COVID-19 stress on the unborn baby may be alleviated by chiropractic care Table 1 A list of statements from 14 chiropractic regulatory boards in the UK, Australia, the US and Canada, which discourage the use of chiropractic care in the prevention and treatment for COVID-19 or to boost immunity in generalWeb-page Statement UK-General Council on Chiropractic www.gcc-uk.org/ It has come to our attention that some chiropractors are claiming or implying in published material that spinal adjustment and/or manipulation may protect patients from contracting COVID-19, boosting the immune system or aiding recovery. The General Council on Chiropractic is clear that there is no credible scientific evidence that supports this and chiropractors must not make such a claim, or link treatment to COVID-19, in any way. Any chiropractors making such claims in any way, or making other unsubstantiated claims, run a very serious risk of being in breach of the requirements set out in the Code and regulatory action will be taken accordingly.Chiropractic Board Australia www.chiropracticboard.gov. au/ Other than sharing health information from authoritative sources, registered health practitioners should not make advertising claims on preventing or protecting patients and health consumers from contracting COVID-19 or accelerating recovery from COVID-19. To do so involves risk to public safety and may be unlawful advertising. For example, we are seeing some advertising claims that spinal adjustment/manipulation, acupuncture and some products confer or boost immunity or enhance recovery from COVID-19 when there is no acceptable evidence in support. in some Canadian provinces, the professional association and the regulatory college exist as one entity mainstream healthcare and place patient welfare at the forefront of their agenda.The groups entrusted with ensuring public safety must take steps to prevent pseudoscientific claims by chiropractors. A recent meta-analytic study suggested the following procedure for correcting misinformation [52] . First, make known the poor credibility of the source of the misinformation. Second, corrections should come from those who created and distributed the misinformation, be made as soon as possible, and come from a credible source [53] .In this search of public media in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia, we discovered many cases of misinformation. Claims of chiropractic treatment improving immunity conflict with the advice from authorities and the scientific consensus. The science referenced by these claims is missing, flawed or has no clinical relevance. Consequently, their claims about clinical effectiveness are spurious at best and misleading at worst. However, our examples cannot be used to make statements about the magnitude of the problem among practitioners as our samples were not intended to be representative. For that reason, we also did not include an analysis of the arguments provided in the various postings. In view of the seriousness of the topic, it would be relevant to conduct a systematic study on a representative sample of public statements, to better understand these issues.Our search illustrates the possible danger to public health of misinformation posted on social media and the internet. This situation provides an opportunity for growth and maturation for the chiropractic profession. We hope that individual chiropractors will reflect on and improve their communication and practices. Further, we hope that the chiropractic teaching institutions, regulators, and professional organisations will always demonstrate responsible leadership in their respective domains by acting to ensure that all chiropractors understand and uphold their fiduciary duties.

The European office of the World Health Organization recently released a COVID-19 and alcohol factsheet [2] outlining risks, including increased susceptibility as alcohol can compromise the immune system. Heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is one of the main complications of COVID-19 [3] . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that any measure of high relative to low alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome [3] . One justification for alcohol being an essential service may have been to protect dependent people who can experience life threatening withdrawal if they do not have access to alcohol [1] . Just over 15% of the New Zealand population aged 15+ years are at risk for problematic alcohol use as defined by the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test [4] . An informal estimate suggests there are at least 200 000 people likely to meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder in New Zealand (Sellman D, National Addiction Centre, Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, New Zealand, personal communication 2020). Another reason may have been concern for business interests [1] .Alcohol as an essential service during COVID-19 was of additional health importance as drinkers consuming alcohol confined in home settings may cause an escalation of harm to those in the household environment including domestic violence and child maltreatment [2] . Police data show that family violence was intensified during lockdown, with a 22% increase in investigations [5] . In New Zealand, a third of family violence offences are alcohol-related [6] . Home confinement may be particularly distressing for children who are being maltreated. Around 30% of child maltreatment is related to heavy drinking by caregivers [7, 8] .Alcohol sales were permitted with some conditions during the first pandemic restrictions during March/ May 2020 in New Zealand ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information, shows the full description of dates, all pandemic and alcohol restrictions [9] ). There were different levels of pandemic restrictions in New Zealand. During Level 4 (Lockdown-stay home orders, 25 March to 27 April) and Level 3 (Restrict-stay home orders, but able to expand contact to include close family/wh anau, caregivers or support isolated people, 27 April to 13 May 2020) restrictions dedicated alcohol shops were closed (except for in a few small trust areas). All onpremises such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants were closed. Supermarkets were open to sell alcohol (supermarkets are only permitted to sell beer and wine). Online alcohol sales, permitted to sell all types of alcohol including spirits and ready to drinks, were also allowed, likely to be of considerable importance given the stay home orders. Initially restricted to existing online-only alcohol businesses, including supermarkets, they were then extended to other premises, provided they consulted with their local council authorities. This increased online potential availability from about 250 online-only businesses to around 1000 physical bottle shops [1] . Social media were used to promote online sales [1] . During Level 2 (Reduce-stay home orders removed, 13 May to 8 June 2020), dedicated alcohol shops and bars could now open as could restaurants/ cafes but booking numbers were restricted and social distancing rules were in place.The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions affected the way New Zealanders accessed alcohol and may have affected how they consumed alcohol. Some predictions based on findings from both the SARS2 pandemic and the global 2007/2008 financial crisis suggest that alcohol consumption may increase in response to an increase in psychological distress triggered by financial difficulties, social isolation and uncertainty about the future; on the other hand, a reduction in alcohol use could also occur with reduced physical availability and negative financial implications [10] . These scenarios are not mutually exclusive, and timing of the impacts may differ, that is, immediate vs. the months or years after the crisis.A New Zealand online panel survey conducted in the first few weeks of the pandemic stay home orders (Level 4) reported online alcohol delivery was used by 14% of New Zealanders (7% for the first time). It also reported that most respondents had either not changed their usual levels of consumption or were drinking less but 20% did report increased drinking [11] .Documentation of alcohol and purchasing behaviours during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions will inform future discussions of alcohol regulation. Therefore, this study will assess purchasing and drinking behaviour in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions among a sample of New Zealand Facebook users. pandemic restrictions relative to before the restrictions (including by job or income loss due to .Cross-sectional, self-report survey data were obtained from a convenience sample of 2173 New Zealand Facebook users aged 18+ years between 30 April and 28 May 2020. Participants aged 18+ were recruited on Facebook via a paid ad. Drinkers and non-drinkers over 18 years were eligible. The age range was selected to comply with Facebook policy and reflected the legal purchase age for alcohol in New Zealand (18 years). Participants who clicked on the survey link were taken to an online survey where they consented to participate. Respondents were completely anonymous to the researchers and IP addresses were suppressed. Facebook was chosen as the recruitment platform as online data collection was safe and appropriate during the pandemic stay at home orders, further this recruitment platform allows access to an online savvy community. As of May 2020, 66% of New Zealanders were on Facebook [12] . The sample was comprised of respondents during Level 3 (Restrict) which included stay home orders (62%; n = 1350) and during Level 2 (Reduce) (38%; n = 823). The period of pandemic restrictions that respondents could report on covered 25 March to 28 May 2020. It was not possible to measure the response rate associated with this approach as, although Facebook gives information about the reach of the ad, the number of people who were exposed to the survey recruitment efforts cannot be determined. We do know that the completion rate was 81%. That is, of the people who started the survey, 81% went on to complete it.Respondents were asked where they purchased alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (covering 25 March to 28 May 2020). Response options included: supermarkets; online delivery from local alcohol shops; other online delivery; alcohol shops (not online); on-licences such as bars and pubs; from friends; any other (specify); and have not purchased. Response options were yes/no.Respondents were also asked if the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions had affected their, or their household's, alcohol purchasing behaviour in the following ways-switched to purchasing online to get spirits/ ready to drinks, purchasing more alcohol than usual during the restrictions, less money to purchase alcohol, and any other. Response options were yes/no.For respondents who indicated that they had purchased alcohol online during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, a series of follow-up questions were asked.• Prior purchase: Respondents were asked if they had purchased alcohol online prior to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (yes/no). • Ease of delivery: Respondents were asked about the ease of getting alcohol delivered online relative to fresh food/groceries (much easier, somewhat easier, not easier, have not tried to buy alcohol online, have not tried to buy groceries online). • Time to delivery: Respondents were asked how long on average it took for their alcohol to be delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (less than 1 h, between 1 and 3 h, 4 and 8 h, 8 and 24 h, and 1 and 2 days, more than 2 days). • ID at delivery: Respondents under 25 reported whether they had been asked to show age ID when online alcohol had been delivered (often, sometimes, never, not under 25 years of age). • Ads for online delivery: Respondents were asked how many ads they had noticed for online delivery per day during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (a lot of ads per day, some ads per day, a few ads per day, no ads per day, do not know).Respondents were also asked: If their alcohol had run out while they were in the middle of drinking, did they sometimes order more alcohol online to keep drinking? (often, sometimes, never, not applicable).Typical occasion quantity in the past week. Respondents told us the beverage(s) they drank on a typical occasion in the past week (from a specified list of all beverages available in New Zealand). Respondents could report multiple responses (yes/no). Respondents reported their consumption of different beverages and reported how much they drank by selecting from specified lists of containers and glass sizes in which alcohol is commonly served and sold in New Zealand. In this way, respondents do not have to 'calculate' and report their consumption in terms of standard drinks which is likely to introduce error [13] . Calculation of the quantity of millilitre of ethanol was made using the appropriate assumptions regarding alcohol content for each beverage and container sizes based on Statistics New Zealand conversion factors.Heavier drinking. Respondents were categorised into 6+ drinks on a typical occasion in the past week versus less than 6 drinks. A drink was defined as 15 ml absolute alcohol.Change in drinking. Respondents were asked ""during the COVID-19 restrictions, has your drinking changed compared to before any restrictions?"" (drinking a lot more, a little more, about the same, a little less, a lot less, did not drink during pandemic restrictions).Census 2018 data. Census 2018 data were not included in the main analysis but were used to compare the demographic composition of the convenience sample against the New Zealand population. Census data are the most comprehensive data available for comparison.For study aims 1, 2 and 4, the descriptive analysis generated sample percentages, cross-tabs and confidence intervals. The confidence intervals are not applicable to the New Zealand population, only to the current sample. Descriptive analysis was conducted separately for males and females, as more females responded to the survey than males. For the variables related to describing aspects of online alcohol delivery denominators differed (see Table 1 ). For the measure 'ease of delivery' if respondents reported they had not bought alcohol online or groceries online (or both), they were excluded from analysis (n = 1158). For the measure 'ran out of alcohol in the middle of drinking and ordered more online', those who specified this was not applicable were excluded from analysis (n = 171). For 'asked for age ID verification on delivery' those over 25 years were excluded (n = 733). For ads for online delivery seen per day, those who reported they did not know if they had seen ads were excluded from analysis (n = 81).For study aim 3, variables that predicted heavier drinking were explored using logistic regression, including online alcohol delivery, purchase from supermarkets controlling for gender, age, M aori (Y/N), New Zealand European (Y/N) and job/income loss due to COVID-19 (Y/N) and Level 3 versus Level 2 restrictions. For typical occasion quantity, the log of this variable was used, and a linear regression was run using the same variables as the model above. Models were built up one variable at a time to check for multicollinearity. No weighting was used for any of the models. After the final models had been run, residuals were checked to see if they were approximately normal and if there were any clear patterns remaining. Using Cook's distance we did not see any influential outliers in any of the models. Analysis was carried out using R 4.0 with some additional data management performed in SAS 9.4.Most respondents who completed the survey were female (79%), 21% were male and 1% gender diverse (given the small number of gender diverse participants we were unable to conduct analysis separately for this group). Most of the sample were New Zealand European/Pakeha (89%); 6% of the sample were M aori ( Table 1 ). The median age of the sample was 43 years. Table 1 shows the demographic comparison of the convenience sample to the New Zealand Population using Census 2018.Supermarkets were the most common place where alcohol was purchased during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Around 40% of males and females used any online alcohol delivery service. Twenty-one percent of males purchased from an alcohol store (in store) and 17% of females did the same. Very small percentages of respondents reported purchasing from on-licences, friends or other places. Around 13% of both males and females did not purchase alcohol during the pandemic restrictions ( Figure 1 ).There were few differences observed between Levels 3 and 2. There were slight changes in the percentages of respondents purchasing any online alcohol deliveryaround 40% in Level 3 and 36% in Level 2. Purchase from alcohol shops (in store) was 15% during Level 3 and 21% during Level 2. On-premise purchase was 1.5% during Level 3 and 7% during Level 2.Of those who purchased alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, around 30% of males and females reported switching to online purchasing to buy spirits/ready to drinks, 51% of females and 46% of males reported purchasing more alcohol during the pandemic restrictions, and 16% of females and 12% of males said they had less money to purchase alcohol.There were few differences observed between Levels 3 and 2. However, for 'Switched to purchasing online in order to get spirits/ready to drinks' results were: Level 3: females = 35%, males = 33%; Level 2: females = 25%, males = 25%. Online alcohol delivery including factors that facilitate access Table 2 shows aspects related to online alcohol delivery that may facilitate access. Of all purchasers, around 18% of males and females reported purchasing online alcohol delivery for the first time during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Of online alcohol purchasers only, 45% of males and 47% of females had done so for the first time.Online alcohol delivery was relatively easy to access during the pandemic restrictions. Of those who had purchased online alcohol and had tried to also buy fresh food online, 58% of males and 53% of females agreed that alcohol was easier to get delivered than fresh/food or groceries during the restrictions.Of those who had purchased online alcohol delivery, almost one-quarter of males and 14% of females reported ordering more alcohol during a drinking session after having run out. While most deliveries took more than 2 days, 5% of males and almost 8% of females reported that delivery took less than 3 h. Of those who were under 25 years and purchased online alcohol delivery, 47% of males and 60% of females reported never being asked for age ID verification at delivery. Most respondents who had purchased alcohol online (73% females and 78% males) reported seeing at least one ad per day for online alcohol delivery, with around 26% of males and 16% of females reporting seeing a lot of ads per day.Respondents who used online alcohol delivery services during the pandemic restrictions had 75% higher odds of being a heavier drinker in the past week [Note:Heavier drinking was defined as 6+ drinks on a typical occasion in the past week. A drink was defined as 15 ml absolute alcohol] than respondents who did not. Purchasing from the supermarket was not associated with heavier drinking. Those who had lost a job or income due to COVID-19 had 78% higher odds of being a heavier drinker compared to those who had not. Males had 98% higher odds of being a heavier drinker in the past week during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions compared to females. Older people had lower odds of being a heavier drinker relative to younger people (Table 3) .Those who purchased online alcohol delivery during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions reported 24% higher typical occasion quantity on average in the past week, while those who had purchased from the supermarket were estimated to have 34% higher typical occasion quantity. Being male was associated with an increase of 36%, M aori an increase of 30% and having lost a job or income an increase of 22% typical occasion quantity in the past week during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Each additional 5 years of age was associated with a decrease of 5% of typical occasion quantity. Drinkers consumed a 13% more typical occasion quantity in the past week in Level 3 restrictions compared to Level 2 (Table 3) .Around 47% of males and 53% of females reported drinking more during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, for those who used online alcohol delivery these percentages were around 58% for males and 68% for females (Table 4) . Online alcohol delivery is associated with heavier drinking Changes in drinking related to income or job loss due to COVID-19A slightly higher percentage of females who had lost a job or income due to COVID-19 were observed to be drinking less relative to those who had not, and both males and females who had lost a job or income were slightly less likely to be drinking more (relative to those who had not). See Table S1 , Supporting Information. While most respondents purchased alcohol from supermarkets during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in New Zealand, it was online alcohol delivery that was associated with heavier drinking in the past week. Online alcohol delivery is an easy way of delivering alcohol to private households; 74% of all the alcohol consumed in harmful drinking occasions in New Zealand is consumed in private homes (harmful drinking defined as 8+ drinks for males and 6+ for females) [14] . The effects of heavier drinking may be exacerbated during home confinement, and initial police and women's refuge data suggest there was an increase in calls for family violence [5] , as has been found in other countries (e.g. United States, China, Brazil and Australia [15] ). In the current study, almost one-quarter of males and 15% of females who had purchased online delivery said they ordered more alcohol online after running out while drinking. This suggests a direct facilitation of heavier drinking by online delivery during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Online alcohol delivery is a rapidly emerging market internationally and COVID-19 has triggered a sudden expansion of online alcohol delivery in New Zealand, for example, a 2015 national random sample of 2000 drinkers found that 2% had purchased online alcohol delivery (SHORE & Whariki, 2015, unpublished International Alcohol Control study data) compared to around 40% during pandemic restrictions in this study. China's online alcohol delivery market is expanding by 15% per year [16] and Australia has also experienced a sudden growth in online alcohol sales and delivery [17] . Retailers providing online sales in Australia offer a variety of alcohol products cheaply, most offered discounts for purchasing greater quantities and one in 10 websites allowed customers to purchase alcohol using a 'buy now, pay later' scheme such as AfterPay or Zip Pay [18] . Online alcohol delivery remains under-regulated in most jurisdictions although, for example, in New South Wales, Australia there are proposed regulations to prevent same day online sales and sales to intoxicated people [19] .Over half of the sample reported drinking more than they had before the pandemic restrictions. This percentage was higher among those who used online alcohol delivery, and particularly so among females. Our study findings differ from a previous study conducted during the first few weeks of lockdown, where most respondents had either not changed their usual levels of consumption or were drinking less [11] . This could be due to a different sample, or perhaps our sample drank more the longer the home confinement orders lasted possibly reflecting an increase in psychological distress [10] .Our findings show that there was a relative ease in obtaining online alcohol delivery during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and several factors facilitated access: alcohol was easier to get delivered compared to fresh food/groceries; relaxed age ID verification processes were apparent; and some drinkers could get alcohol delivered within hours of ordering. Furthermore, around three-quarters of respondents who had used online delivery services saw ads for online delivery at least daily. There is little research into the impacts of these types of ads which is a gap, especially as they can provide a direct link to the source of alcohol.There has been a rapid expansion in online alcohol delivery during COVID-19 in New Zealand. A New Zealand survey conducted in the first few weeks of the pandemic stay home orders (Level 4), reported online alcohol delivery was used by 14% of New Zealanders (7% for the first time) [11] . The findings of this study show that 40% of respondents used online alcohol delivery in Level 3 and 36% in Level 2, with 18% of the total sample purchasing online for the first time during COVID-19. Again, it is possible that differences in the samples contributed to this finding or it could reflect a rapid increase in online alcohol delivery that occurred during COVID-19. This may suggest that the increase in online alcohol delivery services will be permanent, although further research will be needed to confirm such a finding.Respondents financially affected by COVID-19, that is, had job or income loss as a result, were more likely to be heavier drinkers, or vice versa given the crosssectional nature of the data. Either way, this finding suggests that the conditions of COVID-19 and financial distress may exacerbate inequalities relating to alcohol and may result in compounding stress for wh anau (family) and individuals. While there was an association between heavier drinking and the financial impact of COVID-19, only a small percentage of those financially impacted were drinking less than their usual level. Financial loss in the pandemic makes alcohol more difficult to afford, but it is primarily a stressor, which could explain this finding.The increased use of online delivery services during the pandemic has highlighted an already existing problem-there is insufficient policy in place to mitigate harms from home delivery of alcohol. The policy framework permitting and governing online alcohol delivery may not be suitable for protecting public health. Online alcohol delivery in New Zealand is governed by a remote licence that includes restrictions typical of those placed on take-away outlets, however, there is no evidence that these regulations minimise harm as stipulated in the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act [20] . For example, there are no restrictions on rapid delivery or repeat online delivery to extend heavy drinking occasions, or on buy now pay later options such as Afterpay or Zip Pay (which is available in some other countries for purchasing alcohol online) [21] .Future monitoring of alcohol consumption will be important as, during prior epidemics, some affected individuals have increased their drinking. This may reflect self-medication, which can have long-term negative effects, including exacerbating alcohol's role in the 'diseases and deaths of despair' [22] , including those related to alcohol use disorder.The sample is a convenience sample and is not representative of the New Zealand population nor Facebook users. However, the study was able to test relationships between variables in the general population where representativity is not a key necessity [23] . Utilising Facebook was a feasible and safe way to conduct research during stay at home orders. A Facebook sample also may better represent the online savvy community, which should be considered when comparing these findings to others from New Zealand, that is respondents may be more likely to order online alcohol. The fact that more females responded than males may be related to the COVID-19 stay home orders. A similar survey we have conducted on Facebook outside of the stay home orders is more sex balanced. Females use social networking sites to make connections and stay in touch with family or friends, more so than males [24] , a pattern which may have been heightened during stay home orders. Females have also been reported to engage in far more Facebook activity than males [25] . However, females have also been shown to be over-represented in convenience samples (albeit not to the extent in this study) [26] . We undertook descriptive analysis separately by males and females to ameliorate bias that may be present from only reporting total percentages only and controlled for a number of variables (i.e. age, ethnicity, level of pandemic restrictions, loss of income/job) in the models. As our sample is a convenience sample and lacks numbers in some population groups including males, it is likely our survey has underestimated consumption relative to that in the New Zealand population. It is possible social desirability bias meant that respondents were less likely to report heavy drinking [27] , however, this does not change the main conclusions of the study. We were unable to calculate a response rate.During the first COVID-19 pandemic restrictions half of the drinkers in our sample were consuming more alcohol relative to before the restrictions. The source of alcohol associated with heavier drinking during COVID-19 was online alcohol delivery. There was ease of access to online delivery during the pandemic along with advertising directly linking drinkers to alcohol. The rapid expansion of online alcohol delivery coupled with a lack of regulatory control requires public health policy attention.Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's website: Figure S1 .

PIU encompasses various behaviors, and a concern has been expressed about the rise in online gaming (King, Delfabbro, Billieux, & Potenza, 2020) and gambling (Håkansson, Fernández-Aranda, Menchón, Potenza, & Jiménez-Murcia, 2020) , inappropriate use of social media (Wiederhold, 2020) and increased consumption of online pornography (Mestre-Bach, Blycker, & Potenza, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. One problematic online activity that is particularly relevant at the time of public health emergencies is an excessive online health research (OHR). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this activity relates mainly to seeking information about COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to present a model that aims to explain problematic OHR (i.e., cyberchondria) during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.2 | CYBERCHONDRIA Cyberchondria has been conceptualized as an excessive or repeated OHR that is associated with increasing levels of health anxiety or distress (Starcevic, 2017) . It has also been described as a ""multidimensional construct"" that reflects both ""anxiety and an element of compulsiveness"" and encompasses repetitious and time-consuming OHR, negative emotional states or distress associated with OHR and the consequent interruption or neglect of other activities (McElroy & Shevlin, 2014) . Cyberchondria has been considered to represent a 21st century counterpart to hypochondriasis, with the two constructs overlapping in terms of the specific problematic behaviors (excessive health information seeking, persistent health-related checking and/or reassurance seeking), negative emotional state (health anxiety or distress), persistence of problematic behaviors despite their negative consequences (compulsivity) and interference with functioning.Cyberchondria has been strongly associated with a heightened health anxiety Bajcar, Babiak, & Olchowska-Kotala, 2019; Barke, Bleichhardt, Rief, & Doering, 2016; Fergus, 2014; McMullan, Berle, Arnáez, & Starcevic, 2019; Norr, Albanese, Oglesby, Allan, & Schmidt, 2015; Starcevic, Baggio, Berle, Khazaal, & Viswasam, 2019) and PIU (Fergus & Spada, 2017; McElroy & Shevlin, 2014; Singh & Brown, 2014; Starcevic et al., 2019) .Cyberchondria is also related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; Fergus, 2014; Fergus & Russell, 2016; Fergus & Spada, 2018; Vismara et al., 2020) .According to the reassurance-seeking model of cyberchondria (Starcevic & Berle, 2013) , cyberchondria is maintained by uncertainty embedded in OHR, intolerance of ambiguity and uncertainty, dilemmas about the trustworthiness of the sources of online health information, need for a ""definitive"" or ""straightforward"" explanation and difficulty coping with an abundance of information (""information overload""), especially if much of that information is conflicting or contradictory.While some people with heightened levels of health anxiety develop cyberchondria, this behavioral pattern may also occur in the absence of a preexisting, heightened health anxiety (Starcevic, 2017) .Regardless of whether or not high levels of health anxiety precede cyberchondria, OHR perpetuates itself despite causing or amplifying distress under the circumstances of a perceived threat to one's health and wellbeing, intolerable uncertainty, difficulty coping with information overload and confusion as to who could be trusted to provide accurate information and deliver reassurance online. These circumstances reflect the COVID-19 pandemic and may help explain the hypothesized rise in cyberchondria during this time.3 | COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND CYBERCHONDRIA: THE NATURAL BEDFELLOWS Our proposed model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic is an applied version of the reassurance-seeking model of cyberchondria. Moreover, the trigger for cyberchondria in the model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic is the overall context of the pandemic rather than the occurrence of a new symptom in the generic reassurance-seeking model of cyberchondria. The proposed model is presented in Figure 1 , which illustrates the dynamic relationships between its components. These are discussed below and include a heightened perception of threat and fear of COVID-19, difficulties in coping with uncertainty, questionable trustworthiness of online information, difficulties in coping with information overload and ineffective online reassurance seeking.COVID-19 has only recently been identified, it is highly contagious, it can have a lethal outcome and there is currently no evidence-based treatment for it. As such, COVID-19 understandably elicits fear, similar to the fear of other incurable and deadly infectious diseases in the past. Therefore, the perception of threat associated with COVID-19 is not unreasonable on its own. Nevertheless, there seem to be large differences between individuals in terms of the perception of threat and the consequent fear. For example, some studies have reported higher anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among younger individuals who are not considered to be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 (e.g., Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2020;Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Dosil-Santamaria, Picaza-Gorrochategui, & Idoiaga-Mondragon, 2020). Reasons for unexpectedly high levels of the fear of COVID-19 are diverse and may include biological factors (e.g., genetic predisposition), psychological factors (e.g., personality traits such as neuroticism, perceived susceptibility to disease and emotional vulnerabilities such as proneness to worry and poor tolerance of uncertainty) and environmental factors (e.g., panic-like societal attitude toward the disease). The role of these factors is likely to vary from one person to another.The perception of threat during the COVID-19 pandemic does not only pertain to one's physical health (i.e., fear of becomingModel of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic infected or dying from the disease (Schimmenti, Billieux, & Starcevic, 2020; Taylor et al., 2020) , which is the fear domain with obvious implications for cyberchondria. The experience of fear in the context of the pandemic is multifaceted and includes other aspects that are relevant for cyberchondria, such as fear of infecting others, fear of not knowing what one needs to know about COVID-19 and fear of being paralyzed and of not taking whatever action may be necessary to protect oneself or others (Schimmenti et al., 2020) . In addition, other fears (e.g., fear of the economic repercussions of the pandemic (Taylor et al., 2020) may also drive excessive OHR and thereby contribute to cyberchondria.A pervasive uncertainty has been one of the hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the most part, this is also because COVID-19 is a newly identified and poorly understood disease for which the societies and healthcare systems around the world have not been prepared.In this context, uncertainty is invariably experienced negatively. In fact, ""uncertainty distress"" is the term introduced in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and defined as ""the subjective negative emotions experienced in response to the as yet unknown aspects of a given situation"" (Freeston, Tiplady, Mawn, Bottesi, & Thwaites, 2020) .Given this experience of uncertainty, the way people cope with it is of immediate relevance. In the digital age, many try to cope with health-related uncertainty by turning to the Internet to find answers to their questions (e.g., Singh, Fox, & Brown, 2016) ; this may have been the case with COVID-19-related queries, too. Effectively managing uncertainty may depend on various factors, including the ability to tolerate it.Intolerance of uncertainty has been defined in several ways.According to one definition, it denotes a need for ""cognitive closure,"" whereby such a closure reflects a desire for ""an answer on a given topic, any answer"" (Kruglansky, 1990) . Another definition suggests that intolerance of uncertainty is an excessive tendency to consider the occurrence of a negative event unacceptable and threatening, regardless of the probability of its occurrence (Carleton, Norton, & Asmundson, 2007; Dugas, Gosselin, & Ladouceur, 2001) . Irrespective of the definition, the concept of intolerance of uncertainty combines the lack of needed information with a lack of assurance that such information would become available in the foreseeable future.Intolerance of uncertainty is a transdiagnostic construct, associated with various anxiety and related disorders. Several studies have found intolerance of uncertainty to be moderately correlated with cyberchondria (Fergus, 2013 (Fergus, , 2015 Fergus & Spada, 2017 Norr et al., 2015; Zangoulechi, Yousefi, & Keshavarz, 2018) . While some of these studies suggested that intolerance of uncertainty might be a risk factor for cyberchondria (Fergus, 2013 (Fergus, , 2015 Norr et al., 2015; Zangoulechi et al., 2018) , others found that intolerance of uncertainty was not uniquely associated with cyberchondria (Fergus & Spada, 2017 . Although both inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty (referring to a paralyzing effect of uncertainty) and prospective intolerance of uncertainty (referring to an anxious apprehension about uncertainty and desire for predictability of future events) were significantly associated with cyberchondria, the former was associated more strongly than the latter. This suggests that feeling ""paralyzed"" and possibly being preoccupied with threats may be a somewhat more common response to uncertainty in cyberchondria than seeking information to reduce uncertainty. Consequently, there are two effects of a difficulty in tolerating COVID-19-related uncertainty ( Figure 1 ). The first is experiencing an inability to take action and increased perception of threat from COVID-19. The second is engaging in online health information seeking about COVID-19. Both effects may make cyberchondria more likely.The Internet is a repository of a huge amount of information, but a large proportion of that information may be unreliable and untrustworthy. Distinguishing between trustworthy and untrustworthy information is not always easy and difficulties in making this distinction have been associated with cyberchondria (e.g., Starcevic & Berle, 2013) . What makes the COVID-19 pandemic situation particularly challenging in this regard relates back to the fact that so little is known about COVID-19. Therefore, sources of health information that are usually regarded as reliable because they provide accurate and unambiguous information are not necessarily perceived as authoritative and trustworthy when it comes to COVID-19. This ""crisis of confidence"" undermines a notion that it is possible to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy sources of online information on COVID-19. As a result, people may feel that they are left to their own devices when trying to make this distinction.A diminished trust in social and political institutions during the pandemic (e.g., Balog-Way & McComas, 2020; Bargain & Aminjonov, 2020) may make COVID-19 information obtained from the ""official"" sources (e.g., websites of public health agencies and governments) and COVID-19 information obtained from ""alternative"" sources (e.g., social media) equally credible. This situation is likely to make cyberchondria flourish because the large amount of information on COVID-19 found on various websites (e.g., Cuan-Baltazar, Muñoz-Perez, Robledo-Vega, Pérez-Zepeda, & Soto-Vega, 2020) or shared on social media (e.g., Laato, Najmul Islam, Nazrul Islam, & Whelan, 2020) is misleading, inaccurate or false. Indeed, misinformation on COVID-19 is increasingly being recognized as a significant public health issue and a risk in its own right (Krause, Freiling, Beets, & Brossard, 2020) .In particular, various social media have been implicated in what has been termed a ""pandemic of misinformation"" (Li, Bailey, Huynh, & Chan, 2020) and ""COVID-19 misinformation epidemic"" (Kouzy et al., 2020) . Given these findings, perception of social media as a trustworthy source of COVID-19-related information is likely to intensify searches for more information and increase a sense of confusion and distress, thereby contributing to cyberchondria during the pandemic.Information processing is a challenge in the digital age. This is largely a function of the abundance of information, that is, information overload. According to Bawden and Robinson (2009) , information overload occurs when the amount of information that one is exposed to becomes ""a hindrance rather than a help."" Overload of information derived from online sources has been found to have negative effects on general health and to increase distress (Misra & Stokols, 2012) .Furthermore, a perceived information overload has been associated with negative affect, anxiety, depressive symptoms and anger in the context of OHR (Swar, Hameed, & Reychav, 2017) . The World HealthOrganization has recently introduced the term ""infodemic"" to refer to an ""overabundance of information-some accurate and some notthat makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it"" (World Health Organization, 2020).A common way of coping with information overload is filtering out of information that is irrelevant, vague or that seems untrustworthy-a process that may not be too arduous in the setting of a relative safety, social stability, predictability, and a semblance of certainty. However, effective filtering out of information may become more difficult when the world is under the specter of a pandemic that threatens individual lives and weakens a sense of safety, stability, and certainty. This is compounded by a need for the available information to be updated ""on the run"" as experts continue to seek understanding of the key aspects (patterns of transmission, associated symptoms, recovery, recurrence, and immunity) of a disease caused by a virus that has emerged only recently. As a result, this situation may undermine one's capacity to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information about and between information that is important and information that is useless. Without these distinctions, every piece of information has similar value and is worthy of attention. Moreover, less credible sources of information may seem relatively more appealing. For example, information about conspiracy theories that is normally ignored suddenly becomes potentially relevant (e.g., van Bavel et al., 2020 ).An indiscriminate consumption of COVID-19-related information, most of which is found on various websites or on social media, often leads to confusion-and ultimately a pervasive fear. This is especially the case when much of that information is conflicting or contradictory and when it is being constantly updated. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated that individuals who used social media as their main source of information during the COVID-19 pandemic suffered from more information overload and exhibited a more prominent cyberchondria (Farooq, Laato, & Najmul Islam, 2020) .People who are troubled by fears of COVID-19 and/or distressed by uncertainty may seek information on COVID-19 online for the purpose of reassurance. They may hope to find an explanation for incongruent pieces of information, seek to understand the disease better or understand how to prevent it and protect themselves-and feel safer.Ideally, this information would be clear, easy to understand and definitive, which might obviate a need for further OHR. Those who need much information to feel reassured may be more prone to developing cyberchondria because they may continue looking for it ad infinitum.The point at which the amount and quality of information becomes sufficient is difficult to determine, which is similar to a difficulty that many people with OCD encounter when trying to figure out what constitutes a ""just right"" feeling. This is one domain in which cyberchondria resembles OCD. Moreover, the abundance of online information also means that vulnerable individuals may encounter frightening information that triggers new worries and prompts them to look for further information and seek reassurance for concerns that did not originally trigger OHR.However, the Internet was not designed to provide reassurance, there is much uncertainty during the process of OHR itself and the outcome of OHR is largely unpredictable. Many people may not be aware of this and instead, have unrealistic expectations of the Internet. Therefore, when their OHR fails to provide them with necessary information and reassurance, many may feel frustrated, overwhelmed, disappointed and more distressed or fearful.Despite the mounting fear or distress caused by OHR, people with cyberchondria continue searching for more COVID-19-related information. This makes OHR compulsive and leads to a loss of control over this behavior, which is another link with OCD. Compulsivity in cyberchondria may be fueled by a fear of missing some presumably vital information and people may continue online searches as an attempt to reduce fear and alleviate a sense of uncertainty. A particularly pernicious contributor to such continued searching during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the constant updating of online information about the disease as our understanding of it evolves, leading anxious individuals to recheck the current recommendations and what is known about COVID-19. These people may believe that if they were to stop online searches, they might miss something important on COVID-19 that has appeared in the meantime, thus overestimating the reassuring effect of the information and feeling compelled to continue with OHR.The model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic as presented in Figure 1 starts with the biological and psychological vulnerabilities that make the perception of threat during the pandemic more likely and that undermine coping with pandemic-induced uncertainty.Online searching for COVID-19-related information is a response to a COVID-19-related threat and uncertainty because COVID-19 is a newly identified and poorly understood disease. This response is likely to be stronger if the perceived threat from COVID-19 is amplified or in the setting of ineffective coping with COVID-19-related uncertainty. Online searching for COVID-19-related information is made difficult by a questionable trustworthiness of much online information and a challenge of identifying authoritative and trustworthy sources T A B L E 1 Model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic: components, explanations, and corrective strategiesDifficulties in coping with uncertainty • Uncertainty is one of the hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic because COVID-19 is a newly identified and poorly understood disease.• Learning to manage uncertainty, that is, accepting the limitations of medical knowledge, which would allow people to live with unavoidable uncertainty and prevent futile online searches.Questionable trustworthiness of online information, including the negative role of social media• Large amount of online information on COVID-19 is misleading, inaccurate or false. • Sources of health information that are usually regarded as reliable may not be perceived as authoritative and trustworthy when it comes to COVID-19, because so little is known about COVID-19; however, such sources remain most reliable during the COVID-19 pandemic.• Fostering acceptance that some proportion of online health information cannot be trusted. • Increasing reliance on the official and reputable sources of online health information, despite their limitations.• Various social media have been implicated in a ""pandemic of misinformation"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. • Perception of social media as a trustworthy source of COVID-19-related information is likely to intensify searches for more information and increase a sense of confusion and distress, thereby contributing to cyberchondria during the pandemic. • Individuals who use social media as their main source of information during the COVID-19 pandemic tend to suffer from more information overload and exhibit a more prominent cyberchondria.• Avoiding social media as the only or predominant source of online health information. • Encouraging efficient self-control strategies when social media are used (e.g., limiting duration of exposure and the number of links followed).• Overload of information derived from online sources has negative effects on general health and increases distress. • Information overload has been associated with negative affect, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and anger in the context of OHR. • Indiscriminate consumption of online information related to COVID-19 often leads to confusion and fear, especially when much of that information is conflicting or contradictory and when it is being constantly updated. • Coping with information overload by filtering out information that is irrelevant, vague or that seems untrustworthy may be undermined during the COVID-19 pandemic.• Applying strategies to better manage online health information, especially when it is conflicting, inconsistent and abundant. • Promoting an ability to critically appraise the results of OHR via user-friendly consumer guides that provide simple and clear instructions about factors to consider when encountering online health information.Ineffective online reassurance seeking • Unrealistic expectations of the Internet occur because:The internet was not designed to provide reassurance; Uncertainty is embedded in the process of OHR; Outcome of OHR is largely unpredictable. • Online reassurance seeking for healthrelated matters is often ineffective.• Improving understanding of what the internet can do for an anxious person and the limitations when the internet is used to obtain reassurance about healthrelated threats.Abbreviation: OHR, online health research. of information. The sheer volume of this information that is also continuously updated and a decreased ability to filter out unnecessary information further complicate online searches; they become excessive, with almost any information on COVID-19 being taken into account, regardless of how relevant it is. Inability to find necessary and reassuring information leads to more fear and distress, which amplifies the perception of threat and uncertainty. Cyberchondria perpetuates itself via further compulsive online searches and reassurance seeking in a fear-amplifying spiral. Due to accessibility of OHR, people will continue to search for health information online, especially during large-scale epidemics and when public health is jeopardized in any other way. Therefore, it would be unrealistic and counterproductive to suggest ""abstinence"" from this activity. Instead, Internet users need to achieve a high level of online health information literacy and feel confident about their ability to manage this information. This entails several measures, which are related to our model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1) The peer review history for this article is available at https://publons. com/publon/10.1002/hbe2.233.The authors elect to not share data.

Throughout 2020, populations in most countries have been subject to measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19, such as physical distancing or isolating at home. At the same time, a small number of countries (e.g. South Africa, Thailand) temporarily banned all alcohol sales, and in several jurisdictions (e.g. parts of Europe and North America, UK, Australia) on-premises drinking venues have been temporarily closed or given reduced trading hours and patron numbers [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, off-premises alcohol businesses have generally been permitted to continue trading. Internationally, there are concerns about alcohol consumption during the pandemic, including fears that social isolation may lead to increased psychological stress and subsequent increases in drinking [4] . In the UK, experts observed a spike in off-premises alcohol sales at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 and warned that without preventive action we may see a 'toll of increased alcohol harm for a generation' [5] .Despite these concerns, the impact of the pandemic on drinking remains unclear. Rehm and colleagues [1] outline plausible mechanisms for both increases and decreases in drinking during the pandemic, suggesting a decrease is more likely. However, reliable evidence remains rare. Data from various sources report short-term increases in dollars spent on alcohol, potentially driven by fears of greater restrictions [6] [7] [8] . However, these do not always capture corresponding declines in on-premise sales, and are not easily converted into estimates of alcohol consumption. Survey data have produced mixed findings. A survey of 1555 British drinkers found more people reported reductions in their drinking than increases [9] , while a German study found the opposite, citing higher stress as a driver of increased This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.drinking [10] . A large Canadian survey found around three-quarters reported no change to their alcohol consumption during the pandemic, with only small proportions reporting increases or decreases [11] .In Australia, some self-report surveys of adults conducted in April and May 2020 show similar proportions of respondents increasing or decreasing alcohol consumption since the COVID-19 restrictions [12] [13] [14] . Increases were higher in certain demographic groups (e.g.women, younger age groups) [12, 13, 15] , while decreases were higher in those who, before the pandemic, report usually drinking outside the home [16] .Australia is among several countries that have experienced an apparent first and second wave of COVID-19 cases [17] . Australia's first wave of new daily COVID-19 cases peaked on March 28 (n = 464) [18] . Case numbers then declined in April and remained low through May to mid-June, but increased from mid-June with an apparent second wave that peaked on August 5 (n = 698). Among the public health interventions implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia was the mandatory closure of pubs, bars, restaurants, and cafes from 23 March, effectively prohibiting on-premises alcohol consumption [see details of COVID-19 restrictions in S1]. Major events (e.g. sports) where on-premises alcohol would usually be available were also prohibited. Consequently, the availability of alcohol was restricted to off-premises sales (i.e. takeaway, home-delivery), as this sector was permitted to trade. While these restrictions were prescribed by Australia's federal government, regulatory responsibility for alcohol availability in Australia rests with state and territory governments.As the first wave subsided, some restrictions were partially relaxed. From 15 May, on-This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.premises alcohol outlets re-opened in most states and territories, albeit with partial restrictions (e.g. maximum patron numbers, physical distancing rules, drinking permitted only when dining). As the second wave of COVID-19 worsened from mid-June, partial restrictions for on-premises alcohol sales remained across the country. Additionally, in the state of Victoria, where the second wave outbreak was concentrated, on-premises alcohol outlets were ordered to close from 09 July, and from 02 August a night-time curfew and movement restrictions were introduced in the metropolitan area. Despite concerns about the potential for increased alcohol use during the first and second waves of COVID-19, the evidence to date is inconclusive regarding the overall impact on consumption levels in Australia and elsewhere. The aim of this study is to compare beer consumption before and after the first and second waves of COVID-19 restrictions to alcohol availability in Australia.This article is protected by copyright.

This data is timely, offers a high degree of precision, and is disaggregated by on-and off-premises sales, which is pertinent to our study aims. Using data on alcohol sales administered by the government taxation agency, we generally avoid the problem of measurement error (i.e. under-counting or recall biases) inherent in self-reported consumption measures. Additionally, this high frequency data (i.e. weekly observations) can potentially detect temporal effects that may be obscured in monthly or quarterly data. Because beer has a relatively short shelf life, and therefore potentially less likely to be stockpiled than expensive alcohol (e.g. spirits) [21] , we assume that weekly beer sales are generally proximal to same-week consumption.Comparable data is not available for wine and spirits, and therefore we cannot examine changes in consumption across those categories or total alcohol consumption. However, because beer represents the largest share (39.0%) of total alcohol consumed in Australia [22] , changes to beer consumption potentially impact overall consumption in the population, notwithstanding the possibility of some substitution with other categories. Importantly, beer is disproportionately involved in risky drinking in Australia [23] .Our outcome measure is the estimated level of beer per capita consumption (BPC) in litres of pure alcohol (LALs) per week in Australia. Using published estimates of alcohol content in This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.beer [22] , we calculated gross LALs from the taxed volume of alcohol in beer, disaggregated by trade sector (on-premises and off-premises). Per capita LALs were calculated using the estimated resident population of Australia aged 15+ years [24] . Prior to analysis, we seasonally adjusted the weekly BPC time series in EViews 11 [25] using STL decomposition [26] .We use interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to compare BPC levels before and after the first and second waves of COVID-19 restrictions to alcohol availability. ITS analysis is considered the strongest, quasi-experimental design to evaluate longitudinal effects of timedelimited interventions [27] . ITS analysis is suitable for investigating the effect of population-level alcohol policy interventions not amenable to using randomised controlled trials (RCTs), particularly where only aggregate data is available. The approach is useful for estimating not only the effect of introducing an intervention, but also the effect of full or partial removal of an intervention [28] .A methodological challenge we face is the lack of a comparison group, as the outcome is measured nationally. However, ITS analysis is well suited for these single-group situations, as it projects the pre-intervention trend into the treatment period as the counterfactual [27] .Furthermore, the long pre-intervention period in our analysis (n = 247 weekly observations) significantly increases the power of the ITS model in detecting secular trends [29] . Our single-group ITS model is an OLS regression with BPC on-and off-premises as the dependent variables, and three independent indicator variables representing the timing (week beginning) of the interventions (pre-intervention periods 0, otherwise 1). This model This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. To identify possible autocorrelation in the time series, we use the Cumby-Huizinga test [30] .This guided appropriate lag specifications we included in models to adjust for autocorrelation.We assume the interventions were fully implemented in the nominated week, and that any time-varying unmeasured confounders (e.g. changes in household disposable income) are more slowly changing and therefore distinguishable from the sudden change in the indicator variables. Notwithstanding this, for sensitivity testing we include pseudo start and end times of the interventions (e.g. 1 and 2 weeks before and after the expected implementation of the interventions) and dates of potential confounders (e.g. changes in unemployment benefits).Analysis was undertaken in STATA 15 [31] using the ""itsa"" command [32] . Analysis was not pre-registered and our results should be considered exploratory.In the five years prior to the first wave restrictions, on-and off-premises BPC on average represented 23.3% (0.014 LALs) and 76.7% (0.045 LALs) of total weekly BPC, respectively.The long-term pre-intervention trends for on-and off-premises BPC were close to flat [see Table 1 ].Interrupted times series analysis found the first wave restrictions, measured from 23 March 2020, were associated with a significant immediate level reduction in on-premises BPC (-0.013 LALs, P = <0.001) [see Figure 1 ]. In contrast, no significant level change in offpremises BPC was found. Changes in the trend for both on-and off-premises BPC were small and not significant. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Partial removal of the first wave restrictions, measured from 18 May 2020, was associated with a significant immediate level increase in on-premises beer consumption (+0.003 LALs, P = 0.006), but no significant change in off-premises beer consumption was found. For onpremises BPC, partial removal of first wave restrictions was also associated with a significant increase in the weekly trend (+0.002 LALs, P = <0.001). In contrast, the change in trend for off-premises BPC was not significant.Second wave restrictions, measured from 06 July 2020, were associated with a significant immediate level reduction in on-premises beer consumption (-0.004 LALs, P = 0.001).However, no significant level change in off-premises consumption was found. Second wave restrictions were also associated with a significant decrease in the weekly trend in onpremises BPC (-0.002 LALs, P = <0.001), but no significant change in the off-premises BPC trend was found.Sensitivity testing using pseudo start-and end-dates for each intervention and possible confounders (e.g. timing of increased unemployment benefits, wage subsidies) did not produce significant estimates that differed widely from our results. As a robustness test of our findings we fitted Prais-Winsten AR(1) regression models with robust standard errors as an alternative specification (results not shown). These alternative models for on-premises and off-premises BPC adjusted well for autocorrelation (Durbin Watson statistics: 2.02 and 2.02, respectively) and produced estimates close to our original model.

All rights reserved.There had been no prior analysis of objective empirical data to compare alcohol consumption before and after restrictions to alcohol availability during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. We find that the first and second wave restrictions were associated with large and significant reductions in weekly on-premises beer consumption but no significant change in off-premises beer consumption. The partial removal of first wave restrictions was associated with a significant increase in on-premises beer consumption, but this was small and did not fully offset the reductions that occurred after the first wave restrictions.These findings are not directly comparable to the early research on alcohol use during COVID-19 restrictions in Australia, as those involved surveys of individuals and relied on self-reported changes in drinking [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, interestingly, the Australian survey research suggests some reductions in alcohol consumption during COVID-19 restrictions were driven by individuals' reduced consumption outside of the home (e.g. on-premises), particularly in young men and high-risk drinkers [16] . Our analysis, focussing on beer consumption, likely reflects changes in men's drinking and is broadly consistent with those survey findings. The lack of data on wine or spirits represents a key limitation, as there is some possibility that substitution between beer and these categories may have occurred during the restrictions. However, our study nonetheless provides a detailed assessment of how consumption of the largest alcohol category -beer -has changed before and after the first and second waves of COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. Where possible, we tested for potential confounding factors that may bias our results (e.g. changes to unemployment benefits), though data limitations precluded examining some factors (e.g. changes in This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.household disposable income). Furthermore, while we estimate the effects on national aggregate beer consumption, the effects are likely to differ between individuals (e.g. heavy drinkers), beverage categories, and between state and territories depending on the extent of alcohol availability restrictions and other contextual factors.The most plausible explanation for the reductions in on-premises beer consumption we found during first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is reduced availability due to full closures or partial restrictions of on-premise alcohol outlets. However, other factors should be considered. Previous research shows that, during economic crises, budget constraints due to job loss or reduced income can lower drinking [33] , even when the plausible drivers of drinking such as stress are increased [4] . The increasing rate of unemployment in Australia during the pandemic underlines the salience of this factor, especially given the disproportionate rate of job losses among relatively low-paid casual workers [34] . However, in the current pandemic, financial constraints on drinking may have been partially offset by government assistance, including temporary increases in unemployment benefit payments, wage subsidies, the provision of free child care, and permitting individuals to apply for early access to retirement savings. Also, increases in income among those who remained employed (or became over-employed) may have affected consumption. However, there have also been reduced opportunities to drink during the pandemic that are likely to have contributed to lower consumption, including the cancellation of major events (e.g. sports, festivals), reduced tourism, physical distancing rules, bans on large gatherings, and directives to work from home.From a public health perspective, the apparent reductions in beer consumption represent an unexpected benefit from the COVID-19 restrictions. It is estimated that 4.5% of the total This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.burden of disease in Australia is due to alcohol use, ranking it as the 6th leading contributor to disease burden [35] . If the reductions in beer consumption are maintained, and occur similarly in other categories (e.g. wine, spirits), then substantial longer-term public health benefits are possible. Ongoing research is necessary to assess how consumption changes as COVID-19 related restrictions change in the coming months, alongside research to identify vulnerable groups who may have experienced increases in drinking and harm during the pandemic.

In response the Australian government initially closed its international borders to all non-residents on 20-March and followed with different stages of restriction and lockdown. The national Stage 1 restriction was introduced on midday 23-March which included the closure of non-essential businesses, restriction on social gatherings and social distancing rules. 1 Australia moved to Stage 2 restriction from 11:59pm on 25-March with further restrictions on indoor and outdoor social gatherings limited to two persons only and also introduced mandatory quarantine for 14 days after international travel on 28-March. 1 Further, Victoria moved to Stage 3 restriction from 11:59pm on 30-March by introducing the 'Stay at home' restrictions where Victorians could only leave home for four reasons (i.e. medical needs; work or study; exercising; or shop for food and essential supplies). During the lockdown in March-April in Melbourne, there were no reductions or restrictions on public transportation. In Victoria, restrictions began to ease from 11:59pm on 12-May onwards, included allowing family and friends to visit homes.Several studies have provided evidence demonstrating that there was a reduction in casual sex during lockdown; [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and this is also supported by the evidence of reduction in HIV post-exposure prophylaxis during lockdown in several countries. [7] [8] [9] Hence, it is reasonably hypothesised that these changes are likely to have translated in a reduction in sexually transmitted infections (STI). However, there has been very limited research examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STIs. We aimed to examine the patterns and changes of STI diagnoses and access to sexual health services before and after lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia.This study was conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) between January and June 2020. MSHC is the largest public sexual health service in Victoria in Australia, which provides approximately 50,000 consultations annually between 2017 and 2019 (with an average quarterly number of consultations of 13,000 in the first quarter and 12,000 in the second, third and fourth quarter), but the total number of consultations did not vary substantially across seasons at MSHC. 10 All consultations, HIV/STI testing and treatment are free of charge for all individuals. MSHC remained open during the lockdown period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no change in medical staff but up to 25% of the nursing staff were moved to COVID-19 duties elsewhere (e.g.contact tracing for COVID-19). However, this did not change any clinic practices or processes as the clinic was quiet and underutilised during lockdown. MSHC operates a walk-in service for individuals with symptoms and for urgent matters but individuals who did not have any symptoms were required to call the clinic for an appointment for a face-to-face visit, this remained unchanged before and after the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our on-site lab was still operating as usual during the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 lockdown period, and there were no changes in the services in relation to testing and samples collection other than MSHC moved from clinician-collected to self-collected throat swabs. 11 MSHC did not offer any off-site or home testing throughout the period. Upon arrival, all clients were first screened for flu-like symptoms and had their temperature taken. Individuals were asked not to attend the clinic if they (1) were waiting for the testing result of a COVID-19 test; (2) tested positive for COVID-19; (3) were required to be self-isolated due to COVID-19; or (4) had symptoms of COVID-19. The same rules applied to all staff at MSHC. Individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 were not seen at MSHC and were sent to the hospital for COVID-19 testing. Phone consultations were only provided to stable patients living with HIV in a dedicated HIV clinic that is not part of this analysis, but not to other patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.Consultations data were extracted from the electronic medical record at MSHC and were stratified by sex (males, females, or others). 'Others' sex was defined as individuals who self-reported their sex as intersex, transgender or other. Data included the type of consultation (e.g. asymptomatic screening vs symptomatic/urgent), reasons for attendance (e.g. reporting as a contact of infection, requesting a sex work certificate), diagnoses of STI, number of sex partners in the preceding 3 months, and the time between symptoms onset to clinic attendance. We were interested in STI diagnoses among four different client groups -(i) those presenting for an 'asymptomatic screen' defined as individuals who did not have any symptoms and attended the clinic for an on-site lab-based testing for HIV/STI, and did not require a physical examination; (ii) those presenting as 'symptomatic/urgent cases' defined as those presented with symptoms related to STI (e.g. genital discharge, genital ulcer and pelvic pain) and or those requiring urgent attention (e.g. accessing post-exposure prophylaxis); (iii) those presenting as a 'contact of infection' defined as individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with an STI (including gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and Mycoplasma genitalium); and (iv) those requesting a 'sex work certificate' defined as individuals working in the sex work industry who requiring an in-date certificate as the evidence of 3-monthly HIV/STI screening (a legal requirement for anyone doing sex work in Victoria). 12 Eight common symptomatic STI or genital infections were selected as the outcomes in this study, this includes balanitis, bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, herpes (initial episodes or recurrent infections), infectious syphilis (primary or secondary syphilis), nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and urethral gonorrhoea. We did not look at asymptomatic conditions such as chlamydia and HIV because these conditions mainly relied on the frequency of asymptomatic screening which might be biased due to the COVID-19 pandemic or lockdown period.The number of consultations, STI diagnoses were summed across each week and plotted by calendar week starting from the week commencing on 6-January (Monday) to the week ending on 28-June (Sunday), stratified by the sex of the individuals. MSHC closes on public holidays and therefore the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 weekly number of consultations is biased if the public holiday occurs on a weekday; and hence, we adjusted the number of consultations by multiplying the weekly number by , where n is the number of working days and present both the crude number and the adjusted number of weekly consultations. 13 For 'asymptomatic screen' in males, we further stratified into either (1) men who have sex with men (MSM); or (2) males who had had sex with females only (MSW). This is because threemonthly HIV/STI screening is recommended for all sexually active MSM but not in heterosexuals.We further stratified the study period into three seven-week periods: (1) pre-lockdown ( Poisson regression models were used for the count data for the number of consultations and STI diagnoses, and the Poisson regression coefficients were calculated. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was calculated by exponentiating the Poisson regression coefficients and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. We reported the IRR in the lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown period; and in the post-lockdown compared to lockdown period. We reported the mean number of sex partners, and the regression coefficient (beta) was calculated from linear regression to determine whether there was any change (increase, decrease or no change) in the three time periods (prelockdown, during lockdown and post-lockdown). The mean time between symptoms onset to clinic attendance was also calculated. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (version 14, College Station, TX, USA). This study was approved by the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee, Melbourne, Australia (301/20).There were 21,576 clinical consultations between 6-January-2020 and 26-June-2020. There were about 1,100 consultations each week before lockdown that dropped dramatically in the weeks after the lockdown on 23-March-2020 to a low of 600 consultations per week ( Figure 1 ). The total number of consultations began to rise after three weeks of lockdown and reaching about 800 consultations each week in May-June but the weekly number of consolations was still lower compared to the level before lockdown. Compared to pre-lockdown period, there was a 40% reduction (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.57-0.62) in the total number of consultations during lockdown; however, there was an increase in the number of consultations in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.15; 95%CI:1.11-1.20) but the number was still lower compared to per-lockdown (Table 1) . M a n u s c r i p t 6There was a 68% reduction (IRR=0.32; 95%CI:0.30-0.35) in the number of consultations for asymptomatic screening during lockdown compared to pre-lockdown, with a 78% reduction (IRR=0.22; 95%CI:0.19-0.25) in females, followed by a 67% reduction (IRR 0.33; 95%CI:0.28-0.40) in heterosexual males, then a 58% reduction (IRR=0.42; 95%CI:0.38-0.48) in MSM (Table 1) .However, there was an increase in the number of consultations for asymptomatic screening in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.59; 95%CI:1.46-1.76) (Table 1) (Table 1) , with a nadir of 37 in the third week of lockdown but it began to rise since May and returned to the level before lockdown ( Figure 2 ). There was also a marked decline with a 91% reduction (IRR=0.09; 95%CI:0.04-0.18) in females attending the clinic for a sex work certificate during lockdown (Table 1, Figure 2 ).There was a 41% reduction in the number of symptomatic/urgent cases (IRR=0.59; 95%CI:0.56-0.63) in the lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown although this was lower than was seen for asymptomatic screening. Symptomatic presentations with more mild symptoms showed a marked reduction, a 45% reduction (IRR=0.55; 95%CI:0.41-0.75) in balanitis in males, a 46% reduction (IRR=0.54; 95%CI:0.44-0.67) in bacterial vaginosis in females, a 40% reduction (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.50-0.71) in NGU in males, and a 38% reduction (IRR=0.62; 95%CI:0.49-0.77) in candidiasis in females. There was also a significant reduction in conditions with short incubation period, this included a 45% reduction in urethral gonorrhoea (IRR=0.55; 95%CI:0.39-0.77) and a 59% reduction in initial herpes (IRR=0.41; 95%CI:27-0.61). However, conditions with more marked symptoms showed a non-significant change in the lockdown period: this included PID (IRR=0.95; 95%CI:0.61-1.47) and infectious syphilis (IRR=1.14; 95%CI:0.73-1.77). There was no significant change in all STI diagnoses in post-lockdown compared with the lockdown period (Table 1, Figure 3 ).Among those who presented with symptoms and reported the number of days of symptoms, the mean number of days between symptom onset and clinic attendance in lockdown (31. 7 To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STI diagnoses and access to sexual health services during lockdown in Australia and one of the few internationally. We found dramatic reductions in attendances particularly for low-risk reasons such as asymptomatic screening. There were less marked reductions for symptomatic individuals and no significant reductions among some more symptomatic and important clinical conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease or syphilis. Interestingly, attendances for asymptomatic screening rose quickly in the post-lockdown period but no significant increases were seen for symptomatic conditions, suggesting possibly that the lockdown may have also caused a reduction in the incidence of these conditions in addition to discouraging attendances to our clinical service. The number of sexual partners almost halved among MSM during the study period with some suggestion of a recovery in the post-lockdown period, a finding that is consistent with the failure of STIs diagnoses to rise in the post-lockdown period despite marked rises in asymptomatic screening. Given the important contribution that clinical services make to STI control, it may be that a public health campaign is needed to encourage screening of those at risk, and more importantly to encourage symptomatic individuals to seek healthcare promptly.The reduction in asymptomatic screening at the beginning of lockdown is not unexpected as attendances at all health services including cancer screening programs reported reductions in attendances. 14 However, some reduction may also be explained by changes in sexual practices during the lockdown. 4 An Australian online survey conducted in April-May 2020 has revealed that Australians reported fewer casual hook-ups during lockdown (8%) compared to 2019 (31%). 3 In August-2020, the Terrence Higgins Trust in the UK has recommended some safe sex practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stop kissing, wearing a face mask during sex, changing sexual positions where there are no face-to-face contacts although it is not clear how widely these recommendations have been adopted. 15 Further studies will be required to examine whether individuals have changed their practices as per these recommendations during the COVID-19A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8 pandemic. Another explanation of the reduction in asymptomatic screening could be due to the fear of catching COVID-19 when visiting clinics, 2 and individuals might have delayed their regular HIV/STI screening. Our data has also shown that the number of asymptomatic screening gradually increased in the post-lockdown period, this is either because the COVID-19 epidemic in Melbourne began to be under control in May-June or individuals began to resume sex. This increase in presentations fits with a similar pattern seen among individuals reporting a contact of infections.We also observed there was a significant reduction in the number of sex work certificates issued. This is likely to due to the closure of brothels in Victoria since March-2020 and therefore no need for sex workers to obtain certificates which are required under Victorian law to work in brothels. Some sex workers might have changed their services from in-person to virtual (e.g. webcamming and phone sex). 16 Sex workers in Victoria have low HIV/STI prevalence and hence they do not drive STI rates in Victoria. 17 18 A previous study has shown that sex workers acquire most STIs from their non-paying private partners but not from their clients. 19 Further research is needed to examine the impact COVID-There was a marked reduction in most but not all STI diagnoses. Milder conditions (e.g. bacterial vaginosis, balanitis) had moderate reductions of about 45% but some conditions (e.g. infectious syphilis, PID) did not reduce virtually at all despite large reductions in other conditions. It is not possible to determine why this difference occurred; however, one could postulate that the seriousness or nature of the symptoms contributed to the continued attendance for some conditions. The failure to see a resurgence in all STI diagnoses may in part relate to a reduction in the incidence of some conditions, a finding that is consistent with the reduction in the number of sexual partners observed in some groups. There are several limitations to this study. First, this study was conducted in one urban sexual health clinic in Melbourne. Our findings may not be generalisable to other Australian states or countries due to the different level of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Second, some individuals were worried about catching COVID-19 when visiting clinics and might have delayed in seeking healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 Although the time from symptoms onset to clinic attendance did not differ before and after lockdown in our study, we were unable to stratify these data by different STI diagnoses due to small sample size as not all individuals reported the number of days with symptoms. Third, we collected the partners number three months preceding the date of attendance and therefore it might have underestimated the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on sexual practices. In addition, we only collected the number of partners and this may not represent the frequency of sexual encounters over the period which is an important factor for STI transmission. Fourth, we were unable to compare the STI diagnoses at our clinic to the state-wide or national-wide surveillance data as most of these conditions were not notifiable in Australia.By the end of June, the COVID-19 epidemic in most Australian states and territories was under control, except for Victoria. 22 The number of daily COVID-19 cases continued to rise since late-June in Victoria and peaked at 700 cases reported on 5-August. 23 Victoria recorded a total of 12,600 cases (66% of the cases in Australia) by the end of July. 24 --*The total number of consultations was adjusted by multiplying the weekly number by , where n is the number of working days to minimise the bias of public holiday effects. † Asymptomatic screen was defined as individuals who did not have any symptoms and attended the clinic for HIV/STI screening. ‡ Symptomatic/urgent case was defined as individuals presented with symptoms related to STI (e.g. genital discharge, genital ulcer and pelvic pain) and or those requiring urgent attention (e.g. accessing post-exposure prophylaxis). § A 'sex work certificate' was defined as individuals working in the sex work industry who require requiring an in-date certificate as the evidence of 3-monthly HIV/STI screening (a legal requirement for anyone doing sex work in Victoria). ¶ Contact of infection was defined as individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with an STI (including gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and Mycoplasma genitalium).

The case from Singapore was a 27-year-old microbiologist who was working with a non-attenuated strain of West Nile virus in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at a university in which research on SARS-CoV was also done. 2 No history of SARS-CoV exposure was reported and there was no relevant travel history. The case in Taiwan was a 44-year-old researcher who had been testing herbal remedies against SARS-CoV at a research laboratory. 3 Although the individual was not in the contagious phase when they travelled, 90 contacts in Singapore and Taiwan were quarantined, none of whom was eventually found to be infected. With the case from Taiwan, SARS-CoV was most probably contracted while cleaning spilled waste liquid in the biosafety level 4 laboratory.The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Taskforce on COVID-19 did a global survey between April 16 and May 1, 2020, to better understand how biochemistry laboratories have mitigated biohazard risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. 4,5 1210 responses were analysed, 1067 of which were from hospital laboratories that handle moderate volumes of samples daily. 4 During the survey period, 186 laboratories restricted tests on patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 and 171 laboratories restricted tests on patients with confirmed COVID-19. 5 The most common restric tions were on tests of pleural fluid and respiratory samples followed by faecal tests, urine tests, and direct microscopy. 5 819 laboratories had increased the frequency of disinfection, most usually from once a day to four times a day. 5 Use of pneumatic tube transport to deliver samples was reported to have diminished since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with hand deliveries increasing, and more layers of plastic bags were used to contain samples from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 4 992 laboratories denied requests for add-on testing for patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 and 814 laboratories denied requests for add-on testing for patients with confirmed COVID-19. 4 290 lab ora tories autoclaved blood samples of patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 and 276 laboratories autoclaved blood samples of patients with confirmed COVID-19. 4 Using a discrete event simulation, Lim and colleagues 1 modelled the effect of different combinations of staff roster arrangements on workplace transmission of COVID-19 using a simulated index staff who had community-acquired infection over 3 weeks. The number of shifts per day, the number of staff per shift, total number of staff accessible to work in the laboratory, shift change frequency, team-splitting arrangements, and fixed work-rest days were all considered in the model. Lim and colleagues noted that a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was associated with a smaller staff pool, a higher number of shifts per day, a larger staff number per shift, and longer consecutive days worked. 1 Of note, use of personal protective equipment and physical distancing significantly reduced the transmission rate. 1 Lim and colleagues proposed that laboratories should consider arranging staff into smaller teams and reducing the number of consecutive days worked. 1 Test and service restrictions could have adverse effects on health-care services-eg, by depriving clinicians of","Australia","first author","2020-11-04","11"

Despite being ethically and legally fraught, immediate demands on the public healthcare system, infrastructure, and community services posed by the pandemic have resulted in healthcare rationing demanding serious consideration. Healthcare rationing has broadly focused on immediate needs such as the allocation of resources such as diagnostic testing kits, ICU (and hospital) beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE). These issues have captured the attention of wider society, extending beyond the narrow scope of discussion amongst healthcare workers. The novel coronavirus has perhaps itself created a novel circumstance-bringing the issue of healthcare rationing to the fore. This may be the first time that many individuals have been compelled to engage in uncomfortable conversations about the prioritization of medical treatment. Moreover, for many, this may be their first time experiencing the death of a loved one and grieving in isolation without the support of others. Before COVID-19, healthcare rationing rarely received public attention. However, decisions to prioritize medical treatment for some individuals over others occur routinely.This short article will briefly highlight circumstances where implicit and some explicit healthcare rationing decisions occur in everyday practices-broadly against an Australian backdrop, but where relevant, some U.K. examples will be drawn on. This will be followed by an exploration of some of the key ethical principles in the context of rationing and a brief consideration of the value that these principles ultimately provide during a time of global crisis when rationing decisions must be promptly made. This article argues that the pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlightand as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain.Observing the experience of countries that share similar public healthcare systems to its own, Australia has been preparing for the possibility of intensive care units (ICUs) becoming inundated with patients and its healthcare system becoming overburdened-where life or death decisions may need to be made. Some ethicists have also been grappling with the moral dilemma of whether healthcare workers should be given priority care if rationing becomes necessary (Sokol and Gray 2020) . The following discussion briefly explores some of the ethical principles that relate to healthcare rationing.Ethical Principles for Resource Allocation: How Valuable Are They During a Pandemic?There are broad-ranging philosophical differences in the academic literature about how ethical principles should guide healthcare rationing as well as varying interpretation of the principles that relate to distributive justice in healthcare (Scheunemann and White 2011; Childress and Beauchamp 2009; White et al. 2009; Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009) . However, it is beyond the scope of this short article to discuss this issue at length.The potential shortage of supply, and increasing demand for, medical resources due to COVID-19 present an intrinsically normative question: how can medical resources be equitably allocated during a crisis? While there are differing views on rationing, the central premise is that rationing relates to the denial of potentially beneficial medical resources or treatment due to shortage or scarcity (Truog et al. 2006 ).Much of the academic debate concerns how appropriate ethical principles of distributive justice in healthcare are to maximize the best results with the least expense. For this article, the discussion below will briefly consider four broadly cited and recognized ethical principles applied to rationing in healthcare (Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009; Scheunemann and White 2011 ).1. Egalitarianism: treat patients equally 2. Utilitarianism: benefit the greatest number 3. Prioritarianism: favour the worst off (sickest first, youngest first) 4. Promoting and rewarding social usefulness: prioritize specific individuals to enable them to promote other important values or to reward them for having promoted these values Each of the ethical principles above is problematic, raising a range of issues. Broadly, during a global pandemic, an egalitarian approach would encompass an equal opportunity to healthcare for all individuals. This approach often includes a ""lottery"" or ""first come, first served"" approach. Some supporters have stated that ""each person's desire to stay alive should be regarded as of the same importance and deserving of the same respect as that of anyone else"" (Harris 1970 quoted in Rivlin 2000 Stein 2002) . However, others have been more critical of this approach, suggesting that it is overly narrow. It also fails to take into consideration a range of factors that may contribute to systematic bias towards certain groups of society. Thus, an egalitarian approach lacks the equality and fairness that it aims to provide, for example, to those who may take longer to be admitted to hospital for treatment due to distance, disability, or socioeconomic status (Scheunemann and White 2011; Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009) . Utilitarian principles aim to maximize the number of lives saved. This might go some way towards resolving issues of ranking and judging the quality of individual lives-whereby each life is considered to be of value and there is no requirement to justify comparing lives to save them. Prioritarianism-attending to the worst off or sickest patients first also raises ethical concerns. Should the youngest (often vulnerable) patients be given priority treatment? Some have advocated that this ""life cycle principle"" should apply, given that the young have had the least opportunity to live through each of life's stages (Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009; White et al. 2009 ). The concept of treating the sickest people first-""the rule of rescue""-has been deemed by some as ""our moral response to the imminence of death [that] demands that we rescue the doomed"" (Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009, 424) . Further, it would seem ""intuitively obvious"" that those who are the sickest or facing death be treated first (McKerlie 2001). Conversely, it might be claimed that it is counterproductive to treat those who are likely to be worst off, rather than those who are healthier and likely to recover unaided or who have a greater chance of improvement overall. Lastly, while social value cannot solely drive healthcare allocation (Harris 1987) , it may be a consideration during a time of special circumstances, such as a pandemic, where an individual's social usefulness might be a factor in the prioritization of limited resources (Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009, 425) . This might include allocating healthcare resources towards an individual that contributes a significant value-for example, healthcare workers. By prioritizing their healthcare needs, we can benefit others. That is, if healthcare workers are treated as a priority, they will be in a position to treat other patients. Of course, this approach also has its flaws, amongst other things, this narrow approach arguably fails to recognize their intrinsic importance but rather the benefit that others can derive from them.The ethical principles for rationing healthcare discussed above are wide-ranging and differ considerably. Invariably, grappling with unpalatable rationing decisions is a complex and ethically fraught task as it requires accommodating moral values and objectivity. Attempting to balance the priorities of patients with the greatest need and those patients with the greatest capacity to benefit from treatment also raises challenges. Importantly, questions about the fair distribution of scarce healthcare resources cannot be philosophized about at length when emergency rationing decisions about critical care are necessary. In a crisis such as COVID-19, rationing decisions become clearer. Acute decisions about who should be treated and who should not be treated need to be made swiftly with little time for deep moral reasoning.Despite healthcare rationing becoming a more prominent discussion point during the global pandemic, healthcare rationing is not uncommon-although very rarely discussed publicly. The next section of this article explores some implicit and more explicit everyday practices of rationing that occur. The article then moves on to recommend that in a post-pandemic era (post-COVID-19), Australian policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions in the wider community-beyond a pandemic response. Further, healthcare rationing should be a more transparent process for members of society to better understand its mechanisms and its rationale. This is ethically and socially important.In most developed nations such as Australia, healthcare rationing continues to be a topic of controversy carrying long-standing societal taboo. COVID-19 has brought a sharp focus on rationing in academic literature and the popular press, especially in pandemic ravaged countries such as Italy (Beall 2020) , the United States (Truog, Mitchell, and Daley 2020; Emanuel et al. 2020 ) and the United Kingdom (Wilkinson 2020), regardless of their healthcare models. Despite this, rationing in healthcare is not unique or uncommon. Finite healthcare budgets do not permit all patients to receive unlimited access to healthcare. Rationing decisions occur in a range of everyday situations both implicitly and explicitly (Strech, Synofzik, and Marckmann 2008; Halpern 2009) .Implicit methods of rationing healthcare can include deterring access to healthcare by imposing barriers such as the need for treatment referrals before a patient can access specialist care and the use of waiting lists for elective surgery. Other healthcare rationing methods can include setting eligibility criteria and thresholds for certain healthcare services. Routinely, patients are unaware that rationing decisions are being made that can have life and death consequences. Yet very rarely, if at all, do healthcare professionals discuss rationing with patients, partly due to the social taboo that is tethered to rationing.An explicit type of rationing that occurs in the Australian context is government subsidized medication via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Acute rationing determinations are made about the efficacy and cost of medical treatment, technology, and other interventions that will be subsidized by the government. Decisions are made about which medical treatments and medical interventions will be funded under the government scheme and those that will not. Perhaps the most explicit and well-recognized form of rationing is emergency department triage. A triage system works by categorizing incoming patients to an emergency department into groups using a scale. It offers a sharp illustration of the prioritization of healthcare based on the severity of need of need and/or likelihood of recovery.To date, the Australian and English courts have been reluctant to engage in any broad discussion about healthcare rationing in case law-presumably because notions of placing a monetary value on life are ethically and morally repugnant and because of the judiciary's disinclination to involve itself in political and policy decision-making. However, it could be argued that the courts play some role in implicit rationing decisions in cases where further treatment may be considered by some to be less than favourable. In this vein, implicit rationing decisions under the guise of nebulous concepts such as ""futility,"" ""best interests,"" and ""quality of life"" may be made. Concepts such as ""medical futility"" have been well explored and controversially noted as subjective and value laden. The English courts have touched on the issue of fair allocation of limited healthcare resources in cases concerning publicly funded treatment. These, however, received little attention (Re J (a minor) (wardship: medical treatment) [1990] 1 WLR 898). Recently, the High Court did, however, take a robust approach in addressing the issue of rationing healthcare by granting a hospital trust an injunction to remove an inpatient considered to be sufficiently well enough to be discharged to make a bed available for a COVID-19 patient (University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust v MB [2020] EWHC 882 (QB)).This section of the article has provided some examples of implicit and explicit healthcare rationing in a range of different contexts. The following section will discuss the need for greater transparency in rationing discussions in the broader community in a postpandemic era.Healthcare rationing continues to be a socially taboo topic of discussion in liberal developed nations, with very little public, political, or professional (medical) debate. Some of the social taboo that surrounds rationing healthcare is polarized views in society about the allocation of resources. For example, it has been noted that discussion of explicit rationing of healthcare has been considered a cloak for potential euthanasia (Breyer 2013) . Other members of society may interpret rationing more robustly or offensively if they consider that another person's life might be given greater value or worth than their own when rationing decisions are being made.Despite the social taboo that pervades healthcare rationing, it is a necessary mechanism in public healthcare systems. Governments and policymakers need to continue to make tough rationing choices in fiscally constrained societies such as Australia. Indeed, rationing is likely to become even more critical in the aftermath of the pandemic as global economies begin to rebuild. During the pandemic, communities have placed a significant amount of trust in their elected leaders by accepting government healthcare advice and the suppression of physical liberties, otherwise unthinkable in pre-pandemic times (Archard 2020) . In the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers need to leverage this trust and goodwill to bring forward discussions about healthcare rationing.Discussions about healthcare rationing should be advanced with greater transparency. While rationing occurs routinely, members of the public that access healthcare know very little about how rationing decisions are made. Post-COVID-19 rationing should be discussed more broadly in communities and decisions to ration healthcare should be made using (amongst others) (i) evidence-based (ii) economic evaluation tools that are nationally consistent (Martin 2015) . Further, the allocation of healthcare resources should be discussed publicly and in terms that are easily understood by the diverse communities that public healthcare serves. Engaging in a transparent and honest discussion about rationing would benefit broader society in dispelling some of the social taboo and negative perceptions of rationing. Moreover, it would allow individuals to gain a better understanding of how public funds are allocated and distributed. Greater transparency in rationing would also improve the efficacy of the healthcare system more broadly. Discussions about rationing within communities and the public domain must shift from being an approach required as a pandemic response to forming part of our normal parlance in non-pandemic times. Normalizing discussion about rationing may also go some way to building greater public trust in the healthcare system and political system.Healthcare rationing is complex. There is often a moral tension between efficacy and equity in healthcare. However, as rationing decisions can have life and death consequences, this article concludes that it is ethically and morally responsible to ensure that those accessing healthcare are provided with greater levels of transparency in how decision-making occurs not only for healthcare that individuals are able to access but more importantly for healthcare that they may be unable to access.In this spirit, future policy and public discussion about healthcare rationing should work towards greater transparency about how rationing decisions are determined. Instead of implicit arbitrary rationing decisions, robust objective considerations should be made unambiguously and with greater transparency. This would go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare, making it less sensationalized as an emergency pandemic response.","Australia","first author","2020-11-09","11"

ScienceDirect","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed critical pressure on health services to maintain access to personal protective equipment, in particular surgical masks [1] . The unprecedented crisis has seen regional shortages, which compromise the safety of frontline staff, and risk uncontrolled spread of infection. In response, there has been growing concern from healthcare workers that has seen the launch of campaigns such as GetMePPE in the United States, and properPPE in the United Kingdom [2, 3] . Concerningly, low income countries are particularly affected [4] .Given the risk of ongoing inadequacy in the global supply chain, there is the need for practical and innovative solutions [5] . In this context, some centres have proposed manufacturing surgical masks from sterilisation wrap used to protect surgical instruments as a contingency plan [6] . The rationale for this method is that both products are made from similar non-woven polypropylene fabric formed from layers fused with spunbound meltblown spunbound processing. Commercial reports also show similar bacterial filtration efficiency. Further, this material is routinely stocked at hospitals, likely with decreased need at times of low elective surgical activity.However, whilst it has been the focus of considerable public interest, there has been limited assessment of the safety of this practice. Therefore, we developed our own surgical mask prototypes from sterilisation wrap and performed tests to evaluate whether they met regulatory standards.Two surgical mask prototypes were developed from H300 and H500 Halyard One-Step Sterilisation Wrap, which both contain two layers of material [7] . H300 and H500 refers to different grades of sterilisation wrap designed to correlate with tensile strength, and were chosen for practical reasons as they were the most common type stocked at our tertiary hospital. The masks were manufactured by a local textile company. A small metal strip was inserted into the top half of the mask permitting moulding around the nose. Fabric cable ties were stitched onto the sides to permit tying of the mask behind the head (Fig. 1 ).We assessed whether surgical mask prototypes complied with official standards. There are different North American (ASTM F2100-19), European (EN 14683:2019) and Australian (AS 4381:2015) regulations that grade surgical masks (Table  1) [8e10]. Further details of the tests incorporated in these standards are described in Table 2 .Specifications and results of testing for commercial Halyard One-Step sterilisation wrap were initially obtained by directly contacting the manufacturer [7] . As results were lacking on two common tests (differential pressure, and synthetic blood resistance), we conducted experiments at the Walter Bassett Aerodynamics Laboratory at the University of Melbourne to evaluate these parameters.The differential pressure test was designed in line with BS EN14683:2019 guidelines [9] . Five masks of each prototype were tested. Each mask was cut into six samples with all layers preserved. The samples were installed at the cross- section of a circular pipe with a diameter of 25 mm. A flow rate of 8 L/min was established using compressed air. Two rotameters were used to measure flow rates at the inlet and outlet sections of the pipe to ensure no air leaks were present. Differential pressure (dP) was measured with static pressure taps on the upstream and downstream side of the mask samples connected to a high accuracy differential pressure transducer (10 Torr 698A MKS Baratron with MKS type 270 signal conditioner). The surgical masks were not preconditioned, however the laboratory environment guaranteed quasi-constant temperature and relative humidity of 19.5 AE 0.5 C and 45 AE 5%, respectively. The mean differential pressure value across all test specimens was calculated and used to determine compliance with standards.The synthetic blood penetration test was developed in accordance with the ASTM F1862 protocol [11] . 25H300 and 29H500 masks were tested. The synthetic blood was prepared by mixing distilled water (0.78 l), Acrysol G111E thickening agent (40.0 g) and red dye (8.0 g). The specific gravity of the resulting mixture was 1.00 (measured with a hydrometer) and the surface tension was 60.5 dyn/cm (measured via the capillary rise method), which satisfied the ASTM F1862 conditions. 2 mL of synthetic blood was spurted through a 1.27 cm long 18-gauge stainless steel cannula. The dispensing system could accurately deliver the flow at velocities of 450, 550 and 635 cm/s, corresponding to pressure values inside the cannula of 80, 120 and 160 mmHg, respectively. The complete masks were installed on a specimen holder 30.5 cm from the cannula outlet. Pleats were stretched when mounting the prototype so that the testing area contained a single layer of the mask. A target plate with a 3/16-inch diameter hole was placed between the cannula and the mask to ensure the fluid stream hit the desired area. Blood penetration was visually assessed within 10 s. The test was considered passed if the blood did not penetrate through to the inner layer. The masks were initially tested at the highest pressure of 160 mmHg, with plans to sequentially downgrade to lower pressures if three or more samples failed. The masks were not preconditioned. During all tests the laboratory had a stable temperature of 17.5 AE 0.5 C and a relative humidity of 51 AE 1%. The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) of 4.0% mandated in the ASTM F1862 protocol would require that 32 masks be tested and that 29 of the 32 masks pass.Results of standardised testing on sterilisation wrap and mask prototypes are summarised in Table 3 .Bacterial filtration efficiency and flammability specifications were provided for Halyard One-Step sterilisation wrap by the commercial manufacturer.Differential pressure results from our own experiment are shown in Fig. 2 . The prototype made from the thinner H300 Halyard One-Step wrap met regulations (mean Z 4.98 Manufacturing masks with sterilisation wrap mmH 2 O/cm 2 ), whilst the thicker H500 prototype did not (mean Z 7.87 mmH 2 O/cm 2 ).In the synthetic blood penetration test, all prototypes (25 masks from H300 wrap, and 29 from H500 wrap) passed at the highest-pressure threshold of 160 mmHg. Complete raw data is available in the supplementary material.In the context of uncertain supply chains, the current COVID-19 pandemic risks regional and periodic shortages of surgical masks, especially as some hospitals in areas of wide-spread community transmission adopt a policy of universal masking for all staff. Therefore, to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients, contingency plans are required.In this report, we assessed the feasibility of manufacturing surgical masks from sterilisation wrap and tested the safety of a prototype against the necessary standards. Whilst there is slight variation in North American, European and Australian grading, they all rely on similar protocolised tests. Based on data from the commercial manufacturer Halyard and our own experiments, our prototypes fulfilled requirements for bacterial filtration efficiency, flammability, and synthetic blood penetration resistance. The thinner H300 mask met differential pressure standards, whilst the thicker H500 design did not. The clinical implications of this are uncertain, as the process by which exact regulatory thresholds were determined is not publicly described. Lastly, ASTM F2999 Particulate Filtration Efficiency was not performed or reported elsewhere, although notably this is not required in Australian nor European regulations [12] .Collectively, these results suggest surgical masks produced from sterilisation wrap may offer a similar level of barrier protection to droplets, can be used in clinical scenarios with risk of high velocity fluid exposure, and (for the thinner prototype) have adequate breathability. Evaluates the filtration efficiency of particles 0.1 mm in size. The challenge material used consists of latex aerosol spheres in a controlled airflow chamber Fluid/synthetic blood penetration resistance (ASTM F1862, ISO22609) 2 mL of synthetic blood is spurted through a small cannula onto the surface of the face mask, and the inside is observed for penetration. It can be evaluated at three different velocities corresponding to a human blood pressure of 80, 120, and 160 mm Hg. Differential pressure (Delta P) -'Breathability' (EN 14683)Determines the facemask's resistance to airflow. A controlled flow of air is driven through the mask, and the pressure before and after is measured. The difference in pressure is divided by the surface (in cm2) of the sample. A lower breathing resistance indicates a better comfort level for the user. The mean of all tested samples is reported. Flammability (16 CFR Part 1610)Exposes the face mask material to a flame and measures the time required for the flame to proceed up the material a distance of 127 mm (5 inches). Class 1 means the material exhibits normal flammability and is acceptable for use in clothing.a Note the PFE is not considered a measure of respirator performance. For masks to be classified as N95 respirators, they must undergo a different filtration test guided by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). However, our findings only pertain to surgical masks, and not N95 respirators, which are certified by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [13] . They are designed to offer a higher level of protection against airborne particles, and current World Health Organisation guidelines recommend restricting their use for aerosol generating procedures [14] . When producing masks from sterilisation wrap was first proposed by the University of Florida Department of Anaesthesia as part of their 'Mask Alternate' initiative, numerous reports claimed it offered a filtration rate more effective than N95 respirators [6, 15] . These statements were falsely extrapolated from bacterial filtration efficiency, which is not used to certify respirators, and therefore cannot be used as justification to manufacture N95 prototypes. In comparison to surgical masks, a different metric of filtration is assessed by NIOSH. Uncharged NaCl aerosol particles with an aerodynamic mass median diameter of 0.3 mm are sent through the filter at a flow rate of 85l/min. Lammers et al. subjected Halyard H600 sterilisation wrap to this test and found filtration efficiencies of 64.5% and 78.3% through one and two layers respectively [16] . Three further studies have reported on sub-micron filtration in their prototypes. Long et al. detail a filtration efficiency of 96.5% with two layers of H500 wrap [17] . Meijer et al. claim a filtration efficiency of 93.8% through three layers of Halyard H300, whilst Walawalkar et al. report an efficiency of 92.1% through two layers [18, 19] . However, their methods differ considerably to those outlined in NIOSH regulations with variation in particle size, type, flow rates, and particulate counters. This explains the heterogeneity in results and limits direct comparison to N95 specifications. Further, prototypes would need undergo specific fit testing in order to provide appropriate protection. Consequently, the current data assessing NIOSH standards does not justify the use of sterilisation wrap to make N95 respirator alternatives.There are certain limitations to our report. We used a specific brand and strength of sterilisation wrap for our prototypes, and therefore results are not necessarily generalisable to masks developed from different commercial wraps, or by a different manufacturer. Further, whilst our methodology for differential pressure and synthetic blood resistance testing was designed to closely replicate ASTM F1862 and BS EN 14683:2019 protocols respectively, we were not able to precondition our specimens, thus resulting in a slightly lower temperature and relative humidity then indicated.Despite these caveats, we believe this report offers practical guidance for clinicians and policy makers in areas of need. Our surgical mask prototypes provide proof of concept, and our assessment in the context of regulatory standards indicates acceptable barrier and breathability properties can be achieved. Although unlikely to fully meet demand in isolation, these findings suggest manufacturing surgical masks from sterilisation wrap is a reasonable method to supplement stock if required. Further research could investigate the potential re-use of masks by evaluating the relevant tests following re-processing and disinfection. Notably, sterilisation wrap is routinely used in hospitals, and at the time of major outbreaks, elective surgical activity is likely to be low, thereby facilitating increased availability for mask production. Nevertheless, unless there are shortages mandating alternatives, healthcare workers should always use approved personal protective equipment.Ethics approval was not required for this study.Dr Sam E.

Children are predominantly infected from symptomatic household adult contacts 4, 5 . Children have comparatively milder COVID-19 disease and up to one-third are asymptomatic 6 . The immunological basis for milder pediatric disease is unclear, but may be relevant to other viral pandemics where striking age-related epidemiological differences were observed 7 . In SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduced respiratory epithelial expression of the ACE2 receptor and trained innate immunity in children have been proposed 8,9 . Investigating immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups is key to understanding disease susceptibility, severity determinants, and vaccine candidates. Detailed investigations of immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported in adults [10] [11] [12] , with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 causing specific T cell responses without seroconversion 13 . Data on immune responses in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are limited.Here, we show that three children repeatedly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in their household mount cellular and antibody-mediated immune responses similar to their infected parents and specific to SARS-CoV-2, without virological confirmation of infection.Patient Characteristics. Two parents (mother 38 years, and father 47 years) residing in Melbourne, Australia, attended a 3hour wedding inter-state without their children, in early March 2020. They returned home 3-days later and developed cough, coryza, and subjective fevers, followed by lethargy and headache for a total of 14 (mother, A1) and 11 days (father, A2) (Fig. 1 ). Seven days after the onset of the parents' symptoms, child one (male 9 years, C1) developed a mild cough, coryza, sore throat, abdominal pain, and loose stools, and child 2 (male 7 years, C2) developed mild cough and coryza. The third child (female 5 years, C3) was asymptomatic. Eight days after the onset of the parents' symptoms, they were notified of an emerging outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 traced to the wedding. The parents were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs taken the same day. Repeated NP swabs from the children were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Physical distancing precautions were not feasible in the household. Child 3 had particularly close contact, sleeping in the parents' bed throughout the period both parents were unwell. All family members recovered fully without requiring medical care.SARS-CoV-2 testing. Serial samples, including blood, saliva, NP swabs, feces, and urine, were collected from all family members approximately every 2-3 days (Fig. 1) . Daily symptoms were recorded in a standardized diary. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the parents on days 8 and 12 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive. All NP, saliva, and stool samples from the children were PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the children were all positive for rhinovirus by a multiplex respiratory viral panel on day 10.Children and parents show an active cellular immune response. We investigated the cellular immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from all family members on days 12, 37, and 88 by flow cytometry. Both parents and children had high proportions of CD8 T cells at day 12 that subsequently decreased (Fig. 2a) , a decline associated with a corresponding increase in the proportion of CD4 T cells in all samples. Strikingly low proportions of monocytes were observed on day 12 in all family members, particularly in C3 (0.12%) relative to her siblings (average 0.5%) and parents (average 0.88%) (Fig. 2a) . Monocytes returned to circulating proportions in all family members by day 37 (average 4.1%) and day 88 (average 2.5%). These signatures were also identified by unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensionality reduction, where tSNE clusters corresponding to CD8 T, CD4 T, and monocytes in parents and children showed identical sequential changes to those observed by manual gating (Fig. 2b ). Low proportions of monocytes were observed in all circulating subsets with reductions in CD16 + subsets most evident (Fig. 2c) . Both parents showed increases in central (T CM ) and effector (T EM ) memory CD8 T cells by day 88 (Fig. 2d) , and CD8 T cell expression of the exhaustion marker PD1 increased in all family members over time (Fig. 2e ). CD4 T EM cells reduced over time in the parents, and one parent (A2) had a marked decline in the CD4 effector (T EMRA ) cell population (Fig. 2f) . The heterogeneous cellular immune responses observed in all family members at the first timepoint are consistent with emerging evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults, including broad changes in the frequency, phenotype, and activation status of CD8 and CD4 T cells 14 . Depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including monocytes (particularly CD16 + subsets) has also been observed in COVID-19 15 .A study comparing the blood and lung profiles of patients with severe COVID-19 revealed that non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from the blood into the lungs during disease 16 . We observed further alterations in the myeloid compartment in our whole blood analysis. Low proportions of neutrophils were evident in all family members at day 12, particularly in C3 (5.1%) relative to her siblings (average 10.4%) and parents (average 15.5%) (Fig. 2g ). Circulating neutrophils returned to an average of 30.5% in children and 45.4% in parents by day 88, a time point associated with the appearance of low-density immature neutrophils (SSC hi CD16 + CD14 +/− ) in PBMCs of all family members (Fig. 2b, h) . Pre-and immature-neutrophils in PBMC fractions have been recently described in SARS-CoV-2 infected adults 17 . In our study, parent A1 and all children had high proportions of eosinophils at all time points (Fig. 2g) with elevated eosinophils in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients during the recovery phase. Their role remains unclear 18 . Our analyses highlighted that active cellular immune responses in the family members were not accompanied by a corresponding increase in plasma cytokine levels, consistent with mild or absence of symptoms. We quantified 18 plasma cytokines using a custom multiplex bead array and only IL-8, MCP-1, and CCL5 (RANTES) were detectable (Fig. 2i) , with levels remaining constant over time, excluding C1 and C2 who had a~2-fold increase in RANTES levels at day 37 (Fig. 2i) . A case of mild adult COVID-19 disease reported an identical plasma cytokine signature to that observed in our family members 12 . RANTES 37  88  12  37  88  12  37  88  12  37  88  12  37  88  12  37  88   50   40   30 has also recently been shown to be elevated in patients with both mild and severe COVID-19. In critically ill patients, blocking this pathway with a CCR5-targeted monoclonal antibody resulted in the restoration of T cell counts and reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load 19 .To explore SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune responses, we first quantified salivary and plasma antibodies against the S1 protein by ELISA. Saliva from all family members tested positive for IgA antibodies against the S1 protein at all timepoints (Fig. 3a) . A2 had high levels of salivary anti-S1 IgA at day 12, one day after symptom resolution. C1 and C2 also had increased anti-S1 salivary IgA ( Fig. 3a ; day 25 and day 18 samples, respectively), coincident with symptom resolution. Anti-S1 IgM and IgG were present in most salivary samples, but with a less consistent pattern in family members. Both parents and C3 had detectable levels of plasma IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein at all timepoints (Fig. 3b) . IgG levels increased between timepoints for parent A2; those for parent A1 remained stable. Levels of S1specific IgA in plasma were only detected in A1. Finally, A1 had a robust neutralizing antibody response on days 12, 37, and 88 (titers 403, 226, and 160, respectively) (Fig. 3c ). A2 and C3 had a low level but detectable neutralizing antibody activity in sera on days 12 and 37, respectively. Serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 are associated with disease severity 20, 21 , although data from children who often have milder disease or are likely to be asymptomatic are limited. In our study, children had low to undetectable serum antibodies while both parents had strong serum IgG responses out to day 88. More studies are needed to determine antibody magnitude and kinetics in children, including those with mild disease.Serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. To further characterize whether the children had serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity despite being PCR negative, we undertook a systems serology analysis using a CoV-specific multiplex panel with the inclusion of additional aged-matched pre-pandemic healthy individuals. All family members, including the children, exhibited SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody features that differed from pre-pandemic controls (Fig. 4) . This included serological signatures against the S1 protein, as well SARS-CoV-2 Trimer S, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 with enhanced ability to bind Fcγ receptors or complement (C1q), suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within this family induced Fc functionally active IgG subclass profiles. In addition, both parents, but not the children, had serological responses to other non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (Fig. 4c) . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that C3 clustered closest to her parents in all responses. C1 and C2, who had no evidence of a serologic response, clustered closest to the healthy controls whilst still exhibiting a SARS-COV-2 positive signature (Fig. 4c ).Our combined salivary and serological findings show that, despite having no virological evidence of infection, all three children developed antibody responses against various SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Of the three children, C3, who remained asymptomatic throughout, demonstrated the most robust antibody response. We also observed that symptom resolution in A2, Fig. 3 Salivary and plasma antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by ELISA and by microneutralization assay. a Anti-S1 salivary IgA, IgG, and IgM. # IgA anti-S1 response that developed concurrent with resolution of symptoms. b Anti-S1 plasma IgA, IgG, and IgM. c Neutralizing antibody activity in plasma.

SARS-CoV-2 likely infects the salivary glands and is detectable in saliva 22 . Our data, therefore, provide evidence that control of SARS-CoV-2 at the site of infection may be mediated by a mucosal IgA antibody response. This potential key role for mucosal antibodies in protection warrants confirmation in larger studies. The timing of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing occurred while 2 of 3 children were symptomatic and on multiple specimens, reducing the possibility that they cleared the infection prior to testing. Whilst rhinovirus was identified in the children's respiratory panel, this is a common finding at our hospital and reflects recent exposure. The SARS-CoV-2 specific response identified in the saliva and serum would not be explained by this finding. This in-depth family case study provides novel insights into immunological responses in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Despite close contact with infected parents, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was repeatedly negative in all children, who developed minimal or no symptoms. However, the children had similar cellular and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-mediated immune responses to their parents, suggesting that the children were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but, unlike the adults, mounted an immune response that was highly effective in restricting virus replication. Whether this family will be protected from reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain, as only one parent demonstrated a robust neutralizing antibody response. However, potent antiviral RBD-specific antibodies from memory B cell clones have been identified from convalescent patients with undetectable serum neutralizing responses 23 , raising the possibility that the children in our study may also have some degree of protection. The discordance between the virological PCR results and clinical serological testing, despite an evident immune response, highlights limitations to the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR and current diagnostic serology in children. Our findings emphasize the need for further detailed investigation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 to advance our understanding of exposure and protective immunity in children.SARS-CoV-2 detection. RNA was manually extracted from 140 μL of NP swabs and saliva, 280 μL of urine, and plasma and 140 μL of 20% (w/v) fecal suspension 24 and then eluted in 50 to 60 μL sterile, molecular water (Life Technologies, Australia), using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (QIAgen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A previously published RT-PCR protocol targeting the RdRp gene was used on an ABI 7500 25 . The nucleotide sequences of primers and probe are shown in Supplementary Table 2 . SARS-CoV-2 standard (Exact Diagnostic, US) was used as a positive control for the PCR. Respiratory panel testing was by Ausdiagnostic viral panel.Plasma S1 and RBD ELISA. The ELISA method used to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA levels to SARS-COV-2 S1 and RBD protein was based on Amanat et al. 26 .

The following day, plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 (PBS-T) and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Tween and 10% (w/v) skim milk (PBS-TSM) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Serial dilutions (3-fold) of plasma samples were prepared in PBS-TSM starting at 1:50. A positive control (convalescent sample) and negative control (pre-pandemic) sample were used in all assays. The blocking solution was removed and 100 µl of each serial dilution was added to the plates for 2 h at RT. The plates were then washed three times with 200 µl per well of PBS-T. Goat anti-human IgG-(1:10,000) or IgM-(1:5,000) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotech) was prepared in PBS-TSM, and 50 µl of this secondary antibody was added to each well for 1 h. For IgA, 50 µL of biotinylated IgA (1:5000) was diluted in PBS-T and added to each well for 1 h, followed by the addition of Streptavidin-HRP to each well for 30 min. Plates were washed with PBS-T followed by distilled water and 50 µL of 3.3′, 5.5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sera Care) substrate solution was added for 9 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µL of 1 M phosphoric acid and optical densities measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek) at 450 nm (630 nm reference filter). Endpoint titers were calculated following background correction of the respective negative control reactivity in each assay.Saliva S1 protein ELISA. Saliva pooled under the tongue was drooled into a 50 mL tube and stored at −80°C until analyzed. Immuno MaxiSorp 96-well ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 µg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV S1 protein (Sino Biologicals) diluted in PBS. Wells were blocked with 10% skim milk in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. Two-fold serial dilutions of saliva samples in PBST were transferred to the ELISA plates (in duplicate) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Saliva from an asymptomatic individual confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 by clinical testing was used as a negative control. Saliva from a convalescent individual recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 was used as a positive control. Antibody binding was detected with biotinylated anti-human IgA (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) and IgG (1:10,000; Assay Matrix) for 1 hour at room temperature, then Streptavidin-HRP (1:5000; Life technologies) in PBST for 45 min at room temperature. Color was developed with TMB solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and H 2 O 2 with the reaction stopped using 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance at 450 nm was read on a microplate reader. Examples of titrations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 . OD values with negative control saliva were subtracted from the test samples at each dilution, then endpoint titers calculated.Microneutralisation assay. SARS-CoV-2 isolate CoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 27 passaged in Vero cells was stored at −80°C. Serial two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated plasma were incubated with 100 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h and residual virus infectivity was assessed in quadruplicate wells of Vero cells; viral cytopathic effect was read on day 5. The neutralizing antibody titer is calculated using the Reed/Muench method 28, 29 .Systems serology. Healthy participants. Age-matched children undergoing elective tonsillectomy (age 5-9) were recruited at the Launceston General Hospital (Tasmania) and, apart from fulfilling the criteria for tonsillectomy, they were considered otherwise healthy, showing no signs of immune compromise. Healthy adult donors (age 36-48) were recruited via the University of Melbourne. All healthy donors were recruited prior to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Heparinised blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g to collect plasma, which was frozen at −20°C until required.Coupling of carboxylated beads. A custom CoV multiplex assay was designed 30 , with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 (Sino Biological), SARS-CoV-2 Spike 2, SARS-CoV Spike 1 (ACRO Biosystems, USA), and hCoV (229E, NL63, OC43) spikes (Sino Biologicals), as well as SARS-CoV-2 RBD (produced under HHSN272201400008C and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH USA), SARS-CoV RBD (gift from Dale Godfrey) and both SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 Trimeric Spikes (gift from Adam Wheatley). Tetanus toxoid (Sigma Aldrich) and influenza hemagglutinin (H1Cal2009; Sino Biological) were also added to the assay as positive controls. Antigens were covalently coupled to magnetic carboxylated beads (Bio Rad) using a two-step carbodiimide reaction and blocked with 0.1% BSA, before being resuspended and stored in PBS 0.05% sodium azide for use.Luminex bead-based multiplex assay. The isotypes and subclasses of pathogenspecific antibodies present in collected plasma were assessed using the above multiplex assay 30 . Briefly, 20 µl of working bead mixture (1000 beads per bead region) and 20 µl of diluted plasma (final dilution 1:100) were added per well and incubated overnight at 4°C on a shaker. Pathogen-specific antibodies were detected using 14 different detectors. One-step detection was done using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human pan-IgG, IgG1-4, IgA1-2 (Southern Biotech; 1.3 µg/ml, 25 µl/well), where detectors were added to the beads, washed then read by the MagPix. C1q protein (MP Biomedicals, USA) was first biotinylated (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), then tetramerized with Streptavidin R-PE (SAPE; Thermo Fisher Scientific) before dimers or tetrameric C1q-PE were being used in one-step detection. For the detection of FcγR-binding, two-step detection was done by first adding soluble recombinant FcγR dimers (higher affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIa-H131, lower affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIa-R131, FcγRIIb, higher affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIIa-V158, lower affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIIa-F158; 1.3 µg/ml, 25 µl/well; gift from Bruce Wines and Mark Hogarth) to the beads, washing, followed by the addition of SAPE. Likewise, for IgM, two-step detection was done using biotinylated mouse anti-human IgM (mAb MT22; MabTech; 1.3 µg/ml, 25 µl/well;), followed by SAPE. Assays were repeated in duplicate.Data Pre-processing for Systems Serology Analysis. In the multivariate analysis, positive control antigens (Tetanus and H1Cal2009) were removed. All visit days were used for each individual. Data was right-shifted and then log-transformed (log10(x + 1)). Right shifting was performed on each feature (detector-antigen pair) that contained negative values individually, by adding the minimum value for that feature to all samples within that feature. For all multivariate analysis the data were mean-centered and variance scaled for each feature using the z-score function in Matlab.Feature Selection. To determine the minimal set of features (signatures) needed to classify the various cohorts, a three-step process was used based on 31 . First, the data were randomly sampled without replacement to generate 2000 subsets. All classes were resampled at the size of the smallest class for categorical outcomes, which corrected for any potential effects of class size imbalances during regularization. Elastic-Net regularization was then applied to each of the 2000 resampled subsets to select features most associated with cohort classifications. The Elastic-Net hyperparameter, alpha, was set to have equal weights between the L1 norm and L2 norm associated with the penalty function for the least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) and ridge regression, respectively which allows for better analysis of collinear data, which may be eliminated in LASSO regression 32 . The frequency at which each feature was selected across the 2000 iterations was used to determine the signatures by using a sequential step-forward algorithm that iteratively added a single feature into a PLSDA model starting with the feature that had the highest frequency of selection, to the lowest frequency of selection. Model prediction performance was assessed at each step and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation classification error. The model with the lowest classification error within a 0.01 difference between the minimum classification error was selected as the minimum signature. If only one feature was selected, the next best set of features was chosen. If consecutive feature sets were all equivalent, either the smallest or the largest set of features was chosen based on interpretability PLSDA. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), performed in Eigenvectors PLS toolbox in Matlab, was used in conjunction with Elastic-Net, described above, to identify and visualize signatures that distinguish cohorts. This supervised method assigns a loading to each feature within a given signature, and identifies the linear combination of loadings (a latent variable) that best separates the categorical groups. A feature with a high loading magnitude indicates greater importance for separating the groups from one another. Each sample is then scored and plotted using their individual response measurements expressed through the latent variables (LVs). The scores and loadings can then be cross-referenced to determine which features are loaded in association with which categorical groups (positively loaded features are higher in positively scoring groups etc). All models are created with 10 fold cross-validation, where iteratively 10% of the data is left out as the test set, and the rest is used to train the model. Model performance is measured through calibration error (average error in the training set) as well as cross-validation error (average error in the test set), with values near zero being best. All models were othronogonalized to enable clear visualization of results.Hierarchical Clustering. Cohort classification clustering was visualized for the Healthy vs. Household Cohort and based on their feature selected signatures described above, using unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering of zscored data. Euclidean distance was used as the distance metric.Software. PLSDA models were completed using the Eigenvector PLS toolbox in Matlab. Hierarchical Clustering was completed using MATLAB 2017b (MathWorks, Natick, MA). PLSDA scores and loadings plots were plotted in Prism version 8.0.0.Flow cytometry of PBMC and whole blood. Blood was collected in EDTA tubes from each participant at day 12, 37, and 88. Immediately following collection, 100 µl of whole blood was aliquoted for flow cytometry analysis. The remaining EDTA blood samples were processed into plasma and PBMC 33 . For flow cytometry analysis of whole blood samples, whole blood was lysed with 1 mL of red cell lysis buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 mL PBS and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. Following two more washes, cells were resuspended in PBS for viability staining using near infra-red viability dye according to manufacturer's instructions. For flow cytometry analysis of freshly isolated PBMC, cells were washed in 1 mL PBS prior to viability staining using BV510 viability dye according to manufacturer's instructions. For both whole blood and PBMC samples, the viability dye reaction was stopped by the addition of FACS buffer (2% heat-inactivated FCS in 2 mM PBS EDTA) and cells were centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in human FC-block according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 min at room temperature. The whole blood or PBMC antibody cocktails (Supplementary Table 1 ) made up at 2× concentration were added 1:1 with the cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Following staining, cells were washed with 2 mL FACS buffer and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. Cells were then resuspended in 2% PFA for a 20 min fixation on ice, washed, and resuspended in 150 µl FACS buffer for acquisition using the BD LSR X-20 Fortessa.For all flow cytometry experiments, compensation was performed at the time of sample acquisition using compensation beads. Supplementary Fig. 1 depicts the manual gating strategy for PBMC and whole blood samples.Results were analyzed (manual gating and tSNE analysis) using FlowJo Version 10.6 software. The tSNE plots were generated from a concatenated file containing 300,000 events (20,000 randomly selected live single cells per patient per time point). Manually gated results are presented as proportion of live cells or as proportion of parent gate (for PBMC) or as proportion of leukocyes (for whole blood). Data were plotted in Prism version 8.0.0.Plasma cytokines. Plasma was diluted 1:2 and 1:4 for assessment of cytokines using the human soluble protein cytometric bead array flex sets (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cytometric bead array data were acquired on a BD LSR II X-20 Fortessa and analyzed using the FCAP Array Software. The following 18 cytokines were quantified: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNα, TNFα, MIP-1α, MCP-1, IL-8, RANTES, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-2, IL-5, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IFNγ, and IL-17A. All cytokines except for IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES fell below the limit of detection of the assay at both dilutions and were excluded from future analysis. Results are reported in pg/mL and plotted using Prism ","Australia","first author","2020-11-11","11"

Health systems are under significant sustained stress with many parts of world experiencing second and subsequent waves of infection. The understanding of how the pandemic affects overall population health and access to health care; the nature and extent of disruptions it causes to pre-hospital and in hospital health care delivery is still evolving.For example, an increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) incidence has been reported since the very early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic [2] . A recent population-based crosssectional study reported that out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had increased 3-fold during the 2020 COVID-19 period when compared with during the comparison period in 2019 [3] . Patients with OHCA during 2020 were older, more likely to have comorbidities and substantially less likely to have return and sustained return of spontaneous circulation [3] .The chain of survival refers to a series of actions such as early access, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation, early advanced life support and early post resuscitative care. These actions should be optimally executed to reduce the mortality associated with OHCA.Like any chain, the chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link [4] . A pandemic can disrupt this chain of survival in multiple ways and influence patient outcomes.The study hypothesis was that the incidence of OHCA and the associated mortality was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period when compared to an earlier period. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors aimed to determine the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, processes of care and mortality among OHCA patients.To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the studies with direct comparison to an earlier time frame (termed ""before pandemic"") were selected. This enabled a direct comparison between the two-time frames to help understand any differences in incidences.Statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) andStata/MP 15.1 (Statacorp). Numerical data was summarized using mean and standard deviation and categorical data using proportion and percentage. To enable an analysis of results between studies, median values were converted to means, derived using an estimation formula [9] .Between-group differences were compared using Fischer's exact test. An analysis of nonparametric values was conducted using the Kruskal Wallace test. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Mentel-Haenszel random-effects model demonstrate better properties in the presence of heterogeneity accounting for both within-study and betweenstudy variances which was considered for the pooled odds ratio (OR). Results were presented in Forest plots. Heterogeneity was tested by using the χ² test on Cochran's Q statistic, which was calculated by means of H and I² indices. The I² index estimates the percentage of total variation across studies based on true between-study variances rather than on chance. Conventionally, I 2 values of 0-25% indicate low heterogeneity, 26-75% indicate moderate heterogeneity, and 76-100% indicate substantial heterogeneity.A total of 209 studies were obtained from the living systematic review, with 23 full-text articles assessed for eligibility. Ten studies across five countries (Australia, France, Italy, Spain and USA) were included in the qualitative and statistical analysis [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Six studies were fair [10, 12, 13, [15] [16] [17] and four studies were of good quality based on NOS [3, 11, 14, 18] ( Supplementary table 1) . Six studies compared the COVID-19 pandemic with the same period in 2019 [3, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18] . One study compared OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic against OHCA earlier in the year [16] . While one study compared data collected during COVID-19 pandemic with data from 2011-2019 [13] , the remaining studies compared COVID-19 data against the time periods of 2016-2019 [12] , 2017-2018 [14] and 2017-2019 [11] . The mean age reported among nine studies was 70.8 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 65.6 years before the pandemic. Time from call to ambulance arrival was significantly higher during the pandemic (p=0.036). The incidence and outcomes of OHCA of each study is outlined in table 1. The incidence proportion of OHCA due to a medical cause was similar before and during the pandemic (90.0% (12, [3, 10-12, 15, 17] . This is illustrated in Figure 3a .Bystander CPR (Figure 3b ) was reported in all ten studies in a total of 7,908/19,549 patients (40.5%) before pandemic and 2,850/7,322 patients (38.9%) during the pandemic (p<0.001) [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Bystander CPR occurred more frequently before the pandemic but was not statistically significant (OR=1.08 95% CI 0.86-1.35; p=0.51; I 2 =88%).Unwitnessed OHCA (Figure 3c ) was reported in eight studies across 11,794/20,048 patients (58.8%) before the pandemic and 4,328/6,995 patients (61.9%) during the pandemic (p<0.001) [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 18] . Unwitnessed OHCA occurred less often before the pandemic, however, was not statistically significant (OR=0.84 95% CI 0.66-1.07; p=0.17; I 2 =89%).Resuscitation was attempted by paramedics in six studies in a total of 3,182/6,415 patients (49.6%) before the pandemic and 5,053/9,399 patients (53.8%) during the pandemic (p<0.001) [3, 10, 11, [15] [16] [17] . While there was no difference in the number of arrests who had resuscitation attempted in the two timeframes (OR=1.19 95% CI 1.00-1.42; p=0.05; I 2 =73%), only one study reported an increase in frequency of resuscitation attempts during the pandemic (Figure 3d ) [3] . the pandemic (p<0.001) [3, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18] . Shockable rhythm or shocked events occurred more frequently before the pandemic (OR=1.57 95% CI 1.17-2.09; p=0.002; I 2 =78%).There were more OHCA occurring at home during the pandemic (Figure 3g ). Across six studies, 4,837/6,645 OHCA occurred at home before the pandemic (72.8%) compared to 1,997/2,376 arrests (84.0%) during the pandemic (p<0.001) [10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18] . OHCA more frequently occurred at home during the pandemic (OR=0.51 95% CI 0.40-0.66; p<0.0001; I 2 =68%).Airway management differed before and during the pandemic as reported in four studies [3, 11, 12, 14] . More patients were intubated before the pandemic (51.5% (5,589/10,848) versus 47.3% Survival to hospital admission, reported in six studies, occurred in 1,739/6,467 (26.9%) patients before the pandemic and 389/2,168 (17.9%) during the pandemic (p<0.001) [10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18] . Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission before the pandemic (OR=1.75 95% CI 1.42-2.17; p=<0.0001; I 2 =57%) ( Figure 3l ). Similarly, survival to hospital discharge occurred in 551/6,556 (8.4%) of patients before the pandemic and 141/2,207 patients (6.4%) during the pandemic (p=0.002), demonstrating that survival to hospital discharge occurred more frequently before the pandemic (OR=1.65 95% CI 1.28-2.12; p<0.001; I 2 =30%) ( Figure 3m ) [10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f DISCUSSION Across the selected studies, we observed a more than two-fold increase in OHCA incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an overall significant increase in mortality. Our analysis found several disruptions to the chain of survival in OHCA victims during the pandemic and this may have at least in part contributed to the outcomes seen. There was reduced bystander CPR and AED use, along with increased supraglottic airway management by paramedic personnel.Also, time from call to ambulance arrival was longer during the pandemic.The majority of OHCA was attributed to medical causes and was more frequently the reason for arrest. Public health measures may have role in reduction seen in the incidence of non-medical causes for OHCA. This is potentially due to a complex interplay of heightened financial difficulties, social isolation, uncertainty about the future, redistribution of the health workforce and the disruption to clinical services due to the pandemic-related lockdown, resulting in a delay in receiving care [19, 20] . There was not only a substantial reduction in the use of pre-hospital services to transport STEMI patients to hospitals [10] , but also a significant reduction in cardiology admissions [21] and STEMI activations [22] in 2020. Conversely, trauma causes of OHCA were less frequently observed, which is consistent with national lockdowns restricting mass gathering recreational and sporting events [23] . This may have also resulted in reduced road traffic accidents [24] .Despite most OHCA events occurring at home, a higher frequency of unwitnessed OHCA was observed. This may be explained by strict self-quarantine measures adopted, resulting in vulnerable populations such as the elderly being isolated from family members who would otherwise visit frequently. With ""stay home"" measures, it is unsurprising that significantly more cardiac arrests occurred at home, where quarantine isolation may have enforced living in different areas at home or different houses from family members [10] . It could be postulated that although OHCA events occurred at home where family may be present, they may be less likely to commence CPR due to psychological and emotional effects of the sudden event [25] .Bystander CPR was more frequent before the pandemic. While there is an ongoing fear of contracting COVID-19 during CPR administration [26] , limited evidence exists surrounding the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f transmission of infection from patient to rescuer [27] . Although likely underreporting and/or identification of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the overall low prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 cases among OHCA during the pandemic suggests that any concerns regarding bystander CPR may be unwarranted especially in jurisdictions wherein risks of community transmission may be minimal. It should be noted, however, that CPR has the potential to generate aerosols [28] and safety of bystanders and pre-hospital healthcare workers is equally important. Community education, advanced healthcare planning and people wearing bands to indicate their wish not to receive CPR may go a long way in promoting dignity and comfort of the person who has suffered an OHCA and who has a poor chance of survival even outside a pandemic. During a pandemic it may of even greater relevance when health services are stretched, and an element of risk exists to responders providing CPR and ACLS.There have been significant practice variations during the pandemic. For instance, there was an increase in use of supraglottic airway which may at least in part driven by risks of endotracheal intubation. The international liaison committee on resuscitation (ILCOR) recommends the use of supraglottic airways as first line for adults with OHCA (weak recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). However, the aerosol risks of supraglottic airway use when resuscitating patients with COVID-19 remian unclear anda supraglottic airway may potentially cause a false sense of security amongst healthcare providers [28] [29] [30] . Similarly, although ILCOR recommends the use of mechanical chest compression devices (weak recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), it is interesting to note that there was no difference in the use of mechanical CPR devices during the pandemic [28] .Interestingly, the frequency of a shockable rhythm/shocked events and ROSC was higher before the pandemic. This may reflect disruptions in the chain of survival, where the probability of ROSC diminishes significantly with time and it is unclear whether increased non-shockable rhythm is a consequence of delayed response or underlying pathophysiology [31] . Additionally, this may be related to the delay from call to ambulance arrival that is observed in this study. The quantitative increase in OHCA calls and the need to properly apply personal protective equipment and disinfect ambulances between calls likely contributed to the delay in response and regrettably contributed to the observed increase in OHCA mortality [10] . This may also be compounded by the increased frequency of unwitnessed OHCA and reduction in bystander CPR.As a result, patients may be found long after cardiac arrest where they may no longer be in a shockable rhythm.The absolute increase in OHCA incidence and corresponding rise in mortality was reported in our analysis. Direct COVID-19 deaths would account for a proportion of these deaths [3, 13] , while indirect factors such as lockdown and behavioral changes for fear of infection or reluctance to burden health systems may have resulted in delays in presenting to hospital [10, 13] . Worldwide, a decrease in acute hospital presentations have been observed, with reports of reduced ST-elevation myocardial infarction presentations in Spain, Italy and USA [32] .Emergency department presentations have also decreased following the implementation of lockdown measures in the UK, Germany and USA [33, 34] . Emergency medicine services may also be overwhelmed with the surge in OHCA calls, resulting in a strain in pre-hospital services [15] .There are several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, most of the included studies were from the early phase of the pandemic from countries that were significantly affected and had little time to prepare. Moreover, some degree of lockdown in many of the countries, due to the fear of contracting the virus, which implied that many people continued to avoid health care facilities. Hence the result may still be representative during the pandemic. Secondly, postmortem testing to confirm COVID-19 was not reported, hence the direct causation of COVID-19 infection and OHCA or its indirect association due to unattended comorbid diseases during this pandemic was not readily available. Thirdly, there was limited information about the previous medical history or comorbidities of these OHCA patients. Finally, it would been helpful to map the OHCA event curve against that of the epidemiological pandemic curve (based upon hospital confirmed cases) in each of the reporting areas to observe any correlations between the incidence of COVID-19 and OHCA event rates, however this data was not provided in the studies. This information would be critical in helping systems better prepare for future resurgences in COVID-19 cases.The incidence and mortality of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly higher as compared to time periods before the pandemic. Multiple factors may have contributed to the increased mortality, including increased time from call to ambulance arrival and the reduced frequency of unwitnessed events, bystander CPR and AED use. There were significant practice changes during the pandemic.

Since the outbreak of this pandemic, only a very few studies have been done to understand its impact on the economy of Australia. Although there is generally a negative relationship between new cases of infection and stock returns (Al-Awadhi, 2020), the severity of the outbreak varies from country to country. Moreover, coronavirus has already reduced investors' confidence in the stock market due to increased uncertainties (Liu, Manzoor, Wang, Zhang & Manzoor, 2020 ) that coloured past experiences (Anusakumar, Ali & Hooy, 2017; Fan, 2003) .Due to movement control orders, transportation industry as well as energy industry lose huge revenue. Except some emergency cases, all types of transportation usage are completely shut down. Same scenario emerges for all other types of industries that causes massive decline of energy demand. The food industry is dealing with the challenges and opportunities of COVID-19 quite well. The closing down of many restaurants disturbs the supply chains of food items from the production fields to the retail stores and consumers. Due to panic buy, supermarkets and grocery stores did quite well in terms of volume of revenue and profits. Many technology companies stop doing business because of shipment delays in electronic goods and in the real estate industry. However, COVID-19 causes to increase the demand for medical equipment and medicine which leads to more revenue for pharmaceuticals and healthcare companies. Similarly, the revenue of telecommunications industry also boosts up due to high demand of Internet for Online based activities such as remote learning, remote office and so on. Air pollution increases the risk of COVID-19 infection, so the demand for the use of masks and alcohol-based standard sterilisers demonstrate record growth in demand (Paital, 2020) , resulting in huge increases in sales of masks and alcohol-based standard sterilisers. Therefore, we choose to examine the short-term fluctuations of the Australian stock market and check its sectoral performance.To understand the short-term impacts of COVID-19 on different sectors of the stock market, this study analyses the influence of the official announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Australian stock market. Its findings are expected to help investors, business managements, capital market regulatory bodies, and government to better understand the short-term fluctuations and performance of selected industry sectors and help them make better decisions about the future impacts and restoring market sentiment despite the CODIV-19 outbreak.This study selects the Australian economy as its sample because Australia is one of the developed countries which has controlled the epidemic very well (Figure 1 ) in comparison to other developed nations (Wyeth, 2020) . However, its market still remains affected like those of the other developed countries. Its stock market experiences a great loss about a 21.67% pull back ( Figure 2 ) and relatively a very high volatility of daily returns (Table 1) . Therefore, the In the wake of globalisation, transportation has boomed over the last few decades. In 2003, SARS created a huge impact on this industry. Loh (2006) finds that airlines listed in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand are more sensitive to SARS news than non-airline stocks, and that the negative effects of SARS on equities increase volatility rather than lower average returns. They also find that airline stocks tend to be 'aggressive' after the SARS outbreak. For example, Harbison (2003) points out that during the SARS outbreak, when it peaks in March 2003, the number of passenger traffic declines by 5.6%, forcing some airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific region to delay orders and to downsize the number of staff with a view to minimising the cost of service. A declining trend in profit making for airlines operation in the region and a sharp fall in the quality of international service have been cited in some newspapers. Wang (2013) tests the link between international events and international airline stocks return from 1996 to 2010, proving that major international events may have a risk impact on airlines' share price earnings. Borenstein and Zimmerman (1988) use Capital Asset Pricing Model to examine the influence of 74 air accidents on the aviation industry in the United States from the 1960s to 1985. The result shows that an aviation accident has a negative effect on the income growth. Flouris and Walker (2007) analyses two Canadian airlines' accounts and stock price performance, and discuss the effect of the 9/11 attacks on the aviation industry. Their findings show that low operating costs, high consumer confidence, products, organisational structure and execution of projects are major factors leading to effective risk reduction. Kim and Gu (2004) measure the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the returns and uncertainties of airline stocks on the stock market. The results show that while the average weekly return on airline stocks does not change dramatically after 9/11, there has been a substantial rise in the systemic risk and overall value of airline stocks. According to research by Sparaco (2001) in the 5 weeks after the terrorist attacks, passenger traffic of European airlines declines by 36.2%, forcing them to cut 30,000 jobs. Barnard (2002) estimates the 9/11 attacks directly costing European airlines more than $3 billion.Comparing the performance of North American and European airlines' stock portfolios, Sato (2013) finds that the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 has a major effect on the North American market compared to the European one. The fluctuation in aviation market is the result of both internal and external factors, and the development of financial instruments plays an important role on the liquidity dependence of investment. SARS outbreak in 2003 had a major impact on international air transport, bus transport, subway transport and cargo transport by air in Beijing (Beutels et al. 2009 ). Likewise, movement control orders in many countries also hit the transportation industry caused by the high infections of COVID-19. Sobieralski (2020) explains that due to COVID-19, travel restrictions are made and that leads to global incapacity in the airlines sector.In the face of the SARS crisis, Taiwan biotech's stock returns take a positive turn. Chen, Chen, Tang and Huang (2009) argue that during the SARS epidemic in Taiwan, demand for medical and healthcare equipment increases significantly. Moreover, these products are the main output of the biotechnology industry, so their share prices are bound to rise. Jingwen (2005) investigates the link between SARS information disclosure and market sensitivity among listed companies in China's pharmaceutical industry. They find that when the SARS outbreak disclosure is not significant, stock performance in the pharmaceutical industry is not significant. However, when SARS information is significantly disclosed, the market reaction of listed companies in the pharmaceutical industry is significantly positive. These results suggest that Chinese investors may wield a significant effect. Al-Awadhi, Al-Saifi, Al-Awadhi and Alhamadi (2020) shows that during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, technology and pharmaceuticals outperform compared to other sectors in the stock market.The high barriers that hinder the development of new vaccines have the potential to be monopolistic. As vaccine development is much more complex and technologically advanced than that of the production of medicinal products, it is not possible to produce a universal vaccine (Hinman, Orenstein, Santoli, Rodewald & Cochi, 2006) . This leads to an increase in vaccine shortages, particularly for U-vaccines (Hinman et al., 2006) . Thus, with the increase in medical subsidies, the emergence of dangerous diseases globally may be regarded as a potential market for vaccine manufacturers. Furthermore, Lee and McKibbin (2004) and Smith, Yago, Millar and Coast (2005) assert that the impact of SARS and antimicrobial resistance on the nonhealth industries is greater than those on the healthcare sector.The international energy industry has not remained stable during this period, for example, WTI crude price does down for the first time in history. Maijama'a, Musa, Garba and Baba (2020) suggest that the total population is positively linked with the total number of corona virus cases, while the price of crude oil corresponds negatively to the overall number of cases of corona virus. Broadstock, Cao and Zhang (2012) believe that Chinese stock investors, especially those in the energy sector, are more sensitive to price fluctuations in the international crude oil market, because the sudden rise in oil prices will increase the returns on investments which is also linked with energy. In the pre-crisis period, stock market performance of oil and gas are greatly impacted by oil price shifts (Reboredo & Rivera-Castro, 2014) . A rise in the demand or in the price of oil will increase the return on Canadian oil and gas stocks (Perry, 2001 ).Control orders of people's movement issued by governments of many countries have led to the closure of restaurants and bars in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, which affect food industry globally. Furthermore, the closure of the restaurant industry has caused a chain reaction in food production, alcohol, wine, beer production, food and beverage transportation, fisheries, agriculture and other related industries. The results show that positive (negative) events caused by direct actions within the company lead to higher (lower) expected returns, while events related to third-party opinions lead to less change in expected returns within the short-term event window (Deak & Karali, 2014) .The global economic slowdown significantly affects the demand for real estate industry. In this context, possible wage cuts would also have a significant impact on demand for housing and commercial projects. Moreover, demand will be squeezed as people try to hold on to their cash to meet daily needs. Secondly, the movement of workers engaged in construction activities and the lack of access to inputs during the blockade will also lead to delay in housing projects. As new equity investment slows, property companies will struggle to get funding. Therefore, the impact of corona virus on the real estate industry should not be underestimated. In India, the real estate agency NAREDCO (National Real Estate Development Council) estimates that the industry will suffer a loss of Rs. 100,000 crore due to COVID-19 and property prices will fall by 10-15% (Chopra, 2020) . However, Wong (2008) finds that the housing market in Hong Kong does not overreact during the SARS crisis.With the spread of the pandemic, global conferences and activities are being cancelled or postponed. Over the whole period, the telecommunications industry does relatively well, as the demand for services supporting work at home skyrockets (Ramelli & Wagner, 2020) . The technology industry may face the problems of delay to shipments of electronic goods and because of movement control regulations. Many technology companies have to stop doing business. In addition to the significant loss of human life caused by the pandemic, COVID-19 is expected to wield a huge and long-term impact on biometrics companies and related technology developers and markets (Carlaw, 2020) .The Australian government announces the outbreak of the epidemic on 27 February 2020 (Prime Minister of Australia, 2020). This study considers a 10-day window for data analysis and calculates the return for 10 working days before and 10 working days after the announcement of event data. This study uses the Australian stock exchange as its sample based on the indices of eight industries, these are transportation, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, energy, food, real estate, telecommunications and technology. It does so in order to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the performance of these sectors because these sectors are highly vulnerable and demonstrate high volatility at the time of previous pandemic events ( Table 2 ). The stock data are collected from the investing.com website.This study relies on the Event Study method to analyse data. An event study is an empirical statistical method for investigating the relationship between stock prices and economic events (Dyckman, Philbrick & Stephan, 1984) . Stankeviciene and Akelaitis (2014) provide valuable evidences on how stock prices react to public announcements. Event Study may reveal how a stock market could be sensitive to a particular event. In their case studies of events, Campbell and Lo (1997) and Brown and Warner (1985) suggest using 120 days prior to the event date as the estimated period, which is sufficient to form a baseline of normal returns.Hence, this report uses an estimation window of 120 days and a 10-day event window. Here, the Day 0 refers to the announcement of the Corona virus pandemic in Australia, on 27 February 2020. Figure 3 immediately below illustrates the timeline for event study.Abnormal return, the difference between the actual return and the expected return during the test period, can test the effects of a given event. Firstly, the daily return of each security price is calculated through the estimation window and the event window, and the formula is as follows:where R t = stock daily returns on t day, P t = stock closing price on t day and P t−1 = stock closing price on t−1 day. The expected return for the Event Study is calculated based on a simple regression, in which the parameters are identified in the estimation window. As a statistical model, a market model relates return to shares to market index returns. In this study, a simple regression is conducted by using stock returns and market return. The market model is written below:where E(R) t = expected return on stock for day t, α = intercept of the regression equation, β = stock's Beta value (slope) and R ASX = return on ASX index for day t. Abnormal return (AR) is also used in an Event analysis to measure the impacts of an Event. The AR of a stock is given as equation at time t,where AR t = the abnormal return for day t, R t = actual return on stock for day t and E (R) t = expected return on stock for day t.In most Event studies, abnormal returns are accumulated in a given period. This may adjust uncertainties about the date of the event or capture the influence of the event on the stock price. In the given period, cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for a stock across the event period is calculated in the following way:Then, the average CAR across all the observations in the given time is shown as,A test statistic is a measure of the likelihood that the actual value of the parameter is not zero. Therefore, employing statistical hypothesis for significance, this study finds that the tstatistic is larger than the critical value, meaning that the results are significant. The equation is shown below:where t CAR = test statistic of cumulative abnormal return, it = the CAR for each category, σ CAR = the standard deviation of the CAR and n = number of observations.The AR of eight industry indices in the event period of −10 to 10, as well as their significant level are documented in Table 3 . Before the announcement of the coronavirus epidemic, the index for healthcare and pharmaceuticals, as well as the telecommunications index, show a significantly positive AR in Day −6 and Day −3, respectively, while there is negative AR on technology index from Day −6 to Day −5.After the announcement, almost every sector reveals a significant reaction in the stock markets, except the real estate sector, which did not show any significant AR within event window, implying that real estate is not affected in the short-term, but it may be impacted in the long term.The energy sector index does not exhibit significant average abnormal returns before and at the event date, but it has significant AR with 2.15% at Day 2, and −11.70% at Day 7. The greatly negative AR on Day 7 may also be due to the negative impact of two things: the oil price war between Saudi and Russia and low global demand for oil.The transportation sector index does not exhibit significant average abnormal returns before and at the Event date, but it has significant AR with −1.5% at Day 5, 1.5% at Day 7, −2.95% at Day 8 and −1.63% at Day 10. The negative performance is due to transportation firms losing one of the main profit sources, due to the great decline in passenger flow.The technology index has negative AR at a significant level, specifically −3.35% at Day 5, −2.16% at Day −4 and −1.93% at Day 4. The reason for this negative performance may be due to the technology companies having to shut down their business, leading to, instead of shipping of electronic commodities and related goods.The healthcare and pharmaceuticals sectors exhibit significantly positive AR before the announcement with 2.18% at Day −6. Also, at and after the event date, the index of healthcare and that of pharmaceuticals show a 7-day positive AR and 5-day abnormal return, respectively. It is obvious that the event wields a positive influence on the performance of these two indices. This is because increasing demand for medical equipment and medicine will motivate the two industries.The telecommunications index depicts a significantly positive AR before the announcement with 1.71% at Day −3, but there is no significant change at the announcement date. After that day, it shows a significantly positive AR with 3.21%, 3.25% and 5.73% at Day 1, Day 6 and Day 7, respectively. This positive performance is explained by the increasing demand for distance learning and tele-work. Meanwhile, index displays a significantly negative AR with −2.58% at Day 8.The food sector index does not exhibit significant average abnormal returns before the event date while it has significant AR with 3.16% at Day 0, 2.80% at Day 10. The food industry is also in high demand due to panic buying and hoarding of food, which may constitute the main reason leading to positive abnormal return.Overall, during Day 0 to Day 10, the industry indices, except for technology index and real estate index, have relatively stable CARs (Figure 4) . After the announcement, food, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and healthcare sectors indicate a clearly increasing trend of CARs, while energy and real estate industry tend to fall, while for transportation and technology it remains relatively steady.The findings suggest that some industry indices are sensitive to the official announcement of the epidemic in Australia. After the declaration of the epidemic on 27 February 2020, the food, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications industries perform better on AR compared to the others in the post-event window. This is because the Corona virus enhances the demand for medical equipment and drugs, which is consistent with the research on SARS by Chen et al. (2009) . In addition, Ramelli and Wagner (2020) explain that the travel restrictions regulations and demand for working at home accelerate the development of the telecommunications industry. Obviously, investors expect that the possible implementation of quarantine policy means good prospects for the telecommunications industry. The Corona virus triggers soaring demand for food in the form of panic-buying and stockpiling of food products (Nicola et al., 2020) .However, after the announcement, another four sectors show negative abnormal returns. The negative impact of the announcement on the transportation industry replicates past experiences. Harbison (2003) argue that the epidemic would lead to much fewer passengers in the transportation industry. On Day 7, the energy industry has the minimum significant value (−11.70%) of abnormal return, caused by the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and subsequently facilitating a sharp fall in the price of oil on 8 March 2020. Moreover, homequarantine policy forces the public to use their cars less and cancels a huge number of flights, which cuts the demand for petrol and profits of the energy companies. The real estate index is the only industry index showing no clear evidence affected by the declaration of an epidemic in the short-term, which is consistent with the findings of Wong (2008) In terms of long-term impact, the performance of different sectoral indicators depends on how well the epidemic can be contained in the future. There are few studies focussing on the long run impacts for previous pandemic. For an example, using daily data for 77 countries from 22 January to 17 April 2020, Ashraf (2020) finds an indirect positive impact on stock returns by reducing the growth rate of new confirmed cases. Bai et al. (2020) study the impact of the infectious disease pandemic on the stock market volatility in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and Japan between January 2005 and April 2020. They find that, with a lag of 24 months, infectious disease pandemics can positively affect permanent movements in international stock markets, even though the impact of global economic policy uncertainty and volatility leverage have been weakened. However, the long run data are not available for the current pandemic (COVID-19, 2020) and this study only discusses the short run phenomena.This article uses the Event Study method to assess the impacts of the declaration of COVID-19 on eight selected industries in Australia. The findings show how investors' confidence changes since after the official announcement of the epidemic outbreak, but there is a great variation among the sectors. On the day of announcement, three sectors (food, pharmaceuticals and healthcare) show positive impressive return at a significant level. After that, more industry indices show sensitivity towards the declaration, especially the good performance of the indices for pharmaceuticals, healthcare and telecommunications, in comparison with the worse performance of the transportation and energy indices.The findings are meaningful for equity investors, companies and governments. Investors and business managers will have a better idea about which sector is risky in case of a pandemic for taking precautions accordingly. The government should offer assistance and extend policy support, such as tax deductions or free-interest loans to those sectors which are experiencing negative abnormal return. Furthermore, the government can conduct further quantitative research easing to reduce investors' fear in the short-term, just as the US government has done (Zhang, Hu & Ji, 2020) . The government can mitigate the risk of a cash squeeze from COVID-19 through tax deferrals and bridge lending policies, and bridge loans are more cost-effective in preventing a massive cash crunch in the 6 months after a crisis (Vito & Gómez, 2020) .This study is based on instant reflection of the market and short-term fluctuations of the COVID-19 outbreak announcement as it affects eight sector indices in Australia. It will help the government to implement quick policy actions for different sectoral reforms and incentive packages for vulnerable industries. It will be a guideline for taking initial policy action for such type of events in the future. Moreover, this study will lead researchers to check the long-term impacts when the long-run data will be available. Therefore, future research can be focused on the long-term performance of specific sectors or new research may be conducted on other markets to identify the impacts of a pandemic of such a proportionality.The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Md.

Such an approach, which we term CCPE, would allow for the creation of more realistic models which can answer more questions than any existing individual model 6 . This can be used in the decision making of a government, with the goal of both minimising the death toll while reducing the economic impact of any restrictions.We use Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed (SEIR) model 11, 12 for the illustration of our methodology, while stressing that the developed methodology is amenable to any other dynamical model based on ODEs. The SEIR model incorporates coupled ODEs, and has been utilised previously in the context of COVID-19 14 . These ODEs capture the progression of a disease through the population, as people become infected, progress through their infection, and infect others. SEIR models include variables which represent the population during an epidemic which can be in a range of states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic (P), infectious (I), recovered (R) and deaths (D). The infected and recovered cases are further categorized into untested ( I u , R u ) and confirmed cases ( I c , R c ) to enable control mechanisms which are specific to confirmed cases. The key parameter determining if a virus can cause an epidemic is the reproduction number R 0 and depends on both the transmissibility of the virus and social distancing. For R 0 > 1 the virus will spread until herd immunity has been established, while for R 0 < 1 the transmission will progressively decay until the virus is eradicated 12 . In addition to R 0 , further parameters are used for capturing aspects such as the fatality rate and testing rate.Government interventions can be used to modify each of these parameters such as the use of NPIs to reduce the reproduction number, or increased testing to isolate more confirmed cases. These responses vary between countries and typically vary over time depending on the local situation 2, 15 . For example, New Zealand acted with a ""hard and fast"" response that quickly implemented quarantines and immigration restrictions, similar to other countries like Vietnam 16 . The New Zealand response implemented an alert system for COVID-19 17 which comprises four levels of increasingly strict interventions. In this case, the four levels can be modelled as a discrete controller 9 which can interact with the continuous SEIR model as a type of CPS. Such an approach can be used in order to continuously evaluate the efficacy of the control strategy while the pandemic is still in a relatively nascent period and more information is being learned about its dynamics each day.The use of formal modelling for biological processes has been advocated by Fisher and Henzinger 18 , which makes a distinction between computational models and executable models. More recently, Bioengineers have adopted an executable model called Hybrid Input-Output Automata (HIOAs) 10, 19 for developing abstract models. These abstractions are used to achieve behaviour from cellular 20 to organ levels 21, 22 . These abstract models are also ""executable"" in the sense that hardware and software implementations may be derived from them so that they work as virtual organs 21, 23, 24 .An HIOA captures both the continuous (i.e. the population model) and discrete (i.e. the government controller) dynamics through the use of an automata with included ODEs. The conversion of the SEIR model into HIOA results in the formal model of Fig. 1b , where the two locations capture whether the Intensive Care Unit www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (ICU) capacity has been exceeded. The formal nature of these models means that they can be used in simulation and code generation frameworks with relative ease 25, 26 . We have used the recently developed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 23 , which allows for the specification of a complex network of HIOAs.To illustrate our methodology we have selected New Zealand and Italy, who have adopted disease management approaches that differ in terms of their response speed-where New Zealand is quick to increase restrictions, Italy takes comparatively longer. We show that in the case of the four-level New Zealand control, we are able to make decisions around the optimal criteria for switching between the control modes to minimise the impact of the virus. Our methodology is generic enough and has the potential to be adopted to other alternative settings.A simple controller in the New Zealand context. The proposed CCPE approach is first demonstrated using the New Zealand COVID-19 context using a simple controller we term NZ-C1. The NZ-C1 control strategy is to initiate a strong lockdown measure, which is introduced early and is not lifted until the new infections approach zero. We compare against the official data which contains the number of cases (both confirmed and probable), recovered, and deaths for every day from 20th March 2020 to 9th September 2020. Also, on 26th March 2020 (6 days after the first date in our data), the New Zealand government initiated their full lockdown measures, which remained in place until 28th April 2020 when some restrictions began to be eased.First, we examine the accuracy of our CCPE approach by comparing it to the New Zealand data as a means to increase confidence in our predicted future disease dynamics, as per Fig. 1 . In our framework, we propose the modelling of both the plant and controller as HIOA 9 . We create a simple controller (Fig. 1c) , which transitions into a lockdown mode (LD) 6 days after the start. The controller modes are depicted as two different states of the system, namely Pre-LD and LD respectively. Within every mode, we encapsulate a condition that determines the maximum time control can reside in a given mode, which is known as the invariant. In the LD mode, however, no such invariant is specified. In this case, the invariant is by default true and hence control can remain in this location forever. In contrast, control can remain in the Pre-LD mode, when the current time t is less than 6 days. The rate of change of time is modelled as ODE ṫ = 1 within both modes.Transitions between modes happen when some conditions are satisfied. For example, the transition from Pre-LD to LD happens when the current value of t becomes 6. When a transition triggers, some variables are updated. For example, when this transition triggers, the value of time t is reset (by the reset action, which is denoted t ′ = 0 ). Also the value of R 0 is set to 0.316.For this model, we use the previously described values for R 0 of 2.5 and 0.316 for pre-lockdown and lockdown respectively. Figure 1d -f show the results of this simulation for three main metrics. By day 120 (19th July 2020) the cases have levelled out in both the real data and model data. On this date, the simulated model predicts 1505 confirmed cases, while in reality there were 1506, an error of only 1 case. Overall, the correlation coefficient is 0.9752.With this simple controller which remains in lockdown indefinitely (i.e. until a vaccine arrives), the cumulative infection count converges to a realistic number, indicating that the 4 weeks of lockdown was effective at eraditcating the disease. This can be seen in Fig. 1e , where the active infections decrease to around zero by day 100, meaning that the disease has been eradicated. Finally, the total number of deaths in this scenario is expected to be 22, which matches up exactly with the official data. CCPE model of the New Zealand Government control strategy. Next, we investigate the disease dynamics in New Zealand over a longer period of time (600 days) with a more complex model which closely follows the government's strategy of four different levels of increasing stringency, along with their historical changes. The previous controller (Fig. 1c) is extended by incorporating a control policy that reflects these alert levels, where Pre-LD and LD correspond to Level 0 and Level 4 respectively. This new controller is called NZ-C2 and is shown in Fig. 2a . Additionally, the plant model is augmented to allow for the introduction of a ""second wave"" of infections around day 100 to capture what was experienced in the New Zealand context. Until 9th September 2020 (day 172) NZ-C2 follows the historical actions of the real-world control strategy. Subsequently, NZ-C2 tries to set the alert level in order to determine an appropriate reproduction number R 0 for the current situation. We have based our work on the reports released by the New Zealand government and the analysis of R 0 values and associated alert levels 7 .For New Zealand, Table 2 presented in the ""Methods"" section lists major interventions and their associated relative reproduction number changes indicating how they increase/decrease the R 0 . According to 27 , the initial value of R 0 is 2.5 without any control, which corresponds to alert level 0 in our model. In summary, the R 0 values for alert levels 4 through 1 are 0.316, 0.827, 1.384, 1.570, respectively. The maximum value of R 0 is 2.5, which corresponds to level 0.The controller HIOA which captures the transitions between these levels is shown in Fig. 2a . Here, the conditions for increasing the alert level are based on the current number of infected cases ( I c ). For example, from level two if I c ≥ k l3 then the alert level immediately rises to three. On the other hand, the alert level can go down if the increasing rate of new cases per day ( Ċ ) is less than a certain amount. For example, from level three if Ċ ≤ dk l3 then the alert level decreases to level two. In addition, to avoid frequent oscillations between levels, a minimum duration within a level before being able to drop down to a lower level is added and is set to be 14 days.The simulation results for this controller are shown in Fig. 2b , where we also include the presence of a vaccine from day 365, which results in the country moving out of all remaining lockdown measures on day 397 (22nd April 2021). In contrast to the scenario of continuing the lockdown based on the previous controller NZ-C1, we observe gradual step downs in the control level. Although there will be 30 deaths, 8 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ lockdown scenario, the four-level approach allows for society to begin its return to normalcy from day 39 in order to minimise economic damage relative to the controller NZ-C1 caused as a result of enforced social distancing 4 . Additionally, the model and controller show their ability to capture both the real-world second wave (at around day 150-18th August 2020)) in a realistic manner, as well potential future outbreaks (from around day 250-18th August 2020)). In these cases, the controller reacts proportionately to the risk associated with the current situation based on both the number of active cases ( I c ) and the rate of new cases ( Ċ ).Modelling Italy's control strategy. The CCPE approach can be adapted to the intervention techniques of other countries. For example in Italy, the government does not have an explicitly outlined intervention system, instead the control actions are progressively released as they are needed. We use the published stringency index 15 for Italy across time in order to create an approximation of their control strategy in our framework. For example, on 23rd February 2020, the stringency index was listed as 66.67, while subsequent measures increased this to 71.43, 90.48, and finally 95.24 15 . We create an approximate discrete controller for this approach (Fig. 3a) , where the phases correspond to a degrees of stringency mentioned earlier. Note that the date of first observation point in the Italy data is 23rd February 2020.The control flow of the Italy model called I-C1 in Fig. 3a is as follow. From the initial state Phase 0, transition 1 leads to Phase 1. This transition is triggered based on time, according to the historical actions of Italy government. For instance, Italy was in Phase 0 on 23rd February 2020, and moved to Phase 1 by closing the schools and universities on 4th March 2020. Similarly, transitions 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 are triggered based on the time when historical actions were imposed. A countrywide lockdown was issued on 10th March 2020 (day 16) and the nation entered Phase 2. On 20th March 2020 (day 26), the government further tightened the control by reducing the public transportation and initiated Phase 3, before beginning to relax restrictions on 27th After the historical transitions have been performed ( 1 -5 ) in Fig. 3a , we apply the same control strategy presented in Fig. 2a . That is, the control level can decrease based on Ċ and time remained in a level, or the control level can increase based on I c . Precisely, the same level changing conditions are used for Italy. In this way, we can examine the performance of the same controller in different countries. We set 10, 5, and 0.01 for dk l3 , dk l2 , and dk l1 , respectively. Also, k l3 , k l2 , and k l1 are 6046, 3023, and 605, respectively. Additionally, the constraint to level four ( k u ) is equal to the hospital capacity of approximately 483,694 14 .The simulation results for the Italy model are shown in Fig. 3b . When control goes down to phase two for the first time, the active infection count ( I c ) starts to increase again, causing a second wave of infections and necessitating the return to phase three. We can observe that in order to deal with this second wave, the controller implements phase three and remains there until day 344. Overall, the simulation predicts that approximately 45,000 deaths and 320,000 confirmed cases are expected in Italy.Modelling other controllers. We can examine various ""what if "" scenarios of COVID-19 in New Zealand, as a result of varying intervention techniques. A simple control policy in previous work has consisted of only two levels, essentially a full lockdown and no control 14 . Precisely, a complete lockdown (level four) is triggered if the currently active infection count exceeds the hospital ICU capacity ( {I c ≥ k u } ), while in times where the currently active infection count is less than the half of the hospital capacity ( {I c ≤ k u /2} ), the lockdown is removed (level zero), as shown in Fig. 4a . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The simulation results for this model in our framework are shown in Fig. 4b . As expected, the control level frequently switches between four and zero as the number of active cases oscillates. This results in a number of 1-month lockdown happening after day 67. Although the peaks of oscillation in the infection case graph gradually diminishes over time, the final number of deaths is extremely high and control remains in the lockdown for a long period of time, causing drastic impacts on the economy.The compositional approach of CCPE allows the flexibility of formal modelling and validation of government control strategies to manage a pandemic. We have shown the ability of CCPE to model the dynamics of COVID-19 in conjunction with the various intervention techniques that governments employ. Table 1 compares the controllers used in this paper. As we can see, in the case of New Zealand, the controller NZ-C2 achieves much better overall outcome compared to the simple controller NZ-C1. While the lockdown for NZ-C1 lasts until a vaccine is available, the economic impact of such a long lockdown may be catastrophic. In contract, the controller NZ-C2 has a gradual lifting of restrictions, which reaches level 1 much faster. Also, the overall risk of this strategy is a marginal increase in the number of deaths. In contrast to these two controllers, is the third control strategy NZ-C3, which introduces oscillations. We can see immediately the impact of a poorly managed control strategy, which may lead to three orders of magnitude more deaths. Finally, we also present the controller for Italy, which is modelled based on the actions of their government and as reported in 15 .CCPE allows the formal modelling of complex controllers. This enables the systematic evaluation of various control strategies in order to determine the best approach for a country which minimises the economic and social impacts, in addition to achieving the best healthcare outcome. As long as each NPI can be quantified, in terms of R 0 or testing rate, then the importance of individual NPIs can also be evaluated in terms of their overall impact www.nature.com/scientificreports/ on pandemic control. These NPIs can then be organised into an overall policy which includes both the NPIs to enforce, the conditions under which they are enforced, and how long they should remain in place. While the CCPE framework as presented here is based on the SEIR model 14 , there is nothing that restricts our framework to such a model. Any continuous model which can be captured through a series of ODEs is able to be used which can open the door to more accurate simulation techniques, such as the enhanced version used by CovidSIM 5 , the recent SIDARTHE model 28 , or even microscale modelling. We have already shown this ability by suggesting some modification to SEIR to better account for contact tracing and isolation. This is presented in ""Methods"" section and is denoted as the revised plant model PL-2 in Table 1 . Additionally, PL-3 allows for the capturing of the second wave dynamics.The effectiveness of the CCPE framework relies on the fidelity of the transmission model and parameter estimation, requiring expertise in both epidemiology and statistical analysis, both of which are rapidly changing as our understanding of the pandemic increases. As such, the estimation of R 0 is technically challenging 29 and the value varies due to different model assumptions and estimation procedures 27, [30] [31] [32] [33] . While the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the basic R 0 ranges between 1.4 and 2.5 34 , Liu et al. suggested that the value is expected to be higher based on evolving research 35 . To further complicate this matter, cultural differences between countries can have an impact on the effectiveness of NPIs at reducing R 0 , such as social distancing 4 .To apply the CCPE framework to other countries, the R 0 value should be examined. However, this reproduction number varies based on the control measures implemented by each country 29, 30, [36] [37] [38] . To investigate the interaction between government interventions and disease transmission dynamics, action-specific R 0 values are essential. Apart from the control actions, many factors, such as population density 39 , mobility 30 , and spatial heterogeneity 40 , affect the R 0 value.The ability for our CCPE framework to work across a range of these different country-specific plant models and various control designs creates a useful tool for designing strategies to fight COVID-19. The analysis of counter-measures and their impact on dealing with the disease has traditionally been limited to simple ""if-else"" style controllers, and here we show the ability to model counter-measures which are able to include some form of state in their logic.In this work, we evaluated the composition of a controller with an epidemiological model. However, the CCPE framework is far more flexible. HIOA-based modelling can be composed with any number of other HIOA. Further HIOAs could be used which take into account aspects such as legislation, culture, economy structure, administration, etc. 4, [41] [42] [43] . For example, an economic model could be added 3 , which takes into account the various measures being applied in order to provide a metric of the financial toll. Such a model could then be used to design a controller which not just minimises the number of deaths in the population, but also reduces the economic impact in a form of bi-criteria optimisation 44, 45 .In our work, the criteria used for switching between modes of the controller were based on comparing the number of active cases to the ICU capacity. Instead, control mechanisms could be created which take into account additional information, such as the climate, to more accurately capture the decision-making process. Moreover, we could further refine the dynamical modes to better represent the rate of testing.Finally, a robust estimation approach of action specific R 0 values within context of geographical and social heterogeneity should be systematically investigated in the future. COVID-19 is still relatively new and there exists a large variation in potential reproduction numbers between studies. We note that the accuracy of any epidemiological model depends on the accuracy of its reproduction number, and so further improvements in this area would be of great benefit. For example, there is the potential for the adoption of an approach as recently proposed in 13 if the reproduction number could be approximated as a continuous function. While this is a challenging proposition, our work opens the door for more engineering researchers to create an impact on current and future pandemics. A momentum is already in evidence as reported in 46 to show how Engineers are coming together to contribute to this cause in various ways.The SEIR model of COVID-19. The modified SEIR model 14 consists of variables which represent the various sub-populations during an epidemic: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic (P), infectious (I), recovered (R), and deaths (D). The infectious and recovered cases are further categorized into untested ( I u , R u ) and confirmed ( I c , R c ). The dynamics of the transmission between these sub-populations can be described by a series of coupled ODEs, shown in Eq. (1) through (8) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) depends on the number of active people in the ICU and the ICU capacity. If the number of active people in the ICU is within the ICU capacity then the CFR is is simply equal to some lower bound CFR 0 (1%). When this limit is exceeded, the CFR is decided by a mixture of patients who are receiving ICU care ( CFR 0 ) and those who are not ( CFR 1 ). The result of this is a piecewise function as in Eq. (10) where CFR 1 (2%) is the maximum fatality rate, n ICU denotes the maximum ICU beds, N is the population size, and p ICU is the proportion of total cases which require ICU attention.The SEIR model can be described as HIOA, shown earlier in Fig. 1b . X is the vector of all epidemic variables initialized to X 0 , A is the matrix of the parameters, and Ẋ = AX is the matrix representation of Eqs. (1) through (8)). When the ICU demand N icu is less than or equal to the maximum ICU capacity n ICU , the HIOA stays in the location Below ICU with CFR of CFR 1 . Otherwise, control goes to the location Beyond ICU and the CFR is defined by Eq. (10).In the model (Eq. 1, 2 ) , the reproduction number R 0 determines the transmission rate β as per Eq. (11). Here, ǫ is the relative infectiousness in the presymptomatic period, δ is the transition rate from presymptomatic to infectious, and γ is the transition rate from infectious to recovered.These transition rates are decided by the virus nature, while R 0 depends on the contacts and the transmissibility 12 . The government control measures can impact this reproduction number, and hence also β , by reducing:• physical contacts (e.g. travel restriction, self-isolation, work at home, close schools, etc.), or • the transmissibility (e.g. hand washing, public disinfection efforts, etc.)In order to start the propagation of the disease through the population we start with an initial number of cases ( I c ) which matches with the initial number of reported cases. Typically, our simulations start after a country has reached 100 total cases as this is a likely point where local transmission, if not community transmission, has started to occur. Additionally, this allows us to isolate the population from the rest of the world and ignore the potential inflow and outflow of infected people as travel is heavily restricted by this point in time.We propose a revision of the recent SEIR model 14 in this paper to account for better management of the pandemic using improved case isolation and contact tracing. In Table 1 , we denote the SEIR model 14 as the plant model PL-1 while our revised model is marked as the plant model PL-2. This is since case isolation and contact tracing could significantly reduce R 0 for identified cases (i.e. I c ) 37 . We use different parameters for the transmission rate β (Eqs. 1, 2 ) such that the confirmed cases have lower transmissivity due to the combined effects of isolation and contact tracing. The resultant refined model replaces Eq. (1) and (2) with Eq. (12) and (13) .Further, to capture the the dynamics of externally introduced second waves we create a further extended plant model named PL-3. This model, at some predefined time t 2 will instantly move a set number of people from the susceptible population (S) into the exposed population (E). Such a model is required in the context of New 27 . To investigate the interaction between government interventions and disease transmission dynamics, we need to introduce various reproduction numbers for the different action control strategies and stages. The estimation of R 0 is technically challenging 29 and a number of studies have been done 31, 32, 35, 38, 47 . However, these values are not specific to certain control policies. We identified which interventions are applied in the New Zealand alert levels, indicated in Table 2 by a tick (✔) or a cross (✗) to capture if a given intervention is applied (respectively not applied) in a given alert level. Each intervention is also weighted in its effectiveness, with the weighted sum being 2.184. A triangle ( ) is used when an intervention is partially applied. In this case, half the weight is considered. At the bottom of Table 2 , we show the calculated reproduction numbers for each alert level by taking into account both the base reproduction number R 0 and the interventions applied. In summary, the R 0 values for alert levels 4 through 1 are 0.316, 0.827, 1.384, 1.570 respectively. The maximum value of R 0 is 2.5, which corresponds to level 0. Additionally, for use with the previously described PL-2 model, we impose an R 0 value of 0.02 for confirmed cases to capture the enforced isolation placed upon them.In order to capture the increased testing rates (and more rigorous contact tracing) associated with higher alert levels, we also vary the value c used to represent the testing rate in PL-3. In this model, we use daily rates of 0.3, 0.2, 0.15 and 0.01 for alert levels 4 through 1, respectively.The controller NZ-C2, in Fig. 2a , matches a given alert level to its corresponding R 0 value. Initially, the control starts from Pre-LD and move to LD just like the previous controller in Fig. 1c . After 33 days this corresponds Table 2 .

After this point, the control enters Level 3, and the reproduction number is set to 0.827. The transitions 1 through 6 are taken based on time, like NZ-C1, since these mimic known time based government actions. Subsequently, the government decisions, which are yet unknown, will have to be mimicked using more complex mechanisms. We use the following strategy to determine the transition conditions, which will not be time based alone, as follows. First we denote the rate of new cases per day as Ċ and the current number of infected cases is I c We consider the following parameter values based on the published data from New Zealand 14 . We set k l4 , k l3 , k l2 , and k l1 as 100, 50, 5, and 1, respectively. dk l3 , dk l2 , and dk l1 are 10, 5, and 0.01, respectively. Finally, in our results, we assume that a vaccine will arrive 365 days after 20th March 2020. At this time, the number of susceptible people progressively decreases to zero, assuming widespread adoption of an effective vaccine.The conditions for increasing the alert level are based on the current number of infected cases ( I c ). For example, from level two if I c ≥ k l3 then the alert level immediately rises to three. On the other hand, the alert level can go down if the increasing rate of new cases per day ( Ċ ) is less than a certain amount. For example, from level three if Ċ ≤ dk l3 then the alert level decreases to level two. In addition, to avoid frequent oscillations between levels, a minimum duration within a level before being able to drop down to a lower level is added, and is set to be 14 days.The Italy model of COVID-19. Unlike New Zealand, Italy does not issue a systemic intervention strategy for COVID-19. Instead, the government releases the actions incrementally as they are needed. The Oxford COVID-19 15 provides a stringency index of the measures taken by various governments around the world. According to the stringency index of Italy's interventions, we divide the transmission trajectory into four phases. Considering that the initially reported cases are mostly imported rather than community transmission, the starting point of the analysis is 23rd February 2020, when the reported number of cases is 155. As a first attempt, we use the SEIR model 14 and curve fitting to estimate policy-specific reproduction numbers for Italy. We use the MATLAB function lsqcurvefit to search for these reproduction numbers for each phase by minimizing the square of the residual error between the SEIR simulation and the reported data 48 . The resulting reproduction numbers are listed in Table 3 .The controller is shown in Fig. 3a . For dropping alert levels, we have values of 10, 5, and 0.01 for dk l3 , dk l2 , and dk l1 respectively. The population of Italy (N) is 60,461,828 and we have level changing constraints of 6046,3023, and 605 for k l3 , k l2 , and k l1 , respectively. 23 is a recently developed tool in our group for the compositional modelling and verification of CPSs. To create the CCPE system in HAML we simply create two automata, one each for the plant and controller, and compose them as a single network. For the plant model, Listing 1a, we have an automata with an input R 0 value which is used to determine the rate of reproduction in the model. Additionally, there are two outputs for the number of currently infected (and tested) people, I c , and the rate of change in the number of cases ( C dot ). The two locations of Fig. 1b are shown which have the same flow constraints but differ in their calculation of the CFR to create a piecewise implementation of Eq. (10) through the use of update constraints.The discrete controller has external inputs and outputs which mirror those of the plant model, having two inputs, I c and C dot , and a single output, R 0 . Listing 1b shows this controller captured in HAML, using locations for each of discrete modes that it can be in. When the number of current confirmed cases ( I c ) reaches an upper bound for each location then the control progresses to a higher alert level, while when the change in number of cases ( C dot ) reaches a lower bound then control transitions to a lower alert level. The values of R 0 for each control location are taken from Table 2 .Finally, composition between these two components simply requires mapping their respective inputs and outputs together. This is achieved by defining each of the previous models, creating a single instance for each, and then providing the mapping of their variables, as shown in Listing 1c.

His view was that, in the absence of reaching substantive decisions, this made bioethics redundant. Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus epidemic in 2003, Thompson et al. (2006, 2) outlined the importance of bioethics input:… the SARS experience in Toronto taught health care organisations, the costs of not addressing the ethical concerns are severe: loss of public trust, low hospital staff morale, confusion about roles and responsibilities, stigmatization of vulnerable communities, and misinformation.They developed a framework guided by ethical decision-making processes and informed by ethical values. Like Ashcroft they emphasized the importance of fair process. Where Ashcroft felt the role of bioethics should be to make substantive decisions, Thompson et al. described a role for bioethics of developing a framework of values and principles. The aim was to articulate values that were already commonly accepted ""in the community of its intended users"" (Thompson et al. 2006) and it was to be used to inform decision-making. They described this as an exercise in applied, practical ethics. Following the SARS epidemic, the New Zealand National Ethics Advisory Committee (NEAC) published in 2007 the document ""Getting Through Together: Ethical Values for a Pandemic."" These were based around the Canadian example, with a focus on process and values (see National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007, 4-5 under "" Table 1 : Ethical values to inform how we make decisions"" and "" and includes rights and reciprocal obligations consistent with being part of a collective. It is the principle which binds individuals to the wider group and affirms the value of the collective. Whanaungatanga is inter-dependence with each other and recognition that the people are our wealth.As with Toronto, this was an exercise in practical/ applied ethics; a description of the values of the ""community of intended users."" A significant difference between the New Zealand framework and the Toronto framework was the inclusion of Māori ethical concepts. Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, comprise around 16 per cent of the population (Statistics New Zealand 2018). There has been a significant Māori cultural renaissance in New Zealand over the past forty years (Taonui 2017) , that has led to a broad acceptance that Māori values are an essential part of ethical decision-making in New Zealand. The NEAC ""National Ethical Standards for Health and Disability Research and Quality Improvement"" (National Ethics Advisory Committee 2019) and the code of ethics of the NZ Public Health Association (Public Health Association of New Zealand 2012) each have two sets of principles that sit alongside each other: a Māori list and a generic list. There is a lot of overlap but also some distinctive differences between the lists. While this analysis is based on there being a distinct Māori community, in reality there has been much merging of cultural values; There is increasing use of Māori language within the mainstream media and many Māori cultural practices are being adopted by the wider Aotearoa/New Zealand community, the most famous being the Haka performed by the rugby All Black team before a match. After the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the New Zealand Pandemic Influenza Plan (NZPIP) was developed, and updated in 2017 (Ministry of Health 2017). The plan was written with influenza as the main focus, but it was noted that the plan would be applicable for other respiratory infections such as, for example, SARS. Ethical issues were top of the key issues list in the NZPIP (Ministry of Health 2017, 15):People are more likely to accept difficult decisions if decision-making processes are open and transparent, reasonable, inclusive and responsive, with clear lines of accountability. Decision-making processes are also more likely to be acceptable if they are based on agreed, core ethical values.It also noted that: Some pandemic programmes must be implemented swiftly if they are to be effective, and some will have ethical components that need to be considered in real time. It will not always be effective to rely on usual processes.In short, the foundational principles of the ""Getting Through Together: Ethical Values for a Pandemic"" document (National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007) are deeply embedded in the current New Zealand Pandemic Influenza Plan.In responding to COVID-19, a clear delineation was made between the science on which actions were based (represented by Director General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield), the ethical foundation on which decisions were based (that were embedded in the planning), and the politics of what was likely to be possible (led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern).It was clear by mid-March 2020 that the option of no policy response had a high risk of large numbers of infections and deaths, and a collapse of the local health system. A choice had to be made as to what to do and our government decided to ""Go hard, go early."" On March 26, 2020, a high level of community lockdown was imposed (Level 4), allowing only essential services to operate. Details of what each level entailed are 1 Aotearoa is the Māori name for the country of New Zealand. (New Zealand Government 2020). After one month at Level 4 restrictions, a decision was made to extend it for a further week before moving to Level 3. The basis of the decision was clearly signalled in advance and the extension was needed to ensure that capacity for contact tracing would be capable of managing the increased cases that might happen after restrictions loosened. These actions required a combination of the science (detail on contact tracing capacity, numbers of cases, amount of community spread), the ethical framework (described below), and the politics of whether the country would get behind the decision. The last two are of course linked in that if the ethical framework used is one that is shared by the community then it is more likely members will follow the rules. We moved to Level 2 on May 13 and finally to Level 1 on June 9 2020. Good communication was a central element of the strategy. From mid-March until mid-May there were daily media briefings from the Prime Minister (PM) or other government ministers and the Director General of Health or other public servants. 2 I have selected some quotes from these briefings to illustrate the values articulated in ethical frameworks at work.Unity/KotahitangaWe have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved-elimination of the virus-but it will continue to need a team of five million behind it. (PM Jacinda Ardern, April 16, 2020)Today, I can confirm that myself, Government Ministers, and Public Service chief executives will take a 20 percent pay cut for the next six months (PM Jacinda Ardern, April 15, 2020)While acknowledging that the sum would make little practical difference to the government budget it was couched as an example of leadership and described alongside the sacrifices that many others had made.Neighbourliness/whānaungatanga Please be strong, be kind, and unite against COVID-19. (PM Jacinda Ardern, March 21, 2020)We are seeking physical separation not social separation-reach out to people and most importantly be kind. (Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield, March 29, 2020)Throughout her briefings Prime Minister Ardern emphasized kindness and compassion. Particular emphasis was put on being kind to stressed supermarket workers and other front line staff. Fairness[The Ministry of Education] is also working with schools to identify students who do not have a device at home. It will deliver as many devices and materials as possible to students who will benefit the most. (Education package April 8th)This was a clear commitment to addressing inequalities. An important argument in favour of elimination was that in the event that the virus spread the impact would be greater on more disadvantaged communities (Wilson et al. 2020) . OpennessNow, I share this with you because we have been open and transparent throughout this fight against COVID-19, and I personally believe really strongly that it is only fair. Since we are all in this together, we need to all keep working together for success, and that means us sharing with everyone the factors we'll be taking into consideration and the data we use. (PM Jacinda Ardern, April 19, 2020)The PM frequently emphasized the importance of transparency. She signalled in advance when big decisions would be made and what the basis of those judgements would be. There were several Facebook question and answer sessions with the public. The media had a lot of time for questions and answers after each release, that were answered clearly and with a commitment to find information if not immediately available … which was then followed through. The PM made it very clear that the goal was not just controlling the epidemic but overall well-being.During that time, our focus has been to protect the health of New Zealanders. Alongside this, we've 2 Video and transcripts of briefings and copies of media statements are listed by date on the Ministry of Health website ""COVID-19 (novel coronavirus)-News and media updates"" section, available at https: //www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-novel-coronavirus-news-and-mediaupdates.

Public approval ratings suggest Prime Minister Ardern and Director General of Health Bloomfield mostly achieved this. Jacinda Ardern's preferred Prime Minister rating on May 21, 2020, had gone up 21 per cent, to 63 per cent, the highest of any Prime Minister in the twenty-five years the poll has been conducted (Colmar Brunton 2020).Google COVID mobility data showed that New Zealanders adhered to lockdown measures better than in most countries (Ritchie 2020) . There was little in the way of enforcement required to achieve this. For a total population of five million, between March 23 and April 23, 2020 (during the Level 4 lockdown):… police recorded 4,452 breaches of the Civil Defence Emergency Management or Health Act … 477 prosecutions, 3,844 warnings, 131 youth referrals. (Commissioner of Police, April 23, 2020 briefing)The reality of steering through a pandemic is that there are myriad decisions to be made, in real time with insufficient information. There has been much debate in the media around these decisions. Many of the ideas raised have later been adopted as policy and there has been wide consultation with many sector groups. The approach taken of widely sharing available information as it comes to hand, having a clear sense of the ethical basis on which decisions will be made, and holding the trust and commitment of the population has been successful.New Zealand is fortunate in its experience of COVID-19. We are a relatively sparsely populated island nation, although with a (previously) large tourism industry. The pandemic started far from our shores and we had time to make choices on how to respond. We have significant capacity in academic public health expertise but had to rapidly upscale our on-the-ground public health capacity to test and contact trace. We had developed a detailed pandemic plan with an explicit ethical framework. At the time of writing, New Zealand had avoided widespread infection and death. Bioethics articulated a framework that reflected the values and beliefs of the people who live here. Content specialist colleagues in clinical medicine, public health, modelling, economics, and many others interpreted the often uncertain information and provided good communications on which to base decisions. Our politicians, in particular Prime Minister, provided the leadership in making difficult decisions based on the ethical framework and scientific information, while building and maintaining the trust of the population necessary to implement them. Bioethics played an important role in eliminating COVID-19 from New Zealand.","New Zealand","abstract","2020-11-09","11"

With a reproductive rate between 2 and 3 [1] , low case numbers can exponentially rise without proper infection prevention and public health interventions in place. In parallel to public health responses, health services have had to swiftly implement internal strategies to maintain their workforce. One of these key strategies is rapid and effective contact tracing within the healthcare workplace. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines contact tracing as ""the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission"" [2] . In the context of COVID-19, this involves identifying index cases, establishing close contacts of the confirmed case and isolating them, with or without initial testing as appropriate. Predictive modelling has shown that contact tracing and case isolation is an effective way to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent transmission [3, 4] . As a vaccine is at least months away from being widely available, reducing the spread of COVID-19 is our only option to prevent mass hospitalisations and unnecessary deaths.In Australia, contact tracing is the responsibility of the relevant state or territory public health department which, in the state of Victoria, is the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). However, the DHHS has outlined the expectation that local health services initiate their own contact tracing should they have a confirmed case involving a patient or healthcare worker (HCW) within their health service [5] . In the 2003 SARS CoV-1 epidemic, a significant proportion of cases were amongst HCWs, demonstrating that this group, and therefore hospitals, are susceptible to outbreaks [6e8]. Similarly, early evidence suggests that HCWs are at an increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 [9] . Given that HCWs can come into contact with hundreds of vulnerable patients each day, it is vital that contact tracing is completed in a timely manner to prevent the possibility of 'super-spreading' events. Despite this need, clear policies for large hospitals to enact in order to achieve this goal are lacking.Here we describe the approach taken by Monash Health for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order that other centres may contrast their approach and outcomes.Monash Health is the largest healthcare provider in the Australian state of Victoria, with more than 40 sites and 16,000 employees. It provides care to the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, a city of five million, with more than 250,000 admissions annually. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Monash Health implemented a strategy to establish rapid contact tracing for confirmed cases within the service.This strategy consists of four steps completed within defined timeframes as outlined in Fig. 1 . The intended benefit of this approach was to allow for rapid escalation and implementation of contact tracing once a positive COVID-19 case was identified. This approach was developed and led by the Hospital Incident Command Team (HICT) overseeing the COVID-19 response within Monash Health.Step One: notify 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63 infectious and the likelihood of transmission in the workplace, and briefs the executive team comprising the Chief Executive (CE) and Chief Operating Officer (COO).Step One is completed within one hour of the confirmed COVID-19 case. This rapid notification is intended to ensure that the issue is escalated to the highest level so that a co-ordinated contact tracing process can commence.Step two: build the team To implement and monitor the contact tracing process, an Outbreak Management Team (OMT) is created, with clearly defined roles as outlined in Table 1 . Once notification has been received, the CE and COO activate the OMT and an Infection Prevention Consultant (IPC) is allocated to drive the contact tracing process. Having this team structure ensures that there are no delays to commencing contact tracing and isolating individuals. It also reduces any lack of role clarity regarding individual responsibilities during the process.During the contract tracing, the OMT meets numerous times via video conference to monitor and support the contact tracing process. Other relevant staff members are invited as necessary. Each OMT meeting covers a specific agenda, as outlined in Table 2 . The use of a consistent agenda provides a formal structure to each meeting, ensuring that all implications of a positive COVID-19 case are managed, limiting unintended consequences such as HCW shortages. Frequent meetings over a short time period also provide an easy way to track the progress of contact tracing and provide any additional support as required.Step Three: trace Predictive modelling has shown that any delays in contact tracing can significantly reduce its effectiveness [10] . In recognition of this, Step Three commences simultaneously with Step One. This process is led by Infection Prevention, a multidisciplinary unit tasked with preventing nosocomial infections. First, a comprehensive phone interview is conducted with the index case to determine where and how the virus was acquired, time of symptom onset, and identify any potential close contacts. A contact tracing team (CTT) is then formed, with the assistance of the Operational Lead (see Table 1 ), to notify relevant managers and compile a list of potential contacts through employee and patient lists. The CTT proceeds to call each potential contact to determine exposure risk, based on amount of contact, the environment in which the potential exposure occurred, PPE use, and whether the employee works at multiple sites or across different wards. Using this 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63 information, contacts can be stratified using a risk matrix (Table 3) to determine the need for 14-day quarantine and/ or testing. This risk matrix is able to be adjusted for an individual situation and ensures consistent guidance for the CTT. To update the HCW team impacted upon by the case and provide support, a forum for team members via video conference is also organised. As contacts are identified and placed in isolation or quarantine, the Operational Lead assesses how this will impact on service delivery. If a large number of employees need to be furloughed, a Contingency Workforce Plan is activated to ensure services can be provided as close to normal levels as possible. While Step 3 is underway, it is vital that Infection Prevention and the Operational Leads meet regularly to ensure that it is progressing at an appropriate speed. This can be achieved through regular team 'huddles' via video or phone conference. It is critical that this step is completed within three to 24 h of the confirmed COVID-19 case so that employees can be furloughed before onward transmission.Step four: communicate transparently Once close contacts are identified and in isolation, it is imperative that they are followed-up daily to monitor for any symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as their general health and wellbeing. This responsibility is initially given to Infection Prevention to communicate the need for isolation. Thereafter this is handed over to the People and Culture (Human Resources) team who provide daily welfare checks, help with accommodation needs, and provide reminders for testing on day 11. If a large number of staff have been furloughed, the Operational Lead will implement the Contingency Workforce Plan to ensure continuity of health service delivery. The DHHS and HICT are also updated.During this step, it is important that communication with employees is open and transparent. This is achieved through a series of strategies. Organisation-wide emails, and regular 'huddles' lead by managers, take place daily or on alternate days. Weekly staff fora are held that allow frank and open communication between those directly affected by the contact tracing process and leadership including the CE and COO. Additional communications strategies include a dedicated COVID-19 website allowing around the clock access to the latest information such as PPE tier requirements, and regular updates from the CE. When an outbreak occurs, the CE uses these updates to inform all employees of data including the number of positive COVID-19 patients, HCW cases, and employees on furlough. This transparency is intended to build trust, allow for questions to be answered to reduce knowledge asymmetry, and maintain a sense of belonging.A review of every HCW infection is also undertaken. This is aimed to establish processes that need refining and lessons learnt are then communicated to both the OMT and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63 wider health service community, so that an ongoing infection prevention strategy is maintained.This report covers the period between June and September 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic in Melbourne, Victoria. At this time case numbers escalated to a peak of over 600 cases a day, compulsory mask wearing was in place and community lockdown was at stage 4 for a prolonged period. In this time, forty-one OMTs occurred, involving 23 HCW and 18 patient index cases. The total furloughed HCWs arising from these contact traces was 383, with individual contact traces furloughing a mean (range) of 10 (0e80) HCWs. Importantly, 15 furloughed HCWs subsequently became COVID positive during their 14-day isolation period, showing the importance of the contact tracing process and the ability to remove workers from the workplace before they become infectious. No ongoing transmission has been identified from any outbreak once an OMT has been put in place.Since implementing the contact tracing process outlined here in June 2020, we have been able to evaluate risk and follow the identify, trace and isolate algorithm in a timely, open and transparent manner in every case.

Primarily, these experimental vaccines are focused on induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies using various vaccine technology platforms such as synthetic spike proteins and viral vectors. This is not surprising, given that historically antibodies have been used as an immune correlate of vaccine-mediated protection against infectious diseases. However, given our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, one would predict that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + cytotoxic T (Tc) cells will play an important role in facilitating recovery and protection against severe COVID-19. The potential benefit of additional Tc cell-mediated immunity is not only in preventing deaths but also in minimizing the risk of transmission to others by reducing viral load and thus shedding during the recovery phase.The important feature of an effective vaccine is induction of long-lived immunity. A recently published non-human primate study demonstrated that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against homologous re-infection 4 weeks after the initial exposure, and this protection was found to be associated with neutralizing antibodies [2] . However, while achieving sterilizing immunity via induction of neutralizing antibodies appears feasible, growing concerns exist that protective levels of neutralizing antibodies do not persist. Numerous clinical studies have shown that antigen-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS, a disease caused by a closely related coronavirus, can wane rapidly within 1-3 years among survivors of the 2003 SARS epidemic [3, 4] . It is noteworthy that human coronaviruses, although less virulent, have been causing seasonal infections, much like influenza, which indicates that either viral mutation enables coronaviruses to evade antibodies and/or antibody-mediated protection is short-lived [5] . Indeed, studies show that reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses occurs frequently, with protective immunity lasting as little as 80 days [6, 7] . Similarly, an early study on SARS-CoV-2 reported that some individuals who apparently recovered from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have tested positive a second time, an indication of potential reinfection [8, 9] . Furthermore, a recent serological study reported that 40% and 12.9% of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively, became seronegative within 2-3 months after infection [10] . Therefore, unless the vaccine induces immunity more efficiently than the live virus, one would expect that vaccine-induced antibodies will likewise be short lasting. Achieving sterilizing immunity by antibody-based vaccines may prove difficult.Given the above, Tc cell immunity against coronaviruses may present an important aspect of any successful vaccine as it is thought to be long-lived. Recent studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells that are capable of expressing IFNγ and/or granzyme B in 40~60% of uninfected individuals [11, 12] . Notably, this percentage increased to 80-100% for convalescent COVID-19 patients, suggesting that (1) unlike antibodies, Tc cells against coronaviruses persist in humans and can be detected months and/or years after an infection; (2) memory Tc cells are directed against conserved regions of coronaviruses and therefore are broadly cross-reactive; and (3) specific T cell responses are associated with recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. An implication based on these observations is that coronaviruses will be less likely to evade Tc cell immunity due to MHC class I polymorphism. Indeed, a potential benefit of T cell responses was recently demonstrated in two clinical studies that found an inverse correlation between severe COVID-19 and lower CD4 + and CD8 + T cell blood counts on admission [13, 14] . Thus, there are realistic benefits for considering T cell-based vaccination approaches against COVID-19. Future studies are needed to determine whether Tc cell immunity influences the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive Tc cells prior to an infection correlates with the development of less severe COVID-19. It is important to note, however, that T-cell-based vaccines will unlikely provide sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 since cytotoxic T cells will engage after an infection of host cells. Therefore, an ideal COVID-19 vaccine should stimulate both B and T cell immunity to complement each other to provide optimal protection against severe COVID-19.Several forms (inactivated, recombinant protein, DNA, RNA, and viral-vector-based) of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Whether these experimental vaccines are capable of providing protective T cell immunity in humans is currently unknown and should be investigated. In particular, DNA-and RNA-based vaccines, in theory, should generate MCH-I antigens in situ in a manner similar to natural viral infection. However, it should be noted that DNA vaccines have been tested against other infectious diseases in humans and have failed in the past to demonstrate the induction of strong immune responses [15] [16] [17] . As for inactivated and purified viral vaccines, a substantial amount of data exists in the literature that inactivated antigens are mainly dependent on the MHC-II pathway and therefore they are not anticipated to mount strong MHC-I-restricted immune responses [18] [19] [20] . Lastly, although several viral vectors are currently approved for human use, several challenges exist for their application. These include (1) immunodominance of the vector genes over transgenes; and (2) pre-existing anti-vector immunity due to natural exposure to the virus or induction of anti-vector immunity upon first use, which would not permit effective use of the same viral vector in the same patient.Generally, the generation of Tc cell immunity requires live viral infection, and therefore most viral inactivation methods eliminate T cell immunogenicity. However, early studies in the 1970s and 80s have identified gamma-irradiation as a superior inactivation method that can better preserve T cell immunogenicity relative to other inactivation procedures. This favorable characteristic of gamma-irradiation can be attributed to the high penetrative strength of gamma-rays that cause direct damage to genetic material without altering structural proteins [21] . Therefore, gamma-irradiated viruses should be able to infect host cells without producing infectious progeny. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that alphaviruses [22] and bunyaviruses [23] can be rendered non-infectious by gamma-irradiation and yet still possess the capacity to generate cytotoxic T cell responses. We later applied gamma-irradiation to prepare an experimental influenza vaccine and reported that gamma-ray irradiated sterile influenza virus preparations promote Tc cell immunity [24] [25] [26] [27] . Most importantly, gamma-ray irradiated influenza virus preparations were highly protective against heterologous influenza infections, including H5N1 avian flu, in mice, and this T cell memory was found to be long-lived [24] [25] [26] 28] . This experimental protocol of using low dose-rate sterilizing gamma irradiation of whole viruses for induction of long-lasting Tc cell immunity has been shown to be generally applicable if the immunodominant Tc cell determinants are located in structural virus proteins [24] . This approach may enable the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to enter the class I MHC antigen presentation pathway [11] .The obvious strength of a gamma-ray irradiation approach is that virus replication can be eliminated while preserving its infectivity and immunogenicity, thus presenting the viral proteins to the immune system in a natural way, facilitating the induction of both T cell and humoral immunity. In addition, vaccine manufacturing has been greatly simplified, solely requiring cell culture virus growth, purification, and low-dose inactivation using a gamma ray source generally readily available for sterilization procedures of commercial products. Lastly, our previous work has also demonstrated an antigen dose sparing effect of gamma-irradiated virus in mice [27] (discussed in Furuya [29] ). This, of course, is important during a pandemic when enough vaccine doses are need to be manufactured with limited production capacity in a short time frame. Therefore, a gamma-ray irradiated virus vaccine could fulfill the unmet need for a safe, cost-effective, widely distributable COVID-19 vaccine.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and has infected tens of millions worldwide and caused over 1.2 million deaths since its discovery in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (Richardson et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) .Although mild or asymptomatic in many cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly and individuals with chronic health problems can result in severe COVID-19 requiring invasive ventilation or in death (Meyts et al., 2020; Ruan et al., 2020; .Since early 2020, many insights have been obtained into the pathology of severe COVID-19. It appears that high viral loads induce strong inflammatory responses that cause systemic disease, especially in the elderly and in individuals with co-morbidities requiring immunosuppression (Ruan et al., 2020) . Immunomodulation with corticosteroids has improved survival in hospitalized individuals, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatments have shown early evidence of alleviating symptoms and decreasing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in mild disease (Beigel et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) .The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a huge global effort to identify a safe therapeutic vaccine to induce protective immunity. Our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity is based mainly on previous experiences with SARS-CoV, supplemented with recent studies in patients infected with and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar to SARS-CoV infection (Huang et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2004) , the main antibody targets in SARS-CoV-2 are the spike and nucleocapsid proteins (NCP) (Burbelo et al., 2020; Grzelak et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2020) . These antibodies are detectable from approximately 6 days after PCR confirmation of infection, and those directed against spike receptor binding domain (RBD) show neutralizing capacity and hence, can prevent infection (Seydoux et al., 4 2020; Suthar et al., 2020) . However, the rapid decline of anti-SARS-COV-2 serum IgG levels beyond 20 days post-diagnosis and the transient presence of circulating plasmablasts have led to questions about the longevity of immunity (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Ibarrondo et al., 2020; Newell et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020) . In contrast, antigen-specific memory T cells and memory B (Bmem) cells can be detected in convalescence (Juno et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020) . As these memory cells are programmed to respond rapidly upon subsequent antigen encounter, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these long-lived memory cells provide durable long-term immunity (Cox and Brokstad, 2020; Nguyen-Contant et al., 2020) . However, detailed insight into the nature and longevity of the Bmem cell compartment specific to SARS-CoV-2 is currently still unresolved (Vabret et al., 2020) .We extensively characterized the SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cell compartment using unique sets of fluorescently-labeled recombinant tetramers of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NCP antigens in combination with an extensive flowcytometry panel. The SARS-CoV-2specific Bmem cells were quantified and characterized in 36 samples from 25 patients with COVID-19 or in convalescence. Circulating RBD-and NCP-specific Bmem cell subsets were detected early after infection and persisted over 242 days post-symptom onset. Early after infection, Ag-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM, over time followed by a predominance of IgG1. RBD-specific Bmem cell numbers were found to positively correlate with circulating Tfh cells suggesting prolonged germinal center (GC) activity. These analyses highlight that a decline in serum antibodies in convalescence may not reflect waning of immunity, but rather a contraction of the immune response with the development and persistence of B-cell memory.The antigen-specific B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was characterized using recombinant forms of the RBD and NCP. Both proteins were generated in Expi293F cells with an AviTag for targeted biotinylation and tetramerization with fluorescently-labeled streptavidins to minimize epitope masking (Figure 1A and B) . Two tetramers with distinct fluorochromes were generated for each protein: BV480 and BV650 for RBD, and BUV395 and BUV737 for NCP. In subjects with a history of COVID-19, distinct populations of RBD-specific and NCP-specific B cells were detected using double-discrimination ( Figure 1C ). Detection of these populations was highly specific, because neither population was detected in noninfected controls, and the RBD-and NCP-tetramers stained distinct B-cell subsets ( Figure   1C ).The SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and B-cell response was investigated in 25 COVID-19 confirmed patients with samples obtained between 4-and 242-days after symptom onset (Table 1) . Patients were classified into three levels of disease severity (WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characterisation and management of Covid-19 infection, 2020): six with severe disease requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit (ICU); three with moderate disease requiring non-ICU hospital admission, and 16 with mild disease managed in the community (Table 1) . 11 patients were sampled twice (paired samples); first between 21-106 days post-symptom onset and again at 116-242 days to evaluate the longevity of Bmem cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Table 1) . At the time of blood sampling, the majority of patients had normal blood counts of the major leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets ( Table 2) . Of note, the three patients sampled within 14 days post-symptom onset showed 6 CD3 + T-cell lymphopenia due to reduced CD8 + T-cell counts ( Table 2) . All patients exhibited normal absolute numbers of B cells ( Table 2) .The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients was examined with a pseudovirus neutralization assay. 22/25 patients had neutralizing antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the 36 uninfected controls had detectable neutralizing titers ( Figure   2A ). IgG ELISAs were performed to both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NCP proteins in 25 patients and 36 controls. All 25 patients were positive for RBD-specific IgG and 24/25 were positive for NCP-specific IgG, i.e. 2 standard deviations (2SD) above the median of healthy controls ( Figure 2B and C). All controls and patients had detectable levels of IgG to hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza H1N1 strain A/Michigan/45/2015 ( Figure 2D ) (Hartley et al., 2020) , which was a recommended strain in the quadrivalent annual vaccine from 2017-2019 (Australian Immunisation Handbook, 2018). There was no significant difference in HA antibody levels between the patient and control groups. Thus, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NCP proteins are recognized by antibodies in COVID-19 patients with high sensitivity and specificity.The neutralization titers (ID50), and RBD-and NCP-specific IgG levels in our patients declined over time in convalescence (Figure 2E-G) . Neutralizing antibody titers were highest in patients sampled approximately 20 days post-symptom onset and subsequently contracted ( Figure 2E ). All ID50 titers were lower in the second sample of the 11 paired samples, and 7/11 repeat samples were at or below the threshold of neutralizing capacity (ID50 of 20) (Figure 2E ). In parallel, RBD-and NCP-specific IgG levels were highest in the patients sampled around 20 days post-symptom onset, and in 10/11 repeat samples the RBDand NCP-specific IgG levels were lower than the first draw ( Figure 2F and G) . Still, the 7 decline after 20 days seemed to reach a plateau between 120-240 days with nearly all samples having detectable levels of RBD-and NCP-specific IgG.To examine the nature and kinetics of the RBD-and NCP-specific Bmem following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the RBD and NCP proteins were biotinylated and tetramerized with fluorescently-labeled streptavidins. RBD-and NCP-specific B cells were flowcytometrically evaluated in all 36 samples for expression of markers for plasmablasts (CD38), activated (CD71) and resting (CD27) Bmem cells, as well as surface IgD, IgA and IgG1, 2, 3 and 4 subclasses ( Figure 3A ) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Patients 1-3, sampled between 5-14 days post-onset of symptoms showed a large population of CD38 high CD27 + plasmablasts, whereas this population was negligible in any of the samples taken >20 days post-onset of symptoms (Supplementary Figure 1) . Bmem cells were defined using IgD and CD27 (Figure 3A -C).The numbers and Ig isotype distribution of RBD-and NCP-specific Bmem cell subsets varied between individuals. However, similar trends were still observed for both subsets with higher proportions and absolute numbers of IgG1 + RBD-and NCP-specific Bmem cells in samples taken 26 days or more post-symptom onset ( Figure 4A RBD-specific Bmem cell numbers were highest between 100-150 days post-symptom onset ( Figure 4C ). Total and IgM + Bmem cells in paired samples taken >200 days were lower than in the corresponding first samples, whereas IgG + Bmem cells remained stable. NCP-specific Bmem cell numbers increased over the first 150 days as well, and in contrast to RBD-specific Bmem cells, they did not decline between 150-240 days ( Figure 4D ).In summary, RBD-and NCP-specific IgG and Bmem cells were detected in all 25 patients with a history of COVID-19. While serum specific IgG levels declined with time postsymptom onset, SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell numbers persisted, and RBD-specific Bmem cell numbers correlated with Tfh cell numbers. This long-term presence of circulating Bmem cell subsets directed against both the major SARS-CoV-2 neutralization target (RBD) and a non-neutralizing target (NCP) is indicative of long-term immunity following natural exposure and could provide a means to evaluate lasting immunity following vaccination.We have shown that COVID-19 patients rapidly generate B-cell memory to both the spike and nucleocapsid antigens following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rare events, numbers of Bmem cells specific for the major neutralization target, RBD, and a major non-neutralizing target, NCP, were both in the same order of magnitude. Using an extensive flow cytometry panel, we show that in line with typical T-cell dependent responses, IgM + Bmem predominated in the first 20 days post-infection, followed by a gradual increase in IgG1 + Bmem. The fact that nearly all RBD-specific IgG + Bmem cells expressed CD27 and their numbers correlated with circulating Tfh cells is indicative of long-lived immune memory.In our patient population, we observed few abnormalities in the total B-cell population.All patients had total B-cell numbers within the normal range for age-matched controls. This finding is in contrast to some studies that reported a decrease in B-cell frequencies during COVID-19 infection which normalized in convalescence (Kaneko et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Oliviero et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . However, these studies report frequencies rather than absolute numbers and as such an increase in other immune subsets such as NK cells could cause the observed decrease in B-and T-cells (Mathew et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .Influenza virus (Gulley and Tang, 2008; Krajden et al., 2005; Nhat et al., 2017; Ross et al., 2011) . The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to be directed to multiple targets of the virus including the spike, with those that target the RBD considered neutralizing (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Vabret et al., 2020) . Other antibodies target the NCP (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; or non-structural proteins (Hachim et al., 2020) . Detection of such antibodies can be used as markers of recent infection. However, it has been reported that antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 decrease over time (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020) . What we now show is that this decrease reflects a contraction of the immune response.Despite the decline in antibody levels, these remain present at detectable levels until 240 days post-symptom onset and their presence is accompanied by the persistence of RBD-and NCPspecific Bmem cells. These antigen-specific Bmem are rapidly generated and particularly those expressing IgG + remain numerically high, and hence may represent a more robust marker of long-term immunity.which exhibited minimal non-specific B-cell binding and increased the sensitivity of our assay (Hartley et al., 2020) .Our study, for the first time shows the kinetics and longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cell numbers. Other studies have identified SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in COVID-19 patients with particular focus on the RBD of the spike protein, mainly for the purpose of cloning neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (Juno et al., 2020; Nguyen-Contant et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2020) . Such studies have observed a predominant IgG + B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 with lower frequencies of cells expressing IgM and IgA (Brouwer et al., 2020; Juno et al., 2020; Rodda et al., 2020) .We have expanded on this through detailed flow cytometry with the inclusion of absolute cell counts to show that SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM or IgG1. This distinction enabled the discrimination between the initially large fraction of IgM + Bmem cells that tended to decline beyond 150 days, while the IgG expressing fraction persisted and those specific for RBD correlated strongly with circulating Tfh cells.The Bmem cell populations directed against the two SARS-CoV-2 targets showed remarkable differences. The RBD-specific Bmem cells were nearly all CD27 + and strongly correlated with Tfh cells, while this was not observed for NCP-specific Bmem cells.Differential expression of CD27 and IgG subclasses on human Bmem cells are associated with different maturation stages (Berkowska et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2017) . Typically, CD27 + Bmem cells have more somatic hypermutations and have undergone more cell divisions than those lacking CD27 expression (Berkowska et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2017) .has been reported in COVID-19 patients early in convalescence (15-36 days post-infection) (Kaneko et al., 2020) . It would be of interest to study whether this activity increases or persists beyond 36 days. Similarly, detailed molecular studies and somatic hypermutation analysis of RBD-specific Bmem could provide insights into prolonged GC activity. For ongoing GC reactions, continual antigen exposure is required. Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, form double membrane vesicles in the host cell as part of their replication cycle (Angelini et al., 2013; Snijder et al., 2020) . These vesicles contain antigen (Snijder et al., 2006) , persist after infection and hence, could drive prolonged GC activity.We here show long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells with kinetics that suggest high durability, particularly of those expressing IgG. Bmem cells show evidence of antigen experience through extensive replication cycles, elevated somatic hypermutation levels and class switch recombination (Berkowska et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2017) . After infection, a portion of Bmem cells can be measured with an 'activated' phenotype (CD21 lo CD27 + ) and this population has been shown to contract after ~2 weeks (Andrews et al., 2019; Ellebedy et al., 2016) . The remaining Bmem cells are defined as 'resting' with a predominant CD21 + CD27 + phenotype. Furthermore, Bmem cells have been shown to increase expression of surface molecules including CD80, CD180 and TACI indicating the potential for rapid activation upon antigen re-encounter (Berkowska et al., 2011; Berkowska et al., 2015) .Whilst these markers have not been assessed in SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells, they display the classical surface markers (ie. CD27 +/-IgG + ) indicating long-lived memory. There have been some studies reporting that the Bmem cell response to SARS-CoV may not be long-lived (Tang et al., 2011; Traggiai et al., 2004) , however, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates long-lasting B-cell immunity up to 8 months post-infection and could be protective upon reinfection.However, we propose that the establishment of systemic immunity will prevent severe systemic COVID-19, and reinfection may be limited to a mild or asymptomatic upper respiratory tract infection.The identification and analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells could potentially be used as a surrogate marker of humoral immunity in vaccination studies. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trials investigate predominantly SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies as markers of vaccine efficacy (Corbett et al., 2020; Folegatti et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Logunov et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; . As we have shown that SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cell numbers are stable over time, we propose that they may represent a more robust marker of long-lived humoral immunity compared to serum antibodies. As antibody levels decline when the immune response contracts, IgG + Bmem cells remain present, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 induces long-term humoral immunity.Therefore, cellular measurements of immune response could be more reliable markers for immunity following natural infection or vaccination.Blood samples of patients and controls were processed as previously described (Edwards et al., 2019; Hartley et al., 2020) . Briefly, 200 µl was used for whole blood cell counts (Cell Dyn analyser; Abbott core laboratory, Abbott Park, IL) and Trucount analysis (see flow cytometry section). The remainder was used to separate and store plasma (-80°C), and to isolate live peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by Ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation and cryopreservation at a cell density of 10 million cells/ml in RPMI medium with 40% FCS and 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells.Recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NCP) and receptor binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were produced with a human immunoglobulin (Ig) leader and the Fel d 1 leader sequence, respectively. Each protein construct was C-terminally fused to the biotin ligase (BirA) AviTag target sequence and a 6His affinity tag ( Figure 1A) . The DNA constructs were cloned into a pCR3 plasmid and produced and purified as described Measurement of neutralizing antibodies was performed using SARS-CoV-2 retroviral pseudotyped particles and a 293T-ACE2 cell line (Crawford et al., 2020) as described before (Jackson et al., 2020) . Plasma was heat inactivated at 56°C for 45 minutes followed by serial dilution in DMF10. Each dilution was mixed in duplicate with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 (WUHAN-1 spike) retroviral pseudotyped virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.All flow cytometry data was analyzed with FlowJo v10 software (TreeStar, Ashland, Ore).Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 8 Software (GraphPad Software).Matched pairs were analyzed with the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Unpaired groups were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test.MCvZ, ROH and PMH are inventors on a patent application related to this work.

I will consider three of these models in turn.The first is a linear model that has exerted an enormous influence on public discourse and action during the pandemic: the epidemiological curve. The second is a threshold model that creates common ground for epidemiology and ethics, and which is exemplified by the ethical framework published elsewhere in this issue (Dawson et al. 2020 ). The third is narrative, which provides a resource for imagining and creating an aftermath to the pandemic.I will use the second model to offer a justification for taking caring responsibilities into consideration when allocating scarce resources during pandemics. My basic argument is that we should prioritize the survival of patients with caring responsibilities for similar reasons we should prioritize the survival of healthcare professionals. More generally, the pandemic reveals the fundamental importance of informal care and affords an opportunity to raise questions of justice relating to it.The epidemiological curve emplots our collective experience as a peak we must ascend and, by implication, descend. It has been used by expert authorities to persuade publics to accept control measures in order to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed, thereby precipitating the kind of scenarios I invoke below. The epidemiological curve presents an inherent problem when it comes to guiding purposive, future-directed collective action, however. It forces us to navigate an outbreak with our back to the future (so to speak) because the ""flattening"" of the curve becomes apparent only retrospectively. Confirmed cases register infections that occurred in the past-and how long in the past is a fact we only discover as the outbreak unfolds. Furthermore, the model gives rise to a tension that is often framed, rightly or wrongly, as a trade-off between health outcomes and economic outcomes. If we abandon our control measures too early, we risk unleashing a second wave of infections (Xu and Li 2020) . Those who accord primary value to human life typically regard this as a greater mistake than the alternative, which is to bear the costs of control measures for longer than (with the wisdom of hindsight) they might turn out to have been necessary.Threshold models take their bearings from ""tipping points"" at which the norms governing ""business as usual"" can with justification be supervened by a modified set of norms that come into play in exceptional circumstances. In the ethical framework published elsewhere in this issue (Dawson et al. 2020) , tipping points occur wherever demand for an important resource outstrips supply. A similar model (Kain and Fowler 2019) expresses thresholds as a percentage of the normal capacity of healthcare systems. Apparently, it is normal to run these systems at 120 to 130 per cent capacity, but at 150 per cent we enter ""code orange,"" which triggers the activation of pandemic preparedness measures. At 170 per cent of normal capacity, standards of care are modified and, beyond that, the logic of triage comes into play: patients who have a reasonable prospect of survival are turned away (the ""walking wounded""), those who are expected to die get comfort care, and medical resources are focused on those who are most likely to benefit from them. As these resources become increasingly scarce, however, patients in the latter group are forced into a queue.The ethical framework (Dawson et al. 2020 ) suggests that any existing moral consensus is at this point pulled in three different directions which can be broadly characterized as utilitarian, egalitarian, or geared to redressing discrimination and social disadvantage. Each of these approaches can be defended with reference to an established ethical literature on justice, but each yields responses that court objections from the others. For example, lottery-type solutions that can be justified by egalitarian principles are resisted by those who prioritize stewardship of resources. 1 Similarly, measures that flow from egalitarian and utilitarian approaches court justifiable criticism on the grounds that the burdens of discrimination and disadvantage include the social determinants of ill-health; so if patients from disadvantaged groups are not ""triaged out"" on medical grounds, they enter queues or lotteries on an uneven playing field.According to recent empirical research, public perceptions of fairness in Australia and New Zealand reflect trust in expert judgement and disfavour lottery-type solutions and considerations of social utility (Cheung et al. 2017) . These findings obscure the degree to which expert judgements rest on utilitarian considerations that range from widely acceptable (e.g., number of lives saved) to contentious (e.g., number of life-years saved) to controversial. The latter include considerations not only of social utility but also of the quality of life saved, or ""characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, religious or political views"" (Dawson et al. 2020, Part B.5.a) .One consideration of social utility which appears not to attract much controversy is that of according priority to healthcare workers. Perhaps this is because it can be supported by several ethical justifications that have wide intuitive appeal. One justification appeals to a notion of fairness as reciprocity: it is a way to compensate for risks these workers assume in discharging their professional duty (Provincial COVID-19 Task Force 2020; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007). Another justification is plainly utilitarian: this policy will enable healthcare workers to resume the struggle to save lives (Emanuel et al. 2020) ; in effect, they count as scarce resources too (Dawson et al. 2020 ). This justification holds so long as formal (professionalized, expert) systems supporting health and welfare remain intact. But what if such systems fail? This is an extreme scenario, but there have been intimations of this possibility in the aged care sector, in countries severely affected by the pandemic (BBC News 2020).One answer is that we must fall back onto informal care, by which I mean ""care that is provided to the very young, the very old, the weak, the poor, and the sick by family, friends, neighbors, and concerned citizens, rather than by trained, licensed, or certified health care professionals"" (Medical Dictionary 2020). This provides a utilitarian rationale for prioritizing those with caring responsibilities when allocating scarce resources during pandemics. Just as we have a collective interest in sustaining formal healthcare systems, we also have a collective interest in sustaining informal care.This proposal is open to the objection that unlike care provided by healthcare professionals, informal care encompasses a broad and indefinite range of roles and activities and so would not be a useful consideration in prioritizing access to scarce resources. Whilst the meaning of ""informal care"" clearly needs to be scoped, this is not a reason to set this consideration aside altogether.Caring roles and activities that should be considered ""within scope"" include those that are not easily replaced or covered. For example, some lay carers acquire specialized skills to care for someone with particular needs, such as an elderly parent or partner, or someone with a disability. Some single parents with dependent children might not have an extended family or community that can take over their role if they fall sick and die. My point is that some consideration should be given to relationships of dependency that stand to be disrupted by the loss of informal care. By maximizing the survival chances of those with ""lay"" caring responsibilities as the pandemic unfolds, we also maximize the survival chances of those who depend on that care entirely should expert systems fail.This measure does not discriminate by using personal or social characteristics as the basis for resource allocation decisions. To be a carer (either professional or lay) is not a characteristic; it is a social role. Insofar as the role of lay carer is associated with a personal characteristic, it is surely that of gender; and insofar as caring is associated with a social group that has experienced discrimination, it is surely women. If women happen to be advantaged by a consideration that prioritizes those with caring responsibilities, this can also be understood as going some way to redressing the social disadvantages women have experienced historically by carrying a greater responsibility for the work of caring for others. And not only historically: these disadvantages are amplified by the pandemic (Lewis 2020; Workplace Gender Equality Agency 2020).One final point to make about threshold models is that they do not foreclose on the outcome of a pandemic. They are consistent with a good outcome, such as flattening the epidemic curve and descending the slope that lies beyond its peak. They are also consistent with a bad outcome like a failure of formal healthcare systems. They falter, however, in the face of the worst outcome of all, which would be a failure of both formal healthcare systems and informal care. This is the kind of scenario that survivalists prepare for, and it is theorized by sociologists as a state of anomie. We cannot specify a set of social norms for a state of exception which is characterized by a lack of social norms. For this we are forced to fall back on a different source of models to imagine our collective experience.Cultural narratives provide a rich resource for imagining the collapse of human civilizations. According to the scripts of apocalyptic and postapocalyptic fiction, lockdowns are interpreted as a stage of creeping authoritarianism that presages such a collapse. A recent spike in the sale of firearms in the United States illustrates how these scripts can exert a considerable influence on actual behaviour (Volpe 2020) . Survivalist scripts also explain the behaviour of Australian consumers who began hoarding what was perceived to be essential supplies (including toilet paper) early in the pandemic and in the process showed how ""prepping"" can precipitate the very shortages for which it is adopted as a solution.Narratives also provide a model for imagining the restoration of a social order in the aftermath of natural disasters and pandemics. According to the classic sociolinguistic formulation (Labov and Waletzky [1967] 1997), narrative structures are characterized by disruption of an existing social equilibrium (complicating action) and the restoration of that equilibrium (resolution). Some argue that a ""return to normal"" is not possible because the COVID-19 pandemic will permanently alter the conditions of social life. Others envisage a return to a ""new normal."" The degree to which this differs from the ""old normal"" invites us to consider how we might we use the pandemic as an opportunity to reimagine social norms and reshape society accordingly. As the epidemic curve flattens out in Australia, however, the narrative model is increasingly deployed to press a more mundane question: ""When can we resume business as usual?""Of the three main models we use to emplot our collective experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, only one-the threshold model-does not foreclose on the aftermath. I have used this model to fashion an argument that anticipates a threshold that Australia and New Zealand now seem unlikely to reach due to the successful mobilization of the first model-the epidemiological curve. Due to wide adoption of control measures, we have, in the main, preserved the integrity of our formal healthcare systems. Nevertheless, it is worth entertaining an alternative possibility we have perhaps only glimpsed: having no option other than to fall back on informal care. Informal care is also part of our social safety net that can and should be protected, including by the policies we adopt during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic also offers an opportunity to raise questions of justice about informal care. Who has borne and continues to bear its burdens and its benefits (Jaggar 2001) ?","Australia","first author","2020-11-09","11"

Despite this, there have been reports recommending cessation of treatment with ACEI and ARB in patients with COVID-19. 3, 4 With the release of new evidence, [11] [12] [13] we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess whether RAS inhibitors were associated with a risk of a positive test for COVID-19 as well as the likelihood of severe illness or mortality due to the disease.A systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE was performed by two authors according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines up to 7 May 2020. 14 Studies were included if they reported either the likelihood of a positive test or death/severe illness in patients with COVID-19, stratified by the use of ACEI/ARB. Keyword search was performed using medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and included in Supporting Information Table S1 . Reference lists of reviewed articles were screened to identify further relevant studies. The search was limited to articles in English and non-peer reviewed articles were excluded. Severe illness was defined as hospitalised patients that required noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. Co-primary outcomes included the likelihood of a positive test for COVID-19 and the occurrence of death or severe illness. Due to the potentially differential effects of the RAS medication classes on ACE2 expression and clinical outcomes, exposures to ACEI and ARB were evaluated in separate and pooled analyses.Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality assessment of observational studies in meta-analyses. 15 Assessment of quality on this instrument was judged on study group selection, studygroup comparability and outcome assessment. Studies meeting >5 criteria were considered to be of high quality. We collected event counts and/or effect size data and preferentially extracted adjusted metrics. This was prespecified in order to account for a likely adverse cardiovascular risk factor profile in the RAS inhibitor cohort. Random-effects analysis was prespecified due to clinical variations in study types and populations assessed. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. To exclude the possibility that any one study was exerting excessive influence on the results, we also systematically excluded each study at a time and then reran the analysis to assess the change in effect size. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic, where I 2 ≥ 80% was considered to be significant inter-study heterogeneity. 16 As the number of included studies was <10, we refrained from any tests on publication bias. 17 Statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 3, Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Data utilised for this study analysis are available on request.The initial search yielded 102 studies and 95 were eliminated after initial screening. Seven studies were included in the initial quantitative analysis. However, given the recent retraction of one of the studies, this has now been excluded from our quantitative analysis. 12, 18 Details of the literature search and excluded studies are reported in Figure S1 . Five were retrospective cohort studies 11, [19] [20] [21] [22] and one was a case-control study. 13 Populations varied across the studies with three of the studies including an all-comer patient population 11,13,21 while three specifically included only patients with hypertension. 19, 20, 22 Study quality was high in five of the six studies (Table S2) .Overall, 73 122 patients were included in the final analysis. In this cohort, 16 624 (22.7%) patients had a positive COVID-19 test and 7892 (10.8%) were on a RAS inhibitor. Mean age ranged from 49-64 years and 56.4% were male. Details of individual study design, baseline characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors are summarised in Table 1 .Three studies including 68 097 patients specifically assessed the likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test based on RAS inhibitor therapy. Collectively, the use of ACEI or ARB was not associated with a higher likelihood of a Internal Medicine Journal (2020) 1-7 © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians positive COVID-19 test result OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.97-1.05, P = 0.48) with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.69). This was comparable when stratifying by use of each medication class (ACEI 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.02 (P = 0.12); ARB 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12 (P = 0.82)) ( Fig. 1) .The use of RAS inhibitors was not associated with mortality or severe illness (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.07, P = 0.21). There was only moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I 2 = 38%, P = 0.14; Fig. 2 ). We also analysed the effects of ACEI and ARB separately. However, data in this stratified analysis were not mutually exclusive due to data presentation in the studies whereby patients in the no ACEI group also included ARB and vice versa. This was also noted on comparing outcomes stratified by ACEI (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.11, P = 0.46) and ARB (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79-1.10, P = 0.42) both with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). Consistent effect sizes were observed with single-study exclusion analysis (Fig. 3) with a weak trend to lower mortality/severe illness in patients taking RAS inhibitors with removal of data from the study by Mehta et al. 21 Discovery of the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells has fuelled speculation about the safety of ACEI and ARB during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, which summarises the totality of published data in 73 122 patients, demonstrates no association between RAS inhibitor use and a positive test for COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of ACEI and ARB was not associated with severe illness or mortality in these patients. These findings provide important clinical evidence supporting current guidance statements from several international societies which recommend continuation of ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19. 9, 10 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected both the presentation and management of patients with cardiovascular disease. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] During this period, the use of ACEI/ ARB has remained a contentious issue. ACE2 is a cellular receptor that is required in order to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and propagation in host cells. 1 Concern that ACEI or ARB exposure could possibly increase risk comes from studies in some animal models demonstrating increased ACE2, and promoting expert but unfounded opinions that these drugs would increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity in COVID-19. [2] [3] [4] 29 However, these reports failed to acknowledge other studies including those from our group that reported no change in ACE2 during treatment with an ACEI or ARB in animal models of disease [30] [31] [32] or in humans with renal or cardiac disease. 33, 34 This unfounded hypothesis coupled with early reports indicating higher unadjusted rates of severe illness and mortality in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease fuelled speculation that the use of RAS inhibitors may be harmful in the current era. 4, 29, 35 Our findings that quantitatively summarise all contemporary data to date indicate no association between the use of RAS inhibitors and either susceptibility to or harm in patients with COVID-19. This was confirmed on analysis stratified by the use of ACEI or ARB.Pooling results of all the studies evaluating the risk of severe illness or mortality, we observed a weak trend towards benefit in patients on RAS inhibitors. While these findings should be interpreted with caution given the degree of heterogeneity, it highlights the importance of conducting randomised controlled trials to examine the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibition in patients with COVID-19. We await the results of the REPLACECOVID (NCT04338009), ACEI-COVID19 (NCT04353596), Controlled evaLuation of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for COVID-19 respIraTorY Disease (CLARITY) (NCT04394117) and losartan randomised trials (NCT04312009) to guide further clinical decisionmaking.Joint statements by professional societies recommend continuation of ACEI or ARB among patients with co-existing hypertension and COVID-19. 9, 10 This was based on the lack of any clinical evidence demonstrating risk of harm in patients on ACEI or ARB. There are abundant data with the highest level of evidence supporting the use of these medications in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and kidney disease. [36] [37] [38] Furthermore, ACEI, ARB and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists all have demonstrated a significant mortality reduction in patients following acute myocardial infarction with benefit demonstrated with early initiation of these drugs. 39 Discontinuation of these essential therapies in a vulnerable patient population can precipitate deterioration in cardiac function and increase the risk of mortality. Our findings can help allay concerns of patients and providers regarding the continued use of these therapies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal Medicine Journal (2020) 1-7 © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians Strengths of this study include the large sample size, study quality and the inclusion of studies representing a multinational patient cohort from China, Italy and the United States. However, limitations of this study include the heterogeneity in patient populations and the observational nature of the studies. Although a trend to lower mortality was observed in the RAS inhibitor cohort, it is important not to infer causality due to the risk of residual confounding.Use of ACEI or ARB was not associated with a heightened susceptibility for a positive diagnosis of COVID-19. Furthermore, these drug classes were not associated with increased illness severity or mortality due to COVID-19. Randomised controlled trials are needed to address definitively the potential benefits or harms of RAS inhibitor therapy in patients with COVID-19.Additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-site: Table S1 .

Coronavirus was first described in Wuhan, China as a condition causing, most commonly, a fever and dry cough [1] [2] [3] .It relentlessly spread across the world, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 th March 2020 4 . In response, worldwide governments orchestrated 'lockdowns', placing severe restrictions on the free movement of society in an attempt to curtail the virus' spread.The effects of the worldwide lockdown are yet to be fully understood; however research suggests that it has led to significant changes in the presentation of medical and surgical conditions, including changes in the aetiology of trauma 5 , late presentations of common conditions 6 , and higher surgical morbidity in surgical patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection 7 . Furthermore, COVID-19 fundamentally changed demand on healthcare services; with a proportionally higher demand on medical and critical care specialties compared to surgical specialities. This resulted in an adaptive redistribution of resources to meet demand; including infrastructure, healthcare workers and patient pathways. Redeployment of surgical trainees to medical specialties is an example of such adaptations 8, 9 .There is an emerging body of evidence which documents the footfall and management of musculoskeletal trauma globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, data exists from hospitals across the world on the change in the presentation of major trauma 10-15 and trauma to the lower limbs 10, 11, [16] [17] [18] , hand 19, 20 and spine 21, 22 . In this study, we aimed to perform a scoping review to assess evidence in the current literature from around the world on the footfall, aetiology, operative volume and treatment of musculoskeletal traumatic injuries inA scoping review was decided to be undertaken to allow the authors to gain a broad overall view of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of the presentation and management of musculoskeletal trauma. This was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement 23 .Inclusion criteria were studies looking at patients that suffered from trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. No restrictions were placed on study design, age or injury type.Exclusion criteria were studies not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies reporting solely on fragility neck of femur fractures, studies reporting solely on COVID positive patients sustaining trauma, studies not relating to musculoskeletal trauma, studies that did not give quantitative data on the presentation of trauma, reviews, conference abstracts, opinionbased reports and articles in languages other than English.A comprehensive search of the published literature on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception to 30th October 2020 was carried out. The following search terms were used: (trauma OR polytrauma) AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR pandemic OR lockdown OR quarantine).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Two reviewers (SW and SN) independently performed eligibility assessment of the articles.This was initially carried out through screening of the article titles and abstracts; the process was completed by full text evaluation. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus with the senior author. Citation searches were subsequently undertaken to identify any papers not picked up from the initial search. Specifically, a backward citation search was carried out to review papers cited by each article, and a forward citation search to review other papers that have cited the included articles.A pilot of the data proforma was initially conducted using 5 randomly chosen papers to develop a final proforma. Information collected included: study design, sample size, patient demographic information, trauma location and aetiology, management and outcomes.The primary outcomes of this scoping review were to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the presentation and management of trauma. Narrative synthesis of results was undertaken.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fA summary of the search strategy used is shown in Figure 1 . 574 records were returned from Medline, 573 from EMBASE and 13 from the Cochrane Library. 665 records were screened after duplicates were removed, with 533 excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria.The full text was then extracted for 132 papers, with a final 57 accepted for analysis.A summary of the characteristics for the included studies is shown in Table 1 . Of the studies selected, 50 were case control and 7 were cohort studies. The case control study design was used to compare the lockdown period in the corresponding country with the same period 1 to 12 years previously. A summary of the available literature on trauma during COVID-19 including in this scoping review is shown in Table 1 .29,591patients were studied during the COVID-19 pandemic, with reported ages ranging from under one to 103 years. The mean age was reported for 3,236 patients and was 43.7 years 13, 18, 19, 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . An average of 54.8% were male.There was a worldwide reduction of between 20.3% and 84.6% in trauma patients compared Figure 3 .Moreover, the reported prevalence of incidents occurring outdoors ranged from 0% to 51.6% 11, 12, 26, 65 . An overall increase of 3.82% to 6.1% was reported in incidents occurring on the street from studies based in New Zealand 12 and the USA 11, 26 . An overall reduction in incidents occurring at work of between 3% and 12.6% was reported in France 19 , UK 20 and the USA 26 , with a small increase in incidents occurring at work reported in Spain (2.1% vs 1.52%) 13 . Regarding the management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic, in general a trend towards a higher proportion of trauma patients undergoing operative management was identified. This may reflect a higher threshold for trauma patients with more 'minor' trauma that would have previously been admitted to hospital being managed in primary care or the emergency department, as well as a reluctance for patients to present to hospital in fear of the virus. Considering management of orthopaedic limb injuries, a slight decrease in the proportion of patients undergoing fracture fixation was identified, however more research is required to ascertain the effects of the pandemic on decision for operative intervention, and comparison between countries. In such cases where surgery is not life or limb saving, there J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f are instances where the risk of surgery in the context of COVID-19 may outweigh the benefits of 'optimal' fracture fixation. This is consistent with guidelines released on fracture fixation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the British Orthopaedic Associated Standards for Trauma guidelines 8 . Indeed, the detrimental outcomes from emergency surgery in patients with COVID-19 has been documented 7 .Data from the UK from Park et al. shows a preference towards local or regional anaesthesia prior to surgery 10 . Furthermore, the benefits from Wide Awake Local Anaesthesia no Tourniquet (WALANT) surgery in hand trauma are increasingly apparent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic 19 . Increased study in this field from multiple hand trauma centres will give further insight into the effectiveness of this method when used during the pandemic.National guidelines for the management of fractures during COVID-19 tended towards nonoperative management options 8 . This is clearly a deviation from current well-established gold standard treatment of fractures in the light of resource re-allocation to treat patients with COVID-19. Many theatre suites were converted to intensive care facilitates to cope with the burden of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation. Anaesthetists and other personnel were re-deployed from theatre duties which resulted in a reduced capacity for surgical fixation of fractures. Whilst it is entirely understandable that these changes were made to support the pandemic; it is important for health systems now to utilise data and learnings from the last few months to ensure they are fully prepared for a second wave.Prioritising the treatment of COVID-19 whilst at the same time striving to provide gold standard treatment for trauma. It is important that the attention and volume of resources directed to dealing with COVID-19 does not indirectly harm other patients, for example patients with active malignancy who face rationing of services and delays to treatment during the pandemic [72] [73] [74] .This study is not without limitations. The study is prone to selection bias; however, this was minimised by carrying out a search on multiple databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane). This was then followed by a backward citation search to review papers sites by each article and a forward citation search to identify any papers not picked up from the initial search. Furthermore, eligibility assessment of the article was carried out by two independent reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the senior author. In addition, due to heterogeneity in outcome measures there was a risk of interpretation bias, but this was minimised by using a standardised proforma for data extraction.Whilst the number of patients that contracted COVID-19 following admission for trauma appears low from the included studies, these figures may not reflect the true numbers and large variation exists between the number of patients being tested with either antigen or antibody testing. Furthermore, to date, morbidity and mortality outcomes from trauma in the context of COVID-19 are relatively under-reported. At the present time, whilst lockdown measures are slowly being eased across countries, the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continues and long-term outcomes remain to be determined.This scoping review has provided a snapshot of how the presentation and management of trauma has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its limitations must be acknowledged. Notably, to date there is a lack of evidence in the literature, with the majority of studies looking at small numbers and being retrospective in nature. Papers investigating solely fragility neck of femur fractures were excluded from this study as this was considered J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a separate cohort in itself, and therefore the authors would recommend a standalone review for this area.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a reduction in footfall of patients presenting with trauma. The change in the incidence of trauma aetiologies reflects lockdown measures put in place. However, constraints secondary to the pandemic have not significantly altered the management of these patients. Our data has given preliminary evidence of a shift in the presentation and management of trauma as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study has given an indication of an imminent increase in trauma caused by assault during the lockdown period, accompanied by a rise in incidents occurring at home. Lastly, our data has shown that the provision of trauma care was not largely altered by the pandemic, in contrast with the changes in the delivery of elective and cancer surgery. Government and health systems should utilise available data and learnings from this period to establish strategies that optimise trauma care in preparedness for the second wave. Further research is required in order to assess long-term outcomes in these patients. ","Australia","abstract","2020-11-14","11"

A second wave of SARS-coronavirus-2 (""coronavirus"") transmissions hit Victoria in late June this year. The daily number of cases rose from approximately 30-50 cases per day in late June to 500-700 cases per day in late-July. The Chief Health Officer identified many suburbs in Melbourne's northern and western suburbs as 'hotspots' at the beginning of the second wave, first defined by a daily incidence of at least 20 cases per 100,000 local population. As of 1 September, after the Victorian government initiated a stage 3 lockdown on 3 July, and a stage 4 lockdown on 2 August, this second wave has abated HCWs. [1] [2] [3] The Victorian DHHS also restricted elective surgery to more urgent (category 1 and urgent category 2) patients.If and when surgery workflow can return to normal, and what level of personal protective equipment is required to keep HCWs safe will depend on rates of prevalence and transmission in the community. However, a more useful metric is the prevalence rate in elective surgical patients. Local, up-to-date data will better inform planning for further increases in elective surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of active coronavirus infection among patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery in Victorian hospitals.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study across selected Melbourne hospitals, and later included one regional hospital that had comparable procedures and collected equivalent data. Our study hypothesis was that elective surgery patients would have a low prevalence (less than 1 in 100) of active (PCR positive) coronavirus infection. identified as those postcodes with a daily incidence >20 per 100,000 at the beginning of the second wave. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the medical record by local investigators and then entered into a password-protected REDCap web-database, 4 on a secure server managed by Monash University.Our primary outcome was a positive PCR test for coronavirus in patients that had screened negative on the questionnaire (asymptomatic prevalence). Our secondary outcomes were: (i) the number of patients that had risk factors identified by the screening questionnaire that led to their surgery being deferred but also had a positive PCR test for coronavirus, (ii) the number of patients that converted from a negative pre-admission PCR test to a positive PCR test for coronavirus in the postoperative period, and (iii) the incidence of coronavirus transmission (attack rate) in HCWs caring for elective surgical patients during and for two weeks after the study period.The Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee approved this study with a waiver of consent because testing was occurring as part of clinical care, and data collection was conducted locally at each site and only de-identified data were transcribed onto the central database. 5 All participating hospitals obtained ethics committee approval or otherwise had approval from their chief executive or chief medical officer as a quality assurance project.We anticipated a prevalence of asymptomatic coronavirus infection in elective surgical patients to be no more than that seen in metropolitan Melbourne in July, being approximately 50-200 per 100,000. Calculating exact binomial confidence intervals assuming no diagnostic test inaccuracy and using the upper 95% confidence limit, a sample size of at least 2,000Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.patients with no observed positive test results could rule out a prevalence of less than 2 per 1,000.We estimated the prevalence of coronavirus infection using a Bayesian approach which incorporates uncertainty about the values of sensitivity and specificity of the PCR testing in the form of prior distributions for these parameters. We assumed a Beta(15,5) prior distribution for sensitivity, which has mean at 75% and 2.5 to 97.5 percentiles of 54% to 91%, and a Beta (19.9, 0.01) prior distribution for specificity, which has mean at 99.5% and 2.5 to 97.5 percentiles of 95% to 100%. Statistical analysis was conducted using RStan Version There were no reports of HCWs caring for the elective surgical patients testing positive to coronavirus during or up to 2 weeks after the study period that could be attributed to elective surgery. Thus, the attack rate was zero.Despite a second and much larger wave of coronavirus cases in Victoria in July-August, 2020, particularly across the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne, we found a very low prevalence of coronavirus in elective surgical patients who had a negative screening questionnaire at the time of booking. Those (n=3) that first developed symptoms of COVID-19 postoperatively had an otherwise uneventful recovery. In addition, there were no reports of associated HCW transmission linked to elective surgery in the participating hospitals during the data collection period. Our study included a variety of hospitals, both adult and paediatric, adjacent to coronavirus hotspots, and in metropolitan and regional areas.Only 1 of the 8 positives cases had come from one of Melbourne's hotspot suburbs, weakening any ability to selectively identify at-risk patients on this basis. We identified 3 cases in which the preoperative PCR test was negative but the patient was subsequentlyThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.found to have coronavirus infection in the postoperatively periodnone of these had any complications. These cases might reflect a false negative preoperative test, or the patient was early in the incubation period at the time of preoperative testing. Both false negative and false positive coronavirus PCR tests results can occur. 6 We accounted for this with prior distributions for sensitivity and specificity in our Bayesian analysis. Such occurrences will be unavoidable, but there were no apparent adverse effects on their postoperative recovery. The combination of screening questionnaire, preoperative swab testing, and appropriate personal protective equipment has led to no HCW infections in our series. Data from high-prevalence cities and countries around the world have found that anaesthesiologists and other HCWs have a worryingly high prevalence (3.1-7.1%) of probable COVID-19. 7-10 These transmission rates mostly reflect community prevalence. 9 During the period of study, elective surgery was effectively restricted to 50% so that priority was being given to the more urgent Category 1 and 2A cases (e.g. cancer surgery). Less urgent cases and emergency cases may have a different risk exposure to community transmission of coronavirus.Some of us participated in a similar study conducted across Australia during the nadir period of coronavirus transmission through June and early July, 2020. When combined, these pooled results offer great reassurance for those caring for elective surgical patients in Victoria and other states. Elective surgery should be able to return to near-normal levels in Victoria.The global backlog of elective surgery has been predicted to take close to a year to resolve. 10 Given the moderate sensitivity and therefore worrying false negative rate of PCR testing, there is insufficient reassurance with a negative test. Also, even with high specificity (99.5%) there is very weak predictive utility with routine testing in the low risk setting of elective surgery: for a prevalence of 0.1%, the positive predictive value is only 13% (selective surveillance testing may however be done to reaffirm very low prevalence).

These circumstances differ markedly from other parts of the world. For example, the preoperative coronavirus positive testing rate in North Carolina was 0.86% (61 of 7,100). 11 This is 8-fold higher than what has been experienced in Victoria.In conclusion, the prevalence of coronavirus infection in a screened population of elective surgical patients in Victoria during a second a wave was very low, approximately 1 in 833.With existing current hospital capacity and decreasing case numbers, a staged recommencement of elective surgery should be considered. Patient and staff safety will be enhanced by preoperative screening to detect symptoms of coronavirus infection or recent contact with anyone known to have been infected; this should be mandated.This article is protected by copyright.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was found to be the causative agent, and the disease subsequently named COVID-19 (2) . The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic on 11thMarch 2020. As of 9th July 2020, there have been over 11 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, and over 540,000 deaths (3) . Available data on the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, pregnant women, and newborns is limited (4) . Current information suggests pregnant women are not at higher risk of severe illness than the general population (4) . A systematic review identified 33 studies which reported on the outcomes of 385 pregnant women with COVID-19, of whom 368 (95.6%) were considered to have mild disease (5) . Amongst 256 newborns the prevalence of preterm birth was 15.2% and low birth weight was 7.8%. Eight (3.1%) newborns required admission to neonatal intensive care and 3 deaths occurred. The extent to which maternal COVID-19 infection contributed to these perinatal outcomes is unclear.In the case of COVID-19 -a novel disease where new evidence is emerging daily -up-to-date clinical guidelines are vital in providing clinicians and other stakeholders with recommendations based on the latest available evidence. A considerable volume of guidance relating to care of pregnant women with COVID-19 has been rapidly developed and published. In some instances, clinical recommendations from different organisations are in conflict, which can create confusion for healthcare providers. We aimed to develop a database of national and international guidelines related to the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care of women during the COVID -19 pandemic and identify those interventions where there was high and low consensus across recommendations.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWe developed a study protocol to guide literature searching and data extraction. We aimed to identify and include any guidance that provided clinical recommendations or normative statements related to the clinical care of women during pregnancy, labour, childbirth or the postpartum period in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines of interest were those developed specifically in response to or where the recommendations pertained to changes to routine care in the context of treating COVID-19. We included guidelines produced either at international, national or Australian state or territory levels. Guidelines produced from reputable guideline development organisations such as national or international professional societies or specialty colleges, Governmental departments or Ministries of Health or international agencies were included.Guidelines published prior to 2020 pertaining to other respiratory illnesses or infections were not eligible.First, we developed a list of relevant guideline development organisations and searched their institutional websites directly. This was supplemented with structured searches for clinical guidelines via the Trip database, using the 'guideline' filter and search terms pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum (and related terms) and COVID-19 (6).We also contacted international collaborative networks to identify further eligible resources. For the period of 30th March to 15th May 2020, weekly searches of all identified websites and Trip were conducted to identify new guidelines or updates of existing guidelines. On 17th April 2020, we published a list of included guidelines on the Burnet website (7) .Web visitors were invited to suggest additional guidelines or resources for consideration via an online form.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fAll identified guidelines were initially screened by one reviewer to assess eligibility. For eligible guidelines, each recommendation pertaining to management of pregnancy, labour, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period for women in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted. Each guideline was reviewed by two independent reviewers. Individual recommendations were extracted and classified them according to intervention type, period (preconception, antenatal, intrapartum, postpartum, all periods, unspecified) and population (e.g. women, healthcare providers or newborns). Recommendations for women and newborns were classified differently depending on whether they were regarding care of the general population, or specifically those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Where one recommendation included the use of two (or more) interventions, it was extracted twice (or more) and classified accordingly. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. If a guideline was updated, we updated the data extraction accordingly, with superseded or outdated recommendations removed from the database.While standardised guideline quality assessment tools (such as the AGREE II tool) exist, the majority of guidelines identified in our searches were produced rapidly without the customary documentation of the evidence synthesis and guideline development process. This lack of information makes it difficult to properly (and consistently) assess guideline quality. We therefore decided against a formal quality assessment of individual guidelines. For two guidelines that were not in English (French and Italian) we used a combination of colleagues familiar with these languages plus Google Translate to translate relevant recommendations into English for analysis.From the data we identified a list of 91 specific interventions, grouped under 18 intervention types, for which at least one recommendation was available. A full list of this interventions can be found on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the Burnet website (www.burnet.edu.au/projects/435_). This list was reviewed and discussed by the review team, in consultation with three specialists in obstetrics, gynaecology and midwifery, in order to identify a shortlist of priority topics (Box 1). Priority topics were those considered most important from a clinical care perspective and/or where lower consensus was anticipated. We then prepared a detailed table of all recommendations relating to this shortlist of priority topics. A narrative summary of each priority topic was prepared by the review team based on these findings, in order to qualitatively assess the degree of consensus. There were 87 recommendations across 40 guidelines (from 28 organisations) regarding the presence of a support person and birth and appointments for all pregnant women, and infection control policies for these visitors. There was general consensus that the number of visitors for women in hospital should be restricted, with some guidelines suggesting a limit of one visitor per day (4, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19- There was no consensus between guidelines regarding birth companions. Eight guidelines indicated that women -irrespective of COVID-19 status -should be allowed and encouraged to have a companion present, provided the companion is asymptomatic (13, 18, 45, 50, 58, 62, 66) . However, three guidelines from Sri Lanka (57), Italy (Capanna et al.) (87) and FIGO and allied partners (75) advised that no birth partners should be allowed for women with suspected or confirmed COVID -19.There was consensus that individuals who are symptomatic or confirmed to have COVID-19 should not be allowed to visit a hospital (4, 10, 13, 23, 54, 66, 80) and that all support persons should be screened prior to presenting to a facility (34, 40, 45, 66, 80) . Regarding appointments, some guidelines stated it is preferable that women attend alone, however if necessary for support or care then a maximum of one visitor may be allowed (18, 25, 47, 48, 61, 66) .There were 29 guidelines from 27 organisations which provided 37 recommendations regarding the use of antenatal corticosteroids (both betamethasone and dexamethasone) for preterm birth in women with COVID-19 infection. There was disagreement between guidelines as to whether corticosteroids should be given when usually recommended. While some guidelines recommended that steroids should be given where usually indicated (8, 13, 23, 45, 52, 53, 57, 65, 66, 81) , others suggested there should be more careful assessment of the balance between maternal risks and neonatal benefit, and that it should be discussed with maternal-fetal, neonatal and infectious disease specialists in light of evidence suggesting harm to the patient with severe COVID-19 (35, 61, 62, 64, 73-75, 77, 83, 85, 87, 88) . Three guidelines from Western Australia (17), Queensland (13) andIreland (58) recommended that while COVID-19 infection itself is not an indication to alter the provision of antenatal corticosteroids, in those with moderate to severe disease the administration of antenatal corticosteroids should be discussed with specialists in light of the maternal risks. Two guidelines from the USA (37, 44) suggested that antenatal corticosteroids could be given up until 34 weeks' gestation, as at later gestations the benefits may not outweigh the potential risks to a COVID-19 positive patient with moderate to severe disease.There were 115 recommendations from 38 guidelines (32 organisations) regarding the mode of birth for women with COVID-19. The majority of these were regarding the decision between a caesarean or vaginal birth (53 recommendations). Others pertained to instrumental birth, induction of labour, the timing of birth and guidelines for performing a caesarean section such as PPE and the number of theatre staff.There was general consensus that the mode of birth should not be influenced by maternal COVID-19, unless urgent birth is required due to the mother's respiratory condition (4, 8, 10, 13, 17, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 21, 23, 37, 44, 45, 57-59, 61, 62, 64, 73-81) . In the case of rapid maternal deterioration, guidelines advise an individual assessment and treatment of the patient (17, 45, 87) and caesarean section may be required (10, 75, 83, 86) . Alternatively, if the woman delivers vaginally and is short of breath, some guidelines suggest instrumental birth may be required to shorten the length of the second stage of labour (8, 74, 75, 86) . However, two guidelines suggested that there may be a greater need There were 26 guidelines from 23 different organisations which offered 80 recommendations regarding labour analgesia for all women including regional and general anaesthesia (45 recommendations), water immersion/birthing pools (10 recommendations) and nitrous oxide (23 recommendations).There was disagreement between guidelines as to whether to use nitrous oxide. Several guidelines suggested that given the insufficient information as to whether or not nitrous oxide is an aerosol generating procedure it should be avoided in women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (4, 12, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13, 17, 22, 33, 60). Others suggested that nitrous oxide was safe to give all pregnant women, provided it was used with a single-patient microbiological filter (10, 23, 45, 51, 58) . One guideline from the UK indicated that nitrous oxide use was not an aerosol-generating procedure, however it did not provide a recommendation as to its safety in COVID-19-positive women (52). Other guidelines from the USA indicated that its use and potential suspension should be discussed within individual labour and delivery units (34, 35, 37) , or that it may be a source of cross-infection, and that it is important staff are aware of the appropriate decontamination guidelines (83) .There was consensus that regional anaesthesia should continue to be used normally (4, 8, 12, 22, 34, 45, 51, 62) . Although both regional and general anaesthesia may be considered (74, 75, 81, 82), regional anaesthesia is preferred to general anaesthesia, unless it is unavoidable (22, 51, 57, 58, 60, 75) . Several guidelines indicated that early epidural anaesthesia in labour should be considered to minimise need for general anaesthesia (12, 13, 17, 23, 35, 45, 51, 58) , and also as an alternative to nitrous oxide in women who are COVID-19 positive (12) . Three guidelines indicated that in women with COVID-19 the platelet count should be checked prior to spinal/epidural, considering that thrombocytopenia is a common finding in people with COVID- 19 (22, 51, 58) . When general anaesthesia is used, guidelines recommend it should be done under negative pressure (45) , by experienced anaesthetists with adequate PPE (57, 58).There was general consensus that birthing pools (i.e. giving birth while immersed in water) should be avoided in women with COVID-19 due to the risk of infection to the newborn and healthcare workers (13, 17, 23, 45, 58, 74, 75). However, RANZCOG (4, 12) has indicated that water immersion may continue to be used in the normal manner. It is unclear as to whether this recommendation also includes women who are COVID-19 positive.There were 20 guidelines from 18 organisations which gave 23 recommendations regarding cord clamping. There was no consensus between guidelines surrounding whether delayed cord clamping is appropriate in women with COVID-19. While many guidelines suggest that delayed cord clamping safe to continue given the lack of evidence to suggest otherwise (8, 12, 13, 17, 23, 37, 45, 52, 53, 85) , others recommended it may be best avoided (58, 65, 74, 75, 80, 81, 83, 87) . One guideline from Ireland (58) suggested that delayed cord clamping might be appropriate for preterm neonates less than 32 weeks' gestation, but should not be routinely done for babies born at a later gestation. There were 21 recommendations in 17 guidelines (from 16 organisations) regarding skin-to-skin contact between mothers and newborns after birth. There was consensus that skin-to-skin should continue regardless of maternal COVID-19 infection, provided appropriate PPE is worn (12, 15, 17, (87) recommended that early skin-toskin contact be avoided in mothers with COVID-19, although they did not provide evidence that skinto-skin transmission of COVID-19 occurs.In total, 32 guidelines (27 organisations (80) suggested that rooming-in be undertaken for stable neonates, but if there are available resources for isolation then separation should be favoured. It was suggested that in the event of rooming-in, when a mother has COVID-19, measures should be taken to reduce transmission, for example using PPE or a curtain between mother and newborn and attention to strict hand hygiene measures (35, 40, 58, 71, 74, 75) .In total, 52 guidelines from 41 different organisations had 121 recommendations related to breastfeeding. There was consensus that breastfeeding is safe and important to continue, regardless of the woman's COVID-19 status, and if a woman was well enough to breastfeed she should be encouraged to do so (8, 10, 12-15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 31, 41, 45, 53, 54, 56, 58, 62-64, 66, 67, 71, 73, 76, 78-80) . However, three guidelines from Malaysia (60), China (Chen et al.) (81) and Favre et al (86) advised against direct breastfeeding in mothers with COVID-19, however no evidence was provided to support these recommendations.Several guidelines indicated that while there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through breastmilk, there is a risk of transmission from mother to baby during breastfeeding via respiratory droplets. Guidelines consequently emphasised the need for mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to wear a face mask and to practice hand hygiene while J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f breastfeeding (8, 9, 16, 17, 23, 29, 31, 35, 38, 40, 41, 45, 46, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 62, 63, 66, 67, 71, 73-75, 79-81, 83, 85) .Additionally, there was consensus that if women are not well enough to breastfeed, or if temporary separation is undertaken due to maternal COVID-19 infection, they should still be encouraged to express milk which can safely be provided to their newborn (10, 15, 17, 23, 29, 39, 54, 58, 62, 63, 66, 67, 71, (73) (74) (75) (76) 80) . One guideline from the UK (52) suggested that given the overwhelming benefits of breast milk to the infant, unwell COVID-19 positive women who are required to withhold breastfeeding are encouraged to express their breastmilk and discard it in order to maintain lactation until she is no longer infectious. There was general consensus that given the association of fluid overload and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, women with moderate and severe disease require close fluid balance monitoring (8, 13, 17, 45, 58, 66, 75) . Several noted critically ill pregnant patients without shock should be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f managed with conservative fluid management (74, 81). Additionally, there was consensus that oxygen saturations should be monitored closely (17, 45, 74, 75, 80, 81) and hypoxia should be avoided, with the aim of maintaining target oxygen saturation >92% (8, 13, 44, 45, 57, 58, 74, 75, 80, 81) . However, there was some variation on the actual target level of oxygen saturation (>92-95%).One guideline from the USA specified that while the recommended target oxygen saturation for non-pregnant women with COVID-19 is >92%, for pregnant women oxygen saturation should aim for >95% (44).There were 27 recommendations in 15 guidelines from 15 different organisations regarding antibiotic use. There was general consensus that antibiotics should only be commenced in women with COVID-19 if there was evidence of secondary bacterial infection (17, 53, 58, 61, 62, 65, 74, 75, 81, 89) , and that antibiotic therapy should be discussed with infectious diseases specialists (13, 17, 64, 74, 75). However, three guidelines from India (62, 80) and the Philippines (61) suggested that azithromycin could be used for the specific treatment of COVID-19, however there is no evidence to support these recommendations.Eleven guidelines (11 organisations) made 27 recommendations regarding antiviral and other disease modifying treatments for COVID-19. Some guidelines specified that the use of antivirals in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 must be done in consultation with a virologist prior to initiating therapy and on a case-by-case basis (65, 74, 75). Others gave suggestions regarding possible dosing regimens for hydroxycholoroquine (58, 59, 62, 80, 83) , lopinavir and ritonavir (58, 59, 80, 81) , remdesivir (58, 59) , oseltamivir (62) and the immunosuppressive agent tocilizumab (58).Six guidelines (five organisations) provided 17 recommendations regarding anticoagulation for COVID-19 positive pregnant patients. Most recommended that both antenatal and postnatal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis be considered for pregnant women with COVID-19 irrespective of disease severity (13, 45, 58, 75) , while two recommended that all COVID-19-positive women be discharged home postnatally with prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (45, 58) . Others recommended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis (44, 58).We identified four recommendations from four guidelines regarding prone ventilation in pregnant women. Two indicated that while prone ventilation is strongly recommended in adults with severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, there is little evidence on prone position in pregnant women, and in this case the lateral decubitus position may be more beneficial (62, 73) . One suggested that prone positioning may not be feasible in pregnancy but should be considered in early (pre-viable) gestations (58), however another stated prone positioning was indeed feasible in pregnancy and could be used in addition to the lateral decubitus position (44).There was limited guidance regarding the use of intubation in pregnant women (five recommendations from three guidelines). It was suggested that the timing of intubation should be individualised (44), with another guideline recommending early intubation for pregnant women whose respiratory function deteriorates (65). Another guideline stated pregnant women were at risk of aspiration requiring early intubation (58) .One guideline suggested that in pregnant women, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient for severe respiratory failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may have a role (65). Two other recommendations also referred to the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -One guideline from the USA advised its use be discussed if expedited birth was being considered for severe hypoxaemia (44), and another from China (Chen et al.) recommended its use be limited during pregnancy with less invasive measures used beforehand (81) .We identified a large and growing volume of maternal and perinatal health guidelines related to COVID-19 over a six-week period. We identified limited consensus amongst guideline development organisations regarding key maternal and newborn health interventions, including nitrous oxide during labour, policies on birth companions, rooming-in, antenatal corticosteroids, anticoagulants and the use of antivirals and other disease modifying agents. Available guidelines were produced rapidly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, generally in the absence of direct evidence. Given the frequency of updates, it is difficult for clinicians and services to stay up-to-date with the most recent guidance.Our review has included a large number of guidelines from a range of different organisations worldwide. Through weekly checks, we closely monitored updates to pre-existing recommendations and guidelines and were able to identify key areas of disagreement. A limitation to this review is the pace at which guidance is being updated, given the emergence of new information and evidence regarding COVID-19 and its impacts on women and newborns. Many guidelines were regularly updated, and in several instances, recommendations were significantly changed or removed entirely.This makes it difficult for clinicians and health services to stay up-to-date with best practice.Additionally, we were limited in our ability to translate guidelines and there were few guidelines reviewed in languages other than English.Two recent publications by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (90) and Narang et al. (91) considered a range of maternal and perinatal health guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Cochrane report, which focused on guidelines in a subset of countries with more than 10,000 cases of COVID-19 on 19th April, similarly found a lack of consensus in the use of antenatal steroids, the use of nitrous oxide, policies on birth companions and rooming-in, as well as skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding -two interventions for which our review found more general consensus. Narang Maternal and newborn health guidance has been rapidly produced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review identified 81 unique guidelines from 48 different organisations related to the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care of women during the pandemic. We found lower consensus between guidelines regarding nitrous oxide during labour, policies on birth companions, rooming-in, antenatal corticosteroids, anticoagulants and the use of antivirals and other disease modifying agents. Due to the large number of guidelines being produced as well as these areas of disagreement, it can be difficult for clinicians to determine how best to care for pregnant and postpartum women in the context of COVID-19. This review provides a summary of available recommendations to help guide clinicians and health services, as well as other maternal and perinatal health guideline developers. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the situation and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f changes that have already occurred since our review in May 2020, it is vital that health workers seek out the latest guidance when making clinical decisions.Author contributions CH, JV and AW conceptualised the study.

Increases in intimate partner violence were described as rising in parallel with the lockdown [20] , with the police and Women's Refuge reporting surges in family harm related calls [21] . Various groups expressed concerns about the availability and potential abuse of alcohol, which was available as an 'essential item' during the lockdown [22] .The length and severity of NZ's strict lockdown measures have been vigorously debated, but most attention has been directed at their economic consequences. Discussion of their implications for psychological wellbeing have featured less prominently. This study was designed to address this information lacuna by investigating New Zealanders' responses to the current pandemic lockdown and comparing the results with corresponding normative data.The aims were to assess levels of psychological distress, anxiety, wellbeing, suicidal ideation, alcohol consumption, and family relationships using validated measures with benchmark comparisons where possible. A secondary aim was to identify specific populations (e.g., essential workers, those with underlying health conditions and the elderly) who might be more psychologically vulnerable to poor outcomes throughout the pandemic.The specific objectives of our study were to determine:1. The state of the NZ population's wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown (stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, family relationships, suicidal thinking etc).2. How the lockdown impacted on specific populations (e.g., essential workers, those with underlying health conditions, and the elderly).3. Whether there were any positive psychological consequences associated with the lockdown.We recruited a large, demographically representative sample of adult New Zealanders aged between 18 and 90 years using a commercial survey platform, Dynata. Dynata has a New Zealand panel that currently stands at 300,000 active members (i.e., people who have participated in a survey in the last three months). Panel members are recruited through online methods such as Google AdWords campaigns, and via partners such as GrabOne and TradeMe. Respondents are incentivised by earning cash credits in online accounts. This cross-sectional survey had a target of 2000 respondents in order to provide subgroups large enough to enable comparisons. The sample recruitment was designed to be representative of the age-sex distribution of the NZ population over 18 years, and with sufficient Māori and Pacific respondents to produce reliable estimates of ethnicity patterns, with target participation quotas by age, sex, and ethnicity.The survey was fielded between 15 and 18 April 2020, which corresponded with Alert Level 4 lockdown days 19 to 22. Between the start of the pandemic and the launch of our survey on 15 April there were 1366 cases of COVID-19 identified in NZ and nine deaths reported [5] . During the survey period, the number of cases rose by 56 and a further two deaths were reported. The relationship between data collection, the lockdown, and COVID-19 cases and deaths is shown in Fig 1. The survey was fielded using the Qualtrics platform. It took approximately 15 minutes to complete (median 13.1, interquartile range 9.4-19.0). All participants were asked to read a participant information sheet and provide consent before they could proceed with the survey.The survey questions are available are a (S1 File). Demographic information collected included: age, gender (male, female, gender diverse), income, education, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was collected using the NZ Census question on ethnicity, which allows individuals to specify multiple ethnic groups. For analysis, individuals were prioritised into ethnic groups following standard guidelines [23] .Participants were also asked about their living circumstances, including questions pertaining to: who they lived with during the lockdown (family, friends, flatmates or tenants); how many people they lived with; level of satisfaction with their living situation; access to personal space, green space, internet and a computer; and ease and frequency of connection with family outside of their household. We inquired whether participants were 'essential workers'-people required to continue working outside their home during the lockdown to provide necessities, maintain public health and safety and maintain key infrastructure [24] .The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was the primary outcome measure [25] . This is a 10-item scale measuring non-specific symptoms of anxiety and depression over the previous four weeks. Scores are reported in a 0-40 range to align with reporting in the NZ Health Survey. People scoring 12 or higher have a high probability of meeting diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depressive disorders. We selected the K10 because it is a well-validated measure with good Psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in NZ baseline data for the NZ population-it was an outcome measure in Te Rau Hinengaro: the NZ Mental Health Survey [26] and has been used in the NZ Health Survey since 2011 [27] .Symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder were measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), which has been validated within large samples of patients in primary care [28, 29] and general population samples [30] . Respondents indicate how much they have been bothered by each of seven symptoms over the last two weeks, on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'nearly every day'. Scores range from 0-21 with a cutoff score of 10 and higher scores indicating higher anxiety.The third key outcome was the World Health Organization Well-Being Index 5 (WHO-5), which is one of the most widely-used scales for assessing subjective psychological well-being [31] . The WHO-5 contains five positively phrased items, with respondents rating each statement for the last two weeks. Scores range from 0-25 with higher scores indicating higher subjective wellbeing. We were also interested in using the WHO-5 to characterise the group with excellent wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions. Again, there were good baseline population data for the WHO-5, with it having been used in NZ-wide population surveys since 2014 (e.g., NZ General Social Survey [32] ).Questions about family violence were adapted from standard questions asked in the New Zealand Crime and Victims of Crime Survey [33] . Suicidality was assessed using questions on suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts during the lockdown and the preceding 12 months. These questions were similar to those used by Te Rau Hinengaro: the NZ Mental Health Survey [34] .We assessed alcohol consumption by asking participants how many standard drinks they consumed on an average 7-day period before the lockdown and how many standard drinks they had consumed over the previous 7 days. We included a visual aid to help participants define a typical standard drink (for beer, wine and spirits).Bearing in mind previous research that has described people's experiences of 'silver linings'-or benefit finding-during crises [e.g., 35, 36] , we asked participants if the lockdown had produced any 'silver linings' for them personally or for NZ society in general. Those who answered 'Yes' to either question were asked to describe these benefits.We designed the survey to ensure compatibility with mobile phone, tablet or computer access. We refined it using the 'group mind' process, which Sudman and Bradburn described as asking colleagues to review and rigorously critique a draft of the questionnaire [37] , and made iterative improvements based on their comments. We then pre-tested the revised questionnaire on a small sample of the general public and further modified it to address respondents' feedback.The study was approved by the University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (F20/003) and we undertook Māori consultation via the Ngāi Tahu Research Committee.Survey responses were weighted using a post-stratification weighting scheme to reflect the 2018 NZ Census adult (age 15+) population profile by age group, sex, and ethnicity (coded to Māori, Pacific, Asian, and European/Other). These post-stratification weights were checked for extreme weights that would indicate potential influence on estimates from participants where only a small number of participants represented a particular age/sex/ethnicity combination (all scaled weights < 4) [38] .Unweighted frequencies are reported to reflect absolute numbers of responses for a given question, and the available sample size is reported for sub-group and regression analyses.Unweighted percentages are presented for demographic variables, together with weighted percentages which describe the likely distribution of the demographic variables in the population (based on the sample data).Weighted percentages for each outcome (unadjusted for additional covariates) are presented as percentages, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Unadjusted differences in outcomes by key sociodemographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity) are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) derived from logistic regression models. Adjusted ORs are presented with mutual adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (i.e., a single logistic regression model with all three covariates included) as ORs with 95% CIs. For measures where the absolute numbers were low (e.g., suicidal thoughts and behaviours), these are not reported broken down by other demographic variables.Additional analysis of health and wellbeing outcomes are reported according to pre-defined priority groups (e.g., living alone or with others; prior history of mental health diagnosis). Unadjusted and adjusted estimates for differences in outcomes by these factors are presented as ORs and 95% CIs (adjustment was for age, sex and ethnicity as above).Data preparation, weight calculations and analysis were all conducted in R 3.6.1 (R Institute, Vienna, Austria). All complex-survey weighted estimates were calculated using the survey package [39] .In total, there were 2416 survey responses. The non-completion rate, defined as those who opened and started but did not complete the survey before the cut-off time, was 16.8% (n = 406), producing a cleaned achieved sample of 2010 cases. Table 1 shows the demographic profile for survey participants; 408 participants (20.3%, unweighted) reported Māori ethnicity and 115 (5.7%) Pacific ethnicity. The 35 respondents who reported both Māori and Pacific ethnicity were included as Māori following the prioritisation procedure [23] . The median age of respondents was 45 years. There were slightly more female participants than males. Only six people reported being gender diverse, with this group being too small to analyse separately.Most respondents (86.3% unweighted) spent the lockdown living with others, with 81.0% being happy with their lockdown living circumstances. The majority (77.6%) rated their health as good. Almost a quarter (23.0%) had pre-existing conditions or circumstances that made them vulnerable to coronavirus (e.g., being pregnant, immunocompromised). About one-fifth of participants (19.4% unweighted) were essential workers, with 113 employed in healthcare, 25 in law enforcement, 23 in other emergency services, and 232 as providers of essential goods or services (e.g., food supply, fuel, waste removal, internet, financial support, transport [24] ).Very few respondents (n = 36, 2.0% unweighted) believed they may have been infected with COVID-19. Nine people (0.3%) had returned positive serological tests. More than half of respondents (54%) reported spending over an hour a day looking at information related to COVID-19 in the media.Just under one-third of participants (30.3%, 95% CI 28.3, 32.4) scored above the cut-off for moderate to severe psychological distress (K10 > 12). There was a strong gradient with prevalence of distress decreasing with age (see Table 2 ); almost half of younger adults scored highly on the K10 (47.3% of 18-24 year olds) compared to less than one in ten adults aged 65 years and older. These differences persisted following adjustment for covariates. Psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in NZ Substantially increased rates of distress were seen among those who reported having lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in work as a result of the pandemic, those who had potential vulnerabilities to COVID-19 (such as being pregnant or immunosuppressed) or identified their health status as poor, and those who had a past diagnosis of a mental illness. Females and those who lived alone had slightly increased adjusted odds of psychological distress. There were no significant or substantial differences in rates of psychological distress between people identifying as Māori, Pacific Peoples, or NZ European, but those with Asian ethnicity reported lower rates of distress (analyses adjusted for age and sex profile).For anxiety, about one in six participants (15.6%, 95% CI 14.0, 17.3) reported moderate to high levels of anxiety (score of 10 or higher on the GAD-7). Low wellbeing was reported by 38.2% (95% CI 36.0, 40.4) of participants (WHO-5 score < 13), and 8.7% (95% CI 7.5, 10.1) reported excellent wellbeing (WHO-5 > 21).Anxiety and wellbeing results are reported in Table 3 according to key sociodemographic characteristics. For both measures, patterning by age was similar to the current K10 results, with younger adults faring worse. There was no difference in prevalence between male and females, and for the WHO-5, Asian respondents had more favourable outcomes.In our sample, 375 people (18.2%, 95% CI 16.5, 20.0) reported having previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a doctor or psychologist. Of these, many had more than one diagnosis, with 80.2% reporting having been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, 52.6% anxiety disorder, 5.8% personality disorder, 7.6% bipolar disorder, 5.7% an alcohol and drug disorder, 3. 9% a psychotic disorder, and 11.4% another disorder.Over half of those with past mental health diagnoses were experiencing moderate or severe psychological distress (52.9%, 95% CI 47.6, 58.1). About one third (36.1%, 95% CI 31.2, 41.3) thought their mental health had been worse than usual during the lockdown, just under half thought it was the same as usual (46.1%, 95% CI 41.1, 51.6), and about one in six reported it was better than usual (17.5%, 95% CI 13.9, 21.8).Suicidal ideation during lockdown was reported by 6.1% of participants (95% CI 5.1, 7.3) with 2.1% (95% CI 1.5, 2.9) reporting making plans for suicide and 2.1% also reporting a suicide attempt (95% CI 1.5, 2.9). Suicidality was highest in those age 18-34. For most of those experiencing suicidal thoughts, these were not new thoughts-83.0% of that group reported having experienced similar ideation in the 12 months prior to lockdown.Since the beginning of the lockdown, about three in five participants (59.1%, 95% CI 56.9, 61.4) reported that their alcohol consumption had not changed, with about one-fifth reporting increased consumption (22.0%, 95% CI 20.2, 23.9), and another fifth reporting a decrease in consumption (18.9%, 95% CI 17.1, 20.7).Many respondents appreciated having more time with their family and frequently cited this outcome as one of the pandemic's 'silver linings.' In terms of immediate family relationships, more people reported their family relationships were better (24.5%, 95% CI 22.6, 26.6) or the same as usual (63.5%, 95% CI 61.2, 65.6) during the lockdown than worse than usual (12.0%, 95% CI 10.6, 13.6).Most respondents (73.3%, 95% CI 71.2, 75.3) found it easy to maintain contact with friends and family members outside their home during the lockdown, while 11.6% (95% CI 10.2, 13.2) found it difficult to maintain these relationships. A small proportion (1.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 2.6) had not tried to maintain contact with friends and family members. Almost one in ten participants (9.1%, 95% CI 7.9, 10.5) had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period, including sexual assault, physical assault, or harassment and threatening behaviour. Fewer people (3.9%, 95% CI 3.1, 4.9) reported witnessing family harm in which they were not the victim. There were 39 participants who said they preferred not to answer the family harm questions and 12 who gave no response (total 2.5%).The majority of participants (61.5%, 95% CI 59.3, 63.7) identified positive aspects of the lockdown, either for themselves personally (44.0%, 95% CI 41.7, 46.3) and/or for society (37.6%, 95% CI 35.4, 39.8) . Common themes were that the lockdown was conducive to more family time, work flexibility and to social cohesion. People reported taking the opportunity to pause, reflect, consider priorities, recreate healthy habits, and they appreciated the environmental benefits brought by reduced travel.While around two-thirds of participants appeared to be coping well with the pandemic lockdown, about one-third reported moderate or high psychosocial distress, rates well above baseline measures from past population surveys (NZ Health Survey 2018/19: 8.2% of total adult population, with rates higher in young people, females and Māori) [27] . Similarly, nearly 40% of participants reported experiencing poor wellbeing on the WHO-5, compared to 25% in a recent national level survey (NZ General Social Survey 2018/9 [32] ). Lockdown psychological distress analysed by age is compared with data from the NZ Health Survey in Fig 2. What is most striking in our data is the elevated level of distress in younger adults (under 44 years) compared with baseline population rates. However, it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the methodological differences in surveys. The NZ Health Survey is a continuous survey with probability sampling administered by face-to-face interviews, while ours was a cross-sectional demographically representative but non-random survey administered online. Incidentally, data collection for the Health Survey had to be suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, so we have no face-to-face lockdown data for comparison [27] .The baseline Health Survey data show that under normal circumstances, NZ women are around 1.8 times more likely to be experiencing psychological distress than men. Interestingly, our data collected during the lockdown showed a much smaller gender gap. In fact, the proportion of males and females experiencing moderate to severe anxiety (assessed by the GAD-7) was the same. This finding differs to studies from other countries with higher rates of community transmission than New Zealand, which report disproportionately elevated rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in females [10, 11, 40] . One possible hypothesis is that economic anxiety (e.g., worrying about job loss, family finances), which may have dominated in NZ, affected males and females in a similar way early in the pandemic. Health-related anxieties, which may have been more evident in countries with higher infection rates, may affect females more than men [40] . Previous research has shown that being out of work may have a greater psychological toll on men than on women [41] , but this is much less evident in countries where the 'double breadwinner' model predominates [42] .Reports of family violence seem elevated. The NZ Crime and Victims of Crimes Survey 2018/9 (Table 4) found within a 12-month period, 0.7% of adults experienced physical assault or harassment and threatening behaviour, and 0.4% experienced sexual assault by a family member [43] . In our study, the reported levels of these experiences were between three and four times higher. Again, methodological differences in data collection methods could account for some of these differences. While the 6% of people reporting suicidal ideation also seems high, the majority described having experienced similar thoughts in the 12 months prior to the lockdown. This estimate is higher than in Te Rau Hinengaro, the NZ Mental Health survey, which gave a 3.2% prevalence of suicidal ideation over a year [44] . However, Te Rau Hinengaro data is now over 15 years old, and may no longer reflect the epidemiology of suicidal ideation in NZ. On the other hand, there may be selection bias within our survey, such that for some reason there are higher rates of suicidal ideation than in the general population. Nonetheless, that one in 16 people within our survey reported having suicidal thoughts over the lockdown period is of concern and warrants further research.Vulnerable groups included those with past histories of mental illness, young people, and essential workers. We had identified the elderly as a priority group a priori because of their higher risks of social isolation, lack of digital connectivity and greater vulnerability to COVID-19. However, similar to other research that has consistently found declining prevalence of mental disorders with increasing age [45] [46] [47] , in NZ older people appeared to be faring better than younger people. This is not to say older people were unscathed. In our survey, psychological distress was more prevalent among people of all age groups when compared with prevalence in the same age bracket in the NZ Health Survey. However, the magnitude of increased prevalence was less than that observed in the younger age groups. This trend has also been observed in other international samples [e.g., 13, 48] . Finding lower prevalence of distress among older people reflects their higher baseline wellbeing and may also reflect resilience from having overcome past adversities and experiencing fewer daily disruptions and economic impacts. Older people may also have felt they were safer in NZ than elsewhere. While the virus caused clusters in five aged-care residential facilities, these were contained relatively quickly and COVID-19 did not become endemic amongst services for the elderly. To date, only 7.6% of NZ cases in have occurred in people over 70, with 19 deaths in this age range [5] . Lastly, the older people who had the technology and skills to access and complete this online survey could differ systematically from their peers without these resources.Those with a past history of mental illness had an OR of just under 3 (2.9, 95% C 2.2-3.8) for moderate to high psychosocial distress. While this group may well have had elevated rates of distress prior to the lockdown, we note that about one in three thought their mental health was worse than usual, while only one in six reported it was better than usual.We found essential workers showed increased rates of distress, but not to the extent of other international studies [9] . During a pandemic, essential workers in general and health professionals in particular, may face multiple stressors, including an increased risk of infection and inadequate protection from contamination, frustration, discrimination, having to rationalise limited resources, sick and dying patients, grief, a lack of contact with families, fear of infecting others, overwork and exhaustion [49] . The rates of distress in NZ essential workers were lower than in international samples presumably because fewer workers were directly exposed to COVID-19 than in countries where COVID-19 was rampant. However, it should be noted that more than one in 10 cases of COVID-19 were in healthcare workers [50] .While there are now a number of international studies emerging on the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19, our research is unique in that it occurred during a stringent lockdown which was part of the New Zealand Government's COVID-19 'elimination strategy' [51, 52] and which was showing positive results during the time of data collection (see Fig 1) . This means we examined the impact of strict lockdown restrictions in the absence of widespread direct effects of the virus. This provides evidence on the possible psychological effects of such restrictions for future policy makers weighing their risks and benefits in pandemic response planning.To date (August 2020), NZ has experienced 22 COVID-19 related deaths, which is the lowest COVID-19 related mortality in the OECD [53] . Nevertheless, the increased rates of mental distress during lockdown reported in our study are consistent with international evidence showing significant negative effects on population wellbeing [e.g., 7, 8, [54] [55] [56] [57] . Essential workers, young people, those economically impacted, and those with pre-existing conditions, including mental illness, have similarly been shown to be at high risk. [9, 58, 59] . Reports from China, the US, Brazil, and Australia also indicate increases in family violence coinciding with lockdown orders [54] [55] [56] [57] .Like all survey-based research our study has some limitations. Our data was generated by participants' subjective reports of their experiences and emotions. The self reporting of depressive or anxiety symptoms is not equivalent to a structured diagnostic interview [60] , and cannot be used to classify a mental disorder like a depressive disorder or, in aggregate, to estimate the prevalence of disorder based on diagnostic criteria. Our data was also collected cross sectionally and does not reveal whether the increases in psychological distress were sustained over time.Panel samples generally tend to over-represent those with higher socio-economic status and education, and access to a computer or internet-connected mobile phone was necessary to complete the survey. Consequently, those most affected by the pandemic lockdown may well be under-represented in our sample. On the other hand, people for whom the topic of wellbeing had particular salience (perhaps because they were experiencing difficulties), may have been more inclined to participate. Hence, selection bias may have influenced our results, though the direction and magnitude of its effects are hard to quantify.Comparisons between our results and those of other surveys are also complicated by differences in sampling frames and survey modes (e.g. web-based versus face-to-face interviews in the NZ Health Survey). However, we used sample quotas and post-stratification weighting to ensure a gender, ethnicity and age balance representative of the NZ population. The survey was peer reviewed, pre-tested on a sample of members of the general public, and modified accordingly [37] . We used validated outcome measures for which there are established baseline norms. The survey could be completed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer. Consent and completion rates were high.It is clear that the consequences of the novel coronavirus pandemic will be pervasive and prolonged. Evidence of second-wave community transmission in neighbouring countries and enduring economic impacts suggest COVID-19's effects on mental wellbeing will continue. After NZ's early success with 100 consecutive days of no community transmission, the reemergence of cases in Auckland on 11 August 2020 left the country wondering whether another large outbreak was imminent and what measures should be implemented to control it.The ongoing collection of robust mental health data is imperative to guide policy and service delivery. Methods should include random population sampling, validated measures (with benchmark data), and the target sample should be adequately powered to assess critical but low prevalence outcomes such as suicide and family harm. The established methods of probability sampling have been sorely challenged by COVID-19 restrictions, but should resume as soon as they can be undertaken safely. Further research into priority groups (such as young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, ethnic minorities, people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, those who lose work, and those at the front line) should occur. Qualitative research could probe the lived experiences of the lockdown for priority groups. As well as investing in research examining vulnerabilities, the protective factors for those who coped well during the crisis should also be explored.In due course, analysing any changes in mental health-related national data over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic will give further information on its psychological impacts. Useful data to interrogate will include service utilisation data (e.g., mental health presentations in primary care, psychiatric referrals), psychotropic prescribing rates, suicide rates, and family harm data.Governments should treat the adequate provision of psychosocial support with similar priority to other health measures. Current and future response plans need to take due account of the psychological burdens of pandemics and how to mitigate them. As an example, we note the NZ Government's release of the Psychosocial and Mental Wellbeing Recovery Plan outlining the national approach to supporting the mental and social wellbeing in the COVID-19 recovery period [61] .Supporting the population's psychological wellbeing spans a broad range of domains, from ensuring people have ready access to accurate information, basic necessities, and community connection at one end, through to the availability of specialist mental health services at the other end. Communication campaigns are required to publicise what supports are available and how people can access them, with targeted messages for priority groups.The mental health sector, which even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic has been struggling under pressure in many countries including NZ [62] , needs to be adequately resourced to meet the predicted increased demand. Free access to high quality e-therapies and telehealth support also becomes increasingly important if people are afraid or are not allowed to leave their homes.NZ is noteworthy for having implemented stringent restrictions early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and for eliminating the virus from its general populace between May and August 2020. A significant proportion of the population was adversely affected by the lockdown. While the economic impacts of the lockdown measures were serious and are ongoing, our study emphasises the need to pay equal attention to the effects of such lockdowns on mental wellbeing. Governments dealing with pandemics like COVID-19 should treat the adequate provision of psychosocial support with similar priority to contact tracing, provision of personal protective equipment, and procurement of ventilators.Supporting information S1 File.

By early April 2020, there were 1.2 million cases of COVID-19 and over 69,000 deaths. (1) In the same period, more than 300 COVID-19 clinical trials were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, and numbers continue to grow(2).As a novel virus, in the early phases of the pandemic clinicians were required to make vital COVID-19 treatment decisions with limited direct evidence. However, an escalating volume of research related to COVID-19 is released daily,(3) requiring rapid and ongoing synthesis to ensure guidance for health decisions remains up to date.Evidence-based guideline development relies on a series of systematic reviews to identify and appraise the research on which recommendations are based. Recommendations can rapidly become out of date as new research is published but not incorporated into the guidelines, with some recommendations already out of date at the time of publication. (4) (5) (6) Delays in including evidence in guidelines may contribute to sub-optimal quality of care and patient outcomes.'Living' evidence synthesis methods were developed to enable systematic reviews to be continually updated as new evidence emerges. (7) Living systematic reviews are now conducted across the spectrum of health research (8) , and living approaches are being applied to guideline development (9) , with pilot living guidelines projects underway in stroke, diabetes, maternal health and other areas. (10) (11) (12) A living approach to guideline development includes rapid prioritisation of areas where guidance is needed, continual evidence surveillance and frequent updating of recommendations. By continually incorporating emerging evidence, these methods ensure that currency of guideline recommendations is maintained. (9) Living approaches are appropriate when:1. Guideline recommendations are a priority for decision-making; and 2. Recommendations are likely to change as new evidence emerges; and 3. New research evidence is likely to become available. (9) The decisions made by clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 unquestionably fit these three criteria.In late March 2020 the Australian Living Evidence Consortium and Cochrane Australia established the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce. (13) The Taskforce is a partnership of 31 Australian peak health professional bodies (Box 1) whose members provide clinical care to people with COVID-19. Taskforce partners collaborate to develop living, evidence-informed guidelines for primary, hospital and critical care of people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The guidelines are updated weekly. In this paper, we describe the methods used to develop and maintain the guidelines.The guidelines provide specific, patient-focused recommendations on management and care of people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and chemoprophylaxis for people exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The guideline recommendations are intended to be used by individuals responsible for the management and care of people with COVID-19 in Australia.The guidelines are designed to meet the 2016 Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) standard for clinical practice guidelines (14), and the Taskforce is seeking NHMRC approval. The Taskforce is overseen by a Steering Committee, comprised of representatives from member organisations, which has responsibility for endorsing guideline recommendations. A Guidelines Leadership Group (GLG) oversees daily operations, including the work of guidelines panels, and is advised by a consumer panel. The guideline panels review evidence and make draft recommendations in specific areas of clinical practice, to be approved by the GLG. They are supported by an Evidence Team that identifies, appraises and synthesises evidence (see Figures 1 and 2). Membership of these groups is described on the Taskforce website. (13) 1. Identification and formulation of clinical questions Clinical questions are selected and prioritised for living evidence review where they meet the criteria for living evidence synthesis. Over a two-week period in March 2020, we identified initial questions through: a survey of the membership and discussions with leaders of Taskforce organisations; a review of existing guidelines; and discussions with key stakeholders.Since publication of the first version of the guidelines, questions are sought on an ongoing basis from the guideline and consumer panels, Taskforce members, and through the Taskforce website. Each week, in-scope questions are prioritised by the panels by:1. Likely impact on patient outcomes 2. Proportion of clinical population impacted 3. Extent of variation in current practiceHigh-priority questions are selected by the GLG. Each priority question is formulated by the Evidence Team using the Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) format, and clinical experts on the panels ensure the questions target areas of urgent clinical uncertainty. Where possible, outcomes are aligned with the COVID-19 Core Outcomes Set. (15) A list of the topics currently addressed by the guidelines is provided in Box 2, and an up-to-date list is available on the guideline website. (13) 2. Search and selection methods An information specialist oversees evidence surveillance and undertakes searches of databases and other sources. To avoid duplication, evidence surveillance combines daily horizon scans of several COVID-19 sources, including organisations producing COVID-19 guidance, plus targeted searches for specific PICO questions as they are prioritised. The purpose of the horizon scan is to be aware of new evidence syntheses (systematic reviews, rapid reviews, living reviews) and primary studies that fall within the scope of the guideline (see Table 1 ). Several auto-alerts are run daily or weekly in PubMed to supplement the horizon-scanning activities.The Evidence Team also liaises with several international groups who are sourcing and conducting research and evidence syntheses within the guideline scope to minimise duplication and ensure rapid access to relevant research.As new questions are prioritised, existing search surveillance methods are checked to ensure they cover the new questions, and the search is updated or expanded as needed.Articles are eligible for inclusion if they report results of primary research or systematic reviews relevant to one of the PICO questions. PICO questions are occasionally structured to include evidence from other, similar diseases (such as other viral pneumonia), to provide additional indirect evidence for formulating recommendations. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed for each PICO question.Studies retrieved by the search are uploaded into Covidence for screening by at least two members of the Evidence Team. Disagreements are resolved through discussion and, if necessary, a third reviewer adjudicates. Full-text articles are screened using the same process, with expert clinical input as required.The guideline uses GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) (16, 17) methodology, as it is recommended as best practice by the NHMRC, the body responsible for approving clinical practice guidelines in Australia, and is used by many international organisations, including the World Health Organization and Cochrane, enabling collaboration.(18, 19) GRADE is a transparent framework for developing and presenting summaries of evidence and provides a systematic approach for making clinical practice recommendations. Development is supported by the online guideline development and publication platform 'MAGIC' (Making GRADE the Irresistible Choice).(16, 17) Using MAGIC allows collaboration across locations, and rapidly publish updated recommendations in an easily accessible web format.The Evidence Team extracts data using standardised forms. Data are extracted independently by two reviewers and disagreements are resolved through discussion and, if necessary, a third reviewer adjudicates. Extracted data are cross-referenced with an outcome matrix to ensure that all important outcomes are analysed, and we cross-check our assessments with other groups undertaking rigorous syntheses. A summary table of study characteristics is used to group studies for analysis, in accordance with pre-specified questions.Systematic reviews are assessed using AMSTAR2 (20) , and the risk of bias assessment of included studies from the review is used where available. Individual primary studies are assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomised trials (21) and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. (22) Where an existing systematic review is available and up to date, additional synthesis is not undertaken, and reviews are monitored for further updates. Where an existing systematic review is available but not up to date (or becomes out of date), a limited update may be conducted to integrate new studies. Where primary studies are available to answer a clinical question, a systematic review is initiated and synthesis methods selected as appropriate to the question, in accordance with Cochrane standards. (21) For each question, the Evidence Team develops evidence-to-decision tables following GRADE processes. Where needed, specialist expertise is sought from the Expert Advisory Group. The complete evidence profiles and rationales for recommendations are included in the guidelines.Seven guideline panels have been convened:• Primary and chronic care • Hospital and acute care • Critical care • Pregnancy and perinatal care • Paediatric and adolescent care • Palliative and aged care panel • Disease-modifying treatment and chemoprophylaxis Panels are intentionally diverse across disciplines, setting, geography and gender. Members of panels are sought through consultation with Taskforce members and calls for expressions of interest. New panel members are recruited, and new panels convened, as areas of need arise.Panels discuss and revise draft recommendations within their scope at weekly meetings. Panels consider each of the GRADE domains, including benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, resources, feasibility, acceptability and equity in formulating their decisions. Consumer representatives particularly consider whether strong or varying patient preferences and values are likely to impact on the nature or implementability of the recommendations.A recommendation is rated:• strong when most or all individuals will be best served by the recommended course of action • conditional when not all individuals will be best served by the recommended course of action and there is a need to consider the individual patient's circumstances, preferences, and values.For some topics, there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation, however panels believe it important to provide advice. Advice about these topics is developed based on consensus expert opinion (guided by any relevant evidence) and labelled as Consensus Recommendations or Practice Statements.Draft recommendations from the panels are reviewed and approved by the GLG and endorsed by the Steering Committee before publication.On publication, each recommendation is labelled as 'Updated' or 'New'. Updated recommendations are existing recommendations where the strength or the direction of the recommendation has changed.Care is taken to coordinate the work of the panels and ensure consistency in recommendations across panels. Guideline panel chairs and Evidence Team members meet regularly, and panel chairs sit on the GLG where they review the recommendations across each of the panels.The Taskforce has partnered with the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, the peak national health consumer body, to co-convene a consumer panel. The panel consists of eight to ten consumers who advise the GLG on:• new clinical questions and high-priority topics,• relative importance of different outcomes, and • feedback on guideline recommendations.The co-chairs of the Consumer Panel also represent the panel on the GLG.The Taskforce is mindful that Indigenous peoples or other population groups (including culturally and linguistically diverse communities) may have specific needs in relation to COVID-19 care. Our guideline panels include a diversity of representation, including Indigenous peoples and remote and regional health practitioners. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine are both members of the Taskforce.Searches cover all population groups, with no limits on the patients or population of studies, other than that they must have a diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.In the early phase of the Taskforce, it became evident that specialty panels would be required for specific sub-populations. The Taskforce established separate panels for pregnancy and perinatal care, paediatric and adolescent care, and palliative and aged care. These panels develop recommendations specific to these population (for example, care during labour and childbirth), and adapt existing recommendations (for example, use of antiviral medicines in infants). Weekly guideline updates are disseminated through general and health media, including traditional and social media channels, and distributed to the members of the Taskforce for dissemination. Each week, a 'Taskforce Communiqué' is sent to all member organisations, partners and funders of the Taskforce, as well as subscribers to the Taskforce website (and is available online on the Taskforce website (13)). The Communiqué provides an overview of the work of the Taskforce for that week and includes content that Taskforce members can adapt for communications with their members.A process evaluation is being undertaken to continually improve processes and outputs of the Taskforce and guidelines project, and inform future living guideline projects. Each month, experiences of participants in the Taskforce are captured through online surveys, semi-structured interviews and a stocktake of activity. Results are provided monthly to the Taskforce Steering Committee.An impact evaluation will examine the influence of the guidelines on care of people with COVID-19, identifying the extent to which health decision-makers were aware of the guidelines; valued the guidelines; and used the guidelines to inform decision-making.The Taskforce was formed in late March 2020, the first version of the guidelines was published two weeks later and included 10 recommendations. Using the methods described above, the guidelines have been revised, updated and republished each week since.By early October, the evidence team of 11 full-time equivalent staff, working with seven guideline panels and over 230 individuals (clinicians, policymakers, and others) had screened more than 5000 citations, appraised and synthesised 53 randomised trials, 13 non-randomised studies and 12 systematic reviews. Collectively this evidence had informed 92 recommendations addressing 81 topics (version 24, 1 October 2020).The Australian Guidelines for the Management and Care of People with COVID-19 provide a largescale test case for living approaches to GRADE-based guideline development. The weekly update schedule is the most frequent of which we are aware, and significantly more rapid than other living guidelines projects. (10) (11) (12) This is commensurate with the extraordinarily rapid emergence of evidence related to management of COVID-19.(23)Our experience of 24 successful weekly cycles suggests that very frequent updating is feasible, even during a time of significant disruption. The short update cycles require all contributors to be agile and act collaboratively, and depend on strong project management.Others have noted that rapid reviews are particularly challenging during COVID-19 (24) , and the team has faced challenges in developing the guidelines. As a new Taskforce, the project team moved quickly to both rapidly support recommendation development and publication, while simultaneously establishing infrastructure, recruiting staff, and developing the workflows to deliver living guidelines. It took several weeks to establish stability in the team and processes. Having a team of experienced methodologists familiar with living evidence synthesis methods was crucial. With all team members J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f working remotely, technologies such as Zoom and Slack have been indispensable in enabling the rapid workflows.Globally, several groups have also recognised the particular value of living evidence synthesis approaches in the context of a novel disease with such a swiftly evolving evidence base. Cochrane has rapidly produced living systematic reviews (LSRs) addressing the value of convalescent plasma and rehabilitation interventions for people with COVID-19 (25, 26) , on signs and symptoms, and antibody tests to identify people with COVID-19 (27, 28) . The Cochrane convalescent plasma LSR provides a clear demonstration of why these approaches are useful. The initial version, published in May, included only eight studies, predominantly case series, with a total of just 32 participants. The first update, published two months later, included 20 studies (one randomised and 19 nonrandomised) with over 5000 participants, and also identified 50 ongoing randomised trials. (25) Groups The existence of LSRs produced by international research groups and other pre-filtered and preappraised evidence sources, including COVID-19-specific research databases, was a major enabler of our work and reduced duplication of effort.Living methods are also beginning to be applied to other guideline development for COVID-19, for example the World Health Organization guideline for COVID-19 drugs (37) and the BMJ Rapid Recommendation on remdesivir (38) , however we are not aware of other living guideline programs which match the scope or frequency of updating achieved by the Taskforce.The Taskforce brings together 31 Australian peak health professional bodies whose members provide care to people with COVID-19. The willingness of these organisations to collaborate, quickly identify representatives and panel members, and establish rapid processes for recommendation endorsement has been crucial to the successful delivery of weekly guideline updates. Similarly, the commitment of individual clinicians and others to weekly panel meetings has been outstanding, especially given increased workloads resulting from the pandemic. Support from NHMRC was also vital in ensuring the guidelines meet NHMRC standards.The Australian Guidelines for the Management and Care of People with COVID-19 provide an important example of the feasibility of rapid living GRADE-based guideline development, and an opportunity to robustly test and improve living guideline development methods. Results of the process and impact evaluations will provide useful insights to guide future work in this area.As of September, the guideline recommendations cover: Living evidence map and living systematic review of Covid-19 studies (covid-nma.org) Identifies randomised trials, non-randomised studies and case series from daily screening of searches of PubMed, Chinarxiv and MedRxiv.

With the first Australian cases of COVID-19 confirmed in January 2020, the national response was rapid with the international border closed only weeks later (in March 2020) and returning travellers required to quarantine for 2 weeks in major cities before returning home. This was coupled with state and territory lockdowns, which saw non-essential industries shut down and population movement minimised. 1 Early identification of the vulnerability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remote community populations was a notable feature of the Australian health sector's response to the pandemic environment. The Australian Government implemented a suite of initiatives to maintain existing health system function and optimise front-line workforce capacity, including telehealth, workforce training and general practice-led respiratory clinics. 2 Notwithstanding a 'second wave' in parts of Victoria, over 6 months since the first cases were confirmed in Australia, the nation has fared remarkably well compared with many other developed countries, where COVID-19 mortality rates are up to 100 times greater than in Australia. 3 In preparing for, and responding to, the pandemic, remote primary health services, including services in the Northern Territory (NT), Queensland and Western Australia, have been confronted with front-line workforce challenges that are unlikely to have been experienced by their urban and regional primary health counterparts. Remote Australia is characterised by limited access to primary health care (PHC) and specialist services, and generally poorer health outcomes. 4 Remote health services exhibit persistent challenges including underfunding and maintaining adequate health workforce supply and retention. 5, 6 In recent years, remote health services have become highly dependent on short-term or 'fly-in, fly-out/drive-in, drive-out' (FIFO/ DIDO) staff, frequently employed through an employment agency. 7 These workforce challenges have been highlighted by this pandemic. There is scant literature documenting how remote health services experience and respond to pandemics such as COVID-19. This article (a) summarises the factors that make remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities particularly vulnerable to COVID-19; (b) summarises remote health services' responses to COVID-19; and (c) describes the persistent challenges for remote PHC services during the COVID-19 pandemic.Many remote residents are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 and related complications for a number of reasons. These include the high prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and respiratory illness, and high rates of tobacco use. 4, 8 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have three times the rate of diabetes compared with non-Indigenous Australians. 8 To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Australian Department of Health guidelines have recommended physical distancing, good hygiene practices and limitations on the number of people allowed at public gatherings. 9,10 Lack of infrastructure, together with family, cultural and literacy factors, made compliance with these guidelines impractical for many remote communities. Firstly, around 30% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households in very remote Australia experience overcrowding, making social distancing at home difficult. 11 Secondly, the residents of many homes are intergenerational, making transmission to the elderly and higher-risk individuals more likely. Thirdly, many houses lack basic 'health hardware,' such as access to safe electrical systems, toilets, showers and taps to enable recommended behaviours such as hand washing. Fourthly, there is high mobility of community members related in part to participation in cultural ceremonies and funerals. Such movement, coupled with groups of people coming together for ceremony, has enormous potential to spread the virus rapidly within and between communities. Fifthly, the requirement to quarantine prior to return to country, for example following some discharge from hospital of patients from cross-border areas (such as South Australian or Western Australian residents discharged from Alice Springs Hospital), can result in psychological distress. Sixthly, mainstream messaging is likely to have limited impact on remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations if it is not available in local languages or sufficiently adapted to the remote context. Finally, inadequate messaging and levels of health literacy might result in misconceptions; for example, that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are immune or not susceptible to COVID-19.When the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Australia, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, other organisations such as land councils and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders quickly recognised and acted to minimise the threat posed to remote communities by COVID-19 transmission. 2, 12 There was a rapid and forceful advocacy at various levels of government to inform responses and minimise COVID-19 transmission risk through: restrictions on non-essential travel to remote communities; 13 collaborative efforts with non-health organisations to support community members to return to country; and the creation and rapid dissemination of targeted resources with consistent messages in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages using print, television (eg NITV, Imparja), social media platforms (eg Facebook) and radio. 14 There is much that can be learnt from this Indigenous-led response-lessons about early targeting of language-specific resources could be heeded, for example, in cultural and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities within Australia.A suite of responses were designed and implemented by remote Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services to support and strengthen the existing remote PHC workforce so that PHC delivery was maintained. The measures included identifying of essential staff in each clinic and coupling them with workforce contingency planning (eg enabling 'vulnerable, at-risk' including non-Indigenous staff aged 60+ years and Indigenous staff aged 50+ years to return home or to work from home using telehealth), staff training in the use of personal protective equipment, and mental health support for existing staff (eg short, regular breaks in regional towns within the same state or territory where they were working). Although telehealth cannot be a substitute for local workforce and service delivery, the added temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule items increased the availability of telehealth services. This has helped maintain ongoing delivery of PHC in some remote areas during the pandemic.As observed in other parts of Australia, rapid testing and isolating of individuals with symptoms is vital to managing outbreaks of COVID-19. The extraordinarily low infection rates experienced in remote areas during the first wave provided remote health services additional time to develop processes and access equipment needed to efficiently respond to outbreaks. As part of the Australian Government's Remote Point of Care Testing Program, many remote health services are now operating COVID-19 point-of-care testing sites. In the initial months of the pandemic, testing was available in centralised locations only. Remote PHC clinics were located long distances from centralised testing facilities, and many clinics experienced limited accessibility as regional airlines reduced flights or ceased operations altogether. Long delays for test results were therefore experienced prior to pointof-care testing becoming available in these locations. This program has reduced test result waiting times in remote communities from many days and in some cases weeks to approximately 45 minutes.Early in the pandemic, remote clinics lacked adequate resources to effectively prevent, identify, isolate, treat and evacuate cases. With the additional time to prepare, services have since purchased and stocked up on personal protective equipment. Soap and other hygiene products have also been distributed to community households by remote health services. At a local and regional level, remote health services have met regularly with essential services-including police, schools, medical retrieval teams and hospitals-to develop procedures for evacuations should there be an outbreak. Suitable buildings have been identified for isolating COVID-19-positive patients and families who either do not require evacuation or are awaiting evacuation. These facilities will help to minimise infection spread within the health workforce and remote communities.As time has passed and understanding of and preparation for COVID-19 has progressed, federal, state and territory governments have released roadmaps consisting of a step-down approach to easing of restrictions. With support from relevant organisations (eg land councils), the Australian Government also released a framework containing guidelines for easing remote area travel restrictions. 15 As population movement between and within states and territories has recommenced, remote health services and communities remain alert and prepared to respond promptly to community outbreaks. Yet, the vulnerabilities experienced by remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities remain.The high prevalence of chronic disease and overcrowding, for example, are long-standing issues that require fundamental reform, such as an Indigenous Voice to our national parliament. Other long-standing remote PHC service workforce issues, which have implications for the transmission and management of COVID-19, also persist.Primary health care workforce models in remote Australia differ from those in urban and rural settings. 16 Remote clinics usually consist of small teams comprising resident remote area nurses (RANs) and Aboriginal health practitioners (AHPs), supported by general practitioners, other medical specialists and allied health professionals through community visits and telehealth consultations. The median-sized NT Government clinic consists of two nurses: 0.5 full-time equivalent AHP and 2 other non-clinical employees. 5 Over recent years, use of agency nurses-sourced frequently from the south-eastern corner of Australia and New Zealand-has increased substantially. 6 In 2016, a cross-sectional analysis reported that 42% of remote nurses in the NT were employed on a casual or agency contract. 17 Remote health services have been confronted with several additional workforce challenges during this pandemic. These are largely associated with remote health workforce instability, high turnover rate and heavy dependence on FIFO/DIDO and short-term staff 5, 7 and include the following: heightened difficulty sourcing appropriately skilled agency nurses due to the combination of national and state/territory border restrictions, and rapidly changing national demand for short-term health workforce; expensive self-quarantine; increased risk of losing permanent staff through burnout; and risk of health worker illness eroding service provision.In the early stages of Australia's COVID-19 outbreak, the capacity of remote health services to replenish their shortterm workforce was curtailed due to border restrictions imposed by state/territory, Australian and New Zealand governments in order to reduce domestic and international travel. Many remote health services were unable to source previously used interstate and international agency nurses and locum doctors who possess valuable remote health service knowledge and experience and have established relationships with long-term clinic staff and remote communities. Some remote health services now request short-term staff to work remotely for a minimum period (eg 12 weeks).A further strain on sourcing short-term staff was the national high demand for skilled health workers, particularly agency nurses. With more COVID-19 cases in metropolitan centres, there has been competition between and within health systems seeking to boost their own short-term workforces.Remote area nursing might also be less attractive at this time, due to limited flexibility to travel across regions and greater family responsibilities. These factors are likely to leave remote health services with a greater reliance on agency staff who are lacking the cultural competency and breadth of knowledge required to work in remote communities. 18 There have been some temporary closures of remote clinics during the pandemic because of staffing shortages. These challenges highlight the need for a strong, appropriately trained and adequately funded local health workforce in all remote communities.Some categories of health staff deemed 'essential services' are exempt from border restrictions and the 14-day self-quarantine period linked to government-imposed state/ territory border controls. However, some remote health services are nevertheless quarantining all new staff as a precautionary measure to minimise any spread of the virus and alleviate community concern about introduction of the virus by staff. This measure adds substantial costs relating to salaries and accommodation during quarantine to an already underfunded remote PHC system. 6, 19 Loss of existing permanent workforce through burnout might also increase services' need for short-term staff during the pandemic and compromise remote PHC delivery. RANs already had onerous workloads pre-COVID-19, largely due to insufficient number of clinic staff, frequent orientation of new staff, concerns about the clinical and cultural competency of incoming short-term staff and ensuring continuity of care. These stressors result in many RANs experiencing high levels of emotional exhaustion. 20 The pandemic exacerbated the demands on permanent staff, with an increased workload related to COVID-19-specific planning and reduced opportunities to take leave. Other local clinic staff, especially AHPs, might also experience concerns commonly experienced by front-line workers during pandemics such as contagion exposure and cross-infection to family.The threat of COVID-19 transmission into and within Australia's remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities has highlighted not only population vulnerabilities, but also the vulnerability of and unique challenges for remote health services. A clear understanding of the COVID-19 threat by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership has resulted in a rapid response to better prepare PHC services, inform the population at risk and prevent transmission into remote communities. The low numbers of COVID-19 cases experienced in remote parts of Australia early in the pandemic have given health services additional time to develop innovative approaches to manage and respond to cases should future outbreaks arise in remote communities. However, long-standing, persistent workforce shortages and heavy reliance on short-term, casual FIFO/DIDO staff remain a vulnerability and a substantial COVID-19 risk for remote residents. Costly 14-day quarantine of staff mitigate the risk of introducing COVID-19 unwittingly into remote communities, but this reduces the available pool of health professionals and the orientation of new staff adds to the already high work demands on existing staff. This pandemic has highlighted not only an unacceptable level of socio-economic disadvantage amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations living in remote communities that continues to place them at higher risk of adverse health outcomes, but also the urgent need for a well-funded, appropriately trained, stable and accessible health workforce in all remote communities.","Australia","abstract","2020-11-20","11"

A Perspective on Early Communication During COVID-19","behavioural responses-both practicing recommended behaviours (such as putting on a mask) and the refusal to do so are reactions to perceive loss of control (Jetten et al. 2020; Wong 2020) . ""Self-determination"" is used in relation to communities as much as to individuals, which may provide new understandings or representations for relations between individual and communal self-shaping in the context of pandemics (Eichler 2019) . Given the extensive and growing data that reveals values and ideologies as often the strongest determinants of people's attitudes to health protection behaviours (e.g., Dryhurst et al. 2020; Seale et al. 2020) , we suggest that rich accounts of self-determination, autonomy, and/or freedom beyond ""thin"" versions of liberty (e.g., to travel or not wear masks) will have much to offer pandemic ethics in future research.In this paper we make a modest beginning on exploring what adding a ""values perspective"" to risk communication might look like by examining one risk communication principle, ""communicate early and often,"" in the very first stages of the pandemic. Our argument is that use of this principle could have minimized some of the negative impacts seen in Australia and the United Kingdom in February and March 2020. We contend that a hitherto undiscussed reason for why this principle is effective is because it conveys value for people's self-determination, even as this is threatened by both disease and the measures needed to control the disease. We discuss how proactive communication might have improved community preparedness but also suggest that being more explicit about this value should have involved better acknowledgement of, and empathetic engagement with, those who were most directly impacted by control measures at that time. As a result, the Australian government could have better addressed stigma, racism, and xenophobia during late January and February and mitigated or avoided food and hygiene product stock-outs in early March. We conclude with a brief discussion of how communication of values might have avoided the loss of trust and misunderstandings associated with the misnamed strategy of achieving ""herd immunity"" when discussion of this emerged in the United Kingdom.We conclude by suggesting that the communication of values can improve the quality of pandemic response and can increase the degree of trust placed in responding authorities.When people face the heightened fear of a novel, uncontrolled, and uncertain risk such as the pandemic of SARS-CoV_2, self-determination in multiple dimensions is compromised and well-being is reliant on the knowledge and decisions of experts and governments (Siegrist and Zingg 2014) . Risk communication must connect as much as possible with people's sense of selfdetermination, even (perhaps especially) in contexts where individual liberties may become limited. How c a n t h i s b e d o n e ? T h e p r i n c i p l e s o f r i s k communication-for example communicating early and often, being open and transparent, and not dismissing concerns as ""panic""-are all means of affording some sense of control in people facing a situation of high concern and uncertainty.Transparency is a core recommendation for pandemic risk communication (van Der Weerd et al. 2011) , because it enables citizens' knowledge and confidence (Earle, Siegrist, and Gutscher 2007; Siegrist and Zingg 2014 ) that the response strategy will occur as expected. Because values and moral commitments are intrinsic to all pandemic responses, we argue that true transparency requires that pandemic risk communication is explicit about the values that guide it. Further, we suggest that part of the task of managing a pandemic is to cultivate public convergence (Kahan 2012) on the guiding values. This is important because a pandemic response, and communicating about it, are not actually separable: action is, in itself, a very powerful form of communication (Amabile and Kabat 1982) , as we discuss below.We suggest that conveying respect for selfdetermination involves early, proactive communication with those who are directly affected by any response strategy. This will involve addressing issues of fairness or justice, since these are present in virtually all ethical frameworks for pandemic response (Australian Government Department of Health 2019; Kinlaw, Barrett, and Levine 2009 ; N e w Z e a l a n d N a t i o n a l E t h i c s A d v i s o r y Committee-Kāhui Matatika o te Motu 2007; Thomas, Dasgupta, and Martinot 2007) and have also been shown to strongly influence peoples' perceptions of, and responses to, risk (Siegrist, Connor, and Keller 2012) .The earliest representations of the new coronavirus in media coverage of the disease in Australia and the United Kingdom conformed to what Priscilla Wald has identified as ""the outbreak narrative,"" in which a disease emanating from a non-White, non-Western nation is eventually contained as a result of the scientific and technologic prowess of democratic Western societies (Wald 2008) .Through January and February 2020, health risk communicators from WHO and government health authorities balanced communication of the potential seriousness of the new disease (Clun 2020; The Sydney Morning Herald 2020), with caution about acting too strongly or too soon. Nonetheless several elements in news media coverage of the novel coronavirus disease in this period together tended to frame the disease as unlikely to significantly threaten Australia or the United Kingdom (The Guardian 2020). These included comparisons with SARS, MERS, and Ebola, and associations of the new disease with Chinese political authoritarianism, which somewhat signalled that these diseases were unlikely to cause widespread disease in Western nations (Boseley 2020) . The discourse of ""technology as saviour"" (Hooker, King, and Leask 2012; Wald 2008) , in the form of early and frequent expectation that a vaccine and effective treatment would be rapidly developed by scientists, was prominent (Garcia 2020; Mannix 2020) .Media coverage identified that mortality was strongly associated with the elderly and those with comorbidities. Media commentators have noted that this reporting often portrayed the elderly, and those with significant health issues, as a passive, vulnerable minority, even one that was expendable or burdensome (Ashimoni 2020). These representations have continued to raise considerable concern (see, for example, People With Disability Australia (PWDA) et al. 2020) and provides an important context for later discussions of ""herd immunity."" II. ""Communicate Early and Often""In this discursive media environment, we argue that earlier, proactive communication signalling that nations outside China might become affected and about the possibility of a pandemic was needed. Early communication could have supported earlier sense-making, encouraged citizen engagement, and provided potential convergence towards a response strategy.By 20-25 February, the WHO and other health authorities were considering the possibility of a pandemic increasingly likely (Callaway 2020 ). Yet in Australia there was little proactive public communication at this time-indeed, Australian government websites only contained advice pertinent to travellers. The Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was released on February 27 (Grattan 2020) but was accompanied by little transparent communication about what was being done or which elements of the plan were receiving attention. This created a ""risk communication vacuum"" (Leiss 2001) .In this vacuum, messages came from sources not privy to government planning. One was virologist Dr Ian Mackay, who recognized and attempted to fill the space by publishing an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald (Mackay 2020) . This advised Australians to prepare for a pandemic and suggested that Australians moderately stock up on basic consumer items and medicine, urging people to ""prepare, but do not panic."" A steeply-increasing, sometimes harmful, and prolonged period of stockpiling of basic supplies like hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and flour swiftly followed in Australia, fed by escalating public anxiety.We contend that earlier and values-oriented communication could have reduced the anxiety that was later expressed in stockpiling behaviours by enabling longer and more moderated preparation for what could be ahead. Respect for citizens' complex selfdetermination within the context of potential outbreaks could be conveyed in the cautious communication of concrete scenarios concerning what people might consider in their own family preparation (for example, of how to manage if somebody became sick). This period of sense-making and preparation can allow proactive communication of values around which people might shape their responses, such as providing support for neighbours (e.g., New Zealand National Ethics Advisory Committee-Kāhui Matatika o te Motu 2007). Proactive early communication with supermarket managers could have limited or avoided stockpiling (Poloyo 2020) .In attempting to avoid early overreactions, which unintentionally communicates a lack of trust in the public, government effectively intensified a problem, rather than reducing it.Early communication centred on ideas of selfdetermination (acknowledging individual and communal aspects of this) could have helped address the challenge that most pandemic response measures affect people unequally (Howse et al. 2020; Vaughan and Tinker 2009) . Racism and stigmatization have been a feature of almost every epidemic in history (Wailoo 2006) , with anti-Asian prejudice and Sinophobia widespread during the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 (Leung 2008) . Explicitly confronting this through communication is crucial, not only to reduce violence and injustice but because these issues are entangled in epistemic judgements, as occurred in debates in Australia during February, concerning racism in relation to containment measures.As reports of racism and a range of Sinophobic behaviours (including avoidance of Chinese businesses, suburbs, and people) began to appear in the media from the end of January (Vrajlal 2020; Young 2020), a range of containment measures that primarily, but not exclusively, affected Chinese people were enacted. A number of wealthy, independent secondary schools in Australia had unilaterally acted to temporarily exclude students who had recently travelled in China (most of whom were Chinese), including imposing segregated quarantine, in contravention of Commonwealth government health advice (Hooker, Silva, and Anderson 2020). On February 1, the Australian government announced that foreign national travellers from mainland China would not be allowed entry into Australia; Australian citizens (most of whom were Chinese) returning from China were quarantined in offshore detention facilities notorious for their use with refugees. While it is now generally agreed that early border measures to limit transmission of disease into Australia were effective, at the time, school exclusions, selective border controls, and travel-related quarantines in immigration detention camps were questioned as unnecessary and were sometimes perceived as forms of racism (Bedo and McPhee 2020; Hooker, Silva, and Anderson 2020) .To convey respect for people's self-determination, leaders should reflexively examine how their actions might also be interpreted as disrespectful and discriminatory. Actions such as containment (border control) measures are strong forms of communication (Sandman and Lanard 2009 ). While we do not suggest that this was not an important measure at the time, communication needed to address (particular through pre-established two-way channels) those likely to be directly affected by containment measures-in this case, Chinese and other Asian Australians. The predictable harms of stigmatization needed to have been explicitly acknowledged alongside the scientific rationale (Major et al. 2018 ). Risk communication handbooks should urge authorities to be open and honest about the potential for discrimination, in the same way they are encouraged to be explicit about uncertainty.Early communication proactively addressing the potential for stigmatization and racism might have not only limited some of the direct racism experienced by Asian Australians and U.K. nationals but helped to clarify judgements around containment measures by ensuring they were not confused with forms of racism. We note that sometimes violent racism is continuing in Australia at the time of writing (Fang, Yang, and Zhou 2020) .Perhaps the most intractable feature of COVID-19 in its early stages was the persistent framing of pandemic response strategies as a choice between ""the economy"" and ""saving lives."" This frequently contested (Hamilton et al. 2020 ; Zeballos-Riog 2020) framing exemplified the tendency toward values-based polarization in views about the best response to COVID-19 (Kahan 2012) . Early communication with the groups most likely to be affected by any given containment strategy could help with this seemingly incommensurable choice. We discuss how improved communication might have contributed to the pandemic response in the United Kingdom when this was first announced on March 12, the day after the WHO formally declared a pandemic.A crucial period for communication about COVID-19 in Australia and the United Kingdom were the first two weeks of March 2020: the period in which the reality and likelihood of a pandemic was dawning, exponential growth feared in both countries (Churley 2020) , and news of crisis from Iran and Italy were fresh. This period of adjustment was critical for sense-making amid uncertainty, through which convergence on a response strategy could occur.In the United Kingdom there was reportedly heated disagreement between members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies over what response strategy to pursue. Such disagreement is a predictable but highly confounding feature of emergency response (Christensen and Painter 2004) . These differences were epistemic-they involved different appraisals of the evidence available and different assumptions about ""herd immunity""-but they were fundamentally driven by different values. How the term ""herd immunity"" was constructed and interpreted in relation to COVID-19 is worthy of a study in itself. The indirect protection of susceptible individuals resulting from high levels of immunity across a population (D'Souza and Dowdy 2020), ""herd immunity"" is a concept associated most with vaccination (Hanage 2020; MacIntyre 2020) .For the first two weeks of March, the U.K. government pursued a ""mitigation"" (Wickham 2020) strategy with little social restriction under the belief that there was ultimately little the government can do to stop the virus (Shipman and Wheeler 2020); social distancing restrictions would incur a high economic cost, be unsustainable for a long period, and would produce a more severe second wave of infection in winter (Wickham 2020) . This approach assumed that reaching ""herd immunity"" through widespread infection would resolve the pandemic (The Times 2020). This strategy fitted with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's values of limiting state intervention and government spending (Wickham 2020) ; we note that it also fitted with the cluster of values termed ""hierarchical individualism"" in cultural cognition theory (Kahan 2012) .Within twenty-four hours of Johnson's announcement of this policy on March 12, outrage was rising as the strategy's scientific credibility was disputed by epidemiologists and others (Sandle and Boyd 2020) , who pointed out that the ""mitigation"" strategy would result in an overwhelmed National Health Service and that achieving high exposure across the population should not be anticipated to achieve long lasting population immunity and thus conclude the pandemic. The mitigation strategy was perceived as a callous sacrifice of lives, with the media widely reporting that top government aide Dominic Cummings had told a private meeting that the government's strategy was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"" (Buchan 2020) .A ""crisis of trust"" (Smyth 2020) followed. Even though modelling from Imperial College, London (Ferguson et al. 2020) , indicated how swiftly the NHS would be overwhelmed, and convinced the U.K. Government to introduce a ""suppression"" strategy (Wickham 2020) from Monday March 16, doubts remained. The government was urged to ""come clean"" about the sources of the information on which the mitigation strategy was based (Smyth 2020) , and media investigations followed.Earlier communication in this case, where valuesdriven disputes existed between experts (Kahan 2012), likely would not have prevented political crisis, but it would have allowed more time for sense-making processes in scientific, medical, and public communities. We recommend a commitment in pandemic planning documents to sharing sources, models, and evidence at the time of deliberation, and with it, the questions advisors are asking (such as, will the same number of deaths occur regardless of strategy over the long term?) Earlier public discussion of these questions might at least have somewhat disrupted simplistic framing and use of ""herd immunity,"" by enabling early and public scientific challenge from epidemiologists, as occurred from mid-March (Armitage and Hawke 2020; Barr 2020; MacIntyre 2020). We note that the simplistic expectation that ""herd immunity"" would end the pandemic remains widespread (e.g., Hasan 2020).Earlier communication that explicitly discussed values might have enabled better public sense-making about the ""mitigation"" and ""suppression"" strategies. Because each strategy invoked values differently and prioritized different values, we suggest that better communication is needed to explain how values such as being ""proportionate"" (Australian Government Department of Health 2019) are expressed in these strategies. Because the costs of different strategies tend to fall on different members of the community, valuesexplicit communication could more effectively engage with the concerns and needs of those most affected when a strategy is selected.This paper offers some early thoughts for why the principles of risk communication should include the recommendation to be explicit about values. We are not suggesting that better communication alone can prevent or resolve either epistemic or political disagreements in pandemic management nor alleviate every anxiety nor uncertainty. But we do suggest that, given that disagreements about pandemic responses are very often driven by different value commitments, a ""values turn"" in risk communication (Feinberg and Willer 2019) is likely to produce significant benefits, including clearer communication, with greater impact. With regard to the principle of communicating early, we have shown that this is a means of conveying respect for peoples' threatened sense of self-determination, understood broadly. We suggest that this communication of value offers a richer explanation for why early communication, especially where directed with empathy at those most affected by response measures, is important. Values-based risk communication will enable a more effective pandemic response.","Australia","abstract","2020-11-09","11"
