The infection is claimed to have originated from a seafood market in the city. It was first named nCov19 and later relabelled as COVID-19 or better known as the Coronavirus Disease. The virus is transmitted by air droplets; spreading through person-to-person contact. Its symptoms include cough, fever, headache, shortness of breath, and respiratory difficulty. Given its magnitude, the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 30th January 2020, classified COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and subsequently a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1] . As of June 11, there were over 7 million confirmed cases and over 400,000 deaths that were associated with COVID-19 [2] .Reports from the Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) [3] affirmed that the first case of coronavirus in Africa was reported in Egypt on 14th February, 2020. The second case was reported in Algeria on the 25th February, 2020, increasing the number of affected countries in Africa to two. Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the continent and in its adjoining islands [3] . Most of the index cases were reported to have been imported. For instance, according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) [4] , South Africa, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) [5] , the index cases in both South Africa and Nigeria were from travellers who Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s41324-020-00371-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.& Tolulope Osayomi osayomi@yahoo.com flew in from Italy, which at the time was slowly emerging as Europe's epicentre. The virus is now present in every part of Africa; contrary to earlier reports that the coronavirus may not survive in Africa because of the continent's generally high temperature [6] . Nigeria, on the 27th February, 2020, became the third in Africa, and the first in West Africa to report a case of COVID-19. Subsequently, the virus later reached the other fourteen countries of West Africa at different points in time. However, it is pertinent to note here at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in West Africa, Ghana, prior to 17 May, 2020, was the worst affected country in the region. Later, Nigeria overtook Ghana, becoming the country with the largest number of infections on the 17th May, 2020 [7] . Since then, it has not only remained the country with the highest number of COVID-19 morbidity but also the largest mortality. This unenviable status is against the backdrop of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)'s recent proclamation of Nigeria as the Regional Champion against COVID-19 [8] with the hope that Nigeria would lead and effectively coordinate the rest of the subcontinent in the prevention and control of COVID-19.Within the context of West Africa, Nigeria is a major regional player. The country has the largest population size (206.1 million) in West Africa [9] which is more than 50 percent of the sub-region's population. Besides the fact it is home to the headquarters of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Nigeria is a strong pillar in the political and economic affairs of this regional community. In terms of air passenger traffic, Lagos, Nigeria is West Africa's major air traffic hub with about 2 million passengers in 2019 [10] . West Africa, however, had earlier faced an Ebola outbreak in 2014, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.The relatively poor health infrastructure in the subcontinent partly accounted for the rapid spread of Ebola in some parts. The literature shows two conflicting viewpoints on how West Africa's Ebola outbreak history makes its (un)prepared for COVID-19. On one hand, the generally dysfunctional health sector was envisaged to hamper West Africa's preparedness against COVID-19. [6:e631] support this view: ''many west African countries have poorly resourced health systems rendering them unable to quickly scale up an epidemic response''. On the other hand, West Africa, given the Ebola episode, would be better prepared, comparatively speaking, for COVID-19 because of the quality of disease surveillance, testing capacity and contact tracing [11] . The background information on Nigeria and West Africa therefore provides a strong justification for this enquiry. We certainly hope that these findings would not only point Nigeria but also West Africa in the right direction with respect to an effective response in disease prevention and control.Based on the foregoing, the thrust of this research is to (1) examine the geographical distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in West Africa (2) identify the country level drivers of COVID-19 and (3) determine the position of Nigeria in the health crisis within West Africa using retrospective COVID-19 data. The paper is structured as follows. The section that follows the introduction touches on the data sources and methods. The third section shows the study results. The fourth section contains the discussion of the results. Finally, the paper ends with conclusion and recommendation.Secondary data from several published sources such as the West African Health Organisation (WAHO) [7] , 2019 World Population Data Sheet of the Population Reference Bureau [12] , African Statistical Yearbook 2019 of the African Development Bank (AfDB) [13] , Diabetes Atlas of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) [14] , the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report 2019 [15] and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) [16] formed the basis of the study's analysis. Retrospective COVID-19 morbidity and mortality cases in fifteen countries of West Africa as at June 11, 2020 were obtained from the WAHO while the country level information on air traffic movement, population size, urban population, fine particulate matter, tourist arrivals, net migration, population below the poverty line, percent population 65 years and above, population density, doctors/hospitals per 10,000 persons, human poverty index, human development index, poverty incidence, paved roads, population using basic sanitation facilities and diabetes prevalence were culled from PRB [12] , AFDB [13] , IDF [14] , UNDP [15] and ICAO [16] . These variables were selected based on their perceived association with COVID-19 [17, 18] .Pearson correlation technique was useful in discerning the nature of relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and explanatory factors, while the simple linear regression (the step-wise technique) identified the impact of significant explanatory variables on the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases in West Africa. Scatter plots were designed to give the visual clarity to Nigeria's relative position in the pandemic in West Africa. Three dimensional (3D) proportional circle maps showing the geographical distribution of COVID-19 in West Africa were designed to depict the magnitude of the pandemic, using ArcGIS 10.4 version. Statistical data analysis was possible with SPSS version 20.On June 11, 2020, there were a total of 46,433 confirmed cases in the sub-region, however, with substantial variations. The country with the largest number of COVID-19 cases in West Africa was Nigeria (14,554), followed by Ghana (10, 358) and Senegal (4759) while the smallest numbers were found in The Gambia (28), Benin (305) and Togo (524) (Fig. 1 ).Up till June 11, 2020, there were 886 COVID-19 related deaths. Like morbidity, Nigeria had the largest number of deaths associated with the disease (387). However, Mali and Niger followed with 97 and 65 deaths, respectively. Again, The Gambia (1) and Benin (4) had the lowest number of deaths as at the time, followed by Cabo Verde (6) (Fig. 2 ).There appears to be a spatial co-variation between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In other words, states with higher morbidity would correspondingly have higher death rates. Thus, Pearson correlation was used to test this hypothesis. From the results in Table 1 , the relationship between morbidity and mortality was largely positive and strong (r = 0.776).The results of the correlational analysis are set out in Table 1 . Coincidentally, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have strong and positive association with population size and air traffic. Population size has the strongest association with morbidity (r = 0.824) and mortality (r = 0.978). Air traffic is also positively related with morbidity (r = 0.700) and mortality (r = 0.938). The scatter plots not only depict the relationship between COVID-19 and significant risk factors but also Table 2 presents the results of the simple linear regression between COVID-19 and each of the explanatory variables. This was done to explore the individual effects of the independent variables. Table 3 shows the results of the bivariate regression models. With regard to morbidity, population size and air traffic were significant at 0.000. On one hand, population size was positive and accounted for 67.8 percent in the observed variation in morbidity. On the other hand, air traffic explained 49 percent of the total variation in morbidity. With respect to mortality, population size and air traffic were also statistically significant. Population size was responsible for 95.6 percent of the variance in mortality while air traffic contributed 87.1 percent of total variation in mortality.To explore the joint contribution of these two variables, two regression models were estimated for morbidity and mortality using the stepwise approach. Interestingly, The study examined the cross national variations in COVID 19 in West Africa with Nigeria as the COVID-19 epicenter. As at the time of writing, West Africa had a total number of 46,433 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with Nigeria accounting for 31.34 percent of the total confirmed cases [7] , making it the most afflicted in the sub region. In order of relative importance, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal were the top three on the morbidity list while Nigeria, Mali and Niger had the largest number of fatalities as at June 11, 2020. Population size and air traffic were the major determinants of COVID 19 cases and mortality. Nigeria's large population size and large air traffic movement put it at the centre of the pandemic in West Africa. It is a well-known fact that Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with over 200 million people [9] of which 50 percent live in urban areas [12] . These urban settlements are largely characterized by poor housing conditions as well as overcrowded informal settlements [15, 19] which aid the spread of highly contagious diseases. A good reference point is Lagos, the most populated city in West Africa and Africa, is currently Nigeria's COVID-19 epicentre [18] , where about 60 percent of its residents live in slums and informal settlements with limited access to water, poor sanitation and other basic services [20] . As earlier mentioned, the transmission strongly depends on close physical contact. Given this condition, a large and susceptible population would greatly favour the spread of infectious diseases.Our finding is confirmed by [17] 's multi-country analysis of COVID-19 outbreak across the globe in which population size was a significant factor. It is also corroborated by similar studies in the United States [21] , Nigeria [18, 22] , China [23] , Iran [24] , among others. As part of a number of behavioural avoidance measures against the disease, the World Health Organization [2] consistently recommends physical distancing by maintaining at least one metre from the next person. The reason for this is to avoid being infected by respiratory or oral droplets of an infected person. However, physical distancing is quite difficult to maintain in densely populated environments. Similarly, the effect of population size on COVID 19 mortality in Nigeria strongly suggests that COVID-19 mortality tends to be higher in countries with larger population. This is similar to the situation in Lombardy where its large population may have accounted for the high cases of COVID 19 and mortality [25] . This is also the case in Madrid, Spain's most populous city which had the highest cases of COVID 19 and mortality [26] .With regard to air traffic as a risk factor of COVID 19, Nigeria has the tenth busiest airport in Africa and first in West Africa [27] . Over the years, Nigerian airports have witnessed increased patronage. According to the National Bureau of Statistics [28] , Nigeria recorded 14.82 million air travellers (both domestic and international) in 2018 compared to 14.26 million in 2017. The number of international air travellers into Nigeria has risen from 9.16 percent in 2017 to 38.8 percent in 2018 [28] . As a matter of fact, Nigeria's index case was imported to Nigeria from Italy via international air travel. This strongly indicates that human mobility no doubt facilitates the transmission of the virus [18, 29] . Across the world, more than 80 countries had imposed travel bans to limit the spread of the virus [30] . Our finding is again consistent with that of Lau et al. [31] in China and Zhaung et al., [32] in Iran.There were striking cross national variations in COVID 19 in West Africa, with Nigeria as the COVID-19 epicentre of the region. The novel infection spreads rapidly in countries with large population and high air passenger traffic. Besides, Nigeria's demographic and regional standing puts the whole region at great risk if the land borders and airspace are hastily re-opened. Like other countries in the world, Senegal and Togo resumed international flights on July 15, 2020 and August 1, 2020, respectively [33, 34] while Nigeria and Ghana are to reopen airspace on August 21 and September, 1, 2020, respectively [35, 36] .Based on the findings and in light of recent developments, Nigeria certainly needs to live up to its mandate by strengthening the governance structures within and outside its borders so as to effectively coordinate the COVID-19 response. The study argues that a cautious and gradual reopening of the borders should be considered and adopted by member states of ECOWAS while the quality of disease surveillance in the region is enhanced and testing capacity is increased. This is in addition to the strict enforcement of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of face masks, and proper hand hygiene in all public spaces. Finally, airlines, domestic and international airports in West Africa should comply strictly with COVID-19 safety protocols as the search for a COVID-19 vaccine continues.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-11-08","11"

In the beginning, it was of zoonotic transmission through direct contact with a local fish market; however, the rapid direct person-to-person transmission was found resulting in a very rapid increase in the number of infected people per day reaching thousands and spreading worldwide. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic [2, 3] .For diagnosis of COVID-19, PCR is used nowadays with a sensitivity reaching 70% and may increase according to the virus load in the specimen either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab and even bronchoalveolar lavage. Also, CBC changes with lymphopenia have been described [4] .The main concern about the rapid spread of the virus leading to an extensive increase in the number of simultaneously infected patients with rapid exhaustion of the health facilities and in extreme cases selecting which patients to treat and give maximum health support based on their theoretical expected outcome. Different studies showed that the CT imaging findings, as viral pneumonia, are sensitive in the diagnosis of COVID positive cases and even may precede the laboratory findings [3, 5] . Hence, it might be beneficial to use the CT findings to provide an objective tool in stratifying the patients to point out patients who will need ICU admission, those who will need mechanical ventilation, and those who have a higher mortality expectancy. Based on this, the current study was performed in order to study the spectrum of CT imaging findings in 120 COVID-19 proven patients at their first presentation, to classify these findings to typical and atypical findings, and to correlate these findings and the clinical findings with the patients' outcome and its impact on health system namely the need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.The current retrospective study was approved by the Ethical Committee of our university hospital. We included 120 COVID-19 positive cases from May 2020 to July 2020 and revised their clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.The inclusion criteria included:1. Patients with proven diagnosis of COVID-19 clinically and with positive PCR. 2. Available CT examination (first CT at the time of presentation).The exclusion criteria included: Non-contrast CT of the chest at first presentation and later as clinically indicated.All CT examinations were done using Siemens Perspective 64-slices scanner. The CT protocol was as follows: axial scans craniocaudal direction, breath-hold at full inspiration with tube voltage 130 kV, mAs 102, slice thickness 1 mm, pitch 1.2, and rotation time 0.6 s. The mediastinal and lung windows were assessed using the dedicated workstation.All examinations were assessed by two radiologists with more than 17 and 20 years of experience in CT chest in consensus. Owing to the current pandemic of the known clinical context, the readers could not be blinded to the fact that the patients might be COVID-19 positive. However, they were blinded to the fact that all presented images were from proven COVID-19 positive patients and not due to other causes of pneumonia. The readers were only informed about the clinical presentation of the patients with COVID-19 as one of the possible diagnoses. The radiologists were requested to assess the images regarding the following parameters:Ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving lesions, and their distribution at both lungs. (As signs of severity in CT depends on degree or percent of the affected lung parenchyma) Associated subpleural thickening, pulmonary nodules, cavitary lesions, consolidation whether homogenous or heterogeneous on top of groundglass densities. Pleural effusion (as the presence of pleural effusion indicates more severe condition, not only parenchymal affection and usually has an impact on patient's clinical findings and progression of dyspnea), mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy.We studied the association between the CT features and clinical data among our cases, its impact on the health system including ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. In addition, typical and atypical CT findings were correlated with the clinical presentation of the patients.Frequencies (percent) and means (± SD) were used to summarize categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Associations were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square tests. Univariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of outcome and other variables: age, gender, clinical picture as shortness of breath, tachypnea and headache, the need for ventilation, and severe radiological signs. The interaction between outcome status and different independent variables in relation to the dependent variable was tested. Backward binary logistic regression was used to select statistically significant variables, and possible confounding factors associated with outcome were included in the final model. Analyses were done by the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 24). A p value <0.05 level was used as the cut-off value for statistical significance.Among the studied 120 patients, 71 were males (59.2%) and 49 were females (40.8%) with mean age 47.2 ± 14.4 years (range 12.0-76.0 years).All 120 COVID-19 had positive PCR results and lymphopenia (lymphocytes <10% of the total leukocytic count) was found in 112 cases (93.3%).The main presentation among the studied cases was fever (temperature > 37.5 at the time of examination or history of fever during the past 48 h) as it was found in 112 patients followed by dry cough in 108 patients and malaise in 35 patients. Twenty-five patients were admitted to the ICU without the need for mechanical ventilation; 13 patients presented with severe clinical symptoms progressed to ARDS-like and have been admitted to the ICU and placed on a ventilator ( Table 1) . The final outcome was complete recovery in 113 cases and death in 7 cases.The patients who died were older (55.6 ± 23.3 years old) than those who recovered (46.7 ± 13.6 years old) and this age difference was statistically significant, (p = 0.05).Regarding the clinical picture, more than half of patients who died (57.1%) suffered from shortness of breath or tachypnea compared with a small percent among those who recovered (6.2 and 2.7%, respectively) with a highly statistically significant association. Moreover, 71.4% of those who died suffered from headache compared with only 12.4% among recovered, (p = <0.001) ( Table 2) .The radiological signs among the studied cases are summarized in Table 3 .The typical CT findings were peripheral bilateral ground-glass opacities, multilobar affection, while the atypical CT findings including, peripheral and central multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities, consolidation, white lung, single-lobar affection, presence of pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ( Table 4 ).The interpretation of the studied cases by the reading radiologists revealed 86 cases were diagnosed radiologically as COVID-19 by classic typical bilateral GGO (Fig. 1 ). In the remaining 34 cases with nonclassic atypical CT findings, the differential diagnosis of other causes of chest infection was included in addition to COVID-19. Correlation between CT severity signs and the clinical presentation of the patients From our cases, we found a strong association with a statistically significant difference between the presence of multiple multilobar peripheral GGO, white lung, and pleural effusion in CT and the need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation (Figs. 2, 3, 4) . Tables 5 and 6 summarize the correlation between the clinical and CT features and the need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.None of the CT imaging features correlated significantly with patients' death (all p > 0.05) suggesting that even patients with severe imaging features at first presentation might not necessarily die (Table 7) .The COVID-19 pandemic of atypical pneumonia leads to health emergency problems all over the world which is more or less similar to SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012; all these outbreaks occurred due to virus belonging to the family coronaviridae [6] . Fever and cough were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The incidence of other upper and severe lower respiratory tract symptoms as well as headache was ranging between 10 and 20%. Diarrhea occurred infrequently and was not encountered in our patient collective at first presentation. Malaise approached 30% of our patients. Thirteen out of 120 patients required mechanical ventilation. This may be consistent with several previous studies documenting that the main target cells for the virus are those located in the lower respiratory tract [7] . Early studies showed that the main diagnostic CT imaging features of COVID-19 are bilateral multilobar peripheral GGO [6, 8] . The presence of peripheral and central GGO, as well as single lobe affection, consolidation, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, are not matching with COVID-19; however, later on, after an increased number of diseased cases worldwide was reported, these CT imaging features had been found in some COVID-19 positive patients although it is uncommon [2, 9] . In the current study, we also confirmed that peripheral GGO scattered at both lungs is the most common finding as it was found in 83 cases (74.7%) while the other findings were uncommonly found in a much smaller number of cases. This also was in agreement with Adam et al. [3] and Yan et al. [5] Song et al. [2] reported that GGO mainly of peripheral distribution in multilobes is the most common imaging feature in COVID-19 positive patients and may be associated with interlobar and interlobular thickening, even consolidation may be present in less frequency.The results of our cases were similar to these findings.In clinically severe cases, we detected the presence of multiple bilateral central and peripheral GGO in 20 cases, white lung in eight cases, and pleural effusion in six cases. Zu et al. [4] also described these findings as imaging features in severely affected patients. Also, we reported a few cases with pleural effusion (six cases) and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (eight cases) which was also confirmed as atypical findings in other studies [5] . From the results of our cases, we noticed the added value of CT chest imaging with clinical data to diagnose COVID-19 patients and this is helpful in situations such as shortage of test kits or false-negative results; this was in agreement with Wenjing et al. [10] who also concluded the importance of imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.After increasing the number of affected patients worldwide and unfortunately the health systems in most countries cannot cope with this pandemic, most of the studies should look for the impact of the disease course on the outcome and how clinical and radiological data can predict this. In our study, we detected a higher death rate among elderly patients with a statistically significant difference and this was a coincidence with Yang et al. [11] , Hani et al. [12] , Li et al. [13] , and Carlos et al. [14] We detected an association between the presence of multiple multilobar peripheral GGO, white lung, and pleural effusion in CT and the need for mechanical ventilation as the results showed three quarters (75%) of those who showed white lung on the radiological imaging needed ventilation compared with only 6.3% among those without white lung and this association was highly statistically significant, (p = <0.001). Half of the patients with pleural effusion experienced shortness of breath or needed ventilation compared with a small percent among those without pleural effusion (7.0 and 8.8%, respectively) and these associations were statistically significant. Also, a significantly higher percentage of patients with pleural effusion (33.3%) suffered from tachypnea compared with only 4.4% among those without (p = 0.003). This was matching with Hani et al. [12] , Li et al. [15] , Peijie et al. [16] Obviously, tachypnea, shortness of breath, and the requirement of mechanical ventilation were specifically associated with the studied patients with the development of pleural effusion. Peijie et al. [16] and Zhao et al. [17] documented that pleural effusion was much more prevalent in cases who were considered medical emergency than those who were not. The clinical prognosis was poor in cases suffering from tachypnea, shortness of breath, and headache and in the higher age group. Death as an outcome was highly associated with such clinical features. However, tachypnea was the only clinical feature that may be considered a predicting factor for death. So, tachypnea may be considered bad prognostic factors in the COVID-19 disease course.Limitations of the current study included the retrospective nature of the study in addition to the fact that we only included the findings of the CT at first presentation with the possibility that some patients might present themselves at different stages of the disease; however, we consider this to be a simulation of real-life situation based on different cultural and personal differences between the patients.Typical CT findings of GGO showing bilateral distribution with no lobar predilection, crazy-paving consolidation in conjunction with suspecting clinico-laboratory data of COVID-19 are highly diagnostic. We should take into consideration the presence of atypical CT findings when the present does not exclude the presence of COVID-19 infection. CT is considered a prognostic tool as there was the association between the presence of multiple multilobar peripheral GGO, white lung and pleural effusion in CT and the need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation; this should help us in the referral of patients according to the health-system resources. Regarding mortality, the only significant clinical features that correlated with the patient's death were age, the presence of shortness of breath, headache, and tachypnea. None of the CT signs including the severe signs of infection in CT correlated with patients' death; this means that even patients with severe signs of a lung infection on the first presentation have a survival chance.

Previous data from similar outbreaks, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] , showed that the community suffered considerable anxiety, depression, and panic, resulting in a significant psychological impact [3] [4] [5] .The mortality of COVID-19 is even higher than previous epidemics inducing profound fear [6, 7] ; mental health reflections can last longer and even have a higher frequency than the epidemic itself [8, 9] . Shortages of masks and health equipment, quarantine, lack of effective treatment, closure of schools and public places, boredom, fear of infection, or death could increase panic. Moreover, it can lead to a feeling of insecurity due to economic and social losses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .Patients with rheumatic diseases-those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's disease, inflammatory myositis, fibromyalgia, or others-are considered at greater risk both due to their chronic illnesses and use of immunosuppressive drugs [15] . They are also facing many issues-drug shortages, difficulties reaching clinics or hospitals, and hazards of physical inactivity staying at home. It is expected that these individuals with chronic diseases will be prone to higher levels of impaired psychology [16] since the COVID-19 tends to hit hardest those with multiple comorbidities [17] . The American College of Rheumatology [ACR] Issues COVID-19 Treatment Guidance for Rheumatic Disease Patients recommended the reduction of the number of health care encounters; laboratory monitoring less frequently, using telehealth, and increasing intervals between intravenous doses and they set the basis for when to start, stop, or reduce medications [18] .A recent public survey conducted in China about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak showed that about a third of participants experienced moderate to severe anxiety and about half experienced moderate to severe psychological impairment [19] . No previous researches studied the psychological impact of COVID-19 on patients with rheumatic diseases in Egypt. This present study represents the first mental health survey conducted in Egypt addressing this vulnerable population. From this point we aimed to assess the impact of pandemic on the attitude, behavior, and mental health of patients with rheumatic disease and to compare them with healthy individuals.This is an Egyptian case-control study, sample size was calculated based on findings from the pilot study prevalence among cases 17% and prevalence among control 40% case to control 1:1. A total of 360 participants were included consecutively in this study and divided into two groups: a patient group composed of 180 patients with rheumatic diseases and a control group composed of 180 healthy individuals. Rheumatic patients and healthy individuals had been recruited from 14 to 29 April 2020. Data were collected via a self-administered structured questionnaire that were delivered as a Google form in Arabic, which were sent to participants via social networks targeting rheumatic patients and healthy individuals, or via emails. The survey was translated into Arabic [mother tongue of Egyptians] and validated by the authors. It took about 5-10 min to be completed. The participants' information is kept anonymous. The translated form is available in the supplemental files. All control subjects were age, sex, socio-economically, and geographically matched with the patients [living allover Egypt those educated enough to use social media and internet]. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed online consent has been obtained graded as a Likert-type scale ""never,"" ""a bit of the time/few times,"" ""most of the time"", and ""always"" based on the question. 6. Eight questions for rheumatic patients only about:contact with the physician, the means and causes of contact and their feeling afterward, their attitude towards immunosuppressive drugs. 7. Six questions for mental health assessment for patients and controls: Mental health was measured by the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale which was derived from the 50-item BSRS [20] . This effective screening instrument has satisfactory reliability and validity and is widely used to identify psychiatric impairment in medical settings and community samples [20] [21] [22] . The scale was translated and back-translated to Arabic language and a pilot study was conducted to test the applicability and the clarity of the scale then changes were made accordingly. The score for each item ranges from 0 to 4 [0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, moderately; 3, quite a bit; and 4, extremely], based on a 5-point Likert-type scale, participants were asked to indicate how much discomfort they experienced that was caused by a particular symptom in the past week [including the current day]. The sum of the scores across the five items represented the total score of the BSRS-5 and ranged from 0 to 20. A total score on the BSRS-5 above 14 may indicate a severe mood disorder. Scores between 10 and 14 may indicate moderate mood disorders, and those between 6 and 9 could indicate mild mood disorders. A cut-off score of ≥ 6 was considered as a BRSR-5 defined psychiatric case [20] .The collected data were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science software [SPSS] [Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.]. Continuous variables with a normal distribution were reported as mean and standard deviation [SD] . Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Quantitative data were evaluated using Independent t test or one-way ANOVA, which were suitable for normally distributed data, while qualitative data were evaluated by chi-square test [χ2] or Fisher's exact test. p values ≤ 0.05* and ≤ 0.001** were considered statistically significant and highly statistically significant, respectively.Socio-demographic and personal characteristics of the studied groups showed that there was no statistically significant difference [p > 0.05] between both groups; ensuring their comparability. (Table 1) .On comparing attitude and behavior toward COVID-19 pandemic among the studied groups, no statistically significant difference [p > 0.05] was found between patients and the control group regarding their belief that staying at home protects them from infection, healthy diet and exercises help, and frequent washing hands, while there was a statistically significant difference [p ≤ 0.05] between both groups regarding their behavior regarding washing hands, going outdoors, wearing masks and gloves outdoors, and staying in their room (Table  2) .Mental health comparison among the studied groups showed that no statistically significant difference [p > 0.05] was found between the patients and control groups regarding anxiety and depression, while there was a statistically significant difference [p ≤ 0.05] between both groups regarding feeling angry/irritated, inferior, and insomniac. BSRS-5 total score and being defined as a psychiatric case according to BSRS-5 scale was significantly higher in patients (Table 3) .Regarding patients, attitude, and behavior towards their illness, medications, and medical advice, the highest proportion of them answered that they felt at higher risk and they felt no change in their disease activity; however, they believed that fear may increase disease activity. They contacted their physicians less than usual, mainly using the internet. They mainly asked for medication advice and most of them still felt non-assured after communication. Most of them had no fears about drugs, did not reduce doses/stop drugs, and many experienced drug shortages (Table 4) .On assessing the relationship between different parameters and patients' mental health degree, there was no statistically significant association [p > 0.05] between the degree of impaired mental health and all studied parameters except for ""feeling at risk more than other"" where there was a statistically significant association [p ≤ 0.05] where their feeling of ""being at risk"" was associated with a higher degree of impaired mental health [BSRS-5 ≥ 6] (Tables 5 and 6) .Comparison between patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other rheumatic diseases regarding different parameters showed that there was a statistically significant difference [p ≤ 0.05] between them as regards age, sex, their belief that a healthy diet and exercises may help, frequency of going outdoors, BSRS-5 total score, being at risk, their feeling after communication, stopping drugs and experiencing drug shortages. RA patients had higher mean age and a higher percent of the male sex, they believe that a healthy diet and exercises can help, they go out only for necessities, they feel ""maybe/not at risk"", they feel less/the same anxiety and fear after communicating with their physicians, they are less adherent to some drugs and experience more drug shortages. SLE patients had a higher percentage of the female sex, they believe a healthy diet and exercises ""maybe/not help,"" mostly ""never go outdoors,"" they feel ""yes at risk,"" feel more/the same anxiety, and fear after communication, and most do not stop drugs. Patients with other rheumatic diseases had higher mean BSRS-5 a total score and mostly ""go outdoors freely any time,"" feel ""not at risk,"" and experienced no drug shortage. Also, comparing between patients with RA and SLE only, a statistically significant difference [p ≤ 0.05] was found among them as regards some parameters. RA patients had higher mean age, lower mean BSRS-5 total score, and a higher percentage of the male sex, ""yes healthy diet and exercises help,"" feel ""not at all/quite a bit inferiority,"" feel ""maybe/not at risk,"" feel less anxiety and fear after communication, and stopped drugs more often.COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives in many different aspects. The fact that neither vaccine nor confirmed effective treatment has been developed has made the Coronavirus a huge stressor and a fearful threat to many individuals [23] . With COVID-19, the social isolation, quarantine, and loneliness in addition to fear of infection or death were the main factors impacting not only those infected with COVID but also the general population. The resulting fears, although considered a usual response to this major threatening event, when chronic and profound becomes harmful and may lead to psychiatric illness [24, 25] .Health professionals, including doctors and nurses, being the most at risk, suffered impaired mental health [26, 27] . Special population groups who are considered more vulnerable to infection-old age, immunecompromised, and patients with chronic illnesses-frequently complained of considerable psychological problems [7] . The ""double crush"" of having a chronic illness and receiving immunosuppressive drugs makes patients with rheumatic diseases among these groups more vulnerable to infection and thus impaired mental health.Most patients were non-smokers and the majority had no previous lung affection. However, smokers and those with lung affection did not seem to have a different attitude or behavior regarding being at a greater risk, most probably due to the fact that most patients with chronic diseases had comparable degrees of anxiety. When comparing the attitude and behavior towards COVID among the studied groups, no statistically significant difference was found between cases and control group regarding their attitude towards staying at home, the value of a healthy diet and exercises and washing hands; while there was a statistically significant difference between both groups regarding going outdoors, also, wearing masks and gloves outdoors, where patients seemed to be more selfprotecting. Self-isolation in their room most of the time was mostly practiced by patients more than controls.Previous studies have shown that mental health disorders can last longer than the epidemic itself [8, 9] . Individuals with chronic illnesses are even more exposed to psychological impairment [16, 17] . Mental health comparison among the studied groups using the BSRS showed that there was a statistically significant difference between both groups regarding ""feeling angry/irritated,"" ""feeling inferior to others,"" insomnia, and regarding the BSRS total score. Out of all patients, 85.6% were defined as a psychiatric case. Their belief of ""being at risk"" was associated with a higher degree of impaired mental health [BSRS-5 ≥ 6]. These distress reactions [feeling angry, irritable, and disturbed sleep] being more prominent in cases denote fear and panic. About 20% were ""extremely"" angry and agitated. Moreover, cases were feeling more inferior, which is most probably related to their chronic illness. Ironically, no significant difference was found regarding anxiety and depression between cases and controls denoting that the general population during the pandemic felt similar degrees of anxiety and depression. Fear of infection or death raises anxiety levels in healthy individuals as well, quarantine and social isolation increased depression in both groups similarly. Both patients and healthy feared mostly losing their families and beloved ones.Regarding the attitude and behavior of the cases towards medications; the highest proportion of them answered that they have no fear of drugs, they did not reduce doses, nor did they stop any of their drugs. Those who stopped drugs may have had financial issues or difficulty finding medications. This is a good positive attitude consistent with the EULAR guidelines regarding medications, representing their awareness of the necessity of continuing their medications to avoid flares [28] . Moreover, many of them did not experience any increase in their disease activity, although many believed that fear itself may cause a flare. The most frequent cause to contact their physician was medication advice rather than consultation due to pain and disease activity. The increased usage of antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19 patients caused a decline in their availability in pharmacies, highlighting the harm to patients caused by medications being purchased in Egypt without medical prescription [29] . For some patients, this might be an essential treatment especially for those with SLE, and many had to communicate with their physicians for substitutes. During the pandemic, most of the patients visited their physicians less than usual to minimize going outdoors to healthcare facilities; they mostly contacted them using telehealth.Regarding the comparison between patients with RA, SLE, and other rheumatic diseases, RA patients had higher mean age and a higher percent of the male sex, while SLE patients were mostly younger females. Most RA patients believe that a healthy diet and exercise can help combat infection while SLE patients are less confident about that. RA patients only go out for necessities while most SLE patients never go outdoors as they felt that they are at risk more than other patients. They even feel more/the-same anxiety and fear after communicating with their physicians. Most of SLE patients are adherent to their drugs more than other patients. We conclude that although rheumatologists succeeded to convince their patients to stick to their medications, they failed to relieve their anxiety and fear which may be augmented by media, following numbers of those COVIDinfected and dead. About 48% depended on social media as a source of information about COVID-19. Both RA patients and SLE patients experienced drug shortages. Most patients with other rheumatic diseases go outdoors more freely, they do not feel great that they are at a higher risk like SLE patients nor do they significantly complain of drug shortages as they are less dependent on anti-malarials unlike SLE patients.Regarding their mental status RA patients had significantly lower mean BSRS-5 total score and felt less inferiority than SLE patients. No significant difference was found in patients with different diseases regarding anxiety and depression. Although cases were significantly different regarding anger and insomnia compared to controls, there were no differences comparing patients with different disease categories.The limitations of our study were the inability to assess the same patients' psychological status just before the hit of coronavirus, an unexpected event, which would have been more informative about the direct impact of COVID-19 pandemic isolated from the effect of their chronic illnesses which had been also accused to affect mental health [30, 31] . The finding that mental health status was more affected by their belief of ""being at risk"" of infection was a clear indicator of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. The presented data are preliminary data that could be obtained during the quarantine period and we are planning for future studies to test behavioral changes on rheumatic patients that had suffered from COVID-19 infection. Another limitation is recruiting patients who use social media with no inclusion of patients not using it as illiterate patients and patients from Patients with rheumatic diseases show comparable degrees of anxiety and depression to healthy individuals, but higher distress symptoms and panic in the form of anger, irritability, and insomnia. They have a significantly higher sense of inferiority and a higher total BSRS compared to controls. SLE patients show more adherence to their medications and stay mostly at home as a reflection of feeling more vulnerable. Moreover, they have higher degrees of psychological affection in the form of higher BSRS scores. Abandoning drug purchasing without medical prescription is necessary in Egypt to protect our patients from unnecessary drug shortages adding to their fear and anxiety. Mental health should be addressed in the same manner we deal with the infectious disease itself, being of no less importance. Mental health professionals, social workers, and support groups need to provide psychological support to vulnerable populations, including patients with rheumatic diseases.Rheumatologists should be aware of the need for psychiatric consultation for their patients whenever necessary.","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-12","11"

It is prevalent throughout the life-cycle stages for women -infancy, girlhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. The impact of GBV goes beyond the suffering of survivors and their families, and it is estimated that the cost to the economy can go up to 3.7% of some countries' GDP. 3 It affects girls and women's self-esteem and prevents them from realizing their full rights as human beings and as equal citizens. Violence against girls and women undermines countries' achievements of at least the first six of the eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals (Solotaroff and Pande, 2014) . Women and girls experience violence in a variety of different contexts, within family, the community and broader society. Advancement in technology has added cyberviolence against women as another channel for GBV.Pre- COVID-19 Statistics (World Bank, 2019) :• • 35% of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. • • Globally, 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner.• • Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.Almost 18% of women and girls aged 15-49 years who have ever been in a relationship have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), 2018).In 2017, 87,000 women were intentionally killed. The majority of these killings were committed by an intimate partner or a family member (UN Women, 2020a).• Less than 40% of women who experience violence report it; most of those who do, seek help from a family or a friend; less than 10% of women who seek help go to the police (UN Women, 2020a). • • 200 million women have experienced female genital mutilation/cutting. • • Before COVID-19, 1 in 10 women in the European Union reported having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15, including having received unwanted, offensive and sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites. • • According to a November 2016 survey by the All-China Women's Federation, 30% of married Chinese women had experienced some form of domestic violence (Allen-Ebrahimian, 2020). • • Global cost of violence against women and girls, prior to the pandemic, stood at US$1.5trillion, approximately 2% of global domestic product (UN Women, 2020a , 2020b .Many studies have shown that children growing up with violence are more likely to become perpetrators of violence in the future or survivors of GBV.A study on South Asia shows concerning statistics (Solotaroff and Pande, 2014) :• • South Asia has the highest levels of excess female child mortality among world regions.Within South Asia, India has the greatest excess female child mortality of all countries for which data are available; Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan also show high levels. Since the early 1990s, however, excess female child mortality has declined in Nepal and Sri Lanka and dramatically in Bangladesh. Excess female child mortality in India, however, has remained firmly and largely unchanged. • • South Asia also has the highest rate of child marriage in the world, with 46% of girls married by age 18. In Bangladesh, more than 40% of girls are married by age 15. • • Demographic Health Surveys data from countries whose surveys include questions about physical domestic violence show that almost one-half of surveyed married women in Bangladesh, one-third in India and one-quarter or more in Nepal and Pakistan report physical spousal violence. • • In spite of all eight countries in South Asia having specific constitutional provisions that seek to address gender equality and having signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, women and girls are still seen as men's property, they are not seen as equal human beings with equal rights as men and boys.The social and economic stress brought by COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing toxic social norms and gender inequality. At the time when half of the world population was in lockdown due to COVID-19, the number of women and girls between ages of 15 and 49 who had been subjected to sexual and/or physical violence perpetrated by an intimate partner (GBV) was no less than 243 million (UN Women, 2020a). Many countries from developing and developed economies reported an escalation of GBV during the lockdown; France reported an increase of 30% of domestic violence cases since the lockdown on March 17; Cyprus and Singapore reported an increase in helpline calls by 30% and 33%, respectively, in Argentina emergency calls for domestic violence cases increased by 25% since the beginning of the lockdown; in Canada, Germany, Spain, the UK and the USA, government authorities, women's rights activists and civil society partners have indicated increasing reports of domestic violence during the crisis, and/or increased demand for emergency shelter (UN Women, 2020a). According to UN Women (2020a) essential services have experienced increased pressure from the escalation in GBV; In Australia, A Women's Safety New South Wales survey revealed that 40% of frontline workers reported requests for help by survivors, and 70% reported that the cases received have increased in their level of complexity during the COVID-19 outbreak. There have been increased reports of both physical and verbal attacks on healthcare workers in China, Italy and Singapore (UN Women, 2020a). Simonovic of the Human Rights Watch identified an intersection of marginalization and discrimination making certain groups of women more susceptible to GBV, namely, domestic workers; older women; women with disabilities, including in institutional settings; women without access to technology; women facing overlapping discrimination or inequalities; and women facing housing precarity and violence (Simonovic, 2020) :• • The added burden for domestic workers varies from exclusion from the safety nets that protect other frontline workers to increased workload with children at the house and employers working from home. In some instances, emotional abuse with no recourse to the perpetrator. • • Older women are exposed to abuse by partners, adult children, caregivers and/or other family with whom they live. In spite of the vulnerability of older women, some governments do not consistently collect comprehensive data on violence against older women. lockdowns has meant that fewer people, especially family members, are able to spot abuse and neglect, including GBV, against women and girls in these facilities. • • The significant digital gender divide globally was further exposed by the pandemic. According to the International Telecommunications Union, in 2019, 48% of women used the internet globally compared to 58% of men; the gap grew between 2013 and 2019 in Arab states, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. The UN Broadband Commission in a study across 10 countries in Africa, Asia and South America found women were 30%-50% less likely than men to use the internet to participate in public life. Mobile phones are the primary means of accessing the internet in low-and middle-income countries. According to the GSMA, a global network of mobile operators, 48% of women in these countries use mobile internet; they estimate that a gender gap of 23% persists, representing 313 million fewer women using mobile internet than men. Lack of access to connectivity deprives women the ability to work from home and access critical services like survivor support groups, counselling, health information (including sexual and reproductive health), and other online resources that can be critical lifelines to women experiencing GBV during the lockdown. Those women with digital access have other challenges: an escalation of online GBV, inhibiting or preventing women internet access. Targeted groups include young women, women belonging to ethnic or racial minorities; Indigenous women; lesbian, bisexual and transgender women; women with disabilities; women human rights defenders, journalists; bloggers; women from marginalized groups; and those facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination may be particularly and acutely effected by online GBV. According to UN Women (2020a) before COVID-19, 1 in 10 women in European Union reported having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15. Internet shutdown by some governments poses another challenge, especially for women because of power differential within societies. Quite a few governments use internet shut down as a form of censorship, and these include Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan. Such shutdowns violate multiple rights and can be deadly during a crisis like COVID-19. • • Women with intersecting discriminations and/or inequalities are more vulnerable. In many countries, women from already marginalized communities find themselves on the frontline as essential workers, in more economic precarity as informal workers, or facing unaddressed institutional racism and health disparities. This includes the so-called BAME community in the UK, which stands for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, a term that is rejected by some. Migrant and BAME women face exclusion at different levels including language, where only English is used to communicate important information, to lack of women shelters for migrant and BAME women. As an example, as of May 2019, Women's Aid found that there were only 418 dedicated shelter spaces across England for BAME women, 4 dedicated spaces for women over 45, 12 for women with learning disabilities, and none for deaf women. Migrant women in the UK are in a more precarious situation with abusers using their status to prevent them from seeking help; those on visas such as spousal or fiancé visas have 'no recourse to public funds' under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, making them ineligible for most government benefits. In Mexico, the government cut the budget by 75% for Casas de la Mujer Indigena (Indigenous Women's Centre), which service rural and Indigenous areas of Mexico, forcing many of the centers to close leaving rural Indigenous women with nowhere to go. A survey of more than 3000 adults in Colombia found that while nearly 1 in 3 women reported experiencing violence in the home during the pandemic, a slightly higher percentage of healthcare workers did. What is more concerning is that, 45% of people who identify as gender non-conforming experienced violence.Globally women tend to take on a disproportionate share of the caregiving for children unable to attend day-care, preschool or school due to COVID-19 taking care of the elders amongst other unpaid essential work. This compromises time left for women to participate in income-generating activities.Other challenges are based on gender discriminatory legislation, for instance, in countries where inheritance laws discriminate against women and girls or where same-sex partnerships are not legally recognized, the death of a spouse or father from COVID-19 could have gendered impacts on women, girls and people in same-sex relationships who may lose access to the deceased's estate, as well as their share of the marital property or inheritance. According to the Mor (2018) , out of 161 countries surveyed, only 37 had specific laws granting equal rights for men and women to own, use and control land. Extending land rights and ownership to women, in her view, is one of the prerequisites for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Quite a few countries had challenges with places of shelter for displaced GBV survivors, prior to the pandemic. The challenge was exacerbated with the escalation of violence against women. Crises exacerbate existing inequalities; this was learnt from the Ebola and the Zika health crises. Women are disproportionately responsible for unpaid work, informal and low-paying jobs with less security. Job losses for vulnerable women who are in abusive relationships will make it difficult for them to escape. Some pay the ultimate price, killed by an intimate partner.GBV is complex in its causality and requires a multiprong and multi-stakeholder solution.Gender inequality is one of the main drivers of GBV. Inequality causes harm to its victims and society at large. Addressing this human right violations is the first step to protect society from the two pandemics, health crises and GBV. Economies that do not treat the majority of its citizens as equal citizens, women and girls, deprive all society prosperity and human dignity. Governments have to use policy and funds allocation to empower women economically, ensure they have equal access to land, quality education, health, proper sanitation and safety.Gender budgeting is an initiative to use fiscal policy and administration to address gender inequality and women's advancement. The Council of Europe defines gender budgeting as a 'genderbased assessment of budgets incorporating a gender perspective at all levels of the budgetary process and restructuring revenues and expenditures in order to promote gender equality'. The 'Beijing Platform for Action', adopted in 1995 at the Fourth International Conference for Women, explicitly called for gender budgeting as one way of securing equality between men and women. According to Stotsky et al. (2016) , Sub-Saharan African countries were among the earliest countries in the world to adopt gender budgeting with mixed success. South Africa was the first adopter in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some success has been achieved by South Africa, Rwanda and Uganda. Leadership by the finance ministry and input from other stakeholders, namely nongovernmental organizations and donors, are some of the key success factors. The importance of leadership was demonstrated with the waning of gender budgeting efforts in South Africa with changes in parliamentarians (Stotsky et al., 2016) .• • Allocation of additional resources, including evidence-based measures, to address violence against women and girls in COVID-19 national response plans; • • Strengthen services for women who experience violence during COVID-19;• • Build capacity of key services to improve quality of response;• • Put women at the centre of policy change, solutions and recovery;• • Ensure sex-disaggregated data are collected to understand the impact of COVID-19 on violence against women and girls to inform the response; and Integration of GBV prevention into women's socio-economic empowerment initiatives.Civil society has a major role to play, building strong advocacy and awareness about the GBV scourge. Advocacy work should include bringing all stakeholders together, sensitizing and engaging the private sector on ways to identify and respond to GBV, addressing gender inequality; partnership with media and faith-based leaders for challenging gender stereotypes and toxic masculinity; engage with law enforcement to ensure safety for women and girls. The messaging should be inclusive in terms of language and accessible in terms of media channels used to ensure reaching all vulnerable groups. Collaboration among women organizations, men's organizations and disability organizations will give birth to a platform where inclusive solutions are co-created. Different countries have instituted different innovative initiatives to address the increase in gender-based violence; in Spain women are exempt from the lockdown if they experience domestic violence; in Italy prosecutors ruled that perpetrator should leave the family home as opposed to the survivor; in the Canary Islands, Spain women use a code 'Mask-19' to alert the pharmacist of domestic violence, which brings police to offer support. 5South Africa is said to have the highest statistics of GBV in the world, including rape and domestic violence (Onyejekwe, 2004) . In an article on GBV, South Africa's second pandemic (Ellis, 2020) , President Ramaphosa described the femicide and GBV scourge, stating that, one woman is killed every 3 hours. The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown were associated with a spike in GBV and femicide. GBV and femicide are twin pandemics to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the democratically elected government took over in 1994, women represented less than 2% of parliamentarians (20-Year Review SA 1994 -2014 . Targeted interventions and policy reforms were introduced intended to achieve gender equality. Policies to protect women rights like The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act; The Employment Equity Act of 1998 to facilitate equity in access to formal employment for women across race; The National Crime Prevention Strategy of 1996 making violence against women and children a national priority are amongst many other women-friendly policies. In spite of these initiatives, GBV and femicide remain very high in South Africa. In 2018, when President Cyril Ramaphosa had just assumed office, there was an outcry at the escalation of femicide and violence against women and children. Local women groups and some men groups staged a protest, which was led by the #Totalshutdown Movement. The response was a Presidential Summit where government, civil society and non-governmental organizations came together to strategize on ways to eradicate violence against women. The product was the setting up of the Interim Steering Committee on GBV and Femicide (ISC-GBVF) (2020), which oversaw the development of the Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) with an implementation period of six months and total budget allocation of R1.6 billion. The ERAP seeks to mobilize all sectors of society against GBV and to guide the coordination of the national effort. The plan addresses five key intervention areas.Five key intervention areas: (International Steering Committee-GBVF, 2020) • • Access to justice for victims and survivors;• • Change norms and behaviour through high-level prevention efforts;• • Urgently respond to victims and survivors of GBV;• • Strengthen accountability and architecture to respond to the scourge of GBVF adequately; and • • Prioritize interventions that facilitate economic opportunities for addressing women's economic vulnerability.This initiative was inclusive with collaboration across government departments and civil society. Each area of intervention has human and capital resources committed. The ERAP was delivered in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eradication of GBV and femicide goes hand-in-hand with eradication of poverty and inequality. In order to achieve the desired change, commitment from all stakeholders and leadership are key.GBV and COVID-19 are twin pandemics in South Africa and many other countries to varying degrees. Vulnerable groups, especially women, bear the brunt of health crises and/or any conflict. The empowerment of women, especially those with co-existing social identities of disadvantage, namely race, social class, ageism, disability and sexual orientation, is key for economic prosperity of countries. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder, to all countries, for the need to eradicate inequality. It was a reminder to humankind our interconnectedness. It is hoped that we never go back to the pre-COVID anomaly.The author(s) declares that there is no conflict of interest.The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.

The pandemic saw the growth of the tourism industry revised downwards, and it is estimated that 75 million jobs have been lost following the suspension of international travel by March 2020 [3] . It is further estimated that the industry is likely to lose more than US$2.1 trillion in revenue [3] due to the closure of national borders and lockdowns. Therefore, the impacts of COVID-19 on destinations that overly rely on tourism are devastating.Though COVID- 19 is not yet contained, countries including Southern African countries are easing the lockdown through the opening of national borders to restart international travel. The easing of restrictions has been necessitated by business and political voices that are pushing for the opening of economies as soon as possible [4] . In anticipation of the resumption of travel, destinations developed tourism recovery strategies for an industry that contributes much to the gross domestic product (GDP) of most developing economies. Zimbabwe launched its tourism recovery strategy in August 2020 intending to promote domestic tourism as a strategic option and means of building destination resilience.Domestic tourism promotion as a recovery strategy is not new in literature. It has been a default response in several destinations during crises in countries like Kenya, following post-election violence in 2008, and Malaysia during the Asian financial crisis1997/98 [5] . Though extant research has evaluated the vulnerability of destinations following natural disasters [6] , research focusing on the promotion of domestic tourism as a destination recovery and resilience building strategy during pandemics in destinations with prolonged political and economic crises like Zimbabwe is limited. Understanding the sustainability of promoting domestic tourism as an alternative following the decline of international tourism demand due to the impacts of COVID-19 is required. Globally, due to COVID-19, the tourism industry is confronted with severe demand and supply challenges. These challenges vary from one country to another. Generally, the aspects of perceived health, social and psychological risks top demand challenges, while the supply side is confronted with challenges including deficits, low occupancies, job losses, company liquidation, and human capital depletion [1, 2, 7] . Based on this, the objective of this study is to examine the sustainability of using domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience building strategy using both demand and supply-side views in a destination with ongoing political and economic challenges.Tourism is a sensitive industry [8] , especially to disasters and crises [9] . Due to the growing amount of disasters, literature discussing disasters is also growing [2] . It has been established that natural disasters do not result in permanent effects on tourism compared to the effects of incidents like violence and terrorism [10] . Disasters and crises are terms that are often used interchangeably in the literature, though fundamental differences exist [11] [12] [13] . On the one hand, a crisis is a disruptive event or outcome occurring within a system and has the potential to threaten the system's [14] . Following the contested land reform programme, political and economic crises, have been a common occurrence in Zimbabwe [8] . These crises threatened the operations of tourism, resulting in dwindling arrivals and income [8] . On the other hand, a disaster is an event that confronts a system with unpredictable catastrophic changes over which a system has no control [13] . Thus, crises have an internal outlook that makes them more manageable, while disasters are external and less predictable [15] .It is not clear in literature if COVID-19 is a disaster or crisis. Zenker and Kock [2] argue that it is either a disaster or crisis, depending on the lenses one uses to analyse its impacts. While the classification of COVID-19 is contestable, it is beyond the scope of this study. However, its categorisation is critical to better our understanding of the past [2] and improve the formulation of tourism recovery and resilience strategies postpandemic. Though COVID-19 is new, several of its aspects have been experienced and affected travel and tourism [16, 17] . COVID-19 in this study is treated as a unique disaster based on its scale and impacts on the global economy. COVID-19 is a natural disaster that degenerated into a socio-political, tourism and economic crisis [2] .The impacts of COVID-19 on the tourism industry globally are yet to be fully developed and measured [18] . However, what is clear is that following the closure of borders, the demand for international tourism plummeted [1] . The recovery of global tourism, regardless of the type of the crisis, depends mostly on the scale, type, and size of the crisis [15] . With no vaccine in sight, it appears that the pandemic will be around for a long-time, with some countries already been hit by a second wave. Therefore, the tourism recovery efforts must be formulated based on dealing with an ongoing pandemic. This is being reflected in how countries are opening their economies and national borders. Despite an increased stream of literature investigating disasters and crises in tourism, these studies are limited in terms of scope and depth [6, 19] , and the promotion of domestic tourism as a means of recovery and resilience building, is hardly discussed. Furthermore, though the focus of most studies has been post-crisis/disasters, they have not dealt with a pandemic with socio-economic impacts that are so devastating like COVID-19. Thus, the understanding of the role that domestic tourism promotion plays in helping destinations with ongoing crises and negative reputations reduce vulnerability and building resilience is critical.Debate on what constitutes resilience is ongoing [20] , suggesting that it is another elusive term in tourism research. Resilience is an essential construct in disaster and crises management research because it provides destination managers with the means of enhancing capacity to adapt and deal with changes [21, 22] . Though there is a lack of universal measurement, resilience has been approached using three significant perspectives: engineering, ecological and adaptive perspectives [23] [24] [25] . Resilience from an engineering perspective measures how rapid a system can return to its normal state. In contrast, the ecological view measures resilience using the system's ability to absorb the impacts of disruption without altering its identity, functions, and structure [25] . Adaptive resilience refers to the systems' ability to experience the impacts of changes without losing the ability to manage its resources. Thus, in a destination context, resilience is concerned with how quick the destination can return to its previous normal conditions following a shock [25] , such as COVID-19. Adaptive destinations can adjust to, learn from, and manage changes [26] . Applying adaptive resilience thinking during disasters and crises provides ""great utility, namely, the ability to react to external stimuli and modify behaviour accordingly"" [27 pp. 4 ]. COVID-19 presents an opportunity for the promotion of domestic tourism to destinations such as Zimbabwe that relies heavily on international tourism. Whether this strategy could prove to be useful to a destination with ongoing crises [8] remains relatively unknown. Thus, the recognition by destinations of vulnerabilities and being able to plan for eventualities is critical tourism recovery and building a resilient destination. Destinations that can adapt are thus considered more resilient and can recover from disasters and crises quicker [28] .The capacity of a tourist destination to respond to pandemics is framed in stages [4] . Despite knowing that tourism is a victim of crises and disasters [27] , the conceptualisation of recovery and resilience building strategies is generally informed from a reactive point. COVID-19 has long-term impacts on both international and domestic tourism. Thus, how destinations with ongoing political and economic crises respond to the pandemic in shaping long-term tourism recovery and resilience building strategies depends on how well-thought and planned the strategies are. Following the decline in international tourism demand, spearheading tourism recovery and enhancing the resilience of the sector through the growth and promotion of domestic tourism is timely and critical, especially for destinations that overly relies on international visitors.The study examines the perceptions of demand and supply participants regarding the promotion of domestic tourism as a post-pandemic recovery and resilience building strategy in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a Southern African tourist destination with several world-class attractions including the Victoria Falls, Hwange National Park, Gonarezhou National, Eastern Highlands and Great Zimbabwe Monuments [29] . International tourism, which is the biggest market to Zimbabwe, has shown some resilience after it was disrupted in 2000 due to the contested elections, violence, and the land reform programme [8, 29] . These pre-COVID crises in Zimbabwe are not new in literature. However, COVID-19 presents a situation which is novel and not much is known regarding this ongoing virus. Based on this, Strauss and Corbin [30] argue that a qualitative methodology is appropriate in cases where newer problems for which nuanced understanding needs to be developed. Thus, a qualitative research approach was employed.Data were collected using online interviews (in English) between May and July 2020. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, online interviews are becoming a standard method of data collection. Online interviews were conducted using Zoom Video Conferencing Platform with both the demand side (domestic tourists) and supply-side (managers from tourism establishments) participants. These interviews were conducted separately. Questions used in the interviews were based on the review of the literature. Demand interviews focused on the perceptions and challenges faced by domestic travellers in Zimbabwe. Supply side interviews focused on the feasibility of using domestic tourism as a means of restarting tourism, challenges of using domestic tourism and adoption of technologies.Thirty demand respondents were approached using WhatsApp messages, where the aims of the study were explained. Twenty participants accepted to participate (66.7% response rate). Demand participants were supposed to have visited major attractions such as the Victoria Falls, Great Zimbabwe and big national parks including Hwange and Gonarezhou in the last three years to participate in the study. 28 managers were initially approached using emails, and 12 accepted to participate in the study (42.8% response rate). Both demand and supply participants were sampled using convenience sampling. Occasional email and WhatsApp reminders were sent to participants. Participants were informed of the content, aims, their rights to anonymity, and withdrawal of participation. Interviews were recorded using the Zoom cloud facility, averaging 20-30 min. Tables 1 and 2 summarises the participants' profiles. Interviews were conducted, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Data analysis started full data transcription, followed by data familiarisation, codes identification, searching, reviewing, and defining themes, and generation of results. Coding was performed manually, through repeated reading of and making notes on interview transcripts.This section discusses the sustainability of using domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience building strategy. The key issues that emerged from the analysis of data are discussed in the following sections.The theme of affordability of tourism products revealed deep-seated challenges that Zimbabwean destination managers need to deal with if the promotion of domestic tourism is to pay off. Using demand analysis, tourism in Zimbabwe is perceived as expensive. Results show that many domestic tourists cannot afford to travel for leisure in Zimbabwe. Thus, demand participants unanimously agree that affordability of tourism products is a critical concern that should be addressed if Zimbabwe wants to pin its tourism recovery using the domestic market as noted below:D7: ""The elite may do that, but I am not sure if they are also ready to support the local industry, as they can visit other destinations. Yes, domestic tourism could work, it might take off, but at an incredibly low pace because we cannot afford their prices now."" D16: ""How could I travel, when I am earning less than USD$30, after working for the whole month.Cost of travel was identified as an inhibitor of domestic travel, thus affecting the success of using domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience building strategy in Zimbabwe. While there was a particular cost-related question in the interview guide, the aspect of the cost of travel as an inhibitor of domestic travel emerged in the answers long before the question was asked and it is illustrated as follows:D8: ""Tourism has a positive relationship with the availability of disposable income. To then say domestic tourism could be a recovery strategy is problematic because if that positive relationship is looked at, it means Zimbabwe must recover first for disposable income to be available. D4: ""Imagine a civil servant who earns less than US$30 and is expected to pay US $150 per night in a decent hotel, what is that prices should be lowered like what South Africa charges"". D15: ""Look at bungee jumping, it attracts a charge of US$120 per jump, rafting US $115, and a helicopter flight US$150 for 12 min. There should be prices tailored for locals so that we also enjoy these attractions"".The aspect of inclusion remained a recurring sub-theme in most demand responses:D2: ""Let us begin with financial inclusion; then affordability for local tourists. We love travelling every holiday we go to kumusha/ekhaya [to the countryside]. We could visit Vic falls or Nyanga if the trips do not burn holes in our pockets. D9: ""Tourism in Zimbabwe was not designed for us domestic clients; it was designed for varungu [international visitors].Willingness to pay in this analysis developed as a factor explaining how the supply participants perceive the viability of recovering tourism and building a resilient destination using domestic tourism in Zimbabwe in the absence of international tourism due to COVID-19. Many supply-side participants note that domestic tourism might not be sustainable, given their unwillingness to pay premium prices:S8: ""The domestic market has many challenges, and key among them is lack of disposable income to support travelling and paying the premium prices we often charge."" S9: ""We are pricing ourselves out of business. I think to entice domestic tourists we should work on the law of numbers. There is more to benefit by charging $20 per night and get lots of people regularly coming than charging $100 and get four customers per night occasionally. I do not know the economics we are using. The food is also expensive."" Moreover, some supply participants' reflections of kickstarting using domestic shows that post-pandemic, it will not deliver desired results, given that its promotion following post-2000 crises has been futile: S6: ""Zimbabwe has always been struggling to stimulate domestic tourism, will it do that after the pandemic, I doubt"". S9: ""Numbers are too little. Of the many millions in Zimbabwe, very few are mobile and resourced (the elite)"" S10: ""This is not the first time we hear the use of domestic tourism, the last twothree years, ZTA has been making noise about this, but with little changes. Even when Zimbabwe said they were looking East, changes in numbers have not been that large, more effort is required"". S11: ""Most Zimbabweans are low-income earners that cannot economically support tourism in Zimbabwe. Furthermore, the economic climate, compounded with COVID-19, makes it significantly worse, and I do not see domestic tourism supporting the revival of the sector, maybe I am too sceptical"".Although the majority supply participants were sceptical, some participants argue that post-pandemic tourism recovery and post-pandemic resilience needs to go beyond the promotion of domestic tourism:S6: ""It is short-term opium. It is too dependent on disposable income."" S7: ""It will help with hotel occupancies here and there, but the value is too low for what this property can go for"". S10: ""As a tourism-dependent country, it may work, but in the long-run, we will not be able to compensate for at least some of the lost income with domestic tourists. S12: ""Domestic tourists take short-term trips, generally, about 1 to 3 days, and this will not be meaningful in short to long term in terms of occupancies"".Zimbabwe is faced with an ongoing economic crisis that stemmed from high inflation, unemployment, drought, and a worsening political climate. Despite that, pre-COVID-19 has been a significant contributor to the country's GDP [8, 29] . The performance of the economy was described by supply as the primary deterrent of using domestic tourism, given the lack of economic fundamentals:S5: ""Even with international tourism pre-COVID, we still have supply challenges that are attributed to a poor performing economy, including limited access, and lack of airline connectivity. The international market has been resilient, but not sure how it will work out for the domestic market."" S8: ""Too much unemployment and high inflation, makes the tourism recovery using domestic tourism largely too ambitious"".Demand views concerning how the performance of the economy affects the use of domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience option were mainly from the fact that many are unemployed, and earnings are meaningless:D7: ""Hatina mabasa (we have no jobs), how then can we travel in such an economy"". D20: ""Hatitambiri baba (we are not earning), so there will not be any leisure to make"".Because of social distancing, the study also asked supply participants if Zimbabwean tourism could adopt information and communication technologies (ICT) including virtual reality (VR). Adoption of technology in this study is established as a theme that explains supply views in circumstances where tourists are unable to fly. Mixed opinions are noted regarding the adoption of ICT in tourism in a distressed destination: S1: ""The use of ICT in the tourism industry is limited but could work if the government creates an enabling environment and stop using the internet as a means of power. Shutting down the internet is bad for business, should we start selling virtual tourism"". S3: ""Virtual maybe somewhere. In Zimbabwe, we are even failing to have virtual meetings. It is embarrassing. Forget about virtual tourism as a strategic response to the impacts of COVID-19"". S5: ""Zimbabwe's ICT infrastructure needs a facelift, and then we can talk about virtual tourism. With internet shutdowns that are always instigated by the authoritarian regime we have now; this might not work"". S9: ""Imagine, selling a virtual reality experience, where people across the world can have an experience of Victoria Falls or Great Zimbabwe through a simulated environment? This can potentially revolutionise the tourism industry, especially now that most people across the world are confined to their homes, in the spirit of maintaining social distance. But then, look, we have much more deep-seated challenges, that might not support the use of ICTs in tourism in Zimbabwe"".This study examines the perceptions of demand and supply participants concerning the use of domestic tourism as a post-pandemic recovery and resilience strategy. The impacts of COVID-19 on tourism are likely to remain for an extended period in the absence of a vaccine, and the sector must be more prepared than it was when the pandemic struck. Post-COVID tourism recovery is likely to be slow and will depend on the recovery of the global economy as well as the risk perceptions of travellers in the absence of pharmaceutical solutions. The recovery of Zimbabwean tourism using domestic tourism is likely to be slowed by four key factors. These factors include the affordability of the tourism product by the domestic market, willingness of domestic tourists to pay, the performance of the economy and adoption of technologies. Each of these themes had several different sub-themes, as presented in Fig. 1 .The following main findings were evident from the analysis of data. Firstly, Zimbabwean tourism is expensive for the market that should be leading the postpandemic tourism recovery and the creation of a resilient destination. It is imperative to highlight that the viability of using domestic tourism as an option for recovery and resilience building of the tourism industry depends on how attractive and affordable the tourism product is. Several demand participants argued that pricing of the tourism product makes it difficult for them to participate in and consume tourism activities. Therefore, destination managers must consider price reductions and other incentives in stimulating the domestic market. Given the negative relationship between the price of tourism products and demand for tourism, recovery and resilience building effort must ensure the aspects of affordability is addressed.Both supply and demand participants agreed that domestic tourism is viewed as something which is beyond the affordability of the domestic market. This challenge has also been identified in studies that involved international tourists, where it was concluded that Zimbabwe is an expensive destination compared to regional competition [8, 29] . Results from demand and supply views show the need for a pricing regulatory framework in Zimbabwe aimed at boosting domestic arrivals in the interim and international arrivals in the long-term. This could help build destination loyalty, which was noted as weak in past studies [8, 29] . The price regulatory framework will also encourage both domestic and international tourists to stay longer than the reported average of 1-2 days at a destination [29] . Failure to address this will result in the destination losing more revenue and market share. This will add to the existing distress in terms of unemployment to the destination.Secondly, the findings show the immediate need for inclusively promoting tourism. Domestic tourists feel that they are excluded in the tourism value chain due to exorbitant prices and the packages that are offered by the supply side. Some supply side participants also indicated that much priority, even in terms of marketing, has always been given to the international market. While efforts are being made to market domestic tourism aggressively, there is a need to develop packages that are tailor-made for the domestic market. Competitive prices must be deliberately pursued as a means of building financial inclusion, and government can play a crucial role in making subsidies available for the sector to charge less for domestic travellers. The pricing policy of Zimbabwe, which favours low volume and high spending visitors should be revised given the changing market dynamics, even for international tourism [8, 29] . Thus, addressing price competitiveness issues for a destination in distress. It is relatively challenging to promote domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience building strategy post-pandemic in a country where citizens have low disposable income, and the services are expensive (see Table 2 ).Thirdly, the supply side is sceptical regarding the contribution of domestic tourism in enabling tourism recovery and resilience in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's pre-COVID-19 economic challenges which have been exacerbated by the pandemic does not promote tourism, especially from the domestic front. Tourism is highly dependent on income, and in the context of Zimbabwe, the domestic tourism market is highly income constrained. While it is recommended in the literature that at home is safer than visiting abroad during crises and disasters [10, 31] , the findings of this study seem to suggest otherwise. Though supply participants lauded the use of domestic tourism as a viable strategy, they were quick to hint that it is a short-term strategy that might not help Zimbabwe to recovery and be a resilient destination given its over-reliance on international travellers [29] . As earlier indicated, there is a need also to market the domestic tourism aggressively given the low priority the destination management organisation has accorded it. Additionally, this aggressive marketing must be supported by ensuring government and insurance schemes provide access to health care away from home. In the context of Zimbabwe, the assurance of insurance schemes and provision of health care away from might be difficult given its underdeveloped health system and a collapsing economy. There is a need for destination managers to increase the recovery rate by promoting destinations to international travellers through a range of tactics including enhancing the image of air travel safety in the long-term.Fourthly, the performance of the Zimbabwean economy remained a recurring response in this study. Macro-economic factors will determine tourism recovery postpandemic, and these fundamentals are not right in Zimbabwe, given the issues of hyperinflation, unemployment, corruption, and rising debt. Supply results showed that Zimbabwe has no capacity for funding the promotion of domestic tourism. Aggressive promotion of domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience strategy requires funding from the government. As part of their tourism recovery efforts, the Swiss and New Zealand governments, for instance, committed USD$42.2 million and USD $256.8 million to fund the promotion of domestic tourism. Currently, there is no known amount committed by the Zimbabwean government towards the promotion of domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience strategy post-pandemic. The success of using domestic tourism as a recovery strategy requires substantial funding in terms of subsidies and incentives. However, the strategy might not bring in results given the pre-COVID-19 current economic challenges that Zimbabwe has been experiencing. Thus, the use of domestic tourism strategy is merely an academic and theoretical one in the empirical context of Zimbabwe. Incentives like price reductions, tax incentives and subsidies are imperative given that domestic tourism is a market that is price sensitive. Subsidies and other forms of cash injections are imperative in keeping the industry functioning; otherwise, unemployment is likely to increase, and further affecting recovery efforts and puts Zimbabwe in deepening economic distress. This will also make it difficult for establishments to charge lower prices in the absence of incentives and subsidies, give higher operational costs in the sector.Domestic tourism is perceived to recover quicker to pre-COVID-19 levels compared to international travel in other contexts. However, for this to happen, there is a need to increase accessibility to domestic attractions. Previous research argued that Zimbabwe is relatively inaccessible due to lack of internal airline connections, heavy police presence on the highways, and bad roads [8, 29] . Therefore, the practical promotion of domestic tourism requires government and other role players to address these supply-side challenges. Lastly, the adoption of technology, in particular robots and artificial intelligence, has been argued for in literature [33, 34] . In the view of the scepticism expressed by supply participants regarding the use of domestic tourism as a means of restoring tourism and building resilience, the possibility of implementing technologies was also explored. Though technology adoption could benefit Zimbabwean tourism, the economy and political players remains critical deterrents. The implementation of robots and other types of technology in travel and tourism needs an enabling infrastructure, which Zimbabwe does not seem to provide. Zimbabwe is one of the countries with oppressive ICT laws and in the past, the internet was permanently shut down [35] , despite the new president promising a different narrative than what was experienced during the Mugabe administration [8] . Stakeholders must come together and create applications that stimulate the experience of visiting Zimbabwe and package them for sale to potential clients around the world.This study contributes to literature in the form of different themes than can be regarded as useful factors in further research. The dominant themes of affordability, the willingness of the domestic market to pay, the performance of the economy and adoption of technologies should be taken as an imperative contribution to theory regarding tourism recovery and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this study is not without limitations. The study was based on a qualitative approach using a conveniently selected sample which may not justify generalisability of the results. Rigorous empirical investigations regarding the promotion of domestic tourism as a recovery and resilience strategy must be conducted. Future studies must also review pre-COVID and post-COVID challenges in promoting domestic tourism as this will provide the destination with an analytical framework that could help develop sustainable recovery and resilience building strategies of the industry. Though several aspects of COVID-19 have been reported in past studies, there is a need for research to provide a more nuanced understanding of the industry responses to a pandemic with wide-ranging impacts, including scale development. The findings of this study are context-specific; thus, themes and challenges argued in this study may not apply in other destinations, even if they have ongoing crises like Zimbabwe.","Zimbabwe","abstract","2020-11-28","11"

A focus on the natural history and transmission characteristics of current little-studied endemic species of hCoV may give insight to the future behaviour of this emergent relative [7] .Using data from a study of 47 households in rural Kenya, we have previously reported baseline data on the occurrence of hCoV [8] and a detailed analysis of reinfection with hCoV-NL63 [9] .In the present study, we investigate the natural history of infection and transmission patterns of three endemic hCoV within these households.A previously described real time multiplex RT-PCR (mPCR) assay with targets for 15 respiratory viruses was used [12] . The target pathogens were human coronavirus (hCoV species (also called types) OC43, NL63 and 229E), RSV A and B, rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza virus (types 1-4), influenza virus (types A, B and C) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). A preliminary screen of the NPS showed the last three virus groups were uncommon during the surveillance period and hence not screened for the remainder of the NPS collections [8] . A specimen with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of ≤35.0 for a specific virus target was considered positive.Type-specific individual hCoV infection episodes were defined as a period with positive mPCR result(s) of the same type with no more than 14 days apart [13] . Episodes where no samples were collected and tested for >7 days before or after the infection episode were considered leftor right-censored, respectively. An episode was considered symptomatic if the individual was identified with any of the following symptoms during the infection episode; cough, runny nose, sore throat, nasal flaring, indrawing, crackles, wheeze, fever, unable to feed, head nodding, lethargy, unable to talk, cyanosis or difficulty breathing. Co-infection was assigned when within the hCoV infection episode an NPS collection was mPCR positive for a different hCoV species or another of the viruses tested, namely; RSV, RV, or AdV. Detection of two or more individual infection episodes by the same hCoV type in a household within a span of 14 days constituted a household outbreak. For each household hCoV introduction, a primary (index) case was defined as the first person(s) to test positive for hCoV by mPCR while secondary case(s) were the rest of the members who are part of the same household outbreak. For individuals with multiple hCoV infection episodes, reinfections were classified as either homologous (same hCoV species) or heterologous (different hCoV species) with respect to previously detected species during the study period. As an example, if an individual has 3 infections in the temporal order OC43, NL63 and OC43, then the second infection episode would be heterologous to the first, and the third homologous to the first infection episode and heterologous to the second episode.The peak/highest viral load was defined as the lowest Ct value in an individual infection episode and was categorised into three levels; low (>=30), medium (20-29) and high (<20). To account for clustering either at individual or household level, robust cluster variance estimator was used in the Cox PH and logistic regression models discussed above.On average, the peak viral load of the individual infection episodes was higher in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic episodes ( Figure 2 ). This was supported by linear regression model, The duration of virus shedding varied by hCoV type with the longest median duration observed for OC43 (7.5 days, IQR: 3.5 -13.5) and the shortest median duration for 229E (3.5 days, IQR:The median duration of symptoms (Supplementary Table S1) was 7.0, 4.0, 3.5 and 4.0 days, for OC43, NL63, 229E and any hCoV, respectively. For any hCoV median durations tended to decline with increasing age, increase in the presence of other respiratory viruses and increase for high peak viral load. There was some variation between hCoV type.Longitudinal studies of households have played an important role in developing understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses [7, 14] . Here we continue this approach, reporting an intensive surveillance of 483 household members in rural coastal Kenya [11] , to delineate the natural history of infection and transmission patterns of three endemic coronaviruses (OC43, NL63 and 229E). This involved the application of sensitive molecular diagnostic methods [7, 14] , and additionally applied sampling that was frequent and irrespective of observed symptoms [8] . The hCoV types were common in this setting with each of the 47 households, and about 72% of the enrolled household members, experiencing infection with at least one of three targets over the six months of the study. A note of caution in interpreting the results of this study is that infection status determined by PCR assay is not necessarily indicative of active infection or an individual's infectiousness.The three hCoV types had differing durations of shedding ranging from 3.5 days (229E) to 7.5 days (OC43). However, these median time estimates are influenced by our sampling frequency: predominantly every 3-4 days. The duration of shedding was longer in episodes with high peak virus load and which were symptomatic. Consistent with findings from other studies, we report occurrence of hCoV infection episodes among asymptomatic individuals [15] [16] [17] who had lower viral load [18] and shorter durations of virus shedding compared to symptomatic episodes. Despite asymptomatic infections being predominant (>70% of episodes) the above findings suggest they were less likely to transmit infection compared to symptomatic individuals. The duration of symptomatic episodes was related to peak virus load as reported elsewhere [25] and tended to decline with increasing age.Older children (siblings and cousins) and other adults were the major introducers of hCoV transmission into the household compared to RSV transmission in the same households whereby older children (> 32%) were the leading primary cases [11] . Similarly, children have been reported to form the highest proportion of index cases in the USA and UK [7, 20] .However, presence of older adults, children, smokers and individuals with chronic ailments within the households in the UK study was associated with increased household transmission [20] . Secondary transmission of hCoV to other household members upon introduction was high (48%) for any of the three hCoVs (ranged from 39% to 62% across type). This differs from a recent study in England which concluded that the vast majority (>90%) of observed hCoV infections were acquired outside the household [20] . In our study, the risk of secondary transmission was higher among index cases with high viral loads. Interestingly, there was no significant association between the presence of symptoms among index cases and the risk of secondary transmission, as observed elsewhere [20] .The authors have no competing interests to declare.","Kenya","abstract","2020-11-04","11"

The ensuing spread prompted the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after it was considered a health emergency of global concern [1] . The whole world is thus facing an unprecedented health crisis from the coronavirus with the number of people affected which is gradually increasing with more than 25,000,000 confirmed cases for nearly 800,000 deaths at the end of August 2020 [2] . Less affected by the pandemic compared to other continents, Africa is still resisting with a COVID-19 death toll reaching nearly 30,000 deaths while confirmed cases have exceeded 1,130,000 (August 31, 2020) according to the African control center and disease prevention [3] . This progression of the disease in this zone raises concerns as well among the governors as among the health experts with regard to the living conditions of the communities, the insufficient resources to face this type of threat and the noted failures. in some health systems in Africa. In Senegal, at the start of the epidemic, the government declared a state of emergency with several health, economic and security measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Then in the face of socio-economic stress, an easing followed by the lifting of restrictive measures seems to give a boost to the disease with the meteoric increase in incident cases. From March to April, the number of cases was 933. In the period from May-June, people sick with the coronavirus increased by 5,860. From July to This work was completed with the support of the NLAGA project. arXiv:2011.02766v1 [q-bio.PE] 5 Nov 2020August, the number of cases in Senegal increased by 6,818. This progression affecting almost all the health districts of all the regions of the country results for the most part from the resurgence of cases resulting from community transmission. These community cases are characterized by their difficulty in tracing to identify the source of contamination, but also by the limited possibilities for identifying and isolating the various associated contacts. During the three periods described above, the number of community cases among people positive for the coronavirus in Senegal was 109 for the first two-month period, 709 for the second two-month period and for the third two-month period July-August 2384. This development reflects an epidemiological situation including the magnitude and seriousness with regard to the consequences related to lethality and other impacts of all kinds, remain worrying. The determinants and/or variables linked to this form of transmission are not sufficiently documented in Senegal. Therefore, the identification and knowledge of the factors associated with this community transmission can constitute a decision support tool to limit the spread of the disease, on the one hand through targeted actions, to control the epidemic and its externalities on the other hand. The objective of this work is to model the variables potentially involved in the spread of cases resulting from community transmission of COVID-19 in Senegal in order to identify statistical associations. In our previous articles [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , we try to forecast the pandemic for Senegal using the SIR, stochastic SIR and machine learning. Here, we give forecasting pandemic size of community cases for Senegal and daily predictions using the logistic model. We assume that the model is a reasonable description of the epidemic. Full daily reports are available in [12] . First, we collect the pandemic data from [12] , from March 03, 2020 to September 20, 2020. Then, we propose a logistic growth model for forecasting. Variables such as community rate, growth factor, daily difference (daily variations) and weekly increase (number of cumulative cases per week) were defined to better understand the dynamics of the development of community cases in Senegal. The article is organized as follows. In section 2, we present some data analysis followed by the Logistic growth model for forecasting in section 3. Finally, in section 4, we present conclusions and perspectives.The simulations are carried out from data in [12] , from March 02, 2020, to September 20, 2020. The numerical tests were performed by using the Python with Panda library [13] , and were executed on a computer with the following characteristics: intel(R) Core-i7 CPU 2.60GHz, 24.0Gb of RAM, under UNIX system. According to daily reports, we first analyze and make some data preprocessing before simulations. The cumulative numbers of confirmed and community cases are illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows a progression of community cases as a function of the total number of confirmed cases. It seems to mean that the increase in confirmed cases correlates with the increase in community cases. Figure 2 shows the variation in the number of community cases with the various institutional measures taken since the declaration of the index community case on March 21, 2020; as well as the religious events that occurred during this period. The restriction of barrier measures has helped stabilize community cases (RBP, July 10, 2020 from Figure 2) , with a slight increase followed by a decrease. The Aid Al Kabir (Tabaski, July 31, 2020) intensively increases the cases, because during this period people mix from house to house. This increase in cases has prompted the government to strengthen barrier measures (RenBM, August 31, 2020). This increase in cases has prompted the government to strengthen barrier measures (RenBM, August 31, 2020). That made it possible to reduce the transmission. In managing the pandemic, controlling movement is a sure way to limit the spread. This is why slogans urging everyone to stay at home were widely shared on social media to persuade more.First, let's define the community rate.Community rate = number of community cases number of confirmed cases × 100The community rate (per day) is given by Figure 3 , and it's average and median values in Table 1 . The analysis of Figure 3 shows a variable evolution of the rate with extreme The growth factor is the factor by which a quantity multiplies itself over time. The formula used is:Every day's new community cases new community cases on the previous day Remark 2.1.• A growth factor constant at 1 indicates there is no change in any kind of cases.• A growth factor above 1 indicates an increase in corresponding cases.• A growth factor above 1 but trending downward is a positive sign, whereas a growth factor constantly above 1 is the sign of exponential growth.The growth factor for community cases is given by Figure 4 , and it's average and median growth factors in Table 2 . The two largest growth peaks (8 and 13) are reached in May and July. The Daily difference for community cases is given by Figure 5 . The greatest variations are obtained between the end of July and the beginning of August (period of after Aid El Kabir).The curve and the histogram for the weekly increase in number of community cases are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively. We see that week 23 was fatal for community cases, which corresponds to the period after Aid El Kabir.In this section, we a perform forecast with the logistics model ( [9, 10, 11] ) to predict the final size of coronavirus epidemy, for community cases in Senegal. The logistic model is a data-driven phenomenological model. Thus its predictions are as good as useful data are and as good as it can mimics epidemy dynamics. It's in a way mimic both epidemy spreading and its control i.e. prevention measures. When daily predictions of epidemic size begin to converge, we can say that epidemy is in control.In mathematical epidemiology, the epidemic dynamics can be described by the following variant of logistic growth model:where C is an accumulated number of community cases, r > 0 infection rate, and K > 0 is the final epidemic size (of community cases). If C(0) = C 0 > 0 is the initial number of cases then the solution of (3.1) is:where A = K−C0 C0 . When t 1, assuming K C 0 , and therefore A 1. We have the natural growth:When t −→ ∞ the number of community cases follows the Weibull function:The growth rate dC dt reaches its maximum when d 2 C dt 2 = 0. From this condition, we obtain that the growth rate peak occurs in time:lnA r At this time the number of cases is C p = K 2 and the growth rate is dC dt p = rK 4 To answer the question about doubling time ∆t, i.e., the time takes to double the number of cases we solve C(t + ∆t) = 2C(t) for ∆t . Result isThe first term represents initial exponential growth, then ∆t increases with t. When t −→ t p = lnA r , i.e., when C −→ K 2 , then ∆t −→ ∞. For C ≥ K 2 doubling time lost its meaning. For more details for the logistic growth model, see [9, 10, 11] .In Senegal, the first case of coronavirus appeared on March 2, 2020. But the first community case was detected on March 21, 2020. First, we collect the pandemic data from [12] , from March 21, 2020, to September 20, 2020. Then, we perform a forecast with the logistics model to predict the final size of coronavirus epidemy, for community cases. The size will be approximately 5100 ∓ 130 cases ( Table 3 ). The estimated coefficients are given in Table 3 , and that the peak of the epidemic was on August 12, 2020. It seems that the epidemic in Senegal is in the ending stage (see Figures 8 and 9 ). The short-term forecasting is given in Table 4 where we see that the discrepancy of actual and forecasted number of cases is within 3%. However, actual and predicted daily new cases are scattered and vary between 26% to 600%. On September 25, 2020, the actual number of cases was 3697, and the daily number of cases was 15. Prediction in Table 4 is cumulative 3993 cases and 29 daily cases. The errors are 48.276% and 7.413%, respectively. These extensive statistical analyzes allow us to make predictions about the future of the pandemic in Senegal. In the first phase of the response (at the national level), the emphasis was more on government actions, the involvement of health professionals, and uncompromising communication. Then, with the increase in cases of so-called community transmission, the epidemic entered its active phase with an increasing incidence in society. This worrying situation has led to the strengthening of various measures: the state of emergency with a curfew, the prohibition or restriction of interurban travel, gatherings but above all barrier gestures such as wearing a mask. This context of restriction, like everywhere in the world, has caused a gloomy economic environment in Senegal forcing the State to readjust measures. An easing of restrictions is announced first and then, a little later, the lifting of institutional measures, without first giving the necessary guarantees and support for the response strategy at the global level. Decisions that seemed to help boost the spread of the pandemic nationally with areas, initially free from the disease, which recorded their first cases of COVID-19. Despite these considerations, religious events like the Eid feast have taken place during this critical period. The festival of Eid or sacrifice of the sheep, in Senegalese sociology is a symbol and a pillar of stability and solidarity. The individuals preferentially celebrate it in a family or in the community. It is a time of exchanges of civilities, prayers in communion and sharing meals. This could facilitate the breaking of the barrier measures against the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, one to two weeks after the July 31 celebration of this holiday in Senegal, the rate of contamination of the disease has almost tripled with all the affected regions and the resurgence of cases resulting from community transmission. This situation further prompted the state to make the general wearing of masks compulsory in public places, commerce, transport, schools and universities. Wearing a mask remains a beneficial measure for many countries and reduces contamination by limiting the projection of postilions (especially in public). This fact seems to contribute to the control of the disease in Senegal which, since the beginning of September, has been in a downward dynamic. According to an optimistic estimate, the pandemic in Senegal will end soon, while for most countries of the world, the blow of the anti-pandemic will be no later than the end of the year.","Senegal","abstract","2020-11-05","11"

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which had not previously been identified in humans [1] . The novel coronavirus is classified as a beta-coronavirus, similar to previously discovered coronaviruses. The virus is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment [1, 2] .The most common laboratory testing method for SARS CoV-2 is by detecting the virus nucleic material (RNA) using RT-PCR. The test uses nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal swabs or other upper respiratory tract specimens, including sputum and saliva samples [3] . A variety of RNA gene targets are used by different manufacturers, with most tests targeting one or more of the envelopes (env), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF1 genes. The sensitivities of the tests to individual genes are comparable [4] .As of 12 July 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 12.9 million people worldwide resulting in more than 567,914 deaths [5] . In Ethiopia, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate. The first case was reported on 13 March 2020, since then 250,604 people have been tested, 7,402 people have been confirmed by laboratory tests to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 124 lives have been lost. The number of infected cases reported is increasing daily [6] .When COVID-19 was spreading out of Wuhan, China in January 2020, Ethiopia had limited capacity in the molecular diagnosis of coronaviruses. With unprecedented effort and as the lead national referral laboratory, the EPHI started managing testing for COVID-19 by early March 2020. However, the limited testing capacity at EPHI could not keep pace with the increasing demand for testing. Initially, a COVID-19 testing laboratory was initiated by the Virology/Influenza team at the EPHI. Following the quest for expansion of testing at the EPHI, the Malaria and Neglected Tropical diseases (NTDs) research team at EPHI also took the initiative to establish a complementary COVID-19 testing laboratory with the available resources initially allotted for Malaria and NTD research activities.In addition, several public universities, research institutes and hospitals in the country joined the effort by establishing their own COVID-19 testing laboratories. Herein, we have documented the processes followed and challenges encountered during the successful establishment of the COVID-19 laboratory by the Malaria and NTDs research team at the EPHI.The Malaria and NTDs team at EPHI had limited capacity in molecular testing. The existing resource focus was on Chelate extraction capacity and molecular testing of drug resistance using conventional thermocycler and gel electrophoresis. The laboratory was mainly inactive due to weak procurement systems for molecular reagents. However, the key equipment for molecular work including thermocycler, centrifuges, vortex, hotplate and pipettes was available in the laboratory.To develop clear structures of accountability and leadership, a steering committee was formed by voluntary team members from the Malaria and NTDs research team to lead the laboratory establishment. The nucleus team comprised of the laboratory manager, quality officer, safety officer and the team leader. The group started identifying space in parallel with mobilizing materials and consumables. Available equipment and consumables in the Malaria and NTD research laboratory and additional consumables provided by the national Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) targeting COVID-19 testing were taped and utilized for establishment.COVID-19 molecular laboratory testing has its own set of safety requirements with the need to have at least level two safety cabinets or equivalents [5] . The standard extraction and amplification laboratory rooms used by the Malaria and NTDs team are amid offices and are not convenient for handling contagious samples similar to COVID-19. As a result of the inadequacy of the existing laboratory space for contagious material handling, a search and identification process for appropriate rooms that meet the required safety standards was initiated. Consequently, a space previously used as a washing room for the Ethiopian National AIDS Research Program (ENARP) but in current marginal use was identified at the back of the Malaria and NTDs laboratory. The Malaria and NTDs team was planning to renovate the washing room for an NTDs molecular study. The team of experts found the site appropriate for contagious materials management and received permission from the institute's authorities together with strong backing from the top management. The washroom mentioned above was a large room with three access doors. The team partitioned the room into five dedicated rooms for sample reception, RNA extraction, master mixing, detection and amplification, and data management. To ensure safety and security, the entry corridor was outfitted with automated lockable doors to restrict the movement of unauthorized persons. World Health Organization (WHO) documents and experiences from the virology units at the EPHI were consulted to design the room's structure and workflow. The rooms were partitioned with aluminium metal frames and glass windows with adjoining entrance doors positioned in the middle of each room. Two 4 m × 4 m rooms and three smaller 2 m × 2 m rooms were fully setup and painted within two weeks.Simultaneously with room renovation, the team started locating and collecting standard materials required for the new laboratory. The EPHI is a historic institute (more than 100 years since establishment) and large institute with significant human potential and equipment [6] . The first two resources located within the institute were i) a level II biosafety cabinet at the malaria culture laboratory and ii) an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR machine owned by the entomology team, both were rarely used and the latter demonstrated some defects during testing. The cabinet and PCR machine were moved to the renovated COVID-19 laboratory space.The cabinet was recalibrated and tested by biomedical engineers to control the effect of movement on the standard functioning of the instrument. Experts from the Polio and Influenza teams at EPHI helped with calibrating the RT PCR machine. During the first trial test, the ABI 7500 RT PCR was malfunctioning. As a result, a concerted effort was made to solve the issues at hand by communicating with local as well as international colleagues and the ABI bio-system agents.After an intensive period of problem identification and diagnosis by the team, it was concluded that the machine had an electric system problem and required calibration. The team fixed the electric system problem and searched for calibration kits for the ABI 7500 biosystem RT PCR machine. There was a keen awareness that the new procurement of kits may require ample budget and considerable time with the current COVID-19 global slowdown. Fortunately, one of the experts had the required reagents left over from recent calibration and hence the RT PCR machine got calibrated. The machine was tested with plates prepared in another EPHI laboratory (Influenza) with known samples and proved to be working. However, on the second day of the machine calibration, a power fluctuation damaged the desktop computer with the ABI 7500 biosystem software and the window failed. Providentially, the RT PCR machine was not plugged at the time of fluctuation and survived the accident. The nucleus team installed accessible window and ABI 7500 biosystem software. After several trials and examinations, the ABI 7500 RT PCR machine was recalibrated and passed the major requirements for testing. Around the same time, a new QuantStudio 5 RT PCR which was previously acquired for a research project on schistosomiasis arrived for the team's use. The QuantStudio 5 RT PCR machine's manual reading showed that the machine was partially calibrated, and the required program could be downloaded online. The QuantStudio 5 instrument was ready to use with minimal calibration and the required software was installed safely.In parallel, part of the team was mobilizing molecular laboratory instruments such as pipettes, tips, vortex, centrifuges, spines, hotplates, biohazard bags and other consumables to start the actual testing. Most of them were collected from the Malaria and NTDs laboratories at EPHI.In the process of infrastructure and equipment organization, the team benefited from and was capacitated in leadership, team work, critical thinking in problem solving and leveraging human and material resources at the institute.The establishment team generally agreed to have a separate setup for dirty rooms (sample reception and extraction) and clean rooms (master mix). Sample flow was organized in such a way that the dirty rooms do not contaminate the clean rooms. Maximum efforts were exerted to prevent contamination and infection from the dirty rooms (Figure 1 ).PCR reagents and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) were made available through the national COVID-19 response team and aid from the Chinese philanthropist Jack Ma [7, 8] . The team had received training and support from available virology experts where junior and senior staff were trained and capacitated in molecular biology skills. When the laboratory and personnel were ready, the team decided to receive samples. Readiness was declared and the first 20 samples received were collected from community surveys.The collected samples were extracted using Da An nucleic acid extraction kit (Da An Gene Co., Lt. of Sun Yat-sen University); a master mix was prepared using Da An detection kit for Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA (Da An Gene Co., Lt. of Sun Yat-sen University) and amplified. The results were twofold; the system worked but the result was undetermined and non-interpretable. Similar tests and results were repeated two to three times. Potential contamination from unknown source was suspected. In the meantime, since the setup of the laboratory was convenient, experts from EPHI's virology unit requested to extract their samples using the extraction facility, this was in part to avoid the overcrowding at the virology laboratory. The extracts were all contaminated when tested in the newly established laboratory. The nucleus team started searching for the source of the contamination one by one.The entire extraction room, the safety cabinet and all materials including freezers were cleaned using bleach and 70% alcohol to control contamination from nucleic acid and other cellular contaminants that may interfere with assay detection. The room was fumigated with formaldehyde and neutralized. The safety cabinet was exposed to UV light and the laminar fan was kept turned on and running for a couple of days.In the amplification room, all the pipettes were calibrated per the national standards and exposed to UV light; the door to the extraction room was closed and human movement was restricted, except for authorized persons. All the rooms were thoroughly cleaned and fumigated.The team ran the experiment again; however, the result was further frustrating as it showed that the contamination had not yet been removed. The situation was considered as a total laboratory contamination and a corrective action plan was agreed upon. Given the inability to turnaround the samples in the expected timeframe, the COVID-19 national coordinating team notified the Malaria and NDTs team to return the samples. Repeated attempts at extraction and detection failed following which the samples were returned by keeping aliquots. The search for the source of contamination continued. At this stage, most colleagues were frustrated and little to no support remained.To mitigate the challenges, an experiment was designed to extract the samples and master mix in different COVID-19 testing laboratories at the EPHI and the detection was run using different instruments ( Table 1 ).The results indicated that the source of the contamination was the master mix room and potentially the master mix cabinet, particularly the ill working internal airflow. The team decided to remove the safety cabinet from the laboratory and kept on searching for laminar flow from different laboratories. At the same time, a master mix was prepared without the cabinet and limited contamination was found. Whereas samples were requested again for processing by the Malaria and NTDs team, the national COVID-19 testing team was hesitant to accommodate the request. The team received a few samples, ran experiments, and observed encouraging results. Before releasing the results, the team found a new laminar flow fitted with a UV light from one of the sister laboratories at EPHI. The experiment was repeated, and the results were confirmed. The results were confirmed in another laboratory and finally the new laboratory under the Malaria and NTDs team joined the chain of national COVID-19 testing laboratories with an initial testing capacity of 50-100 samples per day, with turnaround time of 24 hours. The new laboratory adopted a sample pooling strategy with four samples pooled together and only pools that have tested positive are individually extracted while the negative pools being reported as negative samples [9] . The establishment is working on the expansion of human resources and providing training to other similar laboratories from different regions including universities and hospitals.The laboratory design was revised (Figure 2) , it is receiving continuous supply of samples from the national COVID-19 testing unit and is working in three shifts reaching a testing capacity of up to 700 samples per day. The new laboratory is now part of the national COVID-19 testing chain and has become a preferred training and research unit because of its convenient setup and 20 skilled permanent and temporary staff. Thus far (31 August 2020), the laboratory has tested more than 39,326 samples total, including more than three thousand positive samples. It has also trained 30 individuals from different universities and hospitals in the country. The national testing capacity has reached around 20,000 per day and a total of 1.1 million samples have been tested nationally. A chain of 54 laboratories that include research institutes, universities, hospitals, and regional health offices have already been established all over the country. During the current national testing campaign, Community-Based Activity and Testing (ComBAT), the EPHI-Parasitology (PCL) laboratory was recognized as the best performer amongst COVID-19 testing laboratories in the country (see additional supplement document). COVID-19 is expected to wane over time, research efforts are being developed to use the capacity built towards research in COVID-19 and parasitic diseases co-infections. Regarding COVID-19 research, a proposal for a sample pooling validation study that was submitted by the Malaria and NTDs team was recently approved by the EPHI-IRB. Additionally, a study proposal has been submitted for serology/ ELISA-based COVID-19 testing and research is ongoing to compare and validate four reagents to provide input for informed decision-making.The Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) of the centre for Public Health Emergency Management (cPHEM) at EPHI is the coordinating body for COVID-19 surveillance, diagnosis, and response. The laboratory section at the EOC coordinates the sample collection from health facilities, communities, congregate settings and vulnerable groups. The sample management unit at the EOC receives samples collected by trained health professionals using standard viral transporting medium (VTM) reinforced by triple packaging, following receipt the samples get registered and distributed to COVID-19 testing laboratories in Addis Ababa. After sample processing, using the Demographic and Health Information System-2 (DHIS-2) platform negative results dispatched to patients via short message service (SMS) and by email to institutions whereas the case management unit of the EOC communicate positive results to the relevant entities for appropriate action (Figure 3 ).The new laboratory is named Parasitology Covid-19 testing Laboratory at EPHI (PCL-EPHI). With a strong commitment, teamwork, leadership and strong management support, an effective COVID-19 testing laboratory was established in a resource-limited setting, at a point in time when laboratory capacity expansion was most critical. Some of the lessons learned include: 1) Repurpose existing laboratory spaces using national and WHO guidelines 2) Mobilize underutilized resources such as equipment and human resources for COVID-19 laboratory setup. Particularly equipment available for health research and diagnostics 3) Collaborate with local and international health experts and equipment manufacturers and agents to solve laboratory issues 4) Ensure that space and equipment identified for COVID-19 testing is sterile and contamination free from the outset. Universities (there are 40 public universities in Ethiopia), hospitals and research institutes may follow a similar approach to establish COVID-19 testing and/or other emergency laboratories using available resources.Currently, COVID-19 is increasingly spreading in Ethiopia as part of the global pandemic. The Ethiopian population is estimated to be 114 million [10] and the government is calling for further testing COVID-19 capacity. The lessons learned in this case can be used to further establish COVID-19 testing laboratories in Ethiopia and in other resource-limited settings. On the other hand, using the opportunity the current pandemic has created, the EPHI benefited from the establishment of an additional standard molecular laboratory, capacitated staff as well as the identification of its human and material resources that may last beyond the COVID-19 era.The EPHI management is acknowledged for their unprecedented support and leadership. Bacteriology, Polio and Virology laboratories at the EPHI are acknowledged for the support and experience sharing. The WHO Ethiopia office and the Gashero project are acknowledged for availing expert advice and resources, respectively. Knowledge gained from molecular training sponsored by CDC/PMI was instrumental during the laboratory establishment. PCL-EPHI teams are highly acknowledged for their limitless effort and their families for patience since the work does not provide any additional income to the family while continuously demanding their commitment. Dr. Lishan Admasu is acknowledged for reviewing the laboratory linkage system. Albab Seifu and Ahlam Awad Mohammed are acknowledged for proofreading the document. Figure 3 . Parasitology COVID-19 testing laboratory design and workflow (PCL: Parasitology COVID Laboratory; EOC: Emergency Operation Centre): Naso/Oro-pharyngeal samples collected by trained health care professionals from risk groups, healthcare facilities, airports, border areas and communities are transported in standard triple package via cold chain to the sample reception centre. Samples allocated to PCL are received using standardized sample receiving/rejection format. Rejected samples are communicated to sample reception centre. Standard samples are given laboratory IDs and transferred to the Extraction unit. Extracted samples then transferred to master mix and detection unit where samples loaded with reagent to be detected by RT PCR machine. Results communicated to EOC through data management unit.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-11-17","11"

Ever since, COVID-19 has become a global public health threat, endangering the health and wellbeing of all people, especially those with existing comorbid conditions [3] . The disease has spread to most countries of the world, affecting millions of people and causing over 1.2 million deaths [4] . The most affected regions of the world include the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean [4, 5] . In Africa, the number of COVID-19 cases is comparatively lower than other regions; however, the trend of the disease is on a gradual increase in many countries [6] . According to the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 1.6 million confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 recorded in Africa as of mid-October, 2020, out of which over 39,000 individuals had died; while some 1.3 million patients recovered from the disease [7] . In Nigeria, over 60,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed as of 14 th of October 2020, out of which, about 1,100 died due to the disease [8] .Nevertheless, Nigeria is rated as a vulnerable country to the disease due to its large population (potentially 200 million citizens) and weak health systems [9] . Moreover, the testing capacity and testing rates in Nigeria has been considered to be inadequate [10] . Thus, Nigeria is being described to have a moderate capacity to control outbreaks like COVID-19 [11] . The capacity to provide sufficient bed space and associated clinical care to support those who could need isolation and quarantine following local cycles of transmission of COVID-19 is also a subject of concern [9] . As of mid-August, 2020; Lagos State was the epicentre of the disease in Nigeria with over 16,000 positive cases out of which over 200 individuals died. This is followed by Abuja (the Federal Capital Territory [FCT] ) that recorded about 4,700 cases and 45 deaths. Kano State was placed on the 7 th position (out of 37 states including the FCT) in Nigeria with over 1,700 total positive cases and 54 deaths [8] .Patients with COVID-19 often present with variable clinical features across various systems of the body including respiratory and digestive tract [12, 13] . These symptoms may include mild self-limited disease to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and systemic multiple organ failure syndrome. Consequently, some of the infected patients may require intensive care during isolation [2] . A comprehensive treatment package may be necessary to improve the experience of patients during COVID-19 hospitalization. For instance, provision of physical activity schedules and improving the aerobic capacity post COVID-19 have been utilized in many developed countries during the management of these patients [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, patients managed on account of COVID-19 could provide relevant information that can be utilized to improve management and care, especially in resource limited settings where international guidelines may not be practicable. Therefore, our study aimed to explore the views and experiences of discharged patients who were managed on account of COVID-19 in Kano, Nigeria through semi-structured in-depth interviews. We envisage that, findings from this study will inform policy on how to improve current interventions in a patient-centered manner. The outcome of this study may also highlight valuable information on the experiences of COVID-19 patients from an African perspective.This qualitative study was reported in line with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) checklist [17] . A phenomenological approach to qualitative research, which summarizes individuals' experiences and how they experienced them was used in this study. Phenomenology essentially focuses on the commonality of a lived experience or the life world of a particular group with a goal of creating meaning and achieving a sense of understanding [18, 19] . Specifically, a descriptive phenomenology method was chosen in this study because it disallows the linking of prior knowledge, while calls for detailed description of lived experience without ascribing meaning is emphasized [20] . Descriptive phenomenology is also based on the meaning of the individual´s experiences that comprises of perception, thought, memory, imagination, and emotion all of which are termed as 'intentionality' [21] . Thus, the primary focus of this study was on patients´ experience and perspective about COVID-19 and its treatment.Participants: we recruited Hausa-speaking patients that were admitted and discharged on account of COVID-19 from the major designated COVID-19 treatment centre in Kano, Nigeria. The telephone contacts of patients were obtained after seeking permission from the relevant authority in the treatment centre. Additional approvals were also obtained from the taskforce on COVID-19 in Kano State. The COVID-19 index case in Kano was admitted less than 3 months from the time of the interview (June, 2020), implying that all discharged patients were less than 3 months post-discharge. Therefore, all adult patients that were discharged from the treatment centre were qualified for inclusion into our study. Purposive sampling with emphasis on intensity sampling method was employed in recruiting the participants of this study [22] . Theoretical saturation was used to stop data collection from the patients [23] .Interviewers: to minimize interviewer dominance, interviews were conducted by two (male) researchers. However, the same device (recorder) was used to make the phone calls to the respective participants for the interview.Interview method: prior to the interview-proper, the interviewers conducted a pilot interview to optimize and familiarize themselves with the questions and the themes. Interviews were repeated where necessary. Structured questions for the interview were developed by all authors through an online meeting via Zoom until the contents were considered adequate and were unanimously accepted. The interview question guides and demographics are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively. The interviews were administered in Hausa language, and they were recorded using the same smart phone. However, no further interviews were conducted as soon as theoretical saturation was attained. Each interview lasted less than 18 minutes, which is similar to earlier reports for short telephone interviews [24] . Following the interviews, the responses of the participants were transcribed. Thereafter, forward and backward translation method was used in translating the transcribed interviews to English from Hausa [25] . The translation panel (the researchers) ensured that participants' style and meanings were preserved.Data cleaning and analysis method: the data collected was transcribed by an independent research assistant, who holds a Bachelor's degree in Library Science and has experience in interview transcription. Transcripts were then returned to the participants for comments or corrections. Thereafter, each transcript was reviewed and coded by two of the authors independently who then met afterwards to harmonize their results [26] . For the analysis, there are several approaches that are used when the aim is to describe the meaning of an experience through emergent themes within the different schools of phenomenology [21] . Since this study was based on Husserl´s descriptive phenomenology, the van Kaam's method, which require that inter subjectivity be confirmed through expert judges was used as the method of analysis [21, 27, 28] . Similarly, descriptive statistics was used to analyse the participants' personal and clinical information.Ethical clearance: ethical approval was sought and obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health, Kano State, Nigeria (MOH/Off/797/T.I/2020). The ethical approval was granted for the purpose of interviewing both discharged COVID-19 patients and healthcare providers of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, permissions from the Kano State COVID-19 Taskforce and treatment centre were also obtained before undertaking this work.The participants: a total of 11 patients were included in the study. Majority of the participants were males (90.9%) as only one participant was a female. The average age of the participants was 44.6 years (ranging between 21 to 70 years). The average duration of admission was about 3 weeks (19.9 days). Finally, majority (90.9%) of the participants were married, and a similar percentage had no comorbidities prior to hospitalization ( Table 2) . Table 3 provides the information on the participants commonalities discovered from the one-on-one interviews.Thematic analyses: this section provides a narrative of the themes generated from the analysis of the data to answer the research questions. Only participants´ responses that were in line with the interview questions were quoted. For clarity purpose, themes were categorized under the respective interview questions. The interview questions and the respective themes/quotes are presented in Table 4 .participants reported that they developed COVID-19 symptoms despite not having any history of travel or contact with a confirmed case. Some participants reported testing positive for COVID-19 after visiting the hospital for a different complaint. AS: ""I did not have any prior contact with a known or suspected case."" AM: ""I had no previous contact with any known COVID-19 patient."" AS2:""I then started having fever and cough. In the hospital, I was tested for COVID-19 and the result was positive."" A few other participants were able to attribute their positive result to either recent travel, following a condolence visit or after having contact with a person that later turned out to be a confirmed case. MK: ""I received a call from my friend that was with me at the condolence that he tested positive for COVID-19 because the first index case of Kano city was also at the same condolence visit. My sample was taken and the result came out positive."" KA: ""My brother was tested positive for COVID-19 and I had very close contact with him. He then called us for testing and my result was positive.""Beliefs and precautionary measures against COVID-19: the participants seem to be divided in terms of beliefs about COVID-19. Some participants have the notion that the disease is deliberately created in the laboratory; while others attribute it only to rich folks who have the means to travel to developed countries. AS: ""I believe it is created."" MK: ""My thought is that COVID-19 is not in Nigeria because in countries like China, America and the rest, they show the isolation centers and the patients, but in Nigeria we only hear about the number of cases increasing."" Some other participants seem to have some knowledge, primarily from media sources, and therefore believed that the virus truly exists. However, a few participants also attributed the outbreak of COVID-19 to destiny. AM: ""I don´t argue about it. There were previous diseases like AIDs and so on. We were told they exist and we later see them. Experiences of patients during COVID-19 hospitalization: some participants described their stay during hospitalization as a difficult time due to COVID-19 symptoms, especially among those with underlying disease conditions. These symptoms typically include dyspnoea (breathlessness) of different intensities and sometimes headache, fever, cold, body weakness, anosmia and pain. AS2: ""I had swellings and difficulty in breathing. But I have underlying heart disease."" UAS: ""I was having a severe flu like symptoms initially with neck pain, but gradually I got better before I got discharged."" NIF: ""During the early days in the isolation center, I had respiratory difficulty and I find it difficult to walk."" MK: ""I was suffering from headache, fever, cold, body weakness, respiratory difficulty, cough and whatever you put in my mouth I will not perceive the smell/aroma."" Nevertheless, some participants reported that they had no symptoms (asymptomatic) throughout their stay in hospitalization as a result of being infected with COVID-19. MS: ""I never had any symptom"" MJ: ""I did not reach any symptom level."" The findings of this study also indicated that majority of the participants reported that they experienced restrictions in their routine activities of daily living. These activities include engaging in acts of worship, doing household chores, working and visiting friends and family. AS: ""if I wash, my breathing becomes a little difficult."" AM: ""after the COVID-19, I find it difficult to recite the Qur´an."" KA: ""I was also coughing which limits my ability to answer phone calls.""The study revealed that the participants were impressed with the environmental hygiene of the treatment centre and quality of care. AS: ""The center we were admitted was always clean."" AS2:""We received excellent treatment."" UAS: ""We get our food and medications on time."" The participants admitted that any problem that they had was quickly resolved by the concerned authorities. Some participants did not have problems with recognising their caregivers´ professions. NIF: ""when those problems were raised, they were solved very quickly and efficiently."" UAS: ""Yes, we recognize the health care members. We also see names of staff members on their uniform."" Another major finding of this study was that the participants reported that infrastructure, equipment, medications and gadgets that were either put in place or used were of high standard quality and good model. MK: ""They gave us medications that are special, of high quality and are expensive."" MM: ""The medical equipment and gadgets I see at the isolation center are world standard."" Suggestions for improvement of care and posthospitalization experience: the patients reported the need to improve in areas of patient's education, caregiver and patient interaction, and the need for government to improve on the welfare package of caregivers (health workers). The patients also called for the need to have separate isolation centres for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. AM: ""There is need for improvement of the shower rooms and supply of soaps and body creams/lotions."" NIF: ""government should be paying the healthcare providers their allowances/salaries as at and when due."" UAS: ""Patients should receive adequate education about the symptoms, presentations and stages of the COVID-19 disease."" MM: ""Patients that have symptoms and those without symptoms should have separate isolation centers."" The participants reported that they faced difficulties in terms of their businesses and work following their discharge from the isolation centers. They also experience occasional fear when they remember their stay during hospitalization, and possible stigma, which makes it difficult for them to interact with people even after discharge. AM: ""It has completely crippled my business."" MK: ""I am afraid of going to people and interacting with them after discharge from the isolation center."" MS: ""because some patients that were with us in the isolation center have died, that fear is still in me.""This study was aimed at exploring the experiences of patients before, during and after hospitalization on account of COVID-19. The major outcomes of this study indicated that both community and secondary transmission are the major modes of transmission of COVID-19 among the participants. Some participants exhibited unfounded conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19; however, they reported taking recommended precautionary measures against the disease prior to being infected. The patients also recorded reduced limitation in their routine activities of daily living. However, the quality of care was reported to be optimal and described to be excellent by some participants. Finally, participants of the study reported that there was a need for improvement in areas of care-giver/patient interaction and welfare of the healthcare providers in the isolation centre. The findings of this study have added to the literature on the importance of patients' perspective in healthcare delivery [29] . This is because, unlike the result of the present study, previously, it was reported that, patients usually perceive healthcare providers to be hostile in developing countries like Nigeria [30] . In addition, the patients in the present study also sought for improved welfare for the attending health workers. We consider this result to be important because healthcare providers have continuously agitated for improved welfare package [31] . Therefore, bringing this information to the fore may be useful to relevant authorities seeking to enhance the quality of healthcare delivery in similar low resourced settings especially during this pandemic, a time when healthcare workers are afraid of risking their lives.Similarly, both community and secondary transmission of COVID-19 were reported by the study participants. This could be explained by the high rates of conspiracy theories around COVID-19 in the study area and earlier forecast by previous researchers [32] . Moreover, a significant proportion of individuals still have the notion that COVID-19 is a hoax, or does not affect Africans like other populations [33] . Therefore, there is a need for further and continuous enlightenment of the populace using different means (modern and traditional) about scientific bases of diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, in general, the participants were impressed with the quality of care administered to them in the isolation centre. This is likely due to the serious nature of COVID-19 on several aspects of human life, which has led to an unprecedented galvanisation of global response to combat it [34, 35] . Hence, the overall efforts in combating the disease by the federal and state governments in Nigeria may have led to the substantial improvement in quality of care reported in this study [36] . It is noteworthy that, many of the isolation centres are furnished with brand new and state of the art medical equipment.Moreover, a number of philanthropists continue to provide both financial and material support during the heat of the COIVD-19 pandemic [37] . Therefore, this can serve as a model to combat future epidemics or pandemics where all hands (the government, the business community, religious bodies and the general public) should be on deck.Nevertheless, the use of other complementary interventions like rehabilitation (physiotherapy) that could help enhance physical activity and boost patients´ immunity was not reported by the participants. Physical activity has been reported to be of immense importance among COVID-19 patients [38] . Rehabilitation has been recommended for COVID-19 patients in both acute settings [39] and at post discharge [40] , because of its beneficial effects on patients health outcomes and experiences. Furthermore, Abdullahi et al. [41] recently called for the need to adequately engage African physiotherapists in the management of COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend the use of more therapeutic options in a multidisciplinary manner for patients in similar settings in order to optimise patients' outcomes. The study has a number of areas of strengths.These include the exploration of viewpoints of patients within 3 months of discharge from hospitalization. This is important for capturing accurate and reliable information. In addition, all interviews were conducted by the same researchers, in order to increase the consistency of the data collection. Furthermore, coding was performed by the same researchers working independently in order to free the data from individual bias. Similarly, the participants had a lot of commonalities. Majority of them were males, married, and had no comorbidities thereby allowing our results to be viewed in a particular perspective. Also, the wide range in the age of the participants is important to capture the generational viewpoints. In contrast, the main limitation of this study is that only participants from one isolation centre participated in the study. However, this is unlikely to have any adverse impact on our study findings because the isolation centre that was used is one of the two major isolation centres in Kano, Nigeria. Moreover, we ensured that saturation of information was reached before stopping further interviews.In general, COVID-19 patients have diverse experiences largely influenced by their clinical presentations during hospitalisation. However, they appear to have a consensus among them that the level of care and health infrastructure was positive. Nevertheless, few areas bordering around care giver/patient interaction, welfare of health workers may warrant further improvement.

Some evidence from these studies suggests that the use of an integrative approach, such as the use of western medicine with herbal medicines and/or medicinal plant-based natural compounds, is more effective in controlling the coronavirus infection and in reducing the number of deaths [2] . Also, the use of effective combinational therapy could reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations, providing better clinical benefits [3] .Alkaloids are a class of naturally occurring nitrogen-containing compounds that have at least one nitrogen as a heteroatom, usually in a heterocyclic ring-with basic properties-and produce pronounced physiological responses. According to the biosynthetic pathway, alkaloids can be classified into, (1) true alkaloids that originate from amino acids and contain a nitrogen-based heterocyclic ring; (2) proto-alkaloids that also derive from amino acids, but do not contain a nitrogen moiety in a heterocyclic system; (3) pseudoalkaloids that do not originate from amino acids. Currently, more than 8000 natural compounds are classified as alkaloids [4, 5] . moiety in a heterocyclic system; (3) pseudoalkaloids that do not originate from amino acids. Currently, more than 8000 natural compounds are classified as alkaloids [4, 5] .Alkaloids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, with some estimates that 25% of Gymnosperms and Angiosperms produce these metabolites. Moreover, alkaloids are present in plants from the families, Apocynaceae [6] , Asteraceae [7] , Papaveraceae [8] , Rutaceae [9] , Solanaceae [10] , Erythroxylaceae [11] , ans Fabaceae [12] among others.Since the discovery of this class of natural products, several biological activities associated with alkaloids have been reported, including analgesic [13] , antibacterial [14] , antifungal [15] , antiinflammatory [16] , anticancer [17] , and antiviral [18] activity. Among the alkaloids that have antiviral activity, berberine has shown activity against the chikungunya virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [19] [20] [21] , tomatidine against dengue virus (DV) [22] , michellamine B against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23] , oxymatrine against influenza A virus [24] , and palmatine against zika virus (ZV) [25] . In addition, plants rich in alkaloids also show antiviral action, such as the seeds of Peganum harmala L. that can inhibit influenza A virus [26] and root tubers of Stephania cepharantha Hayata that improve the survival of mice infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) [27] .Therefore, considering the therapeutic anti-viral potential, including anti-coronaviral, of this class of natural products, the aim of this study was to review the antiviral activity of alkaloids against coronaviruses. This study looked at the various alkaloids which showed in vitro and in vivo anticoronavirus activity, with emphasis on human anti-coronaviral activity. In silico analysis was then performed to study the affinity of the eleven identified alkaloids-with anti-coronavirus activityfor binding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.In recent times, natural alkaloids and alkaloid analogs have been studied extensively for their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory [28] , as well as broad anti-viral properties [29] . In particular, with the current coronavirus pandemic in mind, alkaloids provide a rich source of important chemical compounds with great potential as novel anti-coronavirus agents ( Figure 1 ) [30, 31] . Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a plant-derived alkaloid extracted from some species of the Cephalotaxus genus [32, 33] . HHT exhibits antiviral activity against a diverse range of viruses, including the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [34] , hepatitis B virus (HBV) [35] , human echovirus 1 (HEV1) [36] , vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and HSV1 [37] among others. Moreover, groups have reported that HHT shows strong anti-viral activity against diverse human and animal coronaviruses [37, 38] . In a screen of 727 compounds in the NIH Clinical Collection small molecule database, HHT-with the lowest IC 50 of the 84 compounds identified-was identified as the strongest inhibitor against various coronaviruses. In this study, HHT effectively inhibited coronavirus infection (a reduction in virus titer of ≥8 log 10 ) by interfering with the coronavirus replication. The authors reported an IC 50 of about 0.011 µM with a dose-dependent effect on virus inhibition [38] . In a later study by Dong and colleagues (2018) , HHT was shown to effectively reduce porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) viral load in infected cells and animals. The alkaloid was reported to provide optimal inhibitory activity, without death, at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg in piglets. Interestingly, HHT treatment effectively decreases mRNA levels of PEDV nucleocapsid in pig intestine and blood, indicating efficient inhibition of PEDV replication in vivo. Moreover, HHT-dosed piglets did not show a pathological change in tissues or symptoms of diarrhea and cachexia [37] . In a very recent study, HHT was reported to inhibit the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2. In Vero E6 cells, the alkaloid was reported to have a CC 50 of 59.75 µM, and an EC 50 of 2.55 and 2.14 µM for the reduction in infectious virus and reduction in viral RNA copy numbers, respectively [3] . The authors do not speculate on the mode of HHT action but it has previously been reported to be a protein synthesis inhibitor [33] , so this might provide clues for future studies on the mode of action.Lycorine is one of the major alkaloids isolated from the plant Lycoris radiate, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb [39] . This alkaloid possesses many diverse biological functions, including antiviral [39] and anti-inflammatory properties [40] . Lycorine has been reported to have antiviral action against many diverse viruses, including DV [41] , ZV [42] , poliovirus [43] , HCV [44] , enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and coxsackievirus A16 [45, 46] , avian influenza H5N1 virus [47] , HSV1 [48] , and bunyaviruses and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [49] . Using a high throughput screening MTS assay to check for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), Li and colleagues (2005) screened more than 200 anti-viral Chinese medicinal herb extracts for antiviral activity against the human SARS-CoV. In the end, they reported that lycorine-with an EC 50 value of 15.7 ± 1.2 nM, a CC 50 in Vero E6 and HepG2 cell lines of 14,980.0 ± 912.0 and 18,810.0 ± 1322.0 nM, respectively, and an SI value higher than 900 inhibits SARS-CoV replication in vitro, making it an ideal candidate as a new anti-SARS-CoV drug [30] . Unfortunately, this observation was made post the SARS-CoV outbreak, and could never be tested in an in vivo setting. Moreover, the authors did not speculate on the anti-SARS-CoV mode of action of lycorine. Based on the previous study by Li and colleagues (2005) , Zhang and others (2020) tested the inhibitory effect of lycorine on SARS-CoV-2 in in vitro cell culture replication. Using a dose-dependent rescuing CPE assay, they reported that lycorine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro replication in a cell-independent manner [50] . While previous studies have reported that the antiviral action of lycorine is primarily through the suppression of viral RNA replication [41, 45] , by blocking the elongation of viral RNA translation during EV71 infection [45] , others have reported that lycorine is able to stop the movement of influenza virus nucleoprotein from the nucleus [51] and is able to downregulate autophagy [46] . Based on these previous reports, Zhang and colleagues (2020) postulated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of lycorine is likely due to the alkaloid modulating host factors instead of directly targeting viral factors [50] ; however, this needs to be verified in future studies.Oxysophoridine belongs to the quinolizidine alkaloid group and is one of the alkaloids extracted from the Chinese medicinal plant Sophora alopecuroides and Siphocampylus verticillatus [52, 53] . This alkaloid has various known pharmacological activities, especially in the field of oncology [54] , and has anti-oxidative stress, strong anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis properties [53, 55, 56] . Studies investigating the anti-viral properties of this alkaloid have not been very successful but a recent study has reported that SARS-CoV-2 replication is inhibited by oxysophoridine in cell culture (EC 50 0.18 µM and CC 50 > 40 µM) [50] . Little-to-nothing is known about the anti-viral mode of action of oxysophoridine, however, and future studies are needed to determine how this alkaloid interferes with coronaviral replication.The bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine (TET), fangchinoline (FAN), and cepharanthine (CEP) are major compounds in Stephania tetrandra and other related species of Menispermaceae; these alkaloids are known for their anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity [31] . The antiviral activities of these alkaloids have also been widely studied. The alkaloid fangchinoline exhibits antiviral activity against HIV1 in MT-4 and PM1 cells [57] . Some studies using cepharanthine showed that its antiviral action against HIV1 is by inhibiting the process of virus entry into cells, reducing the fluidity of the plasma membrane [58] ; through a synergic effect with a derivative tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene results in inhibition of the proliferation of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [59] . On the other hand, tetrandrine attenuates the infection caused by the DV in human lung cells [60] , inhibits the infection of human macrophages by EV [61] , and inhibits HSVI-induced keratitis in mice [62] . Moreover, cepharanthine hydrochloride inhibits the replication of the lamivudine-resistant HBV [63] . A more recent study reported that several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids block MERS-pseudovirus translocation through the endolysosomal system-which normally provides one pathway for cellular entry of MERS-CoV-by inhibiting NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release [64] . In addition, tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine inhibit HCoV-OC43-induced cell death in the early stage of infection in human lung cells and reduce virus replication by suppressing the expression of viral S and N proteins [31] .Tylophora indica and Tylophora ovata are used as traditional medicines in India [65] and China [66] . Tylophorine and tylophorine analogs, the natural products first isolated from the plant T. indica, are reported to have broad in vivo activity against many diseases, including inflammation [67] -one of the hallmarks of pathogenic coronavirus infection, and can inhibit global protein synthesis [68] . Interestingly, tylophorine has also been reported to inhibit the replication of the HCV [69] . More recent studies have shown that tylophorine-based compounds, whether extracted from plants or artificially synthesized, act as strong inhibitors of many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [70] [71] [72] . One study described natural (tylophorine and tylophorinine) and synthetic tylophorine compounds as novel and potent anti-CoV agents for the treatment of TGEV and SARS-CoV infections. The authors reported EC 50 values for the natural and synthetic tylophorine compounds ranging from 8 to 1468 nM and 5 to 340 nM, in ST and Vero 76 cells, respectively. Additionally, the tylophorine compounds showed strong anti-coronavirus replication activity, ultimately blocking virus-induced apoptosis and subsequent cytopathic effect in cells in vitro [71] . In a further study to understand the mode of action of tylophorine-based compounds, Yang and colleagues (2017) demonstrated that these compounds target viral RNA, thereby inhibiting TGEV replication. The authors further reported that tylophorine-based compounds act jointly with CYT387-a JAK family inhibitor-to exert comprehensive anti-TGEV activities. They concluded that the combination treatment, using a tylophorine compound and a JAK2 inhibitor, is more efficacious for the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV than either treatment on its own [72] .Isatis indigotica is a traditional Chinese medicine used in clinical settings for its anti-viral properties in the treatment of diseases like influenza, hepatitis, and encephalitis [73, 74] , as well as inflammation [75] . In one study, indigo-a major compound of I. indigotica root extract-showed potent antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in vitro replication in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, time-of-addition assays showed that indigo exhibits a strong antiviral effect before or during infection, but not after viral cell entry [74] . Chang and colleagues (2012) hypothesized that this indicated that the antiviral mode of action of indigo is associated with the blocking of virus attachment to the cell receptor [74] . Interestingly, I. indigotica root was also frequently used for the prevention and treatment of SARS during the SARS-CoV outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan [76] . In fact, Lin and colleagues (2005) reported that both the I. indigotica root extract, as well as indigo, showed a significant inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV in the micromolar range. Similar to other I. indigotica root compounds, indigo inhibits the cleavage activities of the 3CLpro-a viral replication enzyme that mediates the proteolytic processing of coronavirus replicase polypeptides into functional proteins [77] , in a dose-dependent manner. In the end, the authors reported indigo IC 50 values for cell-free and cell-based assays of 300 µM and 752 µM, respectively; this is indicative of indigo acting as an efficient blocker 3CLpro functioning. Lastly, a CC 50 of 7.4 mM in Vero cells was reported indicating that indigo is not toxic to Vero cells [76] . This contradicts the hypothesis for the mode of action for indigo proposed by Chang and colleagues (2012) but could merely be a function of the virus studied or the assays used. Further studies on different viruses, and in different systems, would be needed to elucidate the exact mode of action of indigo.Strobilanthes cusia is a traditional medicine used in Myanmar, India, Thailand, and the southern parts of China [78] . Historically, the root has been used to treat influenza, encephalitis B, viral pneumonia, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, and mumps [79, 80] . Tryptanthrin and indigodole B are two of the major compounds extracted from S. cusia leaves [81] . In a study by Tsai and colleagues (2020), these compounds showed strong antiviral activity in reducing both the CPE and virus yield (IC 50 values are 1.52 µM and 2.60 µM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. In addition, strong viricidal activity was reported for tryptanthrin (IC 50 = 0.06 µM) and indigodole B (IC 50 = 2.09 µM). The authors identified tryptanthrin as the key antiviral compound of S. cusia leaf methanol extract with potent activity against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. Lastly, they reported that tryptanthrin interferes with the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 in vitro replication, by blocking viral RNA synthesis as well as the activity of the papain-like protease 2 [82] .Due to the structural diversity of the alkaloids and the differences in the experimental protocols used by each research group in our selected articles, it is not easy to establish a relationship between chemical structure and anti-coronaviral activity of the alkaloids identified in our review. However, we do note that the identified alkaloids share some common chemical characteristics. Interestingly, the eleven alkaloids are highly oxygenated due to the presence of several functional groups, including methoxyls, hydroxyls, methylene dioxide, and carbonyls of ketones, esters, and amides. Also, the nitrogens found in these alkaloids are heterocyclic atoms and are sometimes in ring fusion, and most importantly, all the alkaloids are made up of polycyclic systems in their chemical structures. It is plausible that these common chemical structures contribute to the anti-coronavirus activity of these alkaloids.Current data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these compounds against several viral diseases, including those related to coronaviruses (Table 1) , as promising molecules for the study of new drug candidates against the COVID-19. Table 2 showed the activities of alkaloids against other viruses-besides coronaviruses-and the compounds are illustrated in Figure 2 .SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic infectious disease resulting in COVID-19, is causing numerous health and economic problems globally. SARS-CoV-2 must bind to specific receptors on the host cell surface that allows virus entry into the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors-the main receptor involved with viral entry-present on the surface of host cells, by anchoring the virus' S1 subunit of the spike protein. The S1 subunit, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), is responsible for the high-affinity viral binding to ACE2 receptors [83] ; this makes the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD residues potential targets to control virus entry and infection. Tetrandrine, Fangchinoline, and CepharanthineBlock MERS-pseudovirus translocation through the endolysosomal system Inhibited HCoV-OC43-induced cell death in the early stage of infection and reduced virus replication by suppressing the expression of viral S and N proteins. In this study, the S1 subunit of SARS-COV-2 was targeted by an in silico approach to repurpose drug molecules that bind the S-protein and blocks its interaction with the ACE2 receptor, rendering it incapable of infecting a host cell. From a previous study [83] , it was reported that several drugs were found from in a high-throughput virtual screening approach of FDA approved LOPAC library drugs to be active against the S-protein receptor of the virus. KT185, KT203, GSK1838705A, BMS195614, and RS504393 were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein. So, in order to gain insights into the binding mode and crucial molecular interactions of the chosen alkaloids, molecular modeling simulation studies were performed with the S-RBD protein of SARSCOV-2 using Libdock protocol in Discovery Studio 2.5 Software. The analysis of their binding modes was performed to predict their biological activities and to achieve further insight into binding orientations and interactions. Alkaloids interacting with S1-RBD could potentially interfere with virus attachment to host receptors and, hence, inhibit virus entry into the host cell. Therefore, a molecular docking study was performed to identify and understand the interaction and binding affinity of these alkaloids with the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2.The outcome of our docking study of the selected alkaloids and reported compounds with SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD is presented in Table 3 . Where the previously reported KT185, KT203, GSK1838705A, BMS195614, and RS504393 gave a libdock score of 95.9, 101.43, 72.7, 91.75, and 120 (Kcal/mol), respectively, the chosen alkaloids gave a libdock score ranging from 64.26 (Kcal/mol) to 109.11 (Kcal/mol). This finding indicated higher binding stability for alkaloids-S1-RDB complexes. In other words, S1-RDB favored interactions with most alkaloids, especially homoharringtonine which revealed the highest docking score. The interaction of homoharringtonine with S1-RBD involved three hydrogen bonds acceptor with Ser494, Ser494, and Gln 493 and two hydrogen bond donors with Tyr453 and Pro491. In addition, there were hydrophobic interactions with Leu455, Lys452, and Phe 497. Also, with cepharanthine, the high docking score (106.74 Kcal/mol) could be attributed to the formation of five hydrogen bond acceptors with Arg 454, Arg 457, Lys 458, Lys 458, and Ser 469 and one hydrogen bond donor with Gln474. All the docked structures showed similar binding modes in the binding region of S1-RBD of SARS-COV-2 and interaction with various amino acid residues, including the Leu455, Phe486, Asn487, Gln493, Ser494, Tyr495, and Gly496 [83] . This indicated that these compounds have a high probability of binding to the S-RBD protein of SARS-COV-2, preventing it from binding to the host cell. Traditional herbal medicines and plant-based natural compounds are rich resources of new antiviral drugs. In fact, about 25% of commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants. Many traditional herbal medicines possess antiviral activity against a plethora of viral strains, exerting their antiviral activity on the virus life cycle, including viral entry, replication, assembly, and release, and also the virus-host-specific interactions. Alkaloids have been reported as broad-spectrum inhibitors of animal and human coronaviruses. Whereas the mechanisms used by HHT, oxysophoridine and tylophorine, and tylophorine analogs to inhibit CoV replication are not known, lycorine modulates host factors to interfere with viral replication. On the other hand, tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine block virus translocation through the endolysosomal system or target viral RNA, inhibiting TGEV replication and act jointly with a JAK-family inhibitor for comprehensive anti-CoV activity. Indigo, on the other hand, inhibits the cleavage activities of the 3CLpro to interfere with virus replication. Lastly, tryptanthrin and indigodole B decrease virus yield and have potent viricidal activity. In particular, tryptanthrin was reported to block viral RNA genome synthesis as well as the activity of the papain-like protease 2 in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. As shown in the in silico simulations using biological targets related to SARS-CoV-2 and in some recent in vitro studies, the alkaloids provide an attractive prospect as anti-coronavirus drugs and warrants further investigation.The present study was carried out based on a search of the literature on alkaloids against human coronaviruses. A search of the literature was performed by using the scientific database PubMed, included studies published until April 2020, and used the following keywords: coronavirus, Human coronavirus-229E (229-E), Human coronavirus-NL63 (NL-63), Human coronavirus-OC43 (OC43), Human coronavirus-HKU1 (HKU1), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV or COVID-19), alkaloid, pyrrolidines, pyridines, tropanes, pyrrolizidines, isoquinolines, indoles, quinolines, quinazoline, β-carboline alkaloid, piperidine, and pyrrole. Articles published in languages other than English were excluded.The X-ray crystal structure of the S-RBD protein of SARS-COV-2 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank [www.rcsb.org] (PDB code: 6vw1) [84] . The protein structure was prepared using the default protein preparation tools integrated into the software. This was accomplished by adding hydrogen atoms to the amino acid residues, completing the missing residues, and applying force field parameters by using CHARMm forcefield [85] . All of the protein structures were minimized using 500 steps employing a SMART minimizer algorithm. Also, binding pockets, together with the surrounding amino acid residues, were identified. The ligands were prepared using the ligand preparation protocol of Accelrys Discovery Studio [86] . The ionization pH was adjusted to 7.4, hydrogen atoms were added and no isomers or tautomers were generated from the ligands. Docking was carried out using Libdock software [87] in the interface of Accelrys Discovery Studio 4.0 [86] . Ten docking poses were generated for each ligand docked and were then thoroughly inspected for proposing the best binding mode. The top-ranked poses were selected for analysis. Funding: Burtram C.

The disease originated from Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 and spread to the rest of the world, and was then declared a global pandemic in February 2020. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the coronavirus family. They are the largest known RNA viruses made up of positive single-stranded RNA and are subdivided into alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses (Shereen et al., 2020; Huynh et al., 2012) . This set of viruses have been documented to have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals and are linked with severe respiratory illness in humans Moore and June, 2020) . The SARS-CoV was first implicated as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks between 2002/2003 in the Guangdong area of China (Zhong et al., 2003; Zhong, 2004) , and the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (de Groot et al., 2013) . SARS-CoV-2, another variant of this devastating virus family has forced the human race to be on lockdown as a preventive measure to avoid disease transmission (contraction and spreading of the disease). The disease symptoms include but are not limited to fever, dry cough, sore throat and difficulty breathing. As of 29 May 2020, there are 5 701337 confirmed cases and 357 688 mortalities due to this alarming infection have been reported from 216 countries (WHO, 2020) .Unfortunately, there is neither a specific drug nor vaccine approved for the treatment or modulation of immune response against this infection, yet the infection and mortality rates are steadily increasing. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in the host was identified as one of the receptors that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interact with during infection, and was explored as a potential target for treatment of COVID-19. Chloroquine and its derivative Hydroxychloroquine were the first drugs to be repurposed for use in the treatment of COVID-19 (Omar et al., 2020) . Although these drugs were potent in inhibiting SARS-CoV, and showed no serious health effects when used for treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases (Vincent et al., 2005) , they are now red flagged for use in COVID-19 (Mehra et al., 2020) . The efficacy of these drugs (Colson et al., 2020) together with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Lim et al., 2020) , and Remdesivir are currently undergoing investigation and clinical trials. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) have suspended the use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine after they were reported to have serious side effects including cardiac toxicity (Mehra et al., 2020) . As the world is gradually easing their lockdown restrictions, there are concerns about the possibility of the infections increasing exponentially, hence there is an urgent need to identify and develop drug candidates and vaccines for the treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Notably, traditional drug discovery and development pipeline are time-consuming, very costly and often associated with high clinical failure (Aruleba, 2018) . Therefore, employing computational drug discovery tools for this raging infectious agent is of paramount importance. In silico techniques can augment the opportunities for designing, verifying activity, and developing new drug and vaccine candidates within a short space of time. In this regard, bioinformatic tools have been utilized extensively in many interesting studies; and recently for the SARS-CoV-2 (Elmezayen et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Bhattacharya et al., 2020) .The virus main protease (M pro ) is one of the best characterized drug targets because its inhibition blocks viral replication . Holistically, the M pro is highly promising as no human protease has a similar cleavage pathway, thus making it a non-probable toxic agent . The interaction of this enzyme and several compounds as inhibitors have shown promising results (Khaerunnisa et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Ton et al., 2020) . Furthermore, M pro is highly conserved among the coronavirus family showing 40-44% of sequence homology (Muralidharan et al., 2020) . Inhibiting the virus replication and maturation in the host cells by blockade of the enzymatic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro could potentially give the patients a fighting chance. Hence, we have employed in silico molecular docking to explore whether Lamivudine, Pradimicin A, Plerixafor, and Lopinavir could inhibit the M pro of the SARS-CoV-2 and used molecular dynamics simulation to validate the stable and strong binding interaction between the protein and the ligands with the aim of providing structural basis for rational drug discovery.The SARS-CoV-2 M pro receptor with Protein Database (PDB) ID: 6W63 and the potential ligands: Pradimicin A (PubChem ID: 5479145), Lamivudine (PubChem ID: 60825), Plerixafor (PubChem ID: 65015), and Lopinavir (PubChem ID: 92727) were used in this study. The ligands were downloaded from NCBI PubChem database in 3D conformer (SDF) format at (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound) while the crystallized 3D structure of the receptor in complex with co-crystallized ligand: X77, PDB ID:6W66 was retrieved from protein data bank at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do. The M pro selection is as a result of the presence of an inhibitor ligand (X77) at the active site. The antiviral drug, Lopinavir served as control in this study.To determine whether the ligands can easily gain access to the target site in M pro after entering the blood stream, the QikProp module in the Schrodinger-2019-4 software package was used to evaluate the 3D molecular structures of the ligands' pharmacokinetic properties. With respect to Lipinski's rule of five, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/T) properties were predicted (Ligprep and Macromodel, 2011).These compounds were further subjected to ligand preparation (LigPrep) prior to docking. LigPrep is a robust collection of tools designed to prepare high quality, all-atom 3D structures for large numbers of drug-like molecules, starting with 2D or 3D structures in spatial data file (SDF) or Maestro format (Release, 2017) . In order to generate a single, lowenergy, 3D structure with correct chiralities for each successfully processed input structure, the ligands were subjected to preparation by LigPrep tool. This tool is also capable of generating multiple structures from input structure with various ionization states, tautomers, stereochemistries, and ring conformations, and eliminate molecules using specified criteria. The ligands for this study were also prepared by optimizing geometries through OPLS_2005 force field and Ionization of possible state were generated at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 by Epik (Greenwood et al., 2010) . Desalt and generate tautomers were also selected and the stereoisomer computation was checked to retain specific chiralities (vary other chiral centers) and to generate at most 32 conformations per ligand.Excellent docking studies require both accurate software and starting structures . Experimentallyderived structures can waste time and resources or produce false result if not corrected. Schr€ odinger's Protein Preparation Wizard is designed to ensure structural correctness at the onset of a project, equipping them with a high-confidence structure ideal for use with a wide variety of modeling applications (Sastry et al., 2013) . Because the typical structure file of the receptor obtained from the PDB is not suitable for immediate use in molecular modeling calculations, the protein preparation wizard was used to prepare the receptor (PDB ID: 6W63). Following the previously reported method , the Protein Preparation Wizard was used for the following: remove alternate conformation, remove HetAtoms from the protein structure, add hydrogen atoms, correct missing or incorrectly specified residues, detect and correct valence violations, optimize protonation state and hydrogen positions.An energy-optimized pharmacophore (e-pharmacophore) model combines the advantages of structure-based and ligand-based drug-design theories, and can be used to rapidly screen ligands based on pharmacophore properties (Salam et al., 2009; Negi et al., 2014) . Using the 'Develop Pharmacophore hypothesis' option in Maestro v12.2 tasks view mode, pharmacophore sites were generated from the receptor with redocked co-crystalized ligand (M pro -X77) complex, preserving a maximum of seven pharmacophore features as default. Pharmacophore chemical properties include: hydrogen-bond acceptor (A), represented as vectors, hydrogen-bond donor (D) as projected points, aromatic ring (R) as ring, positive ionizable (P), and negative ionizable (N) (Veeramachaneni et al., 2015) . Explicit matching was required in the e-pharmacophore approach for generation of the most energetically favorable site. The hypothesis settings were configured to treat atoms as projected points with a radii scaling factor of 0.50 and limit excluded volume shell to 5.0 Å.Glide uses a hierarchical series of filters to search for possible locations of the ligand in the active-site region of the receptor. This is done by ligand ranking via high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). Three modes of sampling ligand conformational and positional degrees of freedom are available to determine the optimal ligand orientation relative to a rigid protein receptor geometry (Repasky et al., 2007) . Flexible ligand docking with Glide, optionally includes ligand constraints or ligand molecular similarities. Docking grid of the receptor's active site was detected using the PDB file of the coordinates with the receptor grid generation tool in maestro v12.2. This site defines the area around the active site in term of co-ordinates x, y and z. The receptor grid box resolution was centered at coordinates À20.57, 18.10, and À26.99 corresponding to x, y and z-axis, respectively. Docking and calculations were run in the extra precision (XP) mode of Glide (Schr€ odinger, 2018).The free binding energies of ligand docked complexes were computed using the molecular mechanic-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) (Huang et al., 2006) with specific parameters. Based on the docking score and MM/GBSA binding-free energy, Jin et al. (Jin et al., 2011) developed correlation model between docking scores or calculated binding-free energies and experimental pIC50 values. The Prime module in Maestro was employed to calculate the MM-GBSA energy of Glide XP docked complex. The OPLS_2005 force field in conjunction with GBSA continuum model (Yu et al., 2006 ) was used to calculate energies of complexes of ligands following the equation reported by Lyne et al. (Lyne et al., 2006) and according to our previous study .The docked complexes were subjected to MD simulation using Desmond module of Schr€ odinger software with OPLS 2005 force field. The protein-ligand complex was bounded with a predefined TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., 1983) in orthorhombic box. The volume of the box was minimized and the overall charge of the system was neutralized by adding Na þ and Clions. The temperature and pressure were kept constant at 310 Kelvin and 1.01325 bar using Nose-Hoover thermostat (Hoover, 1985) and Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat (Zhong, 2004) methods. The simulations were performed using NPT ensemble by considering number of atoms, pressure and timescale. During simulations, the long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (Essmann et al., 1995) . RMSD plots for the backbone atoms for both the protein and ligand bound protein were generated to decipher the relative stability of the ligand in the binding pocket of the M pro . The results were analyzed and visualized by simulation interaction diagram and MS-MD trajectory analysis.The chemical 2D structures of the four ligands ( Figure 1 ) were obtained from PubChem database. In essence, the database is a public repository composed of numerous validated chemical entities and their biological activities (Kim et al., 2016) .Based on the Lipinski's rules of five, the pharmacokinetic properties (ADME) of Pradimicin A, Lamivudine, Plerixafor, and Lopinavir were calculated using the QikProp module in the Schrodinger-2019-4-software package. Here, Lipinski stated that a drug/compound would be orally bioavailable if it follows the following criteria such as molecular weight < 500 amu, Hydrogen bond acceptor sites < 10, Hydrogen bond donor sites < 5, and Lipophilicity value LogP 5. The result of the present study showed that only lamivudine satisfied Lipinski's rules, which indicated good oral bioavailability (Table 1) .Extra precision docking was used to investigate favorable interactions between the selected ligands and the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The redocked X77 replicated the binding pose and orientation of the crystal ligand, and indicated that it was successful in mimicking the native pose ( Figure 2 ). Using the same docking approach, the M pro receptor was docked with the four ligands ( Figure 1 ). Pradimicin A, Lamivudine, and Plerixafor were considered for docking studies. An FDAapproved anti-viral drug Lopinavir was also docked to correlate the docking scores and interactions (Figure 3) .The results revealed that Pradimicin A was properly positioned into the binding cavity constructed by polar amino acids: GLN192 THR190 GLN189 ASN142 THR45 SER46 THR26 THR25 THR24; hydrophobic amino acids: ALA191 PRO168 LEU167 MET165 CYS44 MET49; and charged amino acids: GLU166 with binding energy of À2.4 kcal/mol (Figure 3(A) ). The binding parameters of the ligands together with the number of hydrogen bonds and the residues within the distance of 4 A o are presented in Table 2 . From the 2D interaction result, CYS44 exhibited bi-hedral H-bonding with hydroxyl group of oxane ring (tetrahydropyran) of Pradimicin A and other oxygen group showed H-bonding with GLN189 (Figure 3(A) ).Lamivudine was properly positioned into the binding cavity constructed by polar amino acids: ASN 142 SER144, hydrophobic amino acids: LEU141 PHE140 CYS145 MET165 LEU167, charged amino acids: GLU166; with binding energy À5.3 kcal/mol. The hydroxyl and Oxo groups of lamivudine exhibited bi-hedral H-bonding with GLU166. The amine group and keto groups of the ring structure were also involved in hydrogen bonding with PHE140 (Figures 3(B) and Ye et al., 2020and Table 2) .Lopinavir was properly docked into the binding cavity of the receptor as constructed by polar amino acids: GLN192 THR190 GLN189 ASN142 SER144 THR25 THR45 SER46; hydrophobic amino acids: PRO168 LEU167 MET165 PHE140 LEU141 CYS145 VAL42 CYS44 TYR54 PRO52 MET49; Charged amino acids: ASP187 GLU166; and glycine: GLY143 with binding energy of À9.2 kcal/mol (Figure 3) . Among the residues of Lopinavir and M pro , three H-bonds where involved between the residues GLU166 and GLN189 and the interacting atoms of Lopinavir (Figure 4 and Table 2 ).Plerixafor interacted with the binding cavity constructed by polar amino acids: ASN142 THR25 THR169; hydrophobic amino acids: CYS145 LEU27 MET49 CYS44 VAL42 MET165 LEU167 PRO168; charged amino acids: GLU166 and glycine amino acids: GLY170 with a binding energy of À3.7 kcal/mol. Two amine groups showed bilateral H-bonding with GLU166 and other bonds with CYS145 and ASN142 (Figure 3(D) and Figure 4 ).To predict the binding mode and binding free energy (DG bind ), the Prime MM-GBSA simulation was calculated for M pro -ligands and M pro -co-crystalized ligand complexes utilizing Maestro v12.2 ( Table 2 ). The DGbind (kcal/mol) of all the interactions were reported in order to understand the binding affinities between the ligands and the receptor to provide an insight into the stability of the ligands in the active site of M pro using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. We computationally estimated the binding energy of the co-crystalized ligand to be À48.56 kcal/mol. The binding energy of lopinavir (À85.83 kcal/mol) to the Mpro appears to be the lowest among the ligands estimated followed by plerixafor (À75.78 kcal/mol). Pradimicin and lamivudine showed relatively higher (À45.89 and À34.94 kcal/mol, respectively) when compared to the co-crystalized ligand. The binding free energy determination, based on Prime MM-GBSA, established the stability of M pro -ligands complexes.The simulation interaction diagram of Schrodinger suit was used to analyze and survey the protein-ligand interactions for the desmond molecular dynamic trajectory carried out on M pro and the studied ligands' complexes. (3) 2 GLU166, GLN189 and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are a widely used method for the exploration of novel inhibitors against a target protein (Jani and Dalafave, 2012) . MD simulation provides information regarding the time dependent behavior of any molecular system by integrating Newton's laws of motion (Mandlik and Singh, 2016) . The stability of the docked complexes were determined by performing an MD simulation as previously described (Al-Shabib et al., 2018; AlAjmi et al., 2018) . The protein-ligand root mean square deviation (PL-RMSD) was used to measure the scaler distance between M pro and the ligands throughout the trajectory (100 nsecs) and also to evaluate the evolvement of the Ca protein backbone as well as the protein and ligand RMSD over the course of 100 nsecs period. All the protein frames were initially aligned on the reference frame backbone and then the RMSDs were calculated based the Ca, the protein and the ligands. Monitoring the RMSD of M pro provided insights into the structural conformation throughout the 100 nsecs. Furthermore, it was used to evaluate the equilibration of the complexes and its fluctuation directly to simulation within the sum of thermal average.shows the PL-RMSD of the co-crystalized ligand (X77) and studied ligands, respectively, in the active site of M pro over the 100 nsecs simulation. This illustrates the super positioning or fitting as well as measuring the RMSD using the protein and ligand's heavy atoms. The ligand RMSD shows the stability of X77 as well as the studied ligands with respect to the protein binding pocket that is, the internal fluctuation within the ligands' structures is low. MD simulation of the docked complexes protein backbone RMSD plots indicate the stability of the ligands in the active site of the M pro . The ligands' backbone RMSD plots indicate that all the four ligands are comparable to the co-crystalized ligand and maintained their interactions with M pro .The characterization of the local fluctuation of the protein was further investigated using the protein root mean square fluctuation (P-RMSF) as depicted in Figures 5(B) and 7. The peaks indicate the areas of the protein that fluctuate the most during the simulation period with respect to residue location (the X-axis). Additionally, the ligands' contacts were shown in bars. This corresponds to the protein residues interacting with the ligands. 31 residues of the M pro were involved in the contacts of pradimicin A and plerixafor. With respect to 14 contacts with the X77, lamivudine and lopinavir interacted with 19 and 21 Mpro residues, respectively. Figure 5(C) shows the Ligand RMSF which explains how the ligands fragment interact with M pro and the entropic role in their binding events. Most of the atoms of the X77 (Figure 5(C) ), plerixafor and pradimicin A (not shown) showed a high degree of fluctuation due to the fact that the atoms are solvent exposed and are able to rotate easily around the atom bonds and interact with water. Atoms of lamivudine and lopinavir (not shown) are buried deeply in the binding pocket of M pro with less chance to rotate freely and thus, have lower fluctuation.The timeline of the contacts of the residues of the M pro to X77 over the 100 nsecs period as well as the time of contact (X-axis), the specific residues (Y-axis) and number of contacts (color intensity) were shown in Figure 5 (D). The M pro -ligands interaction was monitored throughout the simulation as presented in Figures 5(E) and 8 for the co-crystalized ligand as well as the studied ligands, respectively. These interactions or the amount of times the ligands made contact with M pro were categorized into four types: Hydrogen Bonds, Hydrophobic, Ionic and Water Bridges (Ojo et al., 2020) . The result of the M pro -ligands complexes were compared with Mpro-co-crystalized ligand and observed that the contacts made with M pro were three namely; Hydrogen Bonds, Hydrophobic, and Water Bridges. GLU166 was maintained almost throughout the period of simulation with hydrogen bond and water bridges. In comparison with the four ligands used in this study, several amino acids were constantly in contact with M pro but the residues ASN142, GLY143, GLN189, GLN192, and GLN166 were significantly in contact with M pro . Residues SER46 and ASN142 were significantly common to Lopinavir, Pradimicin A, and Plerixafor maintained 90%contacts M pro over the period of the simulation time.Computational biology entails in silico investigation which is an essential arm of biotechnology focused at enhancing a deeper insight of biomolecular interactions in order to address cellular disease pathogenesis whilst having immense contribution towards design and development of possible therapeutic candidates (Abdullahi et al., 2017) . Indeed, this technique have assisted in identifying lead compounds for various diseases Shanmuga Priya et al., 2018; . On the other hand, the emergence and sporadic spread of COVID-19 has called for the urgent identification of novel drug and/or repurposing of existing available chemotherapeutic agents against this pandemic. The virus polyprotein encodes two proteases, the 3-C-like protease (main protease) and a papain-like protease, both are vital targets for drug discovery platforms against coronaviruses (Kandeel and Al-Nazawi, 2020) . Accordingly, the M pro is the most probable antiviral candidate due to its crucial role in self-maturation and ensuing development of polyproteins (Muralidharan et al., 2020) . Hence, we explored the molecular implications of blocking the activity of M pro using compounds (Pradimicin A, Lamivudine, Plerixafor and Lopinavir) that have been shown to possess pharmacological activity against viruses.In view of the aforementioned, we redocked the 6W63 with its co-crystalized ligand using the Glide XP docking protocol.With the receptor grid and extra precision option in the precision mode, X77 was docked into the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro receptor. The M pro -X77 redocked complex was used as an input for the e-pharmacophore to generate a hypothesis. The initial number for pharmacophore site generation was set to default; however, five pharmacophore sites were predicted, and the final hypothesis consisted of three aromatic rings (R9, R10, and R11) and two H-bond acceptors (A3 and A4) as shown in Figure 2 (E). The quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) of this enzyme (M pro ) also known as novel 3C-like protease (3CLpro) was developed using a multi-linear regression (MLR) based 2D-QSAR model for the identification of important structural features responsible for the inhibition of Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 infections using eight significant descriptors classified as topological, 2D atom pair, functional group count, and atom entered fragment descriptors (Kumar and Roy, 2020) . The study reported that molecules or ligands consisting of features such as O-S fragments and thiophene rings could contribute to higher M pro enzyme inhibitory activity, and the presence of pyridine rings, methylene groups connected with the highly electronegative atoms, imides (including thioimides) group, and N-O fragment may lower the inhibitory activity for 3CLpro enzyme. Based on this context, the features that negatively influence the inhibitory activity against M pro are not contained in the studied ligands' structures and thus the ligands may have high M pro enzyme inhibitory activities.Pharmacophore-based screening was performed against the ligands in order to determine M pro inhibitors with desired chemical features and to compensate for the QSAR due to limited dataset in this study. The generated hypothesis can be used in a virtual-based screening study to generate additional inhibitors of M pro if they satisfy a minimum match of four sites on the generated e-pharmacophore hypothesis.Subsequently, molecular docking using the Glide molecular tool revealed that Lopinavir bound to the active site with the highest affinity and lowest free energy with a Glide score of À9.2 kcal/mol; suggesting that it could be a vital inhibitor of protease activity of coronavirus . Following Lopinavir in terms of excellent binding affinity for M pro is Lamivudine; having a glide score of À5.3 kcal/mol. Earlier studies have shown this compound to be a potent anti-viral agent and it has been proposed for COVID-19 treatment due to its ability to impair DNA synthesis (Lai et al., 2020) . Jarvis et al. (Jarvis and Faulds, 1999) highlighted Lamivudine as an excellent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and suppresses viral replication in HIV patients. Interestingly, Lamivudine fulfilled the five Lipinski's rule in our study. In light of the anti-viral activity of Plerixafor, we repurposed it for the management of COVID-19. Plerixafor had a glide score of À3.7 kcal/mol against the SARS-CoV-2 M pro , a score lower than the co-crystallized ligand. Nevertheless, this compound is an antagonist to C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4) (Keating, 2011) , with anti-HIV activities. It inhibits the attachment of the virus to the host cell. Amongst all the docked M pro -ligand complexes, the M pro -Pradimicin A complex had the lowest binding affinity of À2.4 kcal/mol. However, it has been shown to possess inhibitory activities against virus infection/replication. Importantly, the anti-viral mechanism of action of Pradimicin A is through binding to mannose residue (Tanabe-Tochikura et al., 1990) and recent studies have documented anti-HIV and anti-coronavirus ( Van der Meer et al., 2007) properties for this compound.Finally, docking of the ligands with the Mpro revealed their binding modes. To account for the flexibility of Mpro and ligands and to evaluate their binding affinity with Mpro, the MD simulation of the docked complexes were carried out at three different time points (1.2 nsecs, 10 nsecs and 100 nsecs) in order to avoid false positive result of the stability result (only the 100 nsecs was reported in this study). Binding mode analysis revealed that the binding modes obtained after MD simulation were more or less similar to that obtained after docking. The presence of a large number of H bond acceptors, H bond donors as well as hydrophobic groups in the ligands account for the stability of the ligand inside the binding pocket of Mpro. Based on the RMSD of the ligand-protein complexes, it was confirmed that ligands maintained their interaction with Mpro with lower root mean square fluctuations.Globally, various research institutions and hospitals are on a quest to identify suitable drug targets to stop/manage SARS-CoV-2. However, using the traditional methods for identification of drug targets for COVID-19 might not be viable as the disease is already crippling the health care resources. Hence, anti-viral drugs are repurposed for immediate attention. This have proven to be the most expensive exercise as the drugs did not behave as hypothesized. As such, Bioinformatics could serve as a tool to screen potential drug activity before use. Accordingly, computational drug design and repurposing has laid a foundation for researchers to investigate various chemotherapeutic agents towards identifying potent drug candidates for clinical trials.Our study revealed that all the antiviral drugs had satisfactory binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Amongst all the inhibitors, Lopinavir had the best binding score while pradimicin A had the lowest binding score for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . These results were comparable after we used molecular dynamics simulation to validate the stability of all the ligand-receptor complexes. The ligands bound steadily to M pro active site and restricted the target movement. GLU166 was found to be an important residue in the active site of M pro necessary for binding. Furthermore, Lamivudine warrants an in-depth investigation taking into account its binding affinity for M pro and fulfilment of the Lipinski's rule of five. It is worth noting that this is the first report that indicated the inhibitory effect of Pradimicin A and Plerixafor against the M pro , and could serve as potential drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, these data can be utilized in drug repurposing pipelines in the continued search for SARS-CoV-2 therapy with high efficacy. The QSAR of these ligands alongside other dataset is recommended for further analysis in order to provide the structure features against the inhibitory activities of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ).","South Africa","first author","2020-11-17","11"

These viruses are of zoonotic origin, highly contagious, and infective and effective reproductive numbers [1, 2] . The two major coronaviruses that had attracted public health attention globally were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2009 [3] . These viruses have high mortality and infectivity and were restricted to Asia, the Middle East, and spread to a few countries via the movement of people [4] . 9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55 56Genomic sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-CoV are 94.6% similar in amino acid sequence and 80% nucleotide sequence similarity [5] . However, SARS CoV-2 is more related to bat SARS-CoV (96.2% nucleotide similarity) than human SARS-CoV (79.0%) [6, 7] . Because of these similarities, the novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 [8] . The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, body pain, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat, difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, loss of speech or movement, and gastrointestinal syndrome [9, 10] , with people presenting the asymptomatic form of the disease in Nigeria and other African countries [11] .The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC-Pandemic) on January 30, 2020. Currently, COVID-19 has spread to over 200 countries and territories, with over 7.5 million cases and 4,19,568 deaths globally [12, 13] as of June 2020. In Nigeria, the first reported COVID-19 case was in Lagos on February 27, 2020, while the number of cases and death had gradually increased. As of June 12, 2020, COVID-19 cases in Nigeria have reached 15181 and 399 deaths, including healthcare workers [14] .Globally, healthcare workers are at the forefront in the containment of COVID-19 outbreak, diagnosis, and management of infected patients. Unfortunately, healthcare workers had also been the source and means of nosocomial and community transmission [15] . The burden of the disease in both developed and developing countries had worsened the response and management strategies due to inadequate provision of personal protection equipment for healthcare workers, environmental contamination, overcrowding, and inadequate provision of proper isolation facilities [16] . Thus, to mitigate the increasing number of COVID-19 cases require the HCWs' adherence to the recommended measures taken to prevent transmission. These measures are affected mainly by knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of the frontline workers [17] .In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of laboratories-confirmed cases is still relatively low compared to other continents. This picture might be due to low testing capacity and a lack of an active surveillance system. The few confirmed cases require an excellent isolation centre, waste management, and environmental decontamination, counselling from the mental health and psycho-social support experts, and public health education. To achieve an effective response and curtailing the transmission within hospital and community settings, it may require the public health awareness campaign through risk communication and community engagement activities within the target population of the HCWs and host communities. Based on our observation, using a questionnaire administered study approach, we assessed the KAPs of healthcare workers towards the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria and the KAPs analyses as the way forward in policymaking.We conducted a cross-sectional survey among healthcare workers within the six geo-political zones in Nigeria from April to May 2020 in major cities in Nigeria due to the national response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country.In line with the principles of social distancing and curtail the spread of SARS-Cov-2, an online survey (Google form; https://forms.gle/uUQCHh xGD3yAQqTo6) was used to collect data. Google form allows questionnaire design, data collection, descriptive analysis of results, and download data via an excel spreadsheet for further analysis.Epi. Info TM was used to calculate the sample size of 346 subjects to fulfil our research objectives at a 95% confidence level. Other criteria for sample calculation include the assumption of a 50% prevalence of proper knowledge and attitude, 5% bound-on error, and a 10% non-response rate. We used a convenience sampling method. The study population eligible for participation in this survey were HCWs, including Medical doctors, Veterinary doctors, Public Health officers, pharmacists, medical laboratory scientists and nurses, and others. Nigerians nationals of age 20 years or more were invited to participate. We identified 22 active HCWs WhatsApp groups in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria and contacts of individuals in the contact list of the authors. A total of 2500 HCWs in the twenty-two WhatsApp groups and contacts of the authors were approached to participate in the survey. Response acceptance was closed when the required sample size of 346 was attained.The research ethics committee of the Borno State Hospital Services, Ministry of Health, Maiduguri, Nigeria, approved our study protocol (MHSEC/03/2020/00022). A consent note was not required. The submission of the online answer to the questionnaire was considered as consent to take part in the study.A survey instrument was designed based on previous KAPs study on COVID-19 [18] , course material regarding coronavirus disease outbreaks including the current COVID-19 pandemic by WHO [13] , and guidelines issued by Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) [19] . The questionnaire consisted of four (4) parts:Part one (1). Demographic characteristics of respondents. Demographic variables include gender, age category, religion, years of service in healthcare, the region of residence, and speciality. Part two (2) . Knowledge of respondents on COVID-19. Questions in this part included eight questions on sources of COVID-19 information, transmission, prevention and control, zoonotic nature, myths, and biocontainment.The knowledge questions consisted of both dichotomous and Likert scales. Likert scales were converted to dichotomous scale (strongly agree and agree ¼ agree and was assigned a score of 1; neutral, disagree and strongly disagree ¼ disagree with a score of 0). For dichotomous questions (yes or no, true or false and I don,t know), a correct answer was scored 1 point while an incorrect answer was scored 0 points. The total knowledge score range from zero to eight; the mean knowledge score of 0-4.99 was considered poor knowledge and a mean score of 5-8 was considered good knowledge of COVID-19. Part three (3) . The attitude of respondents towards COVID-19. This part consisted of 6 questions on the wrong impression, faith healing, and confidence as it affects most regions in Nigeria because of the religious nature of the people of Nigeria. Six dichotomous questions measured attitude among HCWs towards COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. A correct answer corresponded to a positive attitude and was scored 1 point while A negative attitude corresponded to an incorrect answer and was scored 0 points. Attitude score range from 0-6. A mean score of 0-3.99 was considered poor or unacceptable attitude while a mean score of 4-6 was assigned a good, acceptable or positive attitude. Part four (4) . The practice of respondents towards COVID-19. The questions in this part seek to collect data on methods of prevention and control of COVID-19. Five questions measured practices of HCWs towards COVID- 19 . An incorrect answer was scored zero points while a correct answer was scored 1 point. The practice score range from 0-5. A mean practice score of 0-2.99 was considered poor, and a mean practice score of 3-5 was regarded as good practice.We conducted a pilot study to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire before its use. Initially, five experts in the field of epidemiology and research from two universities in Nigeria evaluated the questionnaire to assess the degree to which items in the questionnaires are relevant and can correctly measure the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the healthcare workers in Nigeria on the subject of COVID-19. We reviewed the questionnaire and effected the correction suggested by the experts. Afterword, the surveys were then sent to 30 participants who filled the questionnaire. The data were used to assess internal reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The results showed internal reliability (with Cronbach's alpha ¼ 0.65).Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and later imported into SPSS V.16 for statistical analysis. Inferential statistics were applied depending upon the nature of data and variables. We used Student's t and ANOVA tests to determine the relationship between mean knowledge score and mean attitude score and socio-demographic variables. In the case of a significant ANOVA test, post hoc analysis (LSD) was performed for multiple comparisons between every two categories. Chi-square tests were applied to find a difference in attitude and practice (good vs poor) by demographic characteristics. The authors used Spearman's rho correlation test to find the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05 (two-sided).We developed the formula below to calculate the mean knowledge and attitude scores:where: MS ¼ Mean score (Knowledge or attitude) NR ¼ Number of response by a particular variable, e.g. male. NQ ¼ total number of questions nRd ¼ total number of respondents.Three hundred and forty-six (346) healthcare workers in Nigeria participated in this survey. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study participants. More than two-thirds of the respondents were male 249 (72.0%), 214 (61.8%) belong to the age group 30-39 years, those that had worked for 6-10 years in healthcare services were 145 (41.9%), HCWs in the Northeast and North Central Nigeria was 113 (32.7%) and 104 (30.1%) respectively. Veterinary doctors were 120 (34.7%), while Medical doctors represent 67 (19.4%).All participants agreed to have heard about COVID-19. The most important sources of COVID-19 information were social media and television ( Figure 1 ). The correct rate of the eight questions on knowledge range from 77.7 -96.9% ( Table 2 ). The overall knowledge score of healthcare workers in Nigeria was 7.1 (SD: 0.45; Range: 0-8), the correct overall rate of the knowledge score was 88.75% (7.1/8). Knowledge score significantly differs (0.019) among faithful of different religious bodies. Christianity and Islam had scores of 7.2 AE 0.46 and 7.0 AE 0.62, while HCW, who do not have religion scored 6.0 AE 1.23 (Table 3 ).The attitude score on a scale of 0-6 varies significantly across age groups (p ¼ 0.014) and years of experience in healthcare service (p ¼ 0.001). Healthcare workers within the age group 50 and above had an attitude score of 4.57 AE 0.60, which was lower than HCWs in other age categories combined. Also, those who had 31 and above years of experience in healthcare services had a lower attitude score (3.71 AE 1.04) compared with those with lower years of experience ( Table 3 ). The rate of positive attitude towards COVID-19 ranges from 271 (78.3%) to 326 (94.2%). Table 4 showed Healthcare workers' demographic characteristics and attitudes towards COVID-19. Although there was a statistically significant difference among the age group (χ 2 ¼ 18.360, p ¼ 0.005) and health professionals (χ 2 ¼ 21.501; p ¼ 0.001), a vast majority (92.2%) believed that COVID-19 was not a biological weapon against people in African. The age group 26-30 and work experience for 31 and above believed that SARS-COV-2 was invented to reduce the African population was 22.2% and 28.6%, respectively. Also, among health professionals, Nurses (13.6%) and pharmacists (37.5%) agreed that COVID-19 was a biological weapon against Africans. The majority (78.3%) of participants agreed that faith healing is not the only cure for COVID-19. When asked concerning faith healing as the only cure for COVID-19, it was observed that there was significant difference across years of experience (χ 2 ¼ 33.311; p ¼ 0.000), health professionals (χ 2 ¼ 37.120 (0.000) and geopolitical zones (χ 2 ¼ 13.563; p ¼ 0.019). The attitude of HCWs towards congregating in large crowd differs significantly across age group (χ 2 ¼ 12.925; p ¼ 0.005), years of experience (χ 2 ¼ 19.447; p ¼ 0.003) and health 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 professionals (χ 2 ¼ 18.018; p ¼ 0.006). The majority (92.5%) of the participants in this study have confidence that medical scientists will defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. The response toward overcoming COVID-19 pandemic differs significantly across age group (χ 2 ¼ 35.749; p ¼ 0.000), years of service (χ 2 ¼ 14.313; p 0.003), health professionals (χ 2 ¼ 24.617; p ¼ 0.000) and geopolitical zones (χ 2 ¼ 11.201; p ¼ 0.048).Overall, most of the participants agreed that personal hygiene measures could reduce the risk of SARS-COV-2 infections. Washing hands after handling sick persons/animals (96.0%), wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (91.6%), washing of hands after handling pets/ companion animals (96.0%), and proper covering of mouth when coughing and sneezing (90.5%). Generally, the practice of wearing a face mask when leaving home (59.2%) among HCW in this study was poor ( Table 2 ).There were significant (χ 2 ¼ 21.501, P ¼ 0.001) differences among healthcare professionals with regards to the washing of hands after handling infected persons or animals. One hundred per cent of veterinary doctors and pharmacists said that they wash their hands after handling sick animals or persons. However, Nurses (18.2%) and Medical Laboratory Scientist (10.0%) do not wash hands after handling ill persons or animals. There were significant differences (χ 2 ¼ 8.753, P ¼ 0.000) among healthcare professionals on the issue of wearing PPE when handling specimens from persons with COVID-19. Medical doctors (20.9%) and Nurses (22.7%) do wear PPE when handling specimens from persons with signs of COVID-19. Furthermore, we also observed significant differences (χ2 ¼ 14.275, P ¼ 0.027) among the different health professionals concerning the use of a face mask when leaving home. Medical doctors (53.2%) Veterinary doctors (55.8%) and others (42.3%) had poor practice on the use of face masks when leaving home (Table 5) . Table 6 shows the relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and practice. There was significantly positive correlation (r ¼ 0.584; p ¼ 0.046) between knowledge and attitude. Further details are presented in the supplementary data (Suppl.1).To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first studies in Nigeria that thoroughly assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Healthcare workers (HCWs) towards COVID-19. In this study, over 70% of the respondents were male, more than 30% were from north-central and north-eastern Nigeria, respectively. Veterinary doctors (34.7%) and medical doctors (19.4%) had the highest participants in the study.Our findings showed that most HCWs in Nigeria had a good understanding of COVID-19. The outcome is not unrelated to the current national response activities by the Nigerian Center for Disease Control and Prevention/Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (NCDC/PTF). The mean knowledge score by the respondents was 7.1, representing 88.8% (7.1/8). The mean knowledge score was significantly (p > 0.05) lowest among respondents who do not have religion. The reason for the difference in mean knowledge score among religious and non-religious adherents was beyond the scope of the study scope and off-course for a reason not clearly understood. However, the mean knowledge score in this study was not statistically different among the different age groups and categories of years of work experience. However, a study in Egypt reported that the age group 50 and above had a lower mean knowledge 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 score of COVID-19 [17] . A previous study in Pakistan reported significant (p > 0.05) difference among age groups for the COVID-19 mean knowledge score [20] . A study among internet users in Bangladesh reported a high mean knowledge score among age groups 30 years and above compared to other age categories [21] . The knowledge about COVID-19 was gained by respondents mostly through television and social media. The improvement in technology and the ease of accessing information online and television may explain the high level of knowledge of HCWs in this study that relied on these means of communication to obtain information about COVID-19. This result was consistent with previous studies in Nigeria [22, 23] . The wide media coverage of COVID-19 by WHO, Federal and state government in Nigeria, and strict preventive and control measures imposed by the government and its agencies (NCDC) may be responsible for the high mean knowledge score by respondents in this study. Also, the practice of posting and reposting of professional information in the social media group page such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter accounts may be a second reason. Currently, there is no treatment against COVID-19 globally; HCWs play a vital role in the management, control, and prevention of the spread of the disease. Good knowledge of HCWs on the transmission and preventive measures against SAR-CoV-2 can help to improve their skills to limit occupational risk and further spread to the community [24] . However, precautions are necessary when using social media as sources of medical knowledge because of information overload [25] , lack of peer review, and misleading information. A previous study reported the possibility that there exist dual pandemic, COVID-19 pandemic, and a pandemic of infodemic [20] , which may seriously jeopardize response efforts to contain the spread of the virus. The result obtained in this study were similar to the previous report in China [18] ; Italy [26] ; Egypt [17] ; Pakistan [20] , and Nigeria [22, 23] , in which social media and television served as the major sources of COVID-19 information.The attitudes of HCWs influence their practice of infection, prevention, and control measures against COVID-19. In this study, we assessed the attitude of HCWs about their acceptance of beliefs and misconceptions. Such as African are immune to COVID-19 because of their genetic makeup, SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon to reduce the population of Africa, COVID-19 is a punishment from God because people have sinned. Faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. The acceptance of these negative attitudes in the community by HCWs may jeopardize the effort to contain the spread of the disease. Also, the community looks up to HCWs as role models in respect of practices and attitudes toward health.Our finding revealed that 88.5% of the study participants demonstrated a positive attitude towards COVID-19. There was significant (p ¼ 0.014) differences among age groups and mean attitude scores. Age group 50-59 years had the lowest mean attitude score compare to the age group 20-39 years. Our findings revealed that the mean attitude score differs significantly (p > 0.05) concerning years of experience. Those who had 31 and above years of experience had the lowest mean attitude score. The differences in mean attitude score may be because young HCWs with few years of experience are more likely to seek new knowledge than the older HCWs with long years of experience. Our findings differ with the previous study in Pakistan in which the mean attitude score was found not to differ significantly (p < 0.05) with age or years of experience in healthcare services [20] . Interestingly, our study revealed a significant correlation between knowledge score and attitude. This finding is consistent with the report by Saqlain et al. [20] .Despite the effort of the WHO and relevant government agencies on the origin of SARS-Cov-2, 22.2% and 28.6% of HCWs of young age experienced HCWs believed that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon against Africans. Also, 37% of pharmacists said that COVID-19 was a biological weapon. Generally, 27 (7.8%) of the respondents agreed that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon. This finding reflects the damaging effects of bad rumours and misconceptions. False information was circulating on social media and the internet in Nigeria, claiming that COVID-19 was a biological weapon to reduce the African population. In 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 another rumour, some researchers claimed that SARS-CoV-2 was created in laboratories (Praghan et al., 2020). An article titled ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2"" [2] dismissed the misconception that SARS-CoV-2 was a deliberate weapon. In a similar study in Egypt, Abdelhafiz et al. [17] reported a higher percentage (26.8%) of respondents who thought that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon created in a laboratory. The study further observed that misinformation aided by social media and the internet were the likely reason for the high rate. About 21.7% of the respondents thought that faith healing or prayers are the only cure for COVID-19. This number, although small, reflects the religious nature of the study participants. Nigerians are known to be so religious that they attribute religious motifs to almost everything that they do. Furthermore, their religiousness exemplified the way they view and respond to issues and realities in the world [27, 28] . Concerning attitude towards congregation in a large crowd at a place of worship, 94.2% of the respondents thought that it is wrong for people to gather in large crowds at places of worship. This result is a relevant finding because of the nature of transmission of COVID-19 [1, 29, 30] . The large congregation makes it easier for an infectious case to spread SARS-CoV-2 in crowded environments such as places of worship, markets, bus stations, train stations, and schools, [18, 29] . A similar finding was reported among the general public in China, where respondents agreed that avoiding crowded places is an important preventive measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [18] . The study demonstrated the willingness of HCWs to adapt to new changes and lifestyles in the face of the global pandemic.A large majority of the HCWs held positive attitudes towards winning the war against COVID-19. About 9 out of 10 respondents were confident that medical scientists in Nigeria would overcome COVID-19. The explanation for the high level of confidence by the HCWs may be because of the success of Nigerian HCWs in tackling previous outbreaks like Ebola virus in 2014, the Avian influenza virus in 2007, and Rinderpest in the 80s [31, 32, 33, 34] .Although our findings did not report significant (p < 0.05) correlation between knowledge and practice, the results showed that HCWs in this study demonstrated good practice towards COVID-19. When asked Mean score with the different letters in the same column were significantly different (P > 0.05), * ¼ p > 0.05, **p > 0.01and ***p > 0.001. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 regarding measures that might help to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there was strong agreement among HCWs that washing of hands after handling pets or companion animals (96.0%) and wearing of personal protective equipment when handling specimen from suspected COVID-19 patient (91.6%) might help to prevent transmission. Although, as at the time of writing this article, the role of animals in the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 is yet unknown, people still engaged in a practice that can prevent transmission from their pets and companion animals. Concerning the washing of hands, 18.2% of nurses and 10.0% of medical laboratory scientists do not wash their hands after handling their pets or companion animals. The proportion of female 13 (13.4%) who do not wear PPE when handling specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients was significantly (χ 2 ¼ 4.420; p ¼ 0.035) higher than male 16 (6.4%). The difference observed in this study may be because of the difference in the availability and accessibility of PPE. In the face of scarcity, women are often at a disadvantage than men [35, 36] . Males in Nigeria are considered to have control over resources than females, unlike some Asian countries where women have more wealth than men [18] . In a similar study in China, females observed preventive measures than males against COVID-19 [18] . In another study in the United States, those who are living below the poverty level have a low perception of personal risk and limited ability to prevent infection [37] . Our finding showed that a large proportion of medical doctors (20.9%) and nurses (22.7%) do not use PPE when handling specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients. The reason for this practice among medical doctors and nurses in unclear. However, previous studies reported that allied healthcare workers have a higher knowledge of preventive practices against infectious diseases than medical doctors [20, 25] .When asked concerning the use of a face mask when leaving home, only 3 out of 5 respondents said that they use a face mask when leaving home. Our results agreed with a previous study in Malaysia, where the proportion of those who use a face mask when leaving home was above 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 50% [38] . The reason for this observation maybe because of the scarcity and cost of face mask during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria, and maybe a reflection of the global scarcity of face mask brought about by high demand and low production as a result of global lockdown [38, 39] . The CDC recommended the use of cloth face mask for the public [40, 41] . Another measure to manage the scarcity of face mask for use by health care workers by WHO was the recommendation that only COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 caregivers should use face mask [39] . In Nigeria, the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19 recommended the use of face masks by all irrespective of status. However, the PTF did not specify the type of face mask to be used by the general public. Though the standard recommended use of face mask is based on the risk assessment of healthcare workers. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65 66 67Our findings revealed that HCWs in Nigeria have good knowledge about COVID-19, and possess a positive attitude and good preventive practice to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The familiar sources of information on COVID-19 knowledge were social media and television. However, the practice of wearing a face mask when leaving home was poor among HCWs in this study. Also, the attitude among older HCWs and those with 31 and above years of experience was low. The results showed that there exists a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude and knowledge and practice. We recommended that public health education be targeted towards the categories of HCWs with high-risk practices and attitudes to achieve the necessary control measure been instituted by the government (risk assessment).Accessibility and availability of internet services in Nigeria is limited. Therefore, only those who can have access to the available internet were able to participate in the survey. The survey was only available on the contacts of the authors and those who use WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, and the internet. These represent a significant challenge to this study.Author contribution statement F.

According to an evaluation done in 2015, the world had a total of 7 billion mobile phone lines or numbers [1] . At the end of 2016, Ghana had a mobile phone subscription totaling 38.31 million [1] . Additionally, Ghana currently has the highest mobile phone penetration in West Africa [1] with mobile adoption rate of 55%, higher than the regional average of 45% [2] . Likewise, by the third quarter of 2019, Ghana's unique mobile subscribers were 16.7 million while smartphone devices and mobile phone internet users were 15.1 million and 10.7 million respectively [2] .According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report [3] , Ghana is among African countries suffering from critical shortage of frontline health staff including nurses and midwives [4] . The consequent effect of these limited frontline health staff on quality of healthcare delivery are not farfetched. In rural parts of SSA, frontline health staff shortage relates largely to nurses and midwives, who are the primary source of healthcare since medical doctors are few and will remain so in the foreseeable future. The capability of nurses and midwives in rural areas to provide high-quality healthcare thus remain a determinant of a country's health sector performance [5, 6] . Unfortunately, rural and peripheral regions such as Volta region are the most deprived and underserved when it comes to the quantity and quality frontline health workers [7] .Over the years, Ghana has witnessed unprecedented increases in nursing and midwifery trainee enrolments to bridge the staffing deficits in the country [6, 7] . Nonetheless, these increases are a potential threat to the quality of pre-service training due to an overwhelmed physical infrastructure for training schools coupled with inadequate teaching staff, learning materials such as textbooks and clinical mannequins for simulations [8, 9] .In light of these constraints, digital innovations like elearning are increasingly embraced by countries across the globe to enhance the quality of pre-service training for frontline health staff [8] . Digital innovations such as elearning have the potential to create a learner-centered environment that is interactive, collaborative, situational and learner-relevant [10] . Traditional teacher-centered learning conversely situates the teacher in an active role while students take a more passive or receptive role [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .Digital innovations such as e-learning allow for a shared space for groups to interact in ways not known before such as Wikis, Blogs and group Live Chats. Digital innovations like e-learning can therefore be a highly effective method in nursing and midwifery education in developing countries like Ghana [19] . Moreover, empirical studies suggest that successful implementation of e-learning projects depends strongly on the design of such interventions. E-learning innovations are more likely to succeed when they are adapted to the needs and preferences of the various target user groups, embedded in established social practices [20] .This paper reports on the outcome of an exploratory study on the feasibility of a digital innovative e-learning pilot project for frontline health trainees in one of Ghana's public universities. An illustration of the planned elearning pilot project is shown in Fig. 1 . The study explored preparedness and feasibility conditions among students in terms of mobile phone take-up and patterns of use among students; use of existing e-learning applications; social media and networks for learning purposes.This is a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted to determine the preparedness and feasibility of implementing a pilot e-learning project. The study design is deemed appropriate because it promotes coverage of larger sample size and enhances generalizability of the findings to similar study populations. The design also enables the researchers to describe and examine associations between key variables of interest.The study was conducted in a public university solely dedicated to the training of healthcare professionals (name withheld to maintain anonymity) The university is located in the Volta region. The Volta region is one of the 16 administrative regions in Ghana and it lies on the eastern side of the country. The region shares geographic boundaries with the Republic of Togo to the east; the Greater Accra, Eastern and Brong-Ahafo regions to the west; the Oti region to the north and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. The region has a total land area of 20,570 square kilometers, representing approximately 9% of the total land area of Ghana. According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC), the Volta region share of the estimated 30 million Ghanaians was 8.6%.At the time of conducting this study, the university had a population of about 5,000 students and about 600 teaching and non-teaching staff. The University has six schools including the School of Nursing and Midwifery. This school is the most populous school constituting over 50% of the entire university population and about 30 teaching and non-teaching staff. The nursing and midwifery school has three departments namely: Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health Nursing. The school offers three streams of programs: regular (for high school graduates), Sandwich (for practicing nursing staff with auxiliary certificates) and Top-up (for practicing nursing staff with professional certificates).The study randomly recruited undergraduate students (henceforth called health trainees) of the nursing and midwifery school because of the focus on nursing and midwifery pre-service training. Total list of eligible students was obtained from all three departments (General Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health Nursing) across all the four years of study (i.e. years 1 -4). Determination of the sample size was based on Krejcie and Morgan [21] statistical tool for determining sample size based on known population. This statistical tool gives the recommended sample size for a finite population at 95% level of confidence. Based on Krejcie and Morgan [21] formula, the sample size of 300 was deemed representative of the estimated student population of about 3,000 in the nursing and midwifery school. Moreover, the sample size of 300 accounted for a 5% non-response rate.Eligible respondents were health trainees aged 18 years and above; pursuing their studies in the school of nursing and midwifery and finally respondents who voluntarily consented to participate. Exclusion criteria included health trainees from other schools apart from the school of nursing and midwifery, and health trainees who were not registered for the academic at the time of conducting this study (i.e. health trainees on leave of absence or deferment of their programme of study).Structured questionnaire was developed to ascertain preparedness, acceptability, adaptability and feasibility of an e-learning pilot project for nursing and midwifery trainees. The development of the data collection was based on a grounded theory approach [22] where previous qualitative engagements with the target respondents generated thematic areas on feasibility of a pilot elearning project. Thus, the survey tool was developed based on findings from these earlier qualitative face-toface interviews but findings of these qualitative studies are yet to be published. Additionally, field visits were done to other nursing and midwifery schools in six other regions in Ghana in 2011, 2016 and 2017 and 2016 in Zambia. The grounded theory approach is an acceptable strategy for developing trustworthy data collection tools which have not necessarily undergone psychometric testing [22] .Additionally, to promote internal validity and reliability of questionnaire items, Cronbach's alpha was checked and the scale reliability coefficient was found to be above the 0.80 rule of thumb [23] . Also, the questionnaires development was guided by the research objectives followed by piloting among students with similar characteristics of the study participants. The pilot showed that all questions were understood as intended by the researchers without ambiguity. Independent peer-review and validation of the questionnaire was also done by external reviewers to promote internal validity of the tool.The questionnaire comprised of eight sections namely: Section A (background information of respondents); Section B (Preparedness Proxy 1: Mobile Phone Ownership and Usage of Applications); Section C (Preparedness Proxy 2: Use of Mobile Phones and Related Devices for Education/Academic Purposes); Section D (Preparedness Proxy 3: Rated Satisfaction with Current University ICT Infrastructure (Computer Laboratory)); Section E The study was conducted between 24 th July and 8 th August 2017, by administering 300 paper questionnaires to the eligible respondents at random from the list of students in the School's register. Next, codes were assigned to all target students of the School. Written pieces of paper were randomly picked (without replacement) by a blinded research assistant. Subsequently, the randomly sampled students were contacted via phone by research assistants and questionnaire administered to those who voluntarily agreed to participate. Students who refused to participate were replaced by randomly picking a replacement from the pool of eligible respondents in the school's register.Data were first captured onto Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, cleaned and coded before analysis with STATA (version 12). Descriptive statistical analyses (means, frequencies and percentages) were run to compare relevant variables of interest. Pictural representation of the data was also presented in bar charts as appropriate. Statistical significance was determined at 95% confidence level.In total, 300 structured questionnaires were administered to respondents out of which 233 were correctly completed and returned, representing a response rate of 78%. It was found that one in two respondents were enrolled in a nursing course for either 2-years, 3-years or 4-years. Also, 42% of the respondents were pursuing a midwifery course, and 9% were in a public health nursing programme. Three in four respondents were females. In terms of age distribution, respondents' ages ranged from a minimum of 20 years to an upper limit of 45 years. The mean age was approximately 30 years (see Table 1 ).All 233 respondents stated that they owned a smartphone; the most common brands owned were Samsung, Techno, Infinix, and ITEL; it was found that WhatsApping was the most frequently used function of smartphones by respondents on daily basis followed internet voice, phone calls, social network texting and short messaging services (SMS). The least used function was listening to radio (see Fig 2) . Also, it was discovered that 18% of respondents used their smartphone for 20 minutes or less per day, whereas 11% used their phones for 21-30 minutes. Also, it was observed that 35% of respondents used their smartphones for 31-60 minutes and 36% used their phones for more than one hour in a day. Additionally, 61% of the respondents used at least five applications each day (see Figure 3 ).The results further showed that 88% of the respondents used WhatsApp on daily basis. Additionally, 86% of the respondents used their phones to access the internet on daily basis. Social media networks such as Facebook was mentioned by 76% of the respondents. Out of the 233 respondents, 60% of them mentioned they used existing ""e-learning school content"".Moreover, the results showed that ""searching for information on the internet"" was the most widely and frequently used purpose of smartphones and their applications, followed by ""reading"". The interviews also revealed that lecturers often asked students to obtain complementary learning materials such as YouTube videos from the internet. However, the respondents indicated that no specific websites were given to help find adequate and relevant sources of information on subject areas. The shortcoming of this practice, as reported by students was that the quality of the online material was not assessed and double checked beforehand by lecturers.Approximately 80% of the students used the smartphones for ""WhatsApp chatting"" and ""social networking"" (i.e. creation of learning groups). However, it was found that these usage patterns or behaviours were largely informal. Respondents specifically mentioned lack of established structures in the university to fully integrate such digital e-learning innovation tools in the routine teaching and learning practices.Moreover, it was found that the use of smartphones for recording lectures or documentation purposes was not widespread. Barely 33% of the respondents said they utilize this e-learning function of the smartphone. The types of phones used by many respondents did not have cameras that allowed them to take pictures and make audio recordings that are of sufficient quality for learning purposes (see Figure 4 ). Additionally, it was found that 78% of the respondents said the smartphone they used was either ""very good"" or ""good"" for communicating with parents, relatives or friends. Furthermore, use of the smartphones for ""learning"" was rated as either ""very good"" or ""good"" by 74% of the students. Use of smartphones to network with other students was rated as either ""very good"" or ""good"" by 65% of the respondents; 46% of the respondents considered the smartphone as ""very good"" or ""good"" for ""communicating with lecturers"" and ""working offline"" including making lecture notes (42%).The findings also revealed a significant variation in the average monthly expenditure on mobile charges; 21% of respondents said they spent approximately €1.80 per month; 25% spend between € 2.00 -3.60; 21% spent between € 3,78 -5.40; 13% spent between € 5.58 -7.20; 9% spent between € 7.37 -9.00 and 11% spent more than €9.Results on internet access showed that 50% of respondents said they accessed the internet ""several times"" per day; 42% said they do so ""at least once"" per day. Only three respondents stated they did not access the internet at all. It was observed that the most common means to access the internet by students was by their own smartphones or tablets (89%). Nearly a third of the respondents said they used their personal computers (i.e. desktops or laptops). Even though the university is equipped with a computer laboratory, only 9% of respondents used school-owned computers to access the internet (see Figure 5 ).It was also discovered that over 50% of respondents were from middle-income households, although there was substantial variation in this respect. The average personal budget students had per month was about €36.00 1 . Some students also reported complementing monthly remittance from parents/guardians with part time or menial jobs, in which case they reported an average personal budget of up to € 126.00.Moreover, it was observed that the most popular smartphones used by respondents (i.e. Techno, Infinix) cost between €54 -108. In terms of cost of using internet data, it was noticed that a data volume of 1GB per month cost approximately € 2.00; for approximately € 5.00 the respondents said they could get as much as 35GB per month. However, use of mobile data transfer was hampered by low availability of bandwidth and poor internet connectivity.This feasibility study was conducted several months before the outbreak of COVID-19 but the findings have demonstrated that proactive and novel innovations such as e-learning and m-learning solutions have the potential to enhance the preparedness of health educational institutions towards emergencies such as the COVID-19 global pandemic. As medical education evolves, there is the need for developing countries such as Ghana to adapt to emerging trends in technological innovations. This technological adaption will help improve on the quality of pre-service training for upcoming healthcare professionals. In effect, many more of these feasibility and preparedness studies are highly encouraged in Ghana and Africa at large to inform evidence-based policy decisions on these e-learning and m-learning innovations.Even though this paper reports mainly on a descriptive data, the findings remain important to local authorities in health institutions of higher learning in Ghana. The focus of this paper at this stage is for local stakeholders of institutions of higher learning who are engaged in the training of healthcare professionals. The expectation is that these results will provide first-hand feasibility and preparedness information to inform design and implementation of future e-learning interventions to promote quality pre-service training for healthcare professionals in Ghana. Lessons learnt from this local context could then be leveraged by other countries within and outside Africa with similar conditions.Overall, findings of this study suggest that a large percentage of respondents used a wide range of smartphones and applications for staying in touch with friends and getting things done in almost all spheres of life. The smartphone adoption rate in this study reflects the situation reported in previous studies on Ghana and other countries in developing settings [24] [25] [26] .It was also discovered that the use of smartphones for education-related activities was already widespread among nursing and midwifery students who participated in the study. This observation corroborates conclusions by previous studies on the topic [24] [25] [26] . These revelations appear to suggest frontline health trainees are apparently ready in terms of existing behavioral adjustment to the fastgrowing digital revolution catching up with many countries across the globe including countries with less endowed digital infrastructure such as Ghana [27] . The findings also revealed that majority of respondents had the motivation as well as the physical access required to use smartphones, and that they already used a range of applications for purposes related to their learning activities. These findings thus suggest preparedness of these health trainees for m-learning and e-learning innovations or pilot projects. Another important revelation was the amount of money the health trainees spent on their phones. The selfreported figures suggest expenditure on mobile phones, especially smartphones, makes up a substantial part of their total expenses on and off campus. However, since these figures were mainly self-reported without an independent verification, they should be interpreted with caution. The results generally point to the high utility of mobile phones, particularly, smartphones. Nonetheless, the high connectivity cost was found to be huge bottleneck to the health trainees. The findings thus suggest that even though the respondents appeared to be prepared in terms of high smartphone utilization and being already internet savvy, a potential implementation threat of an elearning innovation pilot project among these beneficiaries will be the high cost associated with internet connectivity.Another outcome of this preparedness and feasibility survey was that low availability of bandwidth posed a threat to sustainable implementation of an e-learning innovation pilot even though the findings showed health trainees' readiness in terms of behavior and acceptability of such intervention. In previous related studies [12, 28, 29] it was observed that even though network coverage (including 3G for mobile data services) was generally satisfactory in many communities of Ghana and other developing countries, the quality of access to the internet in terms of speed of data transfer was insufficient. Findings of this study thus corroborate these earlier conclusions.On the whole, albeit the average per capita expenditure on mobile phones for general and learning purposes was investigated, the figures quoted by respondents were not independently verified in this study. In light of this, the researchers are unable to rely on these self-reported subjective estimates. According to data from the latest Ghana Living Standards Report [30, 31] , the mean annual per capita expenditure in the Volta Region was approximately € 451.08 in 2014. This assumption is based on the estimation that these study participants in the Volta region (the study setting) spent an average of € 4.50 of their disposable income per month on mobile charges (i.e. € 53.96 per year) and that their spending budget is equal to the regional average where students would spend more than 10% of their total expenditure on mobile charges.The relatively high expenditure of respondents on communications including mobile phone services unfortunately does not commensurate the quality of internet and telecommunication services rendered to subscribers, largely due to poor ICT infrastructure. For instance, an empirical study by Alhassan et al [32] among health tutors in selected nursing and midwifery training schools in Ghana found, limited ICT infrastructure is not only a source of frustration to students and tutors but also an important barrier to quality teaching and learning in these training institutions. Similar studies on the use of mobile technology by health trainees [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and qualified personnel in clinical practice [32, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] revealed that even though the technology is highly beneficial there are constraints regarding its use especially lack of seamless internet connectivity and adaptation by relatively older cadre of health trainees. Findings of this feasibility and preparedness study offers the opportunity to leverage the high mobile phone penetration rate to improve on the quality of pre-service training for healthcare professionals through mobile and e-learning innovations.Even though the findings are largely descriptive and locally situated, they remain relevant to institutions of higher learning and health sector policy makers. Thus, the following policy recommendations are proposed for institutions of higher learning in Ghana and countries with similar conditions:1. Health training institutions should initiate policy dialogues on developing e-learning statutory policies to serve as the framework for rollout of e-learning programmes to make these institutions of higher learning globally competitive. Outbreak of COVID-19 has taught institutions of higher learning that elearning can be leveraged to respond effectively to global pandemics and minimise their effect on academic calendars of these institutions 2. Discussions should be initiated between major telecommunication companies in Ghana and the health training institutions of higher learning, in the spirit of public-private-partnership (PPP), to cocreate dedicated internet packages for students and faculty to promote the e-learning agenda. This arrangement could help reduce the per capita expenditure on telecommunication and internet services by beneficiaries and stimulate better utilization of e-learning services.should be institutionalized for students and faculty on emerging trends in e-learning to enhance interest and participation in this digital innovation 4. Finally, health training institutions of higher should create and ring-fence budgets for e-learning to help improve on existing ICT infrastructure and the human resource capacity to promote sustainability of e-learning innovations that are also resource intensive.Limitations associated with this study are hereby acknowledged. First, the paper reports on a feasibility study that may be largely useful for local stakeholders engaged in pre-service training of healthcare professionals. Unfortunately the findings might not be applicable or generalizable to other settings outside Ghana due to country specific peculiarities. Secondly, perhaps the respondents who consented to participate in the study might have induced self-selection since majority of the participants were within the youthful ages, owned smartphones and hence more likely to be ICT savvy. Also, the reported results are mainly descriptive to demonstrate the key preparedness and feasibility opportunities and threats to implementing e-learning innovations in the study setting. No rigorous statistical analyses were conducted at this stage. Likewise, the study was conducted in only one public institution out of over 20 institutions in Ghana. Likewise, only one out of the 16 administrative regions in Ghana was selected for this study which posed generalizability challenges.Moreover, social desirability bias is another potential limitation since some of the self-reported responses were not independently verified by the researchers. Perhaps some participants responded based on so called ""favorable responses"" to impress the researchers. Nonetheless, given the rigorous adherence to internal validity procedures, the tool remains trustworthy and valid.The findings of this study remain relevant to informing the policy directions on innovative strategies for preservice training of health trainees in Ghana and other countries with similar conditions. Nonetheless, it is recommended that future research endeavours should consider conducting full psychometric testing of the developed questionnaire to enhance the reliability and validity of the scale used in this current questionnaire.On the whole, there was high prevalence of mobile phone ownership among respondents and high level of preparedness for an e-learning intervention in terms of behavioral adaptability. It was especially observed that the use of smartphones for purposes of learning and exchange of academic information among peers was already an established practice among the study participants. Nonetheless, the main constraints were the low availability of bandwidth and lack of seamless internet connectivity across all telecommunication companies. Even though the average per capita expenditure on usage of the mobile phone was above the European average of 2.5%, subscribers unfortunately appeared not to get value for their money due to the poor quality of telecommunication and ICT services. This constraint is undoubtedly a threat to successful implementation of a future e-learning pilot project.It is concluded that mobile telephony/ICT space is a huge potential waiting to be fully tapped for effective pre-service training of health trainees in Ghana. Even though there is high preparedness and feasibility of an elearning pilot project in the study setting, policy implementers must recognize and address the potential threats of high service cost, poor internet connectivity and inadequate ICT infrastructure to make an e-learning project successful and sustainable. Not funding was secured for this study.There is no restriction to data availability. Data is available upon request.Ethics approval and consent to participate Prior administrative approval was sought from the University authorities. Voluntary informed consent was also sought from participants before administering the questionnaires. Codes were used in place of names to protect the identify of respondents and guarantee privacy and confidentiality. Participants were told they could withdraw from the study at any time without consequences and that their responses were not in any way linked to their academic grades. Teaching and non-teaching staff known to the students were not involved in the data collection to avoid powerrelations or conflict of interest situations. Data collected was secured with the lead investigator and protected with a password to protect the respondents' data.Not applicable.","Ghana","abstract","2020-11-25","11"

The first case was reported in the Hubei province of China on 29 th December 2019. 1 The disease has been recognized as a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, after cases had started to be seen outside China in less than two months. 2 On 13 March 2020, the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health was confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa. 3 According to a recent study, the virus spreads between individuals through respiratory droplets, direct contact with an infected individual, or indirect contact with surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with respiratory secretions. 4 The impacts of the pandemic are multidimensional; health, social, psychological, political, and economic. 5 Hotels, pensions, restaurants, and cafeterias are more susceptible to contagion because they are visited by many people who interact among themselves and with employees. 6 In addition, the transmissibility of COVID-19 virus from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients could lead to a higher probability of work-related transmission, as people with mild or no symptoms could continue to work or travel. 7 Thus, waiters are more susceptible to contagion, and can easily spread the infection to gusts and to communities where they live. Therefore, they should strictly comply with the basic protective behaviors against the pandemic. 4 In the absence of effective vaccination or treatment, active case finding and isolation, quarantine, travel restrictions, frequent hand washing, wearing of face masks, respiratory hygiene, avoiding public gatherings, and social distancing are the measures of choice. 8 However, the effectiveness of such measures fundamentally depends on the public willingness to cooperate, which in turn is influenced by public risk perception regarding the pandemic. [9] [10] [11] [12] Different health education and psychological models indicate that risk perception is a key driver of behaviors. [12] [13] [14] [15] People who perceive greater risk are more likely to implement protective behaviors, and this influences the probability of infection. [16] [17] [18] Thus, sound empirical data on how laypersons perceive the risks of newly emerged COVID-19 is essential to devise proper risk communication strategies. Moreover, though waiters are more at risk of contracting the infection, 15 information regarding their risk perception is scarce. Previous studies mainly focused on the general population. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] However, waiters working in different food and drinking establishments are more vulnerable to contract COVID-19 than the public because of the nature of their work. Thus, they may have different risk perceptions on the disease, and the engagements in preventive behaviors may also not be similar to the public. Hence, data regarding population are important to devise proper risk communication approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to assess risk perception concerning COVID-19 and its associated factors among waiters in selected towns of Bench-Sheko, Sheka, and West-Omo zones, southwest Ethiopia.This study was conducted among waiters working in hotels, pensions, restaurants and cafeterias found in Mizan-Aman, Tepi and Jemu towns from June 01 to 15/2020. The towns are located in Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People Regional State in the southwest part of Ethiopia. Mizan-Aman is the capital town of the Bench-Sheko zone and is located at 561 km from Addis Ababa. Jemu is the capital town of the West-Omo zone and is located 625km from Addis Ababa. Tepi is the capital town of Sheka zone and is found at 585 km from Addis Ababa. These towns were selected for the study because they are inhabited by a larger number of people, and there are high social mobilities because they are located in cash crops (coffee) producing areas, which make a conducive condition for the spread of COVID-19 virus.Cross-sectional study design was employed.All waiters working in hotels, pensions, restaurants, and cafeterias found in selected towns were a source population, while randomly selected waiters working in hotels, pensions, restaurants and cafeterias found in the selected towns were the study population. Waiters who were on duty in the selected institutions at the time of data collection were included in the study. All hotels, pensions, restaurants, and cafeterias in the specified towns that were licensed by the towns' trade and tourism offices were selected for the study.The sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula based on the assumptions of a 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and 50% of proportion of high-risk perception. A prevalence of 50% was taken because there was no similar study done in Ethiopia previously. After adding a 10% contingency for non-response, the final sample size became 422 waiters. Regarding the sampling procedure, based on the total number of establishments in each town, the sample size was proportionally allocated to the towns. Then, simple random sampling was employed to select 422 establishments. Finally, one waiter from each selected establishment was randomly recruited using the lottery method for the interview.A structured questionnaire was developed from related studies. 12, [18] [19] [20] The questionnaire has five parts: sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19, submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 preventive behaviors, risk perception, and self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 prevention measures. The questionnaire was prepared in English and translated to the local language ""Amharic"" and back to English to ensure consistency. The tool was pretested on 10% of the sample size in a town that was not selected for the actual study and modified accordingly. The reliability (internal consistency) of the questionnaire was calculated based on data from the pretest.The data were collected through face-to-face interviews. We chose face-to-face interview technique than online or telephone surveys due to most waiters in study areas had no access to the internet or telephone. The data collectors used appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during data collection to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 virus to data collectors and study participants during the interview. Data were collected by health professionals (BSc) who had experience of data collection under supervision.Knowledge of COVID-19 (etiology, mode of transmission, symptoms, and prevention methods) was measured using 15 items. The questions were answered on yes, no or I do not know responses. During analysis, the correct answer was coded with ""1"" and the incorrect, or I do not know coded with ""0"". Then sum score was calculated (range 0-15) and categorized. Participants who answered ≤60% of the knowledge questions correctly were considered as having poor knowledge; whereas, those who mentioned 61-75% and >75% of the questions correctly were classified as having fair and good knowledge, respectively.Risk perception regarding COVID-19 was measured using 12 items which answered on five Likert scales: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral (3), agree (4), and strongly agree (5) . The respondents rated their levels of agreement with different statements. Six items were used to measure the perceived susceptibility dimension of risk perception and the left six items used to measure the perceived severity dimension. The items were stated in a way higher value indicates higher risk perception. The cumulative risk perception score (range 12-60) was computed. 25 Based on the mean score, the risk perception categorized as high if scored above mean, and low if scored mean or below. The internal consistency of the items was evaluated on data from pretest, and Cronbach's alphas for perceived susceptibility was 0.717; whereas, it was 0.684 for perceived severity dimension. Respondents' level of concern regarding COVID-19 was compared with different diseases that are common in the study areas. The respondents rate their level of concern if they contracted those diseases on five scale items: not at all serious (1), not serious (2) , not serious-slight serious (3), serious (4), and very serious (5) . The Cronbach's alpha for these items was 0.685.The practice of COVID-19 prevention methods was measured using 10 questions. The respondents rated how often they were following the preventive methods that recommended by WHO on five scales: none (1), rarely (2), sometimes (3), frequently (4), and always (5) . Finally, the cumulative practice score was computed (range 10-50). The Cronbach's alpha for practice items was 0.703.Perceived self-efficacy to practice prevention measures was measured using 4 items which responded on five scales: certainly not (1), probably not (2), perhaps notperhaps yes (3), probably yes (4), and most certainly (5) . The items were stated in a way that the higher value indicates more perceived self-efficacy to practice the measures. The sum and mean scores were computed. Based on the finding of the pretest, the items were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha= 0.764).To assure the quality of the data, training was given for data collectors and supervisors on the data collection tool, how to approach the interviewees, details of interview techniques, the need for respecting the right of participants, and how to maintain confidentiality. Also, a pretest was conducted and necessary corrections were made accordingly. The data collection process was closely overseen by trained supervisors. Finally, the data entry was carefully done using Epi-data manager software to minimize errors.The data were entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2 and exported to SPSS version 24 statistical packages for analysis. Descriptive statistics were done for different variables as supposed necessary. Linear regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with risk perception by treating the cumulative score of risk perception as a continuous variable. The variables were selected using bivariate analysis and dropped from further inclusion in the multivariate model if their p-values were greater than 0.25. Finally, the multivariable linear regression model was fitted using a backward stepwise elimination method, and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 in the final model were considered as significant predictors of risk perception regarding COVID-19. Unstandardized β with 95% CI was used to measure the amount by which dependent variable changes if we change independent variable by one unit keeping other independent Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress variables constant. Multicollinearity was checked using the variance inflation factor (VIF) and found to be within a tolerable range for all variables included in the model.A total of 416 respondents participated in the study, with a response rate of 98.6%. The mean age of study participants was 27.26 (SD=8.35) years. Of the total respondents,350 (84.1%) were single marital status, and 183 (44%) and 154 (37%) had attended primary and secondary or above education, respectively. Three hundred thirty (79.3%) study participants were living with one or more persons in the house ( Table 1 ).All respondents had heard about new coronavirus/COVID-19 disease. Of the 416 respondents, 84.4% correctly answered the cause of the pandemic. A significant proportion of participants knew the mode of spread of the virus: inhalation of droplets from infected people (78.8%), direct contact with infected people (84.4%), contaminated animals (72.8%), and contaminated object/surfaces (60.6%). The mean of the sum score of knowledge items was 10.32 (SD=2.37) with minimum and maximum scores of 3 and 15, respectively ( More than half (53.4%) of the study participants agreed that COVID-19 causes more deaths than other respiratory diseases. About two-thirds (66.6%) respondents agreed that people stigmatize them if they get sick due to coronavirus. About one-fourth (25.5%) of waiters strongly agreed that their work exposes them more to COVID-19 more. The mean cumulative score of risk perception was 40.7 (SD=6.65) ( Table 3) . Two hundred twenty-two (53.4%) participants had high-risk perceptions concerning COVID-19. The highest proportion of respondents was very seriously concerned if they contracted COVID-19 than other diseases (Figure 1 ).About, 36.3% and 22.1% of respondents reported that they were maintaining social distancing frequently, and always, respectively. Very few respondents were wearing facemask at work or outside the home always (6.0%), and frequently (11.5%). Out of the total respondents, 45.4% did not wear a glove at all; while, 17.3% wear rarely, 26.4% wear sometimes, 6.7% wear frequently and 4.1% wear always (Table 4 ).Out of the 416 respondents, only 20.9% were almost certain that they can wash their hands with water and soap or with sanitizers. About 6.0% of the respondents reported they certainly did not manage to use facemasks. The mean of the cumulative score of self-efficacy items was 13.40 (Table 5) . Risk perception is central to many health behaviors. 13, 26 Its role in shaping protective health behaviors could be positive, negative or none. 14 This study intended to assess risk perception toward COVID-19 and its associated factors among waiters working in food and drinking establishments in selected towns of southwest Ethiopia. It was recognized that a significant proportion of study participants perceived that COVID-19 virus causes more deaths than other respiratory diseases. Likewise, another study done in Iran showed that the majority of people thought that COVID-19 disease was very severe. 27 The highest proportion of respondents was very seriously concerned if they contracted COVID-19. This finding agrees with a study done in Wuhan, China. 19 In addition, most waiters perceived that their work exposes them more to the virus than other persons. The study showed that a very small proportion of study participants were following the recommended protective behaviors. For instance, only 6% and 4.1% of the respondents were wearing facemask and gloves always at work, respectively. These findings are lower compared to a study done in Iran. 27 This variation could be due to difference in study populations, awareness, availability of protective equipment, and effect of the pandemic across study settings. Also, the low facemask use in our study could be due to the controversies on the importance of facemask to prevent the transmission of the virus during the earlier phase of the pandemic.The study also showed that the higher the perceived risk regarding COVID-19, the more likely practicing protective behaviors. This finding is consistent with other studies. 11, 12, 14, 23 This implies proper risk communication that addresses susceptibility to the virus and the severity of the disease could enhance protective behaviors such as Percentage Level concern for different diseases How would you feel if you contracted the following diseases?Not at all serious Not serious Not serious-slightly serious Serious frequent hand washing, wearing of face mask, avoiding public gatherings, and social distancing. The higher the age, the more perceived risk towards COVID-19. The risk of death from the COVID-19 virus is higher among older people. 28 As a result, older people might have higher perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, during the earlier phase of the pandemic, it was wrongly perceived older people infected with the virus more than youngers. This might also give rise to the perception that older people are highly susceptibility to the virus.The knowledge about COVID-19 is also positively associated with perceived risk regarding COVID-19. A similar finding was also reported by previous studies. 20, 29 This could be due to individuals who had high-perceived risk might follow the media frequently or read about the pandemic more often. Likewise, people's knowledge of the spread of the virus and case fatality might affect the risk perception regarding the pandemic. However, due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot confirm the exact temporal relationship between knowledge and risk perception.Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot assess how risk perceptions change over time. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between the outcome and predictor variables cannot be established. Also, there might be the risk of social desirability bias since individual behaviors have public health implications and the data were collected through self-report.A higher level of risk perception was found regarding the COVID-19 among waiters working in food and drinking establishments in southwest Ethiopia. The risk perception was positively associated with age, knowledge, and preventive behaviors. Proper risk communication to promote protective behaviors is very essential since waiters are more at risk to be infected with COVID-19 and their infection with the virus has public health implications.The findings from the current study provided the evidence for health policy on the risk perception, and its association with preventive behaviors among waiters during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.This study was conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Mizan-Tepi University. The participants have informed the purpose of the study and gave written consent before the interview.

See 19) began in Wuhan [1, 2] . The virus rapidly spread throughout the country, then throughout the whole world, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 [3] . As of September 23, 2020, it has infected over 31 million people worldwide and caused more than 965000 deaths [3, 4] .The clinical gastrointestinal manifestations are present and less severe when compared with SARS [1, 5, 6] . Early reports from Wuhan stated that around 10% of COVID-19 cases had diarrhea and nausea, 1 to 2 d before the beginning of respiratory symptoms [6] , and some cases may be missed if screening was applied only to those with respiratory symptoms. It is widely believed that SARS-CoV-2 spreads via droplets and contact (especially if within one meter of distance), but there is evidence that airborne spread is also possible during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) [2] .In addition, new emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the feces of patients, giving the possibility of fecal-oral route transmission [7, 8] . This can be explained by the excessive expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 required for cell entry in the epithelial layer of the gastrointestinal tract [9] .Being highly infective, SARS-CoV-2 put the healthcare workers (HCWs) in clinical departments performing endoscopy in great challenges during this pandemic as being highly susceptible to getting the infection [10] . Endoscopy could be considered a highrisk procedure as pulmonary and gastric secretions, as well as fecal material, may contain high viral loads. So, infection to HCWs occurs either due to direct contact with the infected patients or to the lack or improper use of the personal protective equipment (PPE) [11] . In fact, several studies have discussed infection prevention and control measures that must be implemented to increase patient safety, prevent nosocomial outbreaks, protect HCWs, and ensure the rational use of limited PPE [11, 12] .Several endoscopy societies and expert groups have offered recommendations and position statements for endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Several GI society guidelines recommended ceasing elective procedures during the pandemic to decrease the risk of infection [17] [18] [19] . Different recommendations/guidelines have been recently released to ensure the smooth reopening of endoscopy units and resuming elective procedures [17] . Whether or not endoscopy units in different parts of the world are ready to resume service based on these recommendations is not fully known.This study is a multicenter study to discuss the barriers of resuming endoscopic maneuvers in different centers and governorates in Egypt as the coronavirus infection rate has remarkably decreased and there are international calls for resuming all the activities with caution and different precautions, and to assess whether the endoscopic service has returned to its near normal standard level. November 21, 2020 Volume 26 Issue 43We designed an online survey that was based on four domains (Supplementary Figure  1 ). The first domain included the demographic data as regards the governorate, the type of health care facility, and the type(s) of endoscopy service(s) provided. The second domain was for the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the endoscopy service(s). The third domain was directed to the readiness of the health care facility for dealing with COVID-19 cases (infrastructure, working staff, PPEs, case stratification, etc.), and the fourth domain was about the ability of the facility to resume the endoscopy service(s) and the different barriers which preclude service resumption. The whole survey included 20 main questions. All the questions were closed-ended questions that could be answered by selecting the appropriate answer(s). The questionnaire was set-up by a nationally representative group of endoscopy physicians covering different Egyptian governorates. The survey was designed using the RedCap platform (v9.1.0., United States). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Egypt (NLI IRB 00003413) in June 2020, protocol number 00203/2020. The questionnaire was distributed online for 4 wk (starting from July 30, 2020 till August 28, 2020). The primary outcome of the survey was to identify the current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy service and the barriers against the full resumption of the participating centers.Data were collected and entered into personal computers and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 26.0) software (IBM SPSS Inc. Chicago, United States). The incomplete responses were excluded from the analysis. For simplification, we divided the responding governorates according to the administrative division of the governorates of Egypt (see below in discussion). The data were expressed as numbers (proportions). Comparisons between groups were made by the χ 2 or Fisher's test (FET) for the qualitative variables. A uni-and multivariate regression analysis was done to identify the parameters which determine the decision making as regards the resumption of endoscopy service if not working. Correlation analysis also was done to explore the correlation between the current status of endoscopy service and the different domains.The survey was sent to 115 endoscopy centers all over Egypt, of which 113 (98.3%) responded to the survey in complete response and two centers didn't give a full response, so they were excluded from the analysis. Most respondents (n = 67, 59.3%) were from high-volume endoscopy units either University or teaching facility general hospitals providing emergency endoscopy. Cairo and Giza regions have participated with 30 (26.5%) centers, Lower Egypt (Alexandria, Beheira, Sharqia, Qalyubia, Damietta, and Ismailia) and Upper Egypt (Assiut, Fayoum, Sohag, Qena, Aswan and Luxor) have participated through 34 (30.1%) centers, and the Delta region (Menoufia, Kafr El-sheik , Gharbia, and Dakahlia) have participated through 13 (11.5%) centers. COVID-19 designated facilities were present among 48 (42.5%) centers (Figure 1 ).On the day of the planned endoscopic procedures patients were checked for being suspected cases of COVID-19 in 95 (84.1%) of centers. The process of selection and screening was based on symptoms among 90 centers (79.6%), temperature check among 82 centers (72.6%), non-contrast multi spiral computed tomography (MSCT) chest among 50 centers (44.2%), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing among 11 centers (9.7%), and antibody testing among 3 centers (2.7%).Endoscopy practice was almost resuming or resumed in about 70% of the centers Figure 2A . In general, there was an expansion of the waiting lists all over the country. The Quantification of the expansion is shown in Figure 2B . We found significant variation in the waiting lists according to the distribution of COVID-19 pandemic November 21, 2020 Volume 26 Issue 43 status among different centers ( Figure 2B and C). In areas with clusters of cases (n = 49), the waiting lists increased by 0%-25% in 14.29%, 26%-50% in 32.65%, 51%-75% in 34.69%, 76%-100% in 10.2%, and by more than 100% in 8.17% of these centers. While in areas with sporadic cases (n = 62), 45.16% of the centers had their waiting list increased by 0%-25%, however, in 19.35% and 20.9% of the centers the list increased by 26%-50%, and 51%-75%, respectively. In about 14.59% of the centers, the waiting list increased by more than 75%, meanwhile, areas with no new cases (n = 2), 50% of centers had their list increased by only 0%-25% (FET = 19.1, P = 0.005).During the COVID-19 outbreak, endoscopy staff has been deployed to COVID-19 designated wards and hospitals. In addition, a significant number of healthcare providers were infected. The shortage of endoscopy staff was present among 39 (34.8%) of centers ( Figure 2D ). Specialists shortage was present in 88 (77.9%) of centers, nursing staff shortage in 90 (79.6%) of centers, and trainees shortage in 110 (97.3%) of centers. This shortage was considered as a barrier against resuming endoscopy service among 38 (33.6% in intention to treat analysis, 86.4% in per-protocol analysis; 69 centers didn't answer). The shortage in specialists was more pronounced in Delta and lower Egypt than upper Egypt and Cairo and Giza (61.5% and 91.3% vs. 64.7% and 83.3% respectively, P = 0.019). However, the shortage of nursing staff and trainees were not significantly different among different centers, P = 0.93 and P = 0.24, respectively). Only 41 units (35%) had to increase the working hours to compensate for this shortage. Seventy-six units (67.3%) recovered their staff either from sick leave or COVID-19 wards.During the current COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt, 72 (63.7%) of endoscopy centers have provided suitable waiting areas for appropriate social distancing precautions, 65 (57.5%) of centers could provide an adequate number of recovery rooms to keep the social distancing strategy to the optimum, and 40 (35.4%) of centers have increased their working hours to accommodate the extra-burden of increased cases volume; at the same time, 77 (68.1%) of centers have adopted selection strategy to select the endoscopist and the assisting team based on the presence of a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Sixty-three (55.7%) units were planning to resume the pre-pandemic capacity with a designated track for confirmed COVID-19 cases. However, only 24 (21.2%) of centers could provide special endoscopy rooms for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. Of note, training was already resumed in 16 units (14.2%).The Intra-procedural precautions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt varied according to the availability of PPE in each facility locality as shown in Table 1 (more details in Supplementary Table 1) . Post-procedural patient follow-up for the development of fever or suspected COVID-19 symptoms for 14 d after discharge was a strategy adopted by 18 (15.9%) of centers only. The follow up was performed by either a resident doctors (8%), endoscopy nurses (5.3%), administrative staff (6.2%), and/or specialist physicians (1.8%).Multivariate regression analysis showed that burden of cases in the unit locality, staff shortage and their recovery and the availability of separate designated rooms for COVID-19 cases could markedly affect the resumption of endoscopy practice (P = 0.029, < 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and Odd's ratio (0.15, 1.8 and 0.16, respectively) ( Table 2) .The prolonged suspension of routine endoscopic services during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significant implications on diagnostic endoscopic services such as delay in diagnosis and management of cancer patients as well as the expansion of waiting lists worldwide. Therefore, this encouraged the international gastrointestinal endoscopic societies to release position statements, recommendations, and guidance for the rapid and safe resumption of endoscopic services commensurate with facilities and pandemic situations of each country [14, [17] [18] [19] . To our knowledge, whether or not endoscopy centers in Egypt are ready to resume elective services has not been studied. Accordingly, the results of the current survey represent the current status of resuming routine endoscopic services in Egypt and determine the barriers of resuming such services.Our results showed that 70% of different centers all over Egypt have resumed routine endoscopic services as is illustrated in Figure 2A . This is in parallel to the current situation of early recovery phases of the pandemic and the decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Egypt and other countries worldwide [3] . Expansion of elective endoscopy waiting lists is one of the challenges to resume the full capacity of endoscopic services. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidance in the early recovery stages, triage mechanisms are needed to prioritize patients scheduling according to the indications [20] .The highest percentages of waiting lists expansion are observed in areas with clusters of COVID-19 cases which indicate the awareness of senior decision-makers of endoscopy centers in Egypt with the importance of triaging and prioritization of patients scheduling in the light of clinical need with the available capacity. Also, this reflects their compliance with GI endoscopy societies' guidance. In addition, this observation complies with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation in Egypt, as there is a decrease in the number of areas with new cases allowing endoscopy centers to restore their full capacity as soon as possible.Regarding the shortage in endoscopy staff, 34.5% of the centers reported a significant shortage of staff during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in nursing staff (79.6%) and specialists (77.9%). This is related to two factors; one was the reallocation of staff and medical equipment to the surge in demand to manage suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases and the other was some of them get infected caused by frequent exposure to infected patients. The shortage in specialists was more pronounced in Delta and Lower Egypt geographically which may be related to the geographic distribution of a large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and isolation hospitals that need more medical staff. This shortage in endoscopy staff is considered as a barrier against resuming endoscopy service among 38 centers in the current study (33.6% in intention to treat analysis where n = 113, 86.4% in the per-protocol analysis where n = 44). Regarding patient selection before endoscopy, a large number of participating centers (84.1%) screened their patients. The most common method used was symptoms-based screening for COVID-19 risk stratification (79.6%) of the centers and fewer centers used PCR testing (9.7%).Similarly, Alboraie et al [21] reported that most worldwide centers (93.9%) screened patients for possible COVID-19 disease prior to the procedure and 54 centers (33.13%) used PCR testing. However, asymptomatic infected patients are a known source for transmission [2, 22] , accordingly, this type of screening is not sufficient to guide for COVID-19 risk stratification. A recent study from China, employed both symptomsbased screening and PCR in patient's screening, reported no cases of endoscopyrelated nosocomial COVID-19 disease transmission in 1361 cases [23] .Regarding pre-procedural precautions and endoscopy centers designation, our results show that most participating centers so far follow the different international GI endoscopy societies guidelines [14, [17] [18] [19] including appropriate social distancing precautions or increase working hours to accommodate the extra-burden of increased cases volume. More than two-thirds of our centers have adopted a selection strategy to select the endoscopist and the assisting team based on the presence of a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case. Also, Alboraie et al [21] stated that the majority (78.5%) of the centers considered dedicated teams for the delivery of endoscopic services after the onset of the pandemic.To reduce the risk of infection spread most of the international society's recommendations are in agreement with the existence of a restricted protocol for infection control and the awareness of medical staff for the donning and doffing of PPE. According to the results of our study, there is wide variability between different centers regarding intra-procedural precautions depending upon the availability of PPE and type of procedures. We can overcome those types of barriers by reuse some of PPE components such as respirator masks in case of shortage as it was reported by many studies as the methods of decontamination were explained [23] [24] [25] .Most of the international recommendations on endoscopy encourage follow-up of patients after endoscopic procedures [11] . Unfortunately, in our study few participating centers (15.9%) are practicing the strategy of following their patients for the development of any suspected symptoms post-procedure. A similar study showed that 18.4% of centers only called patients back two weeks after procedures [21] . According to multivariate regression analysis that was done in our study, we found that endoscopy staff shortage, availability of separate designated rooms for COVID-19 cases, and the burden of cases in each locality are the most obvious barriers for the resumption of routine endoscopy practice in Egypt.Although there are many barriers that may interfere with the complete restoration of endoscopy services in Egypt, according to the results of our study, most participating centers are preparing their facilities for the resumption of full endoscopy services.We recommend increasing working hours and dividing endoscopy staff into teams to overcome the shortage of endoscopy staff. Also, follow up of patients for two weeks after endoscopic procedures to detect any possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in endoscopy centers as this strategy may help in tracing the source of nosocomial transmission.In conclusion, the current study represents an important national multicenter survey addressing crucial information about resuming regular gastrointestinal endoscopy services and its barriers in Egypt.An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has hit the world and disturbed the whole healthcare system, including endoscopic practices which are a very risky procedures in terms of exposure to infection.Smooth resumption of routine endoscopic service has to be guaranteed as well as decreasing the burden of exposing patients and endoscopy staff to infection during endoscopic procedures. Many strategies have to be implemented in endoscopy units, however, these strategies face many barriers as shortage of personal protective equipment, working staff and post procedure tracing of infection and follow-up of patients.This survey study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and the difficulty of resumption of routine endoscopic service in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.We conducted a survey study that included 20 questions to be answered by the head of endoscopy units in 113 units from all over Egypt.One hundred and thirteen centers participated in the study from all over Egypt. Due to halting the routine endoscopic services during the pandemic, the waiting lists were doubled in most of the centers. Third of the centers experienced significant shortage of endoscopy staff. The lack of dedicated endoscopy rooms for infected patients and the staff shortage were the main barriers to resume routine services smoothly.We recommend increasing working hours and dividing endoscopy staff into teams to overcome the shortage of endoscopy staff. Also, follow up of patients for two weeks after endoscopic procedures to detect any possible transmission of infection in endoscopy centers as this strategy may help in tracing the source of nosocomial transmission.For smooth resumption of endoscopic service between two waves of the current pandemic, several strategies have to be applied in a uniform manner in all endoscopy units. Our study showed how different centers acted differently during this pandemic in terms of their plan to safely getting routine endoscopy service on track. Future studies should propose modalities to guarantee uniform application of determined strategies that overcome the current barriers.","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-21","11"

Many kinds of mammals, such as hedgehog, pangolin, civet, bat, and so on, can serve as storage hosts of coronavirus [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . There are six coronaviruses known to infect human hosts and cause respiratory diseases [1] . Among them, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have resulted in regional and global outbreaks [1] . Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Noteworthy, an outbreak caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Subsequently, a global pandemic due to the said disease ensued. Until the end of April in Cameroon, all but one region (Far North) had recorded confirmed cases of COVID-19.We did a review of the files of these two patients who were admitted to the internal medicine ward of a medical Centre in Maroua Town, Far North Region. We obtained administrative authorization from the director of this hospital to get access to files and informed consent was obtained from the patients to explore their medical records.Case 1: 48-year-old male health personnel who was working in a then COVID-19 free region with no history of travel to a COVID-19 high-risk territory and no known contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 developed fatigue on the 15 th of April 2020. He experienced severe dizziness on the 18 th of April 2020 while returning home from work. He has been using barrier methods such as surgical masks and examination gloves during his medical consultations, and regularly practiced hygiene measures such as hand washing and use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Despite 24 hours of bed rest, the persistence of fatigue prompted him to consult on 19 th April 2020. He admitted having myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough and, joint ache but denied having fever, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, dysuria, frequency, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, catarrh, neither loss of smell nor taste. The patient stays alone and denied any exposure to wild animals or visit wet markets. He does not have cardiovascular disease or any other chronic disease. On examination, he was ill-looking, in an altered general state with severe asthenia, not pale and not icteric. He took a dose of an oral anti-malarial (Athemether + Lumefantrine 80/480mg) a day prior consultation. Vital signs revealed a body temperature, 37.8°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per min, a pulse of 64, and BP 130/69mmHg. Chest examination revealed vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds. His 1 st and 2 nd heart sounds were heard and were normal. We made a presumptive diagnosis of Severe Malaria and the following laboratory investigations were done at admission (Table 1) . He was treated thus (Table 2) .On 21 st April 2020 (day 2 of admission) he had clinical progress marked by a significant decrease in asthenia, no respiratory symptoms, and he was discharged to continue an oral anti-malaria (Arterolane 150mg + Piperaquine 750mg 1 tablet a day for 3 days). On 22 nd April 2020 (about 20 hours after discharge), the patient was rushed to the emergency unit with an acute onset of respiratory distress, fever, nonproductive cough with high intensity, chest pain, and severe asthenia. Due to a suspicion of COVID-19, we immediately hospitalized him in the isolation unit with all measures of protection adopted when interacting with the patient. On general assessment, he was ill-looking, markedly confused with a Glasgow coma score of 13/15 (E4, V3, M6). Vital signs, body temperature 36.7°C, blood pressure 118/73mmHg, pulse 120 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 94%. Chest examination revealed, decreased chest movements over both lung fields, increased tactile and vocal fremitus, and diffuse fine crackles on both lung fields. He also had tenderness on palpation of the epigastrium. A clinical diagnosis of severe pneumonia (suspected case of COVID-19). We did the following laboratory tests for the patient (Table 1) . We notified the case to the competent authorities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 requested, and the patient stayed in isolation, and all protection measures ensured. Meanwhile, he was put on the following treatment (Table 2 ). Due to the unavailability of the PCR and virus transporting material, the patient's sample was not collected only until day 4 of admission. Following his positive clinical evolution, he was previewed for discharge but left in isolation awaiting results for PCR. On day 7 of admission, qualitative Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2.Case 2: 59-year-old male, health personnel with no history of cardiovascular disease or other chronic disease working in a then COVID-19 free zone and a history of contact with a suspected case of COVID-19 (this patient passed away 30 minutes on admission and never had his sample collected). He developed fatigue on the 27 th of April 2020 (7 days after contact with the suspected case). This prompted consultation on the 28 th April 2020, where he also complained of anorexia but denied having fever, cough, chest pain, and difficulty in breathing, dysuria, frequency, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, catarrh, and neither loss of smell nor taste. On examination, he was ill-looking, conscious, and oriented with mild asthenia. Chest examination revealed vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds. We made the clinical diagnosis of simple malaria, and he was treated as an outpatient with an oral anti-malarial (Athemether + Lumefantrine 80/480mg) despite a negative parasitemia for malaria and bed rest. Due to persistent worsening fatigue, the patient was rushed as an emergency on the sixth day following the onset of symptoms. He also complained of generalized back pain but didn't have cough, fever, nor difficulty in breathing nor chest pain.On examination, he was ill-looking with an altered general state by severe asthenia, Glasgow coma scale 14/15 (E 4 V 4 M6). His vital signs on admission were temperature 38.3°C, pulse 104, blood pressure 110/84mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. He had no signs of meningeal irritation. The neurological examination done was unremarkable. Musculoskeletal examination revealed a normal external back with no signs of trauma and no tenderness on palpation. The chest examination didn't reveal any abnormalities. It is worth noting that one of his colleagues, who is the patient presented above, had been diagnosed with COVID-19 during the weekend before his admission. We isolated him unit and PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 requested, and the sample collection was done. We made a clinical diagnosis of severe malaria with a differential of a suspected case of COVID-19 and patient we put him on the following treatment (Table 2) . We noticed significant clinical progress marked by the resolution of fatigue and back pain on day 2 of admission, and discharge was programmed for the following day. His results for SARS-CoV-2 came back on this same day (on day 2 of admission), and he was tested positive.Diagnostic approach: we had a diagnostic dilemma due to the atypical presentation of the patients in a zone, which was then COVID-19 free. These patients came in with extreme fatigue as their main initial presenting symptoms. Both patients had indeed been on oral anti-malaria and antipyretics, which would have probably reduced symptoms like fever. We considered severe malaria as the clinical diagnosis on initial admission in both cases as both clinically, and para-clinically, we did not find any other focus of infection in these patients. Burn out was also considered as a differential or an associated diagnosis. These patients had a very tedious month with a high patient influx and working in extremely high temperatures in the Far North at about 45-50o. Burn out could probably be associated may have created some sort of immunodeficiency to favor the onset of malaria even at low parasitemia thus their probable negative parasitemia at the onset of disease [7] . Their use of an oral anti-malarial before their admission could also explain their negative parasitemia for malaria. Furthermore, clinical improvement following treatment with parenteral antimalarial during their admissions made the diagnosis of severe malaria even more scintillating. However, for the 1 st case, the drastic change of his presenting symptoms at readmission coupled with para clinical findings like mild leukocytosis with lymphopenia and a significant chest X-ray made us have a high index of suspicion COVID-19.These patients were working in a then COVID-19 free zone, however, being a health worker has been isolated as a risk factor for developing this disease [8] . Despite the urgent notification of the case and request for a PCR test in search of SARS-CoV-2 for the 1 st case, his sample was eventually collected 4 days after notification and results available 5 days after sample collection. Case 2 had had his colleague tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and benefited from rapid testing as it was in line with contact tracing and testing. These are the realities we face working in resourcelimited zones where even four months following the outbreak of the epidemic and about two months following the first confirmed case in Cameroon, testing of suspected cases was still very problematic. When samples are collected, however, for a test which theoretically has results available in four hours we had our results more than 48 hours after sample collection. The peculiarity of where these patients live and work is that the closest testing center for COVID-19 was found more than 250km away and virus transporting media was very limited in supply. Also, some studies have shown that a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan has a higher sensitivity than PCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [9, 10] . As such, we would have loved to use this tool here due to the extensive diagnostic delay of PCR results; however, this practice has been condemned by the national health authorities in Cameroon [11] and PCR remains the only diagnostic tool for this disease.Therapeutic approach: the management of COVID-19 worldwide remains a challenge because no known cure and no vaccines are available. Treatment options range from simple quarantine to more invasive procedures like intubation and respiratory assistance. The national protocol adopted by the ministry of health in Cameroon proposed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as baseline management [12] . However, access to hydroxychloroquine became very difficult as they had been stock-outs in all pharmacies for some time now especially as these treatment was provided free of charge and restricted only for confirmed cases. The scientific committee of the hospital adopted in their monthly meeting of March that taking into consideration the health emergency we face, parenteral quinine sulfate would be used as first-line in the treatment of severe malaria in patients without allergy to quinine during this period. Quinine sulfate, amidst its efficiency in the treatment of severe malaria, has been shown to have anti-viral effects [13] . In vitro evaluation of quinine sulfate has been conducted with other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV). Quinine sulfate at micro molar but not toxic doses reduced the number of plaques formed by HSV-1 in vitro in Vero and HaCaT cell models, although no viricidal activity was observed [14, 15] . Quinine sulfate in vitro activity also tested against IAV using viral plaque inhibition assay, when evaluating its prophylactic activity showed different effects with an EC50 within the micro molar range, depending on the viral strains [16] .We opted using parenteral quinine sulfate which has not yet shown much resistance in the treatment of severe malaria [17, 18] as 1 st line in our patients. Parenteral quinine sulfate would not only treat the patients for severe malaria but could have some therapeutic and prophylactic activity against SARS-CoV-2, given its action against similar clinical manifesting viruses like IAV. Due to the known antiviral activity of quinine sulfate, the scarcity of hydroxychloroquine, the complexity in clinically differentiating COVID-19 and other tropical diseases, delay in getting patients tested and eventually getting results and that, symptomatic patients with COVID-19 could present with some form of the severe disease where administration of oral medication is problematic, all suspected cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in this center would be treated with parenteral quinine infusion and azithromycin at baseline while waiting for either sample collection or results understanding the considerable delay. Quinine sulfate is a low cost readily available anti-microbial agent, with a good therapeutic observance in Cameroon. Furthermore, due to the temporary resolution of the patients during their admission while singly on parenteral quinine infusion, we got even more convinced that quinine sulfate could have some effects on the SARS-CoV-2.Contact tracing: for case 1, testing of colleagues in the same health institution where he works, 4/15 health personnel tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, testing of 15 members of his family all came back negative. Case two was a contact of case one, and screening of 2 family members all came back negative.In this case series, we report clinical and therapeutic data on the first two cases of COVID-19 recorded in Maroua, Cameroon. We recognize the fact that we provided results based on a small number of cases, however, the comprehensive follow up of the patients enabled us to illustrate the different courses of the disease we observed, and we provided some relevant data regarding the management of the disease. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and help in advances in the management of the disease. Testing of suspected cases of COVID-19 using the Gold standard RT-PCR is still problematic in Africa;  Health personnel remain a high-risk group for COVID-19.What this study adds  The main interest of this case series is the atypical presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, with extreme fatigue being the primary symptom;  The therapeutic potential of quinine salts for relief of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is questionable and remains a subject to explore in our context.

COVID-19 infection is caused by a highly contagious single-stranded RNA virus called the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1] , which is transmitted mainly through droplets, aerosol, and close contact [2] [3] [4] . Despite the fact that the respiratory system is the primarily affected organ, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many other organs [5] [6] [7] .No specific treatment for COVID-19 infection is available up till now, and there is a great urge for effective treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality during this pandemic. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by changing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, together with altering glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [8] . There is a debate in the literature regarding the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 infection [9] [10] [11] [12] . Adding azithromycin to CQ and HCQ was reported to reduce the complications and fatality rates, and reduce the viral load in COVID-19 patients [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These reports resulted in emerged ideas calling for combining CQ and HCQ with other drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.Zinc is essential for different cellular and enzymatic activities, as well as being a necessary cofactor for many viral proteins [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Zinc was also proved to inhibit RNAdependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV in cell culture [17] . Chloroquine is known to increase the intracellular concentrations of zinc, and thus enhance its effect [18] .Dietary plant polyphenols such as the flavonoids quercetin (QCT) and epigallocatechin-gallate act as antioxidants and as signaling molecules. Remarkably, the activities of numerous enzymes that are targeted by polyphenols are dependent on zinc. Husam and his colleagues have previously shown that these polyphenols chelate zinc cations, and they hypothesized that these flavonoids might also be acting as zinc ionophores, transporting zinc cations through the plasma membrane [19] .Eight studies are registered on clinicaltrials.gov to evaluate the efficacy of zinc with hydroxychloroquine either in the treatment of or prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection. Only one study is completed, 4 studies are still recruiting patients, and 2 studies did not start recruitment yet, while one study was withdrawn. None of these registered studies has shown the results up till now.We aimed to evaluate the effect of combining CQ/HCQ and zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.This was a randomized controlled study conducted in three Egyptian tertiary care centers in Assiut, Tanta, and Cairo. A written informed consent was taken from each participant in this trial. Approval of the Institutional ethical committee was taken before starting the trial. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04447534).This study included patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by real-time PCR test during the period between 23 June and 23 August 2020. All the included patients were classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical according to the WHO case severity classification for COVID-19 infection. Mild cases constituted of patients with symptoms for COVID-19 infection but not complicated with pneumonia or hypoxia. Moderate cases included patients with mild viral pneumonia and SpO2 > 90% on room air. Severe cases involved patients with signs of severe pneumonia such as respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air. Finally, critical cases included patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and septic shock [26] .One hundred ninety-one patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were equally randomized into two groups: group I: zinc group, included 96 patients who received both HCQ and zinc and group II (without zinc group), included 95 who received HCQ only. Patient with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, porphyria, neutrophilia, myasthenia gravis, maculopathy or changes in the visual field, heart failure, prolonged QT interval in ECG, liver cirrhosis, psoriasis, epilepsy, anemia from pyruvate kinase and G6PD deficiencies, chronic kidney disease, and pregnant or lactating females were excluded from this study. Collected data included history, clinical examination, laboratory investigation at admission, and follow-up during the hospitalization period. Primary outcome measures included recovery within 28 days, need for mechanical ventilation, and death.Hydroxychloroquine was given in a dose of 400 mg twice daily on the first day, then 200 mg twice daily for 5 days, while zinc was given in a dose of zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg of elemental zinc) twice daily as many clinical trials did. Both groups received the standard of care treatment for COVID-19 infection, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health guidelines for 15 days. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University. The privacy and confidentiality of the data for participated patients were guaranteed.The normality of the variables was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V. 23 was used for data analysis. Data were expressed in number (No.), percentage (%), mean (x ̅ ), and standard deviation (SD). Student's t test was used for normally distributed continuous variables and Mann-Whitney's test for not normally distributed ones. Chi-square test (χ 2 ) was used to study the association between qualitative variables, and whenever any of the expected cells were less than five, Fischer's exact test was used. Binary logistic regression was used to ascertain the effect of the potential risk factors on the patients' mortality. Two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Sample Size Calculation The sample size calculation was based on a previous study by Shah et al. 2012 , who studied the effect of zinc on severe pneumonia. The required sample was 86 patients in each group with 0.8 as the probability (power), 0.05 as type I error probability, 3 as the difference in the mean duration of pneumonia between the two groups, and 1:1 ratio of experimental to control subjects. The sample size was inflated by 10% to compensate for the dropouts [27] .The two groups were matched for age and gender (p = 0.940 and 0.062, respectively). They had no significant difference regarding smoking, associated comorbidities, or clinical severity grading (p 0.706, 0.384, 0.781, respectively) ( Table 1) .The laboratory investigations did not show any significant difference between the two groups. This is detailed in Table 2 .There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the clinical course or any of the different outcomes. The mean duration of hospital stay was 13.51 ± 5.34 days in the zinc group and 14.01 ± 6.26 days in the zinc-free group (p = 0.553). Seventy-six patients (79.2%) in the zinc group and 74 patients in the zinc-free group showed complete recovery after 28 days (p = 0.969). Four patients in the zinc group and 6 patients in the zinc-free group needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.537). The overall mortality did not significantly differ in the two groups either, as 5 patients died in each group with p = 0.986 ( Table 3) .The univariate analysis revealed that the patients' age and the need for mechanical ventilation were the only risk factors significantly associated with mortality (p = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). The addition of zinc to HCQ did not considerably affect the overall COVID-19 mortality in this study (p = 0.986) ( Table 4 ).In Egypt, there have been an increasing number of cases with COVID-19 infection since March 2020. Many treatment protocols were updated to treat the coronavirus infection based on the evidence available at this time. The initial protocols were primarily dependent on hydroxychloroquine. In the Egyptian leading university hospitals, we aimed to evaluate the effect of combining CQ/HCQ and zinc in treating COVID-19 patients.The treatment teams in the Egyptian universities, which incorporated infectious diseases consultants and clinical pharmacists, adopted the importance of integration of zinc into the treatment protocol of treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial investigating the role of the addition of zinc to hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID 19 patients.The main hypothesis behind this approach was the fact that zinc was proven to have an inhibitory effect on the RNAdependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV in cell culture [17, 18] . Moreover, CQ and HCQ are known to increase the intracellular concentrations of zinc and thus enhance its effect [18] .Despite these proved benefits of zinc in the literature, this study found that zinc supplements did not enhance the clinical efficacy of HCQ.There are a lot of questions now about the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of COVID 19 patients. A recent randomized study found that adding HCQ to standard care did not add significant benefit, did not decrease the need for ventilation, and did not reduce mortality rates in COVID-19 pat i e n t s [ 1 1 ] . A r e c e n t m e t a -a n a l y s i s f o u n d t h a t hydroxychloroquine alone did not reduce mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and even when added to azithromycin, this was significantly associated with increased mortality [28] .This study's major strength is that being the first randomized study to eval uate the effect of combining hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.On the other hand, the study's limitations may be depending mainly on the patients' clinical outcomes and not the viremic response. However, this is due to the limited resources in such a developing country. Another limitation is that zinc absorption may be limited with high phytate diet, and other medications and serum zinc were not measured before, during, or after treatment in tis clinical trial.In conclusion, zinc supplements did not add value or enhance the clinical efficacy of HCQ. Zinc supplementation may be studied further with other drug regimens for COVID 19, but it did not add any clinical values when added to HCQ. ","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-27","11"

It is a breathing infection that can spread from individual to the individual causing virus-like indicators and, in severe cases, death. It was first reported in China and the World Health Organization affirmed the occurrence of a pandemic 1 although it has now spread throughout the globe. 2 COVID-19 impurity is rumored to spread through breathing large droplets, contact with bodily fluids, and with contaminated surfaces. 3 The COVID-19 epidemic is transmitted individual to individual through infected air precipitation, people making contact with fingers or faces that contain the virus and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unclean hands.Africa recorded 23,209 coronavirus deaths and the confirmed cases have risen to 1,045,234 . Ethiopia is currently one of the most impacted nations relative to the proportion of COVID-19 case development and contagion. A state of emergency lasting five months has been imposed by the Prime Minister. All land borders have since been shut as a virus control measure with several restrictions and implementation of physical distancing and mask-wearing measures. But the pandemic is rising due to a temperature change (summer season) and the public ignoring Ministry of Health rules for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethiopia recorded 407 coronavirus deaths since the epidemic began, according to Ethiopia's Ministry of Health (9 August 2020). In addition, Ethiopia reported 22,818 coronavirus cases.The main restriction to silence the matter is the lack of potential injections to treat or control the disease. This investigation aimed to assess the risk factors of COVID-19 deaths in Ethiopia using multiple linear regression models.The source of the data for this study was the 2020 Ethiopian Ministry of Health's monthly reports from March up to July. The data accessed from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health is freely available. The data from the case records were handled with strong responsibility and confidentiality. The study was started after the approval statement was obtained from the Injibara University research committee.The response variable for this study was the number of deaths from COVID-19 per month. The predictor variables were the number of new confirmed cases, recovered, serious or critical cases, total tests, and average temperature.The multiple linear regression model is a regression model with one response or regressed variable and two or more than two explanatory or predictor variables. The general form of multiple linear regression models is as follows:Where, Y is the response variable, X 1 , X 2 , . . ., X p are the explanatory variables, p is the number of explanatory variables, and ε is the stochastic disturbance term.A test of model adequacy is accomplished by testing the null hypothesis:We say that the linear model is adequate in explaining the relationship between the response variable and one or more of the predictor variables if the P-value of ANOVA < the critical value.To test whether each of the coefficients is significant or not, the null and alternative hypotheses are given by: If | t j | > t α/2 (n-pi1), we reject H 0 and conclude that β j is significant, that is, the regressor variable X j , j = 1, 2, . . .., p, significantly affects the dependent variable Y.As shown in Table 1 , among 468,814 total tests, 9,027 were recovered, 20,900 were confirmed cases and 365 were deaths from coronavirus disease in Ethiopia. Table 2 shows that the average temperature in March, April, May, June, and July are 25 °C, 25 °C, 25 °C, 23 °C, and 21 °C, respectively. The incidence of analysis is an effect of the average monthly temperature on the monthly number of deaths. All five predictor variables are not significant for the response variable. By using the backward selection method, temperature, total tests, and critical or serious cases were the most important variables.Based on Table 3 , p-value (0.002) < 0.05 (5% level of significance). Thus, the linear regression model is adequate.Based on Table 4 , there is no multicollinearity problem because tolerance is greater than 0.1 and VIF is less than 10. R-squared value is 0.67 which is 67% of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the variation of the independent variables.The null hypothesis in the Breusch-Pagan test is homoscedasticity is that the data are homoscedastic and the alternative hypothesis is that the data are heteroscedastic. Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than the critical value (α=0.05). P-value = 0.56 > 0.05, we accept the null hypothesis, i.e. the data are homoscedastic. As shown below in Table 4 , critical cases and average temperature per month significantly affected the number of deaths at the 5% level of significance. Critical or serious cases significantly and positively affected the number of deaths per month, while the average temperature significantly and negatively affected the number of deaths from COVID-19. The estimated coefficient of the critical cases is 0.570. Holding average temperature and total tests constant, a one-person increase in critical cases results in a 0.57 unit increase in the number of deaths. The estimated value of deaths decreases by 35.1 units for each increase of 1 degree Celsius of average temperature, holding critical cases and total tests constant.The principal purpose of this research was to identify the risk factors of COVID-19 deaths monthly in Ethiopia based on the 2020 Ministry of Health data. As the results revealed, the average temperature per month was found to be an important predictor for the deaths of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Based on the data, from dry season to summer season, COVID-19 deaths increased. That means the average temperature in June and July was cold (low) as compared to other months and high death rates occurred in the summer season. This study revealed that the low average temperature was safe (not harmful) to the virus. This result is in line with other studies. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] According to the results, the critical case was a significant determinant of COVID-19 deaths. Anyone who has progressed to a serious cases was in old age or living with other infected diseases such as hypertension, HIV/AIDS, sugar diseases, people who have breathing problems, and so on. The findings of this study indicate that as the number of critical cases increases the number of people passing away from the COVID-19 virus also rises. A high level of critical cases elevated the COVID-19 deaths. This result is consistent with others' findings. [10] [11] [12] The aim of this investigation was to assess the factors of COVID-19 deaths. The study was based on secondary data obtained from the Ministry of Health (Ethiopia). The current study indicated that critical cases and average temperature were the risk factors that influence COVID-19 deaths in Ethiopia. To minimize deaths from COVID, we should be able to clean hands regularly with soap and water, wear facemasks, follow instructions from public and global health institutions, especially keeping social distance from critical cases, and stay at home mainly in the summer season.COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.The author acknowledges the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia and the National Meteorology Agency.The author reports no conflicts of interest for this work.

On 5 June 2020, WHO reported that confirmed COVID-19 cases have exceeded 6.6 million globally, with over 391,000 fatalities and more than 2.87 million recoveries [5] .COVID-19 is different from its previous ancestor in that it is highly transmissible and contagious, where it is rated to be 2 times more so than that of seasonal influenza [6] . The virus spread mainly from human to human via respiratory droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose of an infected person and This article is part of the Topical Collection on COVID-19 direct contact which led to this immense number of infected people [7] .During a pandemic, healthcare organizations are supposed to have a main role, where healthcare professionals are at extreme risk of exposure and getting infected [8] . During the outbreak of SARS, they underwent a lot of anxiety and bother that may be related to the overstressed and fragile healthcare system [9, 10] .With the deteriorating situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers and medical students posted in wards are also supposed to be at risk of getting infected [11] .Medical universities all over the world have rapidly developed new strategies to establish innovative experiences for students who were suspended from their clinical rotations [12] .Moreover, many universities across the world rapidly take a decision to develop new strategies and to shift many of their educational activities from face-to-face mode to an online one using a lot of applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Cisco Webex, and Zoom [13] .In Egypt, by the beginning of April 2020, there were over 800 confirmed cases, with more than 50 fatalities, and a rapid tendency towards an increase [14] . Over about 1 month, the number of confirmed cases increased enormously to reach 31,115 cases on 5 June 2020, with about 1166 fatality cases, a jump that can cause anxiety and fear in the community [15] .Recently, there are ongoing research studies on COVID-19, and as a new disease, many facts continue to change rapidly. In parallel to this, many myths and fake news spread in the general public, and with the extensive use of social media, they highly pervade causing more stress, fear, confusion, and anxiety among individuals [16] .Medical students are the first persons who may have close contact with the infected people. Different research studies on medical students during different pandemics have stated that they experienced high levels of psychological stress and anxiety, which may lead to undesirable effects on their education and overall psychological wellbeing [17, 18] .Most of the recent emerged multiple studies related to COVID-19 have focused on topics such as epidemiology, genetic characteristics of the virus, and its clinical consequences; however, there is a scarcity of information on the COVID-19 pandemic-related knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perception among undergraduate medical students in Egypt [19, 20] .Therefore, this present study aimed to evaluate knowledge, risk perception, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate medical students in Egypt, particularly with its expansion in Egypt and other countries of the world and the uncertainty surrounding it.This is a cross-sectional observational study to evaluate knowledge, risk perception, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate medical students in Egypt by using an anonymous online questionnaire. The survey was conducted through a link shared on social networking sites. The study was conducted from 19 June 2020 to 26 June 2020. The medical students of Suez Canal University fulfilled the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study and were included by using convenience and snowball sampling technique. The sample size of 283 was calculated using www.openepi.com keeping an anticipated frequency of 75.8%, in view of a study done in Pakistan [11] which estimated that 75.8% of participants felt at risk of contracting COVID-19 infection at the university, while the confidence interval was 95% and absolute precision 5%.Medical students in the faculty of medicine of both sexes, who agreed to participate in the study, were included. Those who are less than 18 years old as they are not willing to give consent and other universities were excluded.The semi-structured questionnaire consisted of four parts: [22, 23] and COVID-19 [24, 25] . These items include COVID-19 basic science and its etiology, symptoms and incubation period, diagnosis, transmission, public prevention, medical professionals' specific prevention, treatment, and referring suspicious cases. A correct answer will have 1 point, and an incorrect answer or ""I don't know"" will have 0 points. The total score was converted into a percentile. A score ≥ 75% will be designated as high, 50-75% as moderate, and ≤ 50% as a low level of knowledge. 3. Self-reported preventive behaviors: include previously validated and reliable 9 items used in previous studies [22, 24] . Practices such as reducing the use of public places in daily life, preventive behavior during coughing, intensive handwashing, surface disinfection, and talking with people about prevention. Choices are ""yes"" or ""no."" One point was assigned for each appropriate behavior and 0 points for inappropriate behaviors. The total score ranged from 0 to 9 and then converted to a percentile.The questionnaire was face validated by three expert opinions with no major modifications. A pilot study was carried out on 20 students before the study to assess the feasibility and reliability of the questionnaire, with acceptable Cronbach's α of 0.7.Data were collected through an online semi-structured questionnaire using Google forms with a consent form included with it. Consent was obtained from the vice-dean of the faculty to send forms to groups of the faculty students. The link to the questionnaire was sent through WhatsApp groups and faculty students' Facebook groups. The participants were encouraged to roll out the survey to more colleagues as they could. On receiving and clicking the link, the participants were directed to the information about the study and informed consent. After they accept to take the survey, they will fill up the demographic details. Then, a set of several questions appear consecutively, in which the participants answer.Outcome variables: knowledge and risk perception related to the COVID-19 pandemic and self-reported preventive behaviors.Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS V20.0). The normal distribution of the continuous data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Descriptive statistics data were expressed by mean and standard deviation and median and interquartile range. Frequencies and percentages were calculated and tabulated. Inferential statistics data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's correlation. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, approved the study (research no. 4207). Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study.The study included 283 medical students of Suez Canal University, and about two-thirds of the sample (173, 61.1%) were females. Age ranged between 18 and 25 years old with a mean of 20.1 years. The majority of participants were in academic years (first, second, or third) (217, 76.7%). Most of the students are living currently with their families (251, 88.7%). Only 24 (9.5%) suffer from a chronic condition (Table 1 ). Table 2 shows the level of knowledge related to the COVID-19 pandemic. About 94.7% of the students know that COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by a new species of the coronavirus family. The majority (95.1%) recognized that the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Most of them (79.2%) correctly answered the origin of COVID-19 is not clear. The majority (83.7%) recognized the symptoms of COVID-19, while 91.5% realized the incubation period of the infection. About 84.1% recognize the diagnostic test, and 94.3% know the method of transmission, while 95.1% know the circumstances of infection transmission. About preventive methods, 92.2% know the importance of handwashing and hygiene, while 89.4% know the importance of masks, and also 87.6% recognized preventing close contacts. About 78.8% of students accepted that society should wear masks, while only 43.1% accepted wearing an N95 mask during intubation and resuscitation. About half of them (49.5%) know that antiviral drugs do not treat the disease. The majority (80.2%) accepted the referral of suspected cases to the near center. The average total of all related knowledge was 80.9%. Table 3) . Table 4 shows that about 92% of the students practice preventive behaviors towards COVID-19.Females have higher percentages in regard to related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors (P < 0.001). Students who received education to COVID-19 have higher knowledge but not significant, and more in practicing preventive measures (P = 0.04). Students in clinical years have higher knowledge and practice preventive behaviors more than students in academic years. Furthermore, perceived risk is related to practicing preventive measures (P = 0.014) ( Table 5) . Table 6 shows a significant moderate correlation between related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors (r = 0.309 and P < 0.001).The present study was designed to investigate the level of related knowledge, preventive behaviors, and concerns of the undergraduate medical students regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to discuss such aspects among medical students in Egypt.Since the cases and fatalities in Egypt are still rising, especially among the healthcare workers, our hypothesis was that medical students concerned with the pandemic are affected more than others in the general population.Our study revealed that the average of correct answers of the students to the COVID-19-related knowledge was 80.92%, where 73.5% of the students have high levels of knowledge. This result is close to that mentioned by Yakar et al. [26] in his study among Turkish medical students, as the average of correct answers of the participants was 78.3%; however, this percentage is slightly lower than that found among medical students in Mumbai which was about 74% [27] . It is worth mentioning that the lowest scores of knowledge appertained to the 2 items ""During intubation, suction, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, you have to wear an N95 mask (T)"" and ""The disease can be treated by usual antiviral drugs (F)"" (43.1% and 49.5%, respectively). According to the CDC recommendation, the N95 respirator is preferred over a face mask when performing or subjected to aerosol-generating procedures [28] . Hence, medical students who will graduate in the near future should receive more courses about self-protection and the right management related to the COVID-19.On the other hand, about 95% of the students have good knowledge about the transmission of the disease through respiratory droplets and from infected persons to others. This result is in similarity to that found among the Ugandan medical students (99%) [29] but is more than that reported by the Pakistani students, where 70% of the participants only believed that airborne droplets are the main cause of transmission [11] . Our study showed that merely 33.2% of the participants reported feelings of poor physical state, and about 29% felt mentally poor. This result is in congruence with a previous Egyptian study which revealed that those who are in the medical field reported lower psychological impact than other populations [30] . However, it is in opposition to that found by Aker and Mıdık [21] in Turkey, where more than half of the students reported feelings of poor mental state.Regarding the students' risk perception, 83% of the students reported that they felt that coronavirus infection is a life-threatening illness, and more than half of them considered it the deadliest of its entire species. This is in conformity with that mentioned in the literature where COVID-19 is recognized as one of the most catastrophic diseases with many fatalities and morbidities globally that are still occurring ceaselessly on a daily basis [4] . It also found that 86.9% of the students asserted that persons infected with COVID-19 are a serious threat to society. Similarly, 88% of the Pakistani students studied by Ahmed et al. [11] confirmed the same answer.In the same context, 76.3% were concerned about the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 during ward rotations, and almost the same percentage deemed that healthcare workers are the most susceptible to acquire COVID-19 infection. These results are congruent to that found among medical students in previous studies in Iran, Pakistan, and Jordan [11, 24, 31] , where they all have the same apprehension. This matter is needed to be taken seriously, as during the MERS crisis, Abolfotouh et al. [32] reported that 7.1% of the healthcare workers changed their careers due to their worries.Our study revealed that while 69% of the students had received some sort of education about COVID-19, nearly 2/ 3 of them obtain their information about the disease through visiting the World Health Organization (WHO) website, and more than half of them obtain it using social media or YouTube channels. These results are in accordance with that found among the Turkish students [21] , where the WHO website was the most prevailing source of information, and alike the Egyptian students, more than 50% of them use social media as a usual source, a result that was reported also by other studies [21, 33, 34] . These findings should raise the concern of the governments on how to make use of these sources in a dynamic way to send targeted messages to this age group.Unexpectedly, the Health Ministry website was one of the least sources to be reported for seeking information in our study (only 32.9% of the participants), as well as in other studies conducted in Turkey and Jordan [21, 31] . This finding should stand upon the root causes of this mistrust issue regarding the sources obtained from the national official bodies.Our study displayed that 92% of the participants were practicing preventive behaviors, with high scores in most of the items; however, there is a lower score particularly to cleaning and disinfecting items (88.3%). This result is in line with that found among Iranian students, where about 94% were stacked to preventive measures, and surprisingly they reported the lowest score in disinfecting items with almost the same score (85.6%) [24] .On the other hand, on comparing the Egyptian students with their Ugandan peers in some behaviors, it was found that they scored lower percentages in regard to avoiding crowded places (95.4% vs. 99%), yet they have much better practices regarding keeping social distances and coughing around people (95.8% vs. 61%) [29] .In our study, we found that the level of female knowledge is significantly higher than that of male's (P < 0.001). However, contrary to our study, Yakar et al. [26] reported that the knowledge score of the Turkish males was significantly higher (P = 0.033). Furthermore, other studies among students in Iran and Mumbai found that there was no significant relationship between sex and knowledge [24, 27] , a finding that makes the data among all these studies irreconcilable. It was also found that senior students in the clinical years had a higher level of knowledge than their counterparts in academic ones (P < 0.001), a finding that is similar to that in former studies [26, 29] .Another finding of this study was that those who received education about COVID-19 and those with higher risk perception had significantly higher preventive attitudes (P = 0.04 and P = 0.014, respectively). This finding coincides with the study of Olum et al. [29] in regard to the received education and contradicts that of Taghrir et al. [24] where no significant differences were found between students who experienced previous education and those who did not.In addition, it was revealed that both females and senior students had also significantly better preventive practices (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Moreover, on studying the association between knowledge and preventive behaviors, it was found that there was a positive significant correlation between them (P < 0.001). Likewise, preceding studies mentioned that as the level of knowledge increases, favorable practices increase as well [26, 27, 35] ; accordingly, it is reasonable to find such findings in our study among females and students in clinical years.The study participants were from one faculty, so we cannot generalize results for all medical students. It included more students in academic years than in senior clinical years.COVID-19 pandemic-related knowledge and practicing preventive measures among Egyptian students are very good. However, there are some defects as the lowest scores of knowledge were appertained to the 2 items ""During intubation, suction, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, you have to wear an N95 mask"" and ""The disease can be treated by usual antiviral drugs."" Also, national official sites were not the most sourced sites of information to the medical students unlike the WHO website and social media. Females and senior clinical students have more knowledge and practice preventive behaviors more. Finally, related knowledge is related to practicing preventive measures, so we should raise knowledge and awareness for preventing the disease.","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-09","11"

The burden is high in low and middle income countries like Ethiopia. 3 The acquisition of occupationally-acquired infections may pose a risk to healthcare providers, patients, families, and the community at large. On top of that, outbreaks result in significant cost to health organizations, high cost of modifications, and lack of time/space. 4, 5 One of the most persistent issues is the rapid depletion of personal protective equipment (PPE).The World Health Organization and Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommend preventive measures during the pandemic such as canceling elective procedures, isolating symptomatic patients earlier, protecting healthcare personnel through implementation of hand hygiene, install barriers to limit contact with patients at triage, cohort COVID-19 patients, limit the numbers of staff providing their care, risk communication, and prioritize respirators. 6, 7 Based on reports, implementing preventive and control measures in China during the first seasons of COVID-19 pandemic prevented more than 700,000 infections across the country. 8 Despite the recommendations to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, different barriers were reported by healthcare personnel. Accordingly, the shortage of personal protective equipment, poor quality PPE, scarce diagnostic kits, turnover of staffing 9-12 inadequate training, poor adherence, poor practice to infection prevention (IP) measures, rumors and social stigma, 13,14 risk of violence, 15 poor compliance to physical distancing, 16 and fears about unpaid sick leave 17 were reported.In addition, overcrowding of healthcare institutions in a totally new context, heavy workload, fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle the patient's condition. 17 Insufficient scientific data on SARS-COV-2, 18 working in high-risk departments, longer duty hours, and suboptimal hand hygiene, 19 inadequate knowledge of COVID-19, deviations from the recommended PPE donning and doffing protocol 12, 20 and increase the risk of acquiring the infection. A recent study showed that 90% of observed doffing was incorrect, common errors were doffing gown from the front, removing face shield of the mask, and touching potentially contaminated surfaces and PPE. 21 Subsequently, professional supervision, guidance, monitoring mechanism, and routine daily environmental disinfection were also lacking as the COVID-19 pandemic disseminates all over the world. 20, 22, 23 Studies showed that infection prevention measures were 88.7% in Pakistan, 24 Gondar, 47.3%, 25 in Amhara region, 62%, 26 Debre Markos, Addis Ababa, and Mekele, 57.3%, 66.1%, and 42.9%, respectively. [27] [28] [29] The study conducted in Ethiopia showed that 42.1% had low perception to the efficacy of COVID-19 prevention measures and 28.3% had lower intention to carry out those prevention measures. 30 Poor practice of IP add up to the challenges facing healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.Infection prevention could be the primary focus during pandemic season, even if facing a shortage of resources. This could be alleviated by rational use and successful reuse of PPE; 31, 32 improving the logistics of PPE distribution to wards; maintaining written PPE use protocols; and providing structured donning and doffing training with practical simulation; 11, 33, 34 improving knowledge; positive attitudes and practices 35 hopefully can control the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess perceived barriers and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare professionals at South Gondar zone, North Central Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional survey was employed in north central Ethiopia from May 1-15/2020. Debre Tabor town is located in South Gondar Administrative Zone of the Amhara regional state, at a distance of 667 kilometers away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, and 50 kilometers east of Lake Tana. 36 The town has one general hospital and three health centers. All Healthcare professionals (HCPs) working in governmental healthcare institutions (Medical Doctors, nurses, medical lab, pharmacists, anesthetists, midwifery, physiotherapy, optometry, public health officer, and psychiatrist) working in Debretabor town were the source population. A total of 183 HCWs were included during the survey.The sample size for the study was calculated using a single proportion formula by assuming 95% CL, 5% marginal error, and 50% proportion.Since the total population is less than 10,000 we used reduction formula.So, n ¼ n 0Where n is the sample size (384) andN is the population size (432).submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13The final sample size was n=203. Healthcare providers working in Debretabor town were involved in the study. Since the data collection time at state of emergency and staff reduction, the study participants were those healthcare professional found at healthcare institutions during the data collection period, selected by convenience sampling technique.Data were collected by using self-administered questionnaire which was adopted from World Health Organization (WHO), and previous researches, 7, 24, 26, 37, 38 with some adjustment. The tool was composed of three parts, ie, Sociodemographic and work related characteristics, perceived barriers related factors, and preventive measures related factors. The data were collected by two BSc Nurses and one MSC supervisor. Completeness of each recording format was checked before collecting the data. Convenience sampling method was used to select the study participants.Preventive practice (Good, Poor).Socio-demographic and personal related factors (age, sex, marital status, monthly income, profession, year of experience), and perceived barriers.Good preventive practice -if the score is above or equal to mean score.Training was given for 1 day on how to administer questionnaires, handling ethical issues and maintaining confidentiality and privacy. Pretest was done on 5% of the sample size. Cronbach's alpha was used to check the internal validity of the tool and the value of ""α"" was 0.73. Completeness of each data collection tools was checked by the principal investigator and the supervisors in a daily base. Double data entry was done by two data clerks and consistency of the entered data was cross-checked.Data were entered, coded, cleaned, and checked by Epi-Data statistical software version 4.2.0.0 and analysis using STATA Version 14 statistical software. Chi square test was used to test show the non-parametric association of factors with preventive practice. Independent Variables with P-value less than 0.05 in chi-square test were considered as significantly associated. Finally, the data were presented in texts, figures, and tables.In the current study, a total of 183 healthcare professionals participated in the survey with response rate of 90.15%. Two thirds (67.76%) of healthcare providers were males. Four fifths (80.87%) of HCWs were in the age range of 25-35 years. More than half (53.85%) participants married and almost half (45.36%) of the participants were nurses followed by medical doctors (13.66%). Eightyseven (47.54%) of the participants had a monthly income of greater than 6,500 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) ( Table 1) .Healthcare professionals are required to practice infection prevention measures of corona virus disease. A total of eight preventive measure questions were asked. The mean (±SD) score was 9.2±1.47. Overall, good preventive practice among HCWs was 68.31% (95% CI=67.6-69). In the current study, the majority (90.16%) of HCWs avoid meeting person suspected/confirmed of COVID-19 and reduce use of public transportation. One hundred and sixty-one (87.985%) HCWs wear a facemask outdoors and similarly ventilate the room frequently as one preventive measure of COVID-19. About 32.24% and 24% of healthcare professional did not stay at home, and did not practice physical distancing, respectively ( Figure 1 ). In this study, based on the cross-tabulation; sex, age, profession, and work experience were found to be significantly associated with preventive practice as evidenced by chisquare values of 4.10, 11.71, 7.27, 7.08, and P-values of 0.043, 0.026, and 0.029, respectively. Male HCWs were 4-times more likely to practice preventive measures than female HCWs (chi 2 =4.10 at a P-value of 0.043) ( Table 2 ).During the pandemic, healthcare professionals have implemented different preventive measures of coronavirus disease as of World Health Organization recommendations. However, not all healthcare professional are practicing those preventive measures. In the current study, good preventive measures were implemented by 68.31%. This is higher than a study conducted in Ethiopia (62%). 26 The possible reason could be the difference in sample size, way of data collection, and area coverage, but lower than a studies conducted in China (89.7%) 39 and Pakistan (88.7%). 24 This could be due to those studies being conducted in the country where the pandemic was first detected. In addition, China had previous experience of the pandemic. In another way there is a big difference in socio economical and healthcare system.The majority, of participants' practice the recommended preventive measures, however low in implementing physical distancing, and stay home ( Figure 1 ). Physical distancing and movement restriction [40] [41] [42] had been declared as one of the most effective for mitigating the pandemics. The study conducted in China 43 revealed that implementing social/physical distancing was sufficient to control COVID-19. Another study showed that implementation of any physical distancing intervention reduced Covid-19 incidence by 13%. 44 In this study, only three quarters (75.82%) of participants practice physical distancing. Evidence from Ethiopia 37 at the beginning of the epidemic showed physical distancing was less implemented. This increased mass gathering and transmission of coronavirus.A low level of practicing preventive measures may be associated with different barriers. Two thirds (66.12%) of healthcare professionals perceived overcrowding in the Emergency room as a barrier in infection control practice. This is higher than a study conducted in Pakistan, where it was only 52.9%. 24 HCWs perceive overcrowding in the Emergency room is a barrier in infection control practice. The possible difference could be Pakistan had an experience of previous pandemic like influenza so had a better clinical setup for the pandemic.More than half (52.46%) reported the limitation of infection control material to be a barrier during the pandemic. A similar study in Pakistan showed that 50.7% 24 of HCWs reported limited infection control materials. This was also reported by similar studies done in Ethiopia, 45, 46 where resource scarcity was the main reason to practice preventive measures. This is true that provide intense education and training on use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, ward disinfection, medical waste management, and sterilization of patient-care devices and management of More than half (55.19%) reported that no hand washing after examinations or contact with the patient was a barrier for preventive measures of coronavirus disease. This is higher than the studies conducted in Gondar hospital (14.9%), 48 and central Gondar (16.5%). 49 The possible reasons could be the current study is conducted during the pandemic. Poor accessibility of hand washing facilities, knowledge of infection prevention, and workover load 50 were reported as barriers for poor hand hygiene compliance in developing countries. Future studies should be conducted by including behavioral (attitudinal) factors, cultural factors, socioeconomical and work satisfaction related factors which may have a great impact on those preventive measure. Since the study was conducted during a state of emergency, a limited number of healthcare professionals were included.Lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic offer hospital preparedness and response with the goal of protecting the front-line healthcare workers. The majority of HCWs practice preventive measures of COVID-19, however it was shown that HCWs had a gap in practicing physical distancing, stay at homeing, and ventilating the room frequently. The finding showed that there are different perceived barriers which hinder preventive practices in the study setting, some of which were: overcrowding in the emergency room, lack of infection prevention and control materials, insufficient training in infection control measures, and no hand washing after examinations or contact with the patient. The government and healthcare institution should work in strengthening infection prevention practices by reducing the barriers. Attention should be given for the safety of healthcare professionals and the community at large. In addition, frequent supervision, monitoring, and communication are important.

It was first recognized in China in late December 2019 as an unknown respiratory disease outbreak.Due to its high risk of contagiousness and human-to-human transmission, it has reached global pandemic level in a very short time C. Lai et al., 2020) . As of September 18, 2020, WHO has reported 30,055,710 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 943,433 deaths globally.(WHO, 2020) On the same day, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health has also reported 67,515 total confirmed cases and 1,072 deaths in the country (MOH, 2020) .Healthcare workers (HCWs) dealing with COVID-19 are under increased psychological pressure, and experience high rates of psychiatric morbidity, resembling the situation during the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza epidemics . Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress are the common mental health disorders that occur during such a dramatic global health crisis Pappa et al., 2020) . A recent study among 1257 healthcare professionals in a tertiary hospital in China, revealed a high prevalence of mental health symptoms among HCWs. Overall, 50.4%, 44.6%, 34.0%, and 71.5% of health workers reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Nurses, females, and frontline HCWs were affected more than others with these mental disorders (Bohlken et al., 2020) .To date, studies on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCWs are limited in Sub Saharan Africa. The aims of the current study were to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress among HCWs and associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic at St. Paul's Tertiary Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.The study was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey that was conducted to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and mental distress among healthcare workers at St. Paul's Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic from August 1 st , 2020 up to August 30, 2020.The sample size was determined based on a single population formula for a finite population of 2308 HCWs with a 95% CI, 5% margin of error, and taking the highest of the prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress of 50.4% Sofia et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) , 44.6% Sofia et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) , 34.3% Sofia et al., 2020; ) , and 71.5% Zhu et al., 2020) respectively from similar studies. By considering a 10% non-response rate and applying a sample correction formula, a total sample size of 272 HCWs will be included in the study. To allow for subgroup analysis, we amplified the sample size by 50% with a goal of at least 430 completed questionnaires from participants. Healthcare workers working in either in-patient or out-patient units or COVID or non-COVID units of the Hospital were included. Healthcare workers who had previous mental illnesses, not involved in the diagnosis or treatment of patients, and those who did not give consent were excluded from the study.Healthcare worker (HCW): health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory professionals and pharmacists) who have close contact with patients in the diagnostic and treatment units of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College.Frontline HCWs: participants who are directly engaged in clinical activities of diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with confirmed COVID-19.Non-firstline (Second-line) HCWs: participants who are not directly engaged in clinical activities of diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with confirmed COVID-19 but could be indirectly exposed while involved in the care of other patients who might be in a pre-symptomatic stage of COVID-19.Healthcare workers of both sexes working in both out-patient and in-patient units of St.Data were collected by trained residents and nurses.The data collectors categorized the participants by asking whether they were directly engaged in clinical activities of diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with confirmed COVID-19.Each completed questionnaire was entered into EPI data version 7, cleaned, and exported into SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. All the variables were categorical and presented as numbers and percentages. The original scores of the 4 measurement tools were continuous, not normally distributed, and thus presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR). A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were applied to compare the severity of each symptom between two or more groups. The ranked data, which were derived from the counts of each level for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress were presented as numbers and percentages. To determine potential risk factors for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress in participants, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the associations between risk factors and outcomes were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, after adjustment for confounders, including age, sex, marital status, profession, educational level, technical rank, monthly salary, work experience, and working position (frontline or non-frontline). Finally, a p-value <0.05 in a multivariable model was considered as significant.This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Each participant's information was collected by residents and nurses using an anonymous precoded structured questionnaire that was assigned to each selected HCW. The code was blinded to both data collectors and data entry clerks. The information was kept confidential among the investigators. A participant who had severe symptoms of mental disorder was traced by a psychiatrist (one of the investigators) and advised on further evaluation and treatment. Those who volunteered were linked to our psychiatric clinic.The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress was found to be 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% respectively. The median (IQR) scores on the PHQ-9 for depression, the GAD-7 for anxiety, the ISI for insomnia, and the IES-R for distress for all respondents were 4.0 (1.0-9.0), 3.0 (0-8.0), 4.0 (1.0-9.0), and 11.0 (4.0-25.0), respectively. Respondents were categorized based on the severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress. Moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety insomnia, and distress were reported in 57 (13.6%), 49 (11.7%), 43 (10.2%), and 71 (16.9%) respondents. Severe symptoms of depression, anxiety insomnia, and distress were also reported in 28 (6.7%), 24 (5.7%), 9 (2.1%), and 30 ( Moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and distress were also more common among frontline HCWs (Table 3) .Thought of resigning from work due to COVID-19 was reported in significantly higher proportion of respondents with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress (p-values <0.01). Worrying of life-threatening situation once infected was reported in a significant proportion of respondents with symptoms of depression (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8; p = 0.007). The study also assessed whether or not the respondents were satisfied with the psychological protective measures implemented at St. Paul's Hospital.A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the demographic and relevant contextual factors that are associated with mental health illnesses. In the adjusted logistic regression analysis, several factors were independently associated with depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10), anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 9), insomnia (ISI score ≥ 15), and psychological distress (IES-R score ≥ 33). Factors that were independently associated with a higher risk of depression included being married (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.6; p=0.003) andworking in frontline position (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.5; p=0.009). Working in frontline position is also associated with more severe symptoms of anxiety (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9;p=0.02) and psychological distress (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.2-15.5; p<0.001). Working as a doctor was associated with a lower risk of experiencing anxiety (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.51; p = 0.004) and insomnia (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.59; p=0.013) than working as a laboratory or pharmacy professional (Table 5) .Abbreviation: ISI, OR, odds ratio; This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of common psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers at St. Paul's Hospital. The survey revealed a significant proportion of mental health symptoms among healthcare workers at St.Paul's Hospital. Overall, 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% of all respondents reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress respectively.Similarly, doctors were at lower risk of experiencing severe symptoms of anxiety and insomnia as compared to other healthcare professionals. As a result, our findings raise a concern about the psychological well-being of HCWs involved in the care and treatment of COVID-19.Our finding is consistent with several other studies (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Que et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) After adjusting for confounding factors, working in a frontline position was an independent risk factor for all mental health outcomes, compared to working in a non-frontline position.An interesting finding of our study was that thought of resigning from work due to COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. In contrary, being satisfied with work-shift arrangements, logistic support, and accommodation implemented by the hospital administration were the protective factors associated with lower risk of severe symptoms of mental disorders. A similar finding was recently reported by Zhu et al. from a study conducted during the earlier stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China .Similar to a study from China , our finding further indicated that HCWs who were married reported more severe symptoms of depression. This might be due to increased occupational exhaustion and family responsibilities among married than unmarriedHCWs. In addition, doctors, nurses, and midwives were at lower risk of experiencing severe symptoms of anxiety and insomnia than laboratory and pharmacy professionals. This could be explained by the fact that higher proportion of doctors and nurses received medical training related to COVID-19 by the hospital administration as compared to laboratory and pharmacy professionals which should be established with further studies.The strengths of the study were the use of random sampling method and adequate number of participants. However, our study has several limitations which should be addressed in the future. First, it was a single-centre study and the findings may not be nationally representative. Second, it was a cross-sectional study and was not the best method of determining correlation and causation. Third, all the data collected were self-reported by the respondents and could be exposed to social desirability bias and more objective data can be used in future similar research.In conclusion, the study demonstrates that a significant proportion of healthcare workers are suffering from symptoms of mental health disorders during COVID-19 pandemic at St.Paul's Hospital. Being married and working in frontline were independently associated with a greater risk of experiencing severe symptoms of mental disorders.Strategies to provide psychological support should be implemented by the hospital administration for the mental health of HCWs in order to control the impact of the Pandemic.Long-term surveillance should be implemented to monitor the mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers.HAM and MT conceived and developed the study protocol and drafted the manuscript.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMOs) have been used successfully to oxygenate and decarbonate blood [3, 4] , and there are a number of indications for the use of ECMO [5] . However, its use is costly and resource intensive [6] .Our objective is not to replace ECMO but rather to investigate repurposing of renal hollow fiber membrane dialysers (HFMDs) as cost-effective augmentation of respiratory support in resource-constrained environments.Unlike purpose-designed ECMO membranes [7, 8] , renal dialysis membranes are designed for liquid-liquid transfer of specific molecules. Nonetheless, their existing clinical approval for renal replacement therapy makes repurposing HFMDs as oxygenators an attractive option.Nominal O 2 consumption in adults is approximately 250 ml·min −1 (STP) (0.357 g·min −1 ) [9] . e purpose of respiratory support is to achieve concentrations of O 2 and CO 2 in arterial blood that are compatible with proper organ function. Repurposed dialysers could potentially provide sufficient gas transfer to compensate for the respiratory deficit in some patients.We investigated O 2 transfer in a renal HFMD using water as a blood substitute.is facilitated exclusion of problems such as air bubble formation and transmembrane fluid leakage. e minimum O 2 transfer rate in water motivated further experiments with blood.eoretical Considerations and Computational Methodology. Mass transfer in the HFMD is modelled by the following equation:where k 0 is the mass transfer coefficient, A is the membrane area, qO 2 is the rate of oxygen transferred, and LMΔpO 2 is the logarithmic mean of partial pressure differences at the top and bottom of the device. Defining the partial pressure difference between the blood inlet and the oxygen flow outlet as ΔpO (2)To achieve a given qO 2 , this equation facilitates determination of the minimum k 0 A of the device.As oxygen transport capacity of blood resides primarily in haemoglobin, it reaches saturation at a low partial pressure of oxygen.us, we can assume that oxygen transfer into blood takes place within a narrow range of partial pressures. Also, for high-purity oxygen, the pO 2 may be regarded as essentially constant. e oxygen-carrying capacity of blood is 8800 μM of O 2 bound to the Hb for 100% saturation [10] and dissolved O 2 in blood is negligible. e HFMD cartridges are designed for blood flow rates up to 500 ml/min, and we evaluate oxygencarrying capacity of blood for an Hb concentration of 15 g/ 100 ml and a typical oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.At sea level atmospheric pressure, and for a typical venous and arterial pO 2 of 6 and 12.7 kPa (and corresponding HbSat of 45% and 95%), respectively, the oxygen uptake in 500 ml of blood and the ΔpO top 2 and ΔpO bottom 2 are calculated and substituted into (2) to estimate the required k 0 A. is is repeated for an inlet venous HbSat of 25% as shown in Table 1 .It is assumed that mass transfer across the membrane is rate limiting rather than mass transfer through blood or the reaction of oxygen with haemoglobin.e experiments were conducted at the Biotechnology Laboratory at UNISA, Johannesburg, at an altitude of about 1700 m with atmospheric pressure about 84 kPa and temperature about 25°C.A low-flux Leoceed-21N (Asahi Kasei Medical) hollow fiber membrane renal dialyser cartridge was used in this study. e polysulfone membrane has an effective surface area of 2.1 m 2 , and the HFMD has a priming volume of 108 ml and an internal fiber diameter and wall thickness of 185 μm and 35 μm, respectively. e manufacturer-specified maximum blood flow rate is 500 ml·min −1 (mean residence time about 13 s at this flow rate). Maximum transmembrane pressure (TMP) is rated at 80 kPa.Tap water was deoxygenated by boiling and allowed to cool in a sealed glass bottle and measured for dissolved oxygen (SD 400 OXI L, Lovibond, Amesbury, UK). e deoxygenated water was pumped through the vertically mounted HFMD using a peristaltic pump (Qdos Chemical Metering Pumps, Watson Marlow, Cornwell, UK) via the blood inlet at 50, 200, and 500 ml·min −1 and discharged into a beaker covered with parafilm to minimize oxygen losses.High-purity (>99%) oxygen (Afrox Gas, Johannesburg, South Africa) was passed countercurrent through the HFMD via the dialysate inlet, using a pressure regulator set between 60 and 80 kPa (gauge) followed by a needle valve to control flow rate at 400 ml ·min −1 .is study with human blood was approved by the Institutional Review Recently expired donor whole blood (SANBS) was warmed in a water bath at 37°C and pooled in a glass flask to constitute approximately 4.5 l to which approximately 3000 units of heparin (heparin sodium mucosal, Fresenius Kabi, 5 ml of 1000·U/ml) was added.Nitrogen sparge gas was bubbled through the blood to reduce the % oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (HbSat) to typical venous levels [11] . e nitrogen flow was gradually increased from 1 l/min until froth was visualized.As shown in Figure 1 , blood was pumped by a roller pump through the hollow fibers of a vertically mounted HFMD, from top to bottom, at 500 ml/min. e upstream placement of the roller pump reduces the risk of red blood cell lysis prior to oxygenation. Blood was discharged into a collecting flask. Oxygen was passed countercurrent at 1250 ml/min through the outside of the fibers. e pump was placed ≈0.5 m below the base of the HFMD to achieve a pressure head, thus reducing the required suction, making sampling easier. e blood was piped through dialysis tubing fitted with inlet and outlet sampling ports (Fresenius Kabi).After priming with normal saline, the flow was switched to blood, which was mixed by swirling, prior to and during the experiments.Two runs were performed using a Leoceed-21N (Asahi Kasei Medical) HFMD and the third run using a Leoceed-18N (effective surface area of 1.8 m 2 and priming volume 96 ml). A high-flux Leoceed H-type dialyser was also tested, but fluid leakage across the membrane into the gas side was noted, suggesting that this high-flux dialyser may not be suitable for oxygenation.Two to four inlet and outlet blood samples of 1-4 ml each were taken for each run with heparin-coated syringes and analysed with a blood gas analyser (Radiometer, ABL80 FLEX CO-OX) for haemoglobin concentration (Hb), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ), partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ), and haemoglobin saturation (HbSat). Bicarbonate ion concentrations (HCO − 3 ) were calculated by the blood gas analyser.Measurements were averaged for each run over the sample number. Measurement uncertainties were reported as ± 1 standard deviation based on rounded estimates from coefficients of variation [12, 13] and scaled for sample number.Oxygen was passed through the HFMD at 400 ml/min and water was run countercurrent through the inside of the hollow fibers. Inlet oxygen concentration was measured at 3.61 mg/l, at 37.1°COutflow water was collected in beakers and oxygen concentration measured. Table 2 shows these data and corresponding calculated oxygen transfer rates. e low reading of 28.6 mg·l −1 is probably due to higher overall oxygen losses at saturation due to the slower flow rate.Equation (2) is used to estimate k 0 A based on the minimum oxygen transfer rate of 14.6 mg·min −1 at 500 ml·min −1 . Dissolved oxygen concentration is treated as negligible as haemoglobin carries most of the oxygen. e oxygen exit stream is at atmospheric pressure, and the water inlet's partial pressure is given by the % saturation read from the dissolved oxygen meter × pO 2 in air at 84 kPa, which amounts to a difference of ΔpO top 2 = 72 kPa. e oxygen outlet pressure has little influence on the large driving force for mass transfer.e ΔpO bottom 2 requires knowledge of the unmeasured gas pressure as it enters the HFMD. e pressure regulator reading was 60 kPa, but most of the pressure drop occurs at the needle valve. Also, prior to membrane contact, there was a contractor connection and the expansion/elbow entering the membrane unit, whereas on the discharge side there was just the expansion/elbow and a short length of tubing to the discharge. While it is not possible to exactly know the pressure in the membrane unit, it must be considerably lower than the regulator's pressure reading, and a simple estimate suggests that the relevant pressure drop is as low as 0.1 kPa.Because the outlet water stream is at or above saturation, the partial pressure difference at that point is at most equal to that overpressure amount. us, the mass transfer coefficient calculations are highly sensitive to the actual pressure in this region.For a 0.1 kPa partial pressure drop across the ΔpO bottom 2 and a minimum oxygen transfer rate measured at 14.6 mg/ min, equation (2) yields a k 0 A value of 1.334 mg·min −1 ·kPa −1 . is implies a 3.4-fold larger oxygen mass transfer rate than required to fully oxygenate blood to 95% saturation for incoming pO 2 of 45 mmHg and 1.7-fold larger than needed if the incoming pO 2 is 25 mmHg. Even in the unlikely case of a ΔpO bottom 2 of 6 kPa, the potential mass transfer rate of oxygen will be 1.4-fold larger than the minimum needed for incoming blood with oxygen partial pressure of 45 mmHg and 70% of the required amount for an incoming saturation of 25 mmHg. Figure 2 , the dark blood entering the top and bright red blood exiting from the bottom of the HFMD is clear evidence of oxygenation.Measurements from the inlet and outlet ports from two runs using a Leoceed-21N HFMD and one run using the Leoceed-18N HFMD are shown in Table 3 . Samples (n � 2 to 4) were averaged and reported ± one standard deviation measurement uncertainty.Measurement uncertainties for the blood gas analyser were approximated as 1% for pO 2 , pCO 2 , and Hb and 0.1% for HbSat based on the reported coefficient of variation data [12, 13] . e high values for pCO 2 are in keeping with known changes in stored blood [14] .Oxygen content per 100 ml of blood was calculated using a conservative Hüfner constant of 1.31 as follows [15] :Oxygen content per 100 ml � 1.31 · HbSat · 0.01 + 0.0225 · pO 2 .(3)Substituting the differential values for HbSat and pO 2 between inlet and outlet into (3), the oxygen transfer rate (VO 2 ) in ml(STP)·min −1 for a blood flow rate of 500 ml/min was calculated as shown in Table 4 . is table also shows the percentage of the nominal 250 ml(STP)·min −1 oxygen consumption rate (VO 2,n ) and the % maximum (100% HbSat at the outlet at prevailing Hb) oxygen transfer rate (VO 2,max ).Highest oxygen transfer rates were obtained on Run 1 with the 21N HFMD. Run 2 utilising the same HFMD showed diminished oxygen transfer rates compared to Run 1, probably due to fouling of the HFMD which was noted prior to the second run. Run 3 with the 18N HFMD showed the lowest oxygen transfer rates which is consistent with the smaller surface area.Using equation (2), the product of the mass transfer coefficient and the area (k 0 A) estimates for oxygen was 0.72, 0.56, and 0.69 mg·kPa −1 ·min −1 for runs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. ese estimates are in close agreement with theoretical k 0 A estimates for blood which ranged from 0.389 to 0.787 mg·kPa −1 min −1 . ese estimates are also in keeping with the minimum estimated k 0 A of 1.33 mg·kPa −1 ·min −1 for a minimum oxygen transfer rate of 14.6 mg·min −1 determined in the water experiments.While the principal purpose of this study is blood oxygenation, CO 2 elimination is also an important consideration. Table 2 : Minimum oxygen transfer rates calculated from differential dissolved oxygen concentrations between inlet and outflow water.Water flow rate (ml/min) Dissolved oxygen in collected water outflow (mg/l) Calculated oxygen transfer rate (mg/min) 5028.6 1.25 200>32.9 (out of range) >5.85 500 >32.9 (out of range) >14.6 e outlet partial pressure of CO 2 was estimated by performing a CO 2 mass balance using pCO 2 and HCO − 3 , together with the oxygen flow rate of 1250 ml/min. From the pCO 2 and HCO − 3 concentrations at the inlet and outlet on each run, and treating CO 2 binding to Hb as negligible, total CO 2 concentrations were calculated as shown in Table 5 . Using equation (2), k 0 A for CO 2 was estimated for runs 1, 2, and 3 as 6.0, 6.6, and 19.4 mg·kPa −1 ·min −1 , respectively. e 3-fold higher value for the 18N dialyser is probably due to the sensitivity of the calculation to the indirectly estimated outlet pCO 2 , and uncertainties in the bicarbonate concentrations which are calculated rather than directly measured by the ABL80 FLEX CO-OX.e minimum membrane oxygen transfer rate in the water experiments informed the decision to proceed to studies with blood. e experiments with blood flowing at 500 ml/min yielded k 0 A values for oxygen which were in close agreement with the theoretically determined values and the measured value in the water study. is suggests that a Leoceed-21N HFMD would facilitate oxygen transfer rates of about 15% of the nominal 250 ml(STP)/min adult oxygen consumption rate. Using two 21N dialysers in parallel with total blood flow rates of up to 1 l/min would facilitate approximately 30% of this nominal oxygen consumption rate.As these studies were performed at ambient pressures (85 kPa), operating at sea level and/or designing the system for increased pressure on the inlet gas may achieve an oxygen flux closer to 20% (40% with two HFMDs in parallel) of the nominal adult oxygen consumption subject to sufficient Hb in the blood.Estimated k 0 A values for CO 2 were at least an order of magnitude higher than the k 0 A for oxygen, suggesting that oxygenation will be rate limiting and CO 2 elimination will be readily achieved [16] . CO 2 elimination may even exceed its production rate, possibly requiring reduction of the fresh gas flow rate or adding CO 2 to the fresh gas supply to limit CO 2 losses.A suitable repurposed HFMD with veno-venous access may provide a cost-effective, practical adjunct to respiratory support where ECMO is precluded.Improvements in performance may be achievable in desperate situations by exceeding the specified maximum blood flow of 500 ml/min and increasing the gas-side pressure. However, this should be weighed against risk of damage to the unit resulting in patient harm, including air embolism.Other considerations such as red blood cell damage, hemodynamic instability, cytokine activation, white blood cell depletion, coagulation, and bleeding are likely to be similar to those encountered in dialysis and will need to be addressed by clinicians before considering such an approach.Dialysis pumps are costly, and presumably most are in service for renal therapy; thus, alternative low-cost pumps would be needed. However, the absence of automatic monitoring may increase risks such as undetected venous air embolisation and will require weighing the trade-offs in the face of a pandemic.Further tests are essential to determine which HFMDs can be used for oxygentation and to establish the duration for which they can be operated before significant leakage occurs. Clinical implementation would also require consideration of the placement of the venous catheters, double vs. single lumens, and the need for noncollapsible catheters under higher flow rates.is study points to the potential for HFMD repurposing as off-label blood oxygenators in dire, resource-constrained environments. Translational research with full cooperation of regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions would be needed to assess clinical utility, feasibility, and safety prior to any consideration of clinical implementation.Readers interested in obtaining the raw data in Excel format should send an e-mail request to the corresponding author.Dr Claudia Do Vale's clinical practice includes managing patients at Fresenius Dialysis units. e authors declare that there are no other potential conflicts of interest.","South Africa","first author","2020-11-03","11"

As of October 25, 2020, globally, more than 1,153,861 people have died from COVID-19, and estimates of future deaths number in the millions. 1 While Ethiopia has confirmed the first case of COVID-19 on March 13, 2020, and took several steps to detect, manage, and control transmission of COVID-19. As of October 25, Ethiopia has registered a total of 92,858 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1419 total deaths and 12 death rates from 1,437,497 total tests and expected to rise as the case detection and laboratory tests capacity expands. 2 In Ethiopia, COVID cases increased by twelve folds between June and September and currently holds the highest COVID-19 caseload in East Africa. 3 This virus is primarily transmitted rapidly between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes and about 44% of transmission of it occur before the onset of symptoms. 4, 5 Having underlining health conditions, advance age, reduced ability to access and understand health information, and failure to take optimal healthpromoting are among the greatest risk factors for sever infection and death due to COVID-19. 6, 7 The state of emergency was declared by the government on 8th of April, 2020 to control the pandemic that includes closing schools, banning public gatherings, and requiring employees to work from home. 8 Hand-washing, mask wearing and social distancing are the main prevention measures that government has communicated to the public through various media platforms. 9 COVID-19 pandemic results in widespread disruption to health systems and reduced access to food, and Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) can expect to see large increases in maternal and child deaths. 10 The pandemic could also affect routine health-care services. 11 In Ethiopia, whose medical system is under-resourced and the economy is subsistence, the health crisis of the people may be compounded by lost livelihoods and hunger crisis unless concerned government organizations and individuals implement the pandemic protection guideline most at once. 12 Good levels of COVID-19 knowledge and risk feeling of the disease were significantly affected by information source (like; media) related factors. 13 Too much access to these media may lead people to overestimate the risk of COVID-19, then increase fear and worry about the disease. 14 On the other hand, inappropriate social media exposure during the COVID-19 outbreak increase the occurrence of mental health problems, misperception, or misinformation, and result in poor compliance to preventive measures like social distancing. [15] [16] [17] Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 held misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. 18 The online survey study in Taiwan showed that 80% of participants received COVID-19 information online (Internet) despite the national health minister report and which was significantly associated with poorer psychological well-being. 19 Mass media and peer-educators channels had a higher score of accessing COVID-19 information, compared to organizations/agencies/associations sources. Participants consumed most of their COVID-19 information via the Internet, online newspapers, and social networks. 20 Additionally, delivering timely and reliable information that addresses critical infection control issues is one of the key importance to mitigate COVID-19 for both the public and scientific community. 21, 22 Another study revealed that obtaining high-quality information more frequently, trusted website accessibility, and positioning may improve to access preventive measures. 23 Free and rapid access to high-quality information from verifiable sources is valuable to perfect the global medical response of COVID-19 pandemic crises. 24 Mass communication and community mobilization is the recommended action to mitigate the transmission of the virus. 25 Public access to information is included in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16) target 10. 26 Good health information exposure about COVID-19 is crucial to inform or create awareness about the disease and save many lives since the curve is progressively moving upward. In Northwest Ethiopia, most of the people are straggling to implement preventive measures that are advised by the national minister of health through mass media and home to home education by community health workers. These forms of approach help to reduce the spread of misinformation and risk of stigma. Filtering out community's level of health information exposure will be helpful to promote the right and trusted source of information. However, no studies have assessed about community's level of health information exposure and influencing factors related to COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to address the above gaps.A community-based quantitative cross-sectional study was employed from April 20 to 27, 2020. submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13The study was conducted at the selected kebeles of Gondar city. Gondar city is about 750 km far from the North West of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. According to the 2015 population projection of major cities in Ethiopia, the total population size of Gondar town was estimated to be 323,900. The city is divided into 22 kebeles (the smallest administrative unit) (Figure 1 ). This city is among the ancient and largely populated in the country. Currently, Gondar city has one Referral Hospital and Eight government Health Centers.All people above the age of 18 years in Gondar city were considered as source population and those who were in the selected kebeles marked as the study population.The sample size was determined by using single population proportion formula by considering the confidence level (Cl) of 95%, proportion (p) = 50%, and Margin of error (w)= 5%, with these assumptions the sample size was 384. Then, considered 10% non-response rate and 1.5 design effect, the final sample size was 635.A simple random sampling technique was used to select the kebeles. A total of 6980 households were recruited from the eight kebeles (lowest administrative unit or village) and their house numbers. The households were selected systematically with sampling interval of ten based on their house numbers. The first household was selected by lottery method from the first ten identified households, and went with the interval of ten. Either parent in the household was interviewed. One family member whose age 18 and above in the household was the respondent whenever the parents are not present. Participants' households were accessed using a cluster sampling technique. Data about all variables related to information exposure were collected through face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire which was adapted from different works of literature. Respondents were asked about the sources of information regarding COVID-19, how much they trust those sources, and about the types of information that they wanted to receive. Twenty-four data collectors (BSc nurses) and 6 supervisors (MSc Students) were selected and training was given on the purpose of the study, data collection tools, collection techniques, and ethical issues during selection and collection of the data. The supervisors were assessing the consistency and completeness of the data daily.The questionnaire was divided in three portions: the first portion deals with socio-demographic-related characteristics (age, sex, religion, marital status, educational level, occupation, and family size); types of information platforms and trusted source of information about COVID-19.Respondents were asked about the sources from which they obtained information about COVID-19, and how much they trust those sources. 27 This outcome variable was measured by nine (9) information exposure assessment questions/items and answered on a false/true basis. These items were information on COVID-19 (prevention mechanisms, symptoms, mode of transmission, distribution of COVID-19 cases, number of infected people at national level at the time study period, intervention/action taken by the national government, disease progression, actions to be taken if someone manifest the disease, and complications of COVID-19). A correct answered was assigned as ""1"" and incorrect/false was coded as ""0"". The total information exposure score ranged from 0 to 9. Then, those who responded above the mean score (≥4 out of 9) of the information exposure assessment items were coded as having good exposure of information about COVID-19 and coded as ""1"" or ""yes"", and those who answered <4 was considered as poor information exposure which was coded as ""0"" or ""No"".The data entry was performed using the statistical program Epi-Data version 4.6 and then exported into STATA version 14 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were carried out and presented with narration, tabulation and graphical presentation. Binary logistic regression (Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression) was performed to name statistically significant variables using a cut-off p< 0.2 in the bivariable analysis to show candidate variables for multivariable logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to declare statistically significant variables based on p<0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test was performed and a decision was made at P>0.05.To assure the quality of the data, the tool was initially prepared in English and then translated to the local language (Amharic) and back to Amharic by language experts to check its consistency. A pretest was done among 5% (32) of the total study participants at one sub-city which was not selected for the actual data collection area. Then, a minor modification was made on its clarity. Additionally, training was given for both data collectors and supervisors. Moreover, the quality of the project was assured by using statistical parameters for assessing the validity of the collected data.A total of 623 residents were taken part in this study with a response rate of 98.1%. The mean age of the study participants was 36.32 with the SD of (±13.24) years. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the participants' age has lied between 34 and 45 years. Nearly two-thirds (64.5%) of the study participants were female and 373 (59.9%) were married by their marital status. Almost onethird (32.4%) of the study participants' educational level was college and above. Regarding occupation and religion, the majority (71.9%) and 433 (69.5%) study participants were unemployed and orthodox religious followers, respectively. The mean family size of the households in this study was 4.73 with SD (±2.04). More than one-third (36%) and almost all (93.6%) study participants have listened to the radio and watched television as a source of information. Only 66 (10.6%) and 263 (42.2%) participants got information from community health workers and social media, respectively. Less than one-fourth (20.5%) also received information from religious leaders ( Table 1) .From the 623 participants, 280 (44.9%) were exposed well to COVID-19 related information (Figure 2 ). The majority, submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 418 (67.1%) study participants have watched television as a trusted source of information related to COVID-19 ( Figure 3 ).In this study, a total of nine independent variables were screened to be included to the final model during bivariate logistic regression with p-value <0.2 and after controlling all confounders five variables: educational level, browsed or follow social media, discussed COVID −19 with family members and friends were positively, and age was negatively influencing good information exposure at p-value <0.05.Study COVID-19 crisis has aroused great public concern around the world, including Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the community's level of information exposure about Ethiopia. These findings will help to have baseline data on the community's level of information and to act based on the factors affecting of it. From the total 623 study participants, 280 (44.9%) had good information exposure which was below the average. Even if, no previous studies were conducted related to this topic to discuss intensively due to the virus emerged recently. The probable reason could be due to misinformation or myths about the disease and most of the society were considered that they have enough knowledge when they know only one of the outcome variable measurement criteria. The study conducted in Sub-Sahara showed that not receiving disease-related information from mass media and health workers were found to be significantly associated with a reduction in odds of implementing preventive measures. 28 That could be the reason, why the spread of the virus is too fast in the region and here in the study area.Though misinformation was widespread during the early years of the HIV epidemic, and these days, there is also anti-science movement or misinformation that has spread everywhere regarding COVID-19 globally, including in Ethiopia. International health agencies including, WHO and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) have worked to provide trusted and verified information to aware of the community worldwide. Therefore, we must learn from past mistakes that have been happened at the time of HIV, and believe the media has a significant role to play in this issue. 29 Based on Global media analysis; rumors, stigma and conspiracy theory were mentioned as real-time threats to control the spread of COVID-19, which can have a potential serious impact at individual and community level if evidence-based guidelines are not prepared or prioritized. 30 In this study, the information which has been broadcasted via National/regional television was the primary and the most trusted source of information reported by nearly two-thirds (67.10%) of study participants. Here in Ethiopia, most of the time, the right and updated information which are prepared by in collaboration with the National Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute, and then broadcasting through national and regional mainstream medias.Regarding the influencing factors, the youngsters (18-26 years) and participants with the age range of 34-45 years were less likely to be exposed for healthrelated information about COVID-19 compared to those older aged groups (≥46 years). This finding is supported by the previous study conducted in the USA and Hong Kong showed that being older had been one determinant to have good health-seeking behaviors. 31, 32 The possible explanation is that since the majority of the study participants' primary source of information was television, and older participants might be spent most of their time by watching television. Study participants who had higher educational achievement were highly exposed to information related to COVID-19 compared to those uneducated participants. This finding agreed with the study conducted in Hong Kong, 32 showed that a higher educational level increased the interest of online health information-seeking behavior. Additionally, the study conducted in the USA and Kuwait 33, 34 showed that higher educational achievement was one-factor that increases health information seeking practice. The probable reason could be a higher level of education motivates to go online and access information or freely communicate with healthcare providers. An uneducated society could also highly influence by different incorrect cultural ideologies which may affect the implementation of preventive measures.In this study, browsing social media was also another independent factor positively associated with good information exposure about COVID-19. This was supported by the report of WHO that showed, social media platforms touch millions of followers and one of the communication channels which have an important level of messages (information) and increasing the likelihood that audiences will act on the information provided. 35 The study conducted in China also revealed that many media coverage can enhance the ideology of public for epidemic situation, and the whole people participate in and fight against the epidemic together. 36 Therefore, accessing DovePress different social medias on a daily basis and, browse this platform is one of the motivators to expose health-related information about COVID-19. Finally, interpersonal communication (discussed with family members and friends) was the factor influencing the study participants to have good exposure for information towards COVID-19. This study was supported by the study conducted in India showed that having an open interpersonal (husband, family, or friend) discussion was one of the integrals enabling factor to know and use modern family planning. 37 Another study also showed that interpersonal communications have a more effective role in obtaining information about Human Immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the Iranian community, 38 and personal network exposure associated with all steps of behavioral changes in Bolivia. 39 In fact, that, discussions with friends and family members help to clarify the misleading information and have a good understanding each other of the disease condition because they are more intimate each other.This study has the following limitations. Firstly, participants were examined what they remember at the time of interview which was not revealed the real reflection towards the disease. Secondly, the study did not show the cause-and-effect relationship due to the nature of cross-sectional study design. In addition, important variables might not be assessed, because the study was new and no further studies were conducted so far.This study provides a preliminary idea of community's level of information exposure related to COVID-19, and our finding showed that good information exposure remained low. Age, level of education, browse social media, and having interpersonal (family and friends) discussion were the independent factors significantly associated with good information exposure towards COVID-19. Therefore, efforts on information dissemination activities through regional/national mass media and other more trusted and appropriate information conveying platforms to address all the challenges that affect the process to gain information. Then, the community's good level of information exposer helps to have good knowledge of all aspects of the virus.AOR, adjusted odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; COVID-19, corona virus disease 19; COR, crude odds ratio; OR, odds ratio; SD, standard deviation; WHO, World Health Organization.The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Gondar with Ref.

In Egypt, the first confirmed case was officially announced on February 14 th , 2020 [3] . Cases gradually increased, reaching 26,384 by June 1 st , 2020 and 90,000 cases by July 23 rd , 2020 [4, 5] . [ Figure 1 ] Abbreviations: HCWs, healthcare workers Hospital-associated transmission has been recognized as an important route in spreading the infection [6, 7] . Healthcare workers (HCWs), particularly those at the frontlines, represent a high-risk category [6, 8] in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality [2] . Worldwide reports have confirmed that HCWs are disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2, as they represented 9% of the total cases in early reports from Italy [9] . Currently, very few data exist on the number of asymptomatic HCWs J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and their role in disease transmission. Since recent data suggest that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 mostly occurs before the onset of symptoms [10] , determining the rate of infection among HCWs, including asymptomatic cases, is a key to reduce the rate of nosocomial spread [11] .Kasr Al-Aini University Hospital, a tertiary care referral center, along with its affiliated hospitals represent the largest university hospital complex in Egypt. It comprises 5,600 beds, an outpatient clinic, and a large emergency department (ED) delivering health services in all specialties. Suspected cases of COVID-19 are served in a special zone apart from the ED.In this study, we report on SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) among asymptomatic frontline HCWs at the ED of Kasr Al-Aini University Hospital in the first half of June 2020, at the height of the spread of infection in Egypt.Ethical committee approval was obtained for the study. During the period from June 1 st to June 14 th , 2020; a total of 575 HCWs were scheduled to work in the ED at Kasr Al-Aini University Hospital, Cairo University.These HCWs included physicians, nurses, workers, technicians, and clerks. Twenty-five subjects were excluded from work as they had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and/or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The remaining 550 HCWs were invited to participate in the study. 203 subjects (37%) agreed to participate and each signed an informed consent. All participants completed a questionnaire which Dx Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR instruments was used for the amplification. In the process, probes were annealed to three target sequences specific to SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid (N) andSpike (S) primers/probes for bacteriophage MS2. Two of the three genes and the MS2 (positive control) must be positive or the result was considered inconclusive.Simultaneous with the NPS collection, serum immunoglobulins were detected by COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody rapid diagnostic test (Artron Laboratories, Burnaby, Canada). It is a qualitative lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for the rapid determination of presence or absence of both anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM and anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG in human specimens with a sensitivity of 93.4% and specificity of 97.7%, as reported by the manufacturer. 10 μL serum was added and was incubated for 20-30 seconds.Subsequently, 2 drops of buffer were added, and the results were detected visually after 15-20 minutes.The presence of both the control line and IgM or IgG line indicated a positive result for IgM or IgG antibody, respectively.All subjects with a positive RST result and negative RT-PCR NPS were invited for re-testing for RT-PCR a week after the initial NPS.Continuous variables were described with medians and ranges. Categorical variables were described as frequency and percentages. The Pearson Chi-Square test was used as appropriate. A 2-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.From June 1 st to June 14 th , 2020, a total of 203 frontline ED HCWs participated in the study (104 men and 99 women, with a mean age of 31.9 ± 6.6 years), representing 37% of the eligible working force (n = 550).Of the enrolled participants, 74 (36.5%) were physicians, 89 (43.8%), were nurses, 24 (11.8%) were cleaning and patients' transportation personnel, and 14 (6.9%) were administrative. None of them reported a household contact with an infected person. However, approximately 86% reported occupational contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. More than 90% of the participants confirmed adherence to the recommendations of PPE use at the workplace, as well as proper hand hygiene practice (Table 1) . With the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Egypt, several reports surfaced regarding COVID-19 related morbidities and mortalities among HCWs in hospital settings, particularly those at the frontlines. In April 2020, 2.37% of the officially reported COVID-19 cases were HCWs, with a presumed case fatality rate of 6.5% [12] .In this context, after designation of several hospitals in Egypt (including their EDs) as isolation hospitals exclusively for COVID-19 patients, EDs in other tertiary referral centers as that of Cairo University Hospitals were subjected to exceptionally larger numbers of re-directed patients seeking emergency services and their companions, exposing HCWs to a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.In the present study, we found a 14.3% overall point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the HCWs in ED using RT-PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the prevalence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic frontline HCWs in an ED setting in Egypt.It has been established that HCWs are at greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with some studies reporting a 12-fold increased risk compared to the general population [13] . A report from Papoutsi et al., stated that the median HCWs infection percentage among total cases retrieved from data of 41 countries was 10.04% (range 0%-24%) [12] . However, the prevalence rate among HCWs varied among studies from different countries. High prevalence rates in HCWs were reported in studies from the Netherlands and the UK using molecular testing (9% and 18%, respectively) [14, 15] . On the other hand, studies from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS, England and D. Cotugno Hospital in Naples, Italy showed point prevalence of 2.39% and 1.7%, respectively using molecular testing [16, 11] . In addition to different screening methods, the interpretation of the variability in prevalence rates among HCWs in these studies should also take into consideration the time of screening in relation to the pandemic and the group of HCWs being screened.The high prevalence rate encountered in our study conducted in June 2020 among asymptomatic HCWs denotes the importance of periodic screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of the presence of symptoms as they are at continuous risk of exposure during the pandemic. Although most public health strategies rely on early detection of the disease to limit its spread, it is clear that asymptomatic transmission plays an important role in the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection worldwide [17] . The rapid and easy transmission from person to person can be explained by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 can already be heavily shedding in the upper respiratory tract even in presymptomatic cases [18] .Although NPS is currently used to obtain samples for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of RT-PCR in clinical practice varies depending on the site and quality of sampling, reaching 63% in one study, which may underestimate the extent of infection [19, 20] . To increase the detection rate of more cases infected with COVID-19, we added RST to complement molecular testing. In 26 HCWs (12.8%), antibodies could be detected by RST while initial NPS results were negative. This raised the cumulative prevalence among HCWs with at least one positive test (RT-PCR and/or RST) to 27.1% of screened HCWs, which could represent either currently asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases or previous infection. In a similar study in a referral hospital in Belgium, 41/326 HCWs were confirmed positive by RT-PCR and/or serology,representing an overall infection rate of 12.6% [21] . Results of RST should be interpreted cautiously and need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability [22] .A potential limitation of the use of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, is the possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses. However, in another study evaluating SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, the RST used in our study had a 100% specificity with no cross-reactivity with control serum samples from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses [23] . In our study, for HCWs with a positive RST and negative RT-PCR, a repeat NPS was done after one week to increase the diagnostic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-27","11"

Africa has recorded 1.8 million cases and 42,000 deaths with South Africa reporting the most cases on the continent [1] .Kenya reported its first case on 13th March 2020 and has recorded more than 45,000 cases and 1,000 COVID-19 deaths within 8 months with established community transmission in all the 47 counties as documented by the Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Centre.The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID 19 patients are not fully known. Initial data from China reported a median age of 47 in patients with COVID-19, majority of patients were male with only 5% requiring ICU care and a 1.4% mortality [2] . On the other hand, limited data from Africa have reported higher mortality for <20 years compared to 20-39 year olds [3] , which differs significantly from what is reported elsewhere and underscores the need to understand the disease dynamics in multiple settings.The COVID-19 disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe to critical disease [4] . About 5% of patients have critical disease which is defined as respiratory failure, shock or multiorgan dysfunction, usually exacerbated by immune hyperactivation such as the cytokine storm [5] . The most common laboratory findings include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransferases, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated C reactive protein (CRP) and elevated D-dimer levels [6] . Common chest radiological findings include ground glass opacities in 83%, mixed ground glass opacities and consolidation in 58%, pleural thickening in 50% and interlobular septal thickening in 48% [7] .Whereas detailed reports of clinical features and outcome of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are increasing from various parts of the world, data from Africa is scarce. In this paper we report the epidemiologic and clinical features of patients admitted with COVID-19 to Kenyan Hospitals and describe the risk factors for mortality.This multi-center cohort study recruited patients admitted into six hospitals with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 between 14 th March 2020 and 17 th September 2020. The six hospitals (3 public hospitals and 3 private hospitals) had provided dedicated facilities with isolation beds for COVID-19 patients. Two of the public hospitals (Kenyatta National Referral Hospital and Mbagathi Hospital) are located in Nairobi while one public hospital (Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital) is in Mombasa County at the Coast. The three private hospitals (Nairobi Hospital, Aga Khan University Hospital, Avenue Hospital) are located in Nairobi.We developed a detailed questionnaire that was used to systematically extract information from the medical records of COVID-19 patients admitted into these study hospitals. Briefly, the questionnaires captured patient information at admission into the hospital, during the hospitalization until discharge or death. Medical records of the SARS-CoV2 positive patients admitted in the study hospitals were reviewed by a team of trained physicians. They extracted data including patient demographic data, medical history, underlying co-morbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, management and treatment measures and outcome data. Presenting symptoms at admission and during the hospital stay were obtained.All patients had daily pulse oximetry and blood samples drawn for blood count, liver and renal function tests within 24 hours of admission. Patients who had moderate to severe illness got a chest radiograph, CRP and D-dimers in facilities where these investigations were available. Other investigations were ordered as informed by the clinical scenario. Patient with low oxygen saturation were given supplemental oxygen via nasal prongs or masks as appropriate. Patients requiring further respiratory support were admitted to the ICU for either non-invasive or invasive ventilation.For survival analysis, the primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 related death, defined as death among patients admitted into the hospital with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications associated with COVID-19. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to calculate Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with the demographic, underlying co-morbidities, symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics were calculated, and the confidence intervals set at 95%. All the statistical analysis was carried out using the R statistical software [12] .A total of 787 patients from six health facilities were recruited into the study. The median age was 43 years, with 42% of the patients being below 40 years. Majority of the patients (64%) were male.Nearly two thirds (67%) of the patients had visited the health facility while the rest had been admitted following the initial government regulations of isolating all laboratory confirmed positive cases in health facilities. Of the admitted patients, 43% had underlying conditions, with the most common being cardiovascular diseases (17%), diabetes (15%), HIV (7%), cancer (4%), chronic renal disease (3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3%) ( Table 1) .Severely ill patients got chest imaging (n=101). The most common findings included presence of ground glass opacities in 73(72%), local patchy shadowing in 59(58%), diffuse patchy shadowing in 61(60%) and interstitial abnormalities in 29(29%).The incidence of ICU admission was 90(11%) with 59(7%) patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This incidence of severe illness requiring ICU admission is lower than that observed in other cohorts largely from developing countries. Cummings et al report on a New York cohort in which the incidence of ICU admission was 22%. [13] There are several factors that may account for this lower disease severity. The initial Kenya national containment strategy included admission of all persons testing COVID-19 positive even in the absence of symptoms, this was at a time when over 80% of the patients were asymptomatic [14] . Our patient population was also younger than that reported elsewhere, with a median age of the general population of 20 years compared to 45 in Italy and 44.9 in Spain, 38.2 in USA and 33in Brazil, all countries that have seen significantly higher morbidity and mortality. In the New York cohort, they reported a mean age of 62 years and a high prevalence of hypertension (63%) in patients admitted to the critical care units [13] . The prevalence of underlying chronic conditions was lower in our cohort than that reported elsewhere. De Souza and others in an analysis of the epidemic in Brazil, report prevalence of 66.5% of cardiovascular disease and 54.5% diabetes in patients with COVID-19 [15] . Older age and presence of underlying co-morbidities have both been associated with increased risk of severe outcomes in COVID-19 [16, 17] . 58% of our patients were symptomatic at the time of admission with the most common symptoms being cough (58%), loss of taste and smell (35%), and fever (16%). Earlier reports on the epidemic reported fever as the most common symptom followed by cough. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Hu found the prevalence of fever to be 85.6%, cough at 65.7%, other common symptoms were fatigue and dyspnoea [18] . Loss of smell and taste was fairly prevalent in our population as has been reported elsewhere [19] .On cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we found significantly increased risk of death with older age (>60), male gender and in patients with co-morbidities. Men with COVID-19 have been shown to be at higher risk for worse outcomes and mortality irrespective of age [21] . Possible explanations for this include the higher prevalence of high-risk behaviour including smoking and attendant lung injury, higher prevalence of underlying co-morbidities and other yet to be fully defined biologic differences.We found that the presence of a comorbidity was associated with increased mortality, HR 2.34 (CI 1.69-3.25). Co-morbidities have been associated with higher risk of severe outcomes in many populations. Data from China showed that the hazard ratio of severe outcomes including admission to ICU, invasive ventilation and death was 1.79 for patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 for patients with two or more co-morbidities [17] .As countries think of strategies to reduce disease transmission and reduce risk of severe disease and mortality, it is important that these risk factors of older age and presence of co-morbidity are taken in to account and strategies that identify and shield those at highest risk as defined here are adopted.We found various laboratory parameters to be associated with increased risk of death, these included leucocytosis, lymphopaenia, transaminitis and elevated CRP. Lymphopaenia has been shown to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19 and to predict severe disease [22] . Lymphopaenia may result either from suppression of the bone marrow, direct infection and destruction or a cytotoxic mediated killing of lymphocytes. A functional exhaustion of antiviral lymphocytes has also been reported [23] .We found elevated alanine and aspartate aminotransferase in 48% and 51% of patients respectively. Elevations in liver enzymes is common and has been reported to range from 16-53% in various studies [24, 25] . Boregowda et al in a meta-analysis of studies comparing liver chemistries in mild and severe disease, showed that elevated liver enzymes were associated with severe disease, and predicted mortality [25] . This finding is further strengthened by our our study where the presence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase was associated with a hazard ratio of death of 2.5 (CI 1.69-3.7)This main strengths of this study is that it was multi-center and included asymptomatic and mild cases, which provides a more comprehensive analysis of the presentation of COVID-19 and reduces bias. Limitations of this study include the absence of laboratory parameters for some of the study patients, pulse oximetry was not routinely recorded during the initial period of the outbreak and we did not have access to other laboratory markers that have been shown to predict mortality including D-dimers and interleukin 6.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 in Kenya were fairly young with a low rate of severe disease. Age >60, male gender, presence of co-morbidities, leucocytosis, lymphopaenia and elevated transaminases predicted mortality.","Kenya","abstract","2020-11-12","11"

Following this declaration, on 30 January the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International concern on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has become an ongoing public health epidemic that poses a major threat to people, especially those living with chronic diseases such as people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Approximately two-fifths (13.4 million) of the 37.9 million people living with HIV worldwide are unable to receive HIV medication to keep them healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 The pandemic disrupts the treatment and prevention continuum of HIV. When it spreads, poorer nations and those with higher rates of HIV, disconnected from the access to HIV care and treatment. 3 COVID-19, like HIV/AIDS, has a disproportionate effect on those already marginalized. So far, elderly people and people with existing health problems like diabetes, hypertension has been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. 4 Study findings and experience to date indicate that those with compromised immune systems may be affected more seriously and may need more intensive care. 5, 6 Governments around the world have responded at various rates by implementing public health measures to address the rapid transmission of COVID-19 into populations. These include international and domestic travel restrictions accompanied by strengthened border controls; major scale-up of testing and tracing; promotion of daily hand washing or sanitation of physical and/or social distances; and, in some situations, declaration of emergency states followed by curfews and full lock-downs. 7 Some of the strategies to counter COVID-19 will affect the continuity of HIV treatment and care at the HIV clinic. COVID-19 lockdown has also had an effect on other health systems in various African countries. For example, in South Africa, 13% of, individuals living with chronic illness have lost access to regular drugs they need. Similarly, in Zimbabwe, about 19% of people with HIV were unable to receive refills for antiretroviral therapy (ART). 3 The stringent public health measures (such as travel restrictions, complete lockdown, physical and social distancing) taken to limit the COVID-19 epidemic will also have a positive impact on preventing the new infection of HIV. This can be more taken into account for high-risk individuals and occupations, such as sex workers (commercial and non-commercial) and those individuals working on long-distance transport services. Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, sex workers especially in developing countries have been one of the groups most vulnerable to HIV infection due to their large numbers and rapid change of sexual partners and have been considered a core group for HIV transmission. 8 Overall HIV prevalence among female sex workers reaches 12%. In the general population of women aged 15-49 years, the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers was 13 times the overall HIV prevalence. Besides, in bringing HIV infection to the general population, men who have both commercial and non-commercial sex partners (regular partners) play a major role. Early the COVID-19 outbreak across the globe government closed all non-essential goods and service providers including any kind of bars, hotels, brothels, sex dens, and night clubs. These will pose financial difficulties and loss of jobs, especially for commercial sex workers. However, those interventions which will limit exposure and promote physical distancing will have a positive impact on preventing new HIV transmission.Transport is known to be a ""high-risk"" occupation. The transport sector is commonly regarded as a major vector in the spread and transmission of HIV/AIDS. 8, 9 This is more common for truck drivers and their assistants, individuals who earn living transporting goods throughout the country and across national boundaries along major transport corridors. 10, 11 The prevalence of HIV among those individuals reaches up to 40%. 12 Long-distance truck drivers have gained a reputation as a ""risk group"" because of their sexual networks along road transport corridors, frequently linked to long periods away from home. 13 This is mainly due to two possible reasons. First, the movement of people through transport routes and improvements in transport efficiency allow HIV to spread between areas of high and low prevalence. Second, The sexual conduct of employees in the transport sector and the populations that interact with them, such as sex workers, may pose a high risk of contracting or transmitting HIV. 14 Multiple reports showed that around 30% of the clientele of sex workers is made up of long-distance truck drivers. Similarly, people living in the vicinity truck stops along major road corridors tend to have a greater incidence of HIV than the general population. 12, 15 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic containment strategies such as physical/ social distancing, movement restriction, and/or complete lockdown, the probability of new HIV infection from such kinds of risky behavior will decrease. However, this is an important research area that needs specific detailed information and analysis.Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is considered as a ""curate's egg"" on human immunodeficiency virus infection. Even though the negative impact of the pandemic is considered to be huge, its containment response will minimize the transmission of HIV from sexual contact and is expected to reduce the incidence of HIV infection.HIV itself increases the risk of contracting the COVID-19. People living with HIV will not easily get access to their to follow up on the schedule due to fear of contracting the disease and travel restrictions. The pandemic containment strategies and response will affect commercial sex workers who exchange sex for money in terms of income of daily living. However, international and domestic travel restrictions will reduce the opportunities for sexual contact exposure. In place, where movement is permissible, still due to physical distancing the risk to engagement into sexual activities expected to be minimal.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-11-13","11"

Most tests to check for COVID-19 relied on tests done at a laboratory for pathogen testing, which is the most accurate test possible. Still, it is time-consuming with significant false-negative results [1] .Patients suspected of having respiratory infection or pneumonia are admitted to the hospital under consideration of specific diagnostic procedures with laboratory and other non-laboratory tests to identify the cause, location, and severity of the infection. The laboratory tests include standard procedures, like blood gas analysis tests, complete blood count (CBC), and pleural effusion [2] , 15 in a procedure that needs transporting samples from the hospital to the lab, which takes up valuable time. On the flip side, the non-laboratory tests are the computer-assisted imagery analysis techniques used to inspect/registrate the lung regions using digital chest radiography (or standard 2D x-ray) or CT scan.On the contrary to the conventional 2D x-ray; which uses a fixed x-ray tube 20 that does not provide much detail. 3D CT scan is a nondestructive scanning technology that has the advantage of providing a very detailed view of the lung of bone, soft tissue, and blood vessels [2] . Advantages of CT imaging include low cost, wide availability, high spatial resolution with current multi-slice scanners, short scan time and higher sensitivity. Disadvantages include: Inferior soft 25 tissue contrast compared to MRI and X-ray-based radiation exposure [3] .Various methodologies in computer vision have been proposed to deal with different sides to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including segmentation and classification methods [4] . These approaches can be classified into two fundamental classes: Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods [5] . 30 In general, Image segmentation has become an increasingly important task in radiology research and clinical practice. The goal of segmentation is to separate regions or objects of interest from other parts of the body to make quantitative measurements. More specifically, obtaining further diagnostic insights, including measuring the area and volume of segmented structures. The main chal-35 lenges of segmentation algorithms exaggerates due to intensity in-homogeneity, presence of artifacts and closeness in the gray level of different soft tissue.Various aspects of segmentation algorithms have been explored for many years. Existing segmentation approaches can be classified into three main classes: manual, semi-automatic, and fully-automatic. Manual segmentation 40 methods are time-consuming, monotonous, and can be affected by inter and intra-observer variability. Semi-automatic approaches are already widespread and integrated with publicly available software packages. Finally, fully-automatic procedures do not need user intervention. Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations. However, even now, the investigators try to make segmen- 45 tation steps as easy as possible with the help of automatic software tools. Still, the problem of segmentation remains challenging [6] , because (1) in clinical practice, there are only a few works related to infection segmentation in CT scans [9] . b) most of COVID-19 imaging data-sets focus on diagnosis, only one data-set providing segmentation labels, and c) the qualitative evalu-55 ation of infection and longitudinal changes in CT scans could thus offer useful and vital information in fighting against COVID-19 1 . However, these methods are not applicable when we have a tiny data-set. In this paper, we focus on a segmentation system to automatically quantify infection regions of interest (ROIs) and measure the volume of the infection area. Table 1 along with results obtained of each approach.In this article, we took advantages of a classical machine learning-based 65 COVID-19 segmentation methods, since a) it provides a high accuracy while deep networks require large data-sets, b) computationally cheap, c) easy to design, interpret, and use, which is helpful for clinicians and consumers communities in developing countries. presented system will be very beneficial in developed countries to help Africa through the COVID-19 pandemic [11] . Therefore, the expected outcome of the proposed work is to take into account the coronal-view of the CT scan for a better experimental interpretation.Although there are several approaches for medical image segmentation, few stud-ies have been done and tested on an image with COVID-19 lesion to observe its ability to segment the lesion precisely [8] . Subsequently, those algorithms may not be the best choice for searching for smaller homogeneous regions in medical images that may contain the features of a disease such as COVID-19.This challenge motivates us to observe the performance of some state-of-the-art 90 algorithms proposed in the literature for tackling the COVID-19 lesions area.Besides, it leads us to offer a robust scheme that has an excellent ability to segment the COVID-19 lesion in an accurate way.The proposed framework is developed and investigated within the Matlab R environment, and the essential CT Scan images of COVID-19 is collected from 95 the COVID-CT-Dataset [17] . Also, a data-set from the EL-BAYANE center forRadiology and Medical Imaging which include a data CT images on a person who got two times CT images.The main contributions of this paper are as follows:• A new image contrast enhancement algorithm by combing linear and log-100 arithmic stitching parametric algorithms.• An improved image-dependent multilevel image thresholding method.• Method to compute the number of image-dependent multilevel k.• An image segmentation approach to minimize the over-segmented regions.The remaining part contained in the present paper is organized as follows.After briefly reviewing the related works on the segmentation of COVID-19 in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the proposed pipeline and measurement comparison both on objective and subjective perspectives (in Section 3) and in terms of the coloring of a segmentation algorithm (in Section 3 also). We conclude by highlighting the outcome achieved (in Section 4).In the remainder of this section, we report the enhancement method, along with the proposed segmentation and visualization functions. Its impact is quite more significant in biomedical and medical research [18] . The impactcontributions of this section are:• Method to compute the number of image-dependent thresholds k, which based on a local minimum level of a project 2D histogram.• Method to correct threshold by using the k-largest entries of Kapurs Entropy.• The method to compute the optimal threshold by taking a weighted com-120 bination of corrected thresholds.• The method to compute Kapurs Entropy using a projected 2D histogram.• A new image contrast enhancement algorithm by combing linear and logarithmic stitching parametric algorithms. The linear function works well for common-exposed imaging components, while the logarithmic function 125 works well for under-exposed imaging components.The outline of the proposed COVID-19 enhancement, segmentation, and visualization method is described in Figure 1 . First, the lung region is extracted from the input CT images. Then, the left and right lungs are separated [19] .After that, image enhancement is applied on the right and the left lung sepa-130 rately (detailed in 2.1.1). At this stage, we proposed a modified Local ContrastEnhancement for a small more detailed CT target detection. The fundamentals of our modification are taken the concept from a local contrast method that can be found in [20] .In this sub-section, we focus on images that are degradedly acquired, to improve the quality of CT images for a more accurate perception of information in images for both human viewers and for other automated COVID-19 lungs infected region segmentation and measurement systems. In Figure 2 we illustrated the steps used for enhancements by separating the considered image into a small tile. In addition to that, we generated a directional block. In each directional filter, we included a local mean filter. g 3,2 g 3,1 g 2,1 g 2,3 g 1,3 g 1,2 g 1,1 General mathematics concepts with dilation are when a structuring element has a height [22] . Thus, the dilation of A(x, y) by B(x, y) is defined as:Where (A) original image, (B) dilated features and (D) structural element of (b). The proposed masking pneumonia regions comparison by using different 170 structural filters are presented in Figure 3 . 10:Generate a masking metric Kapur's entropy computation (see Figure 6 ).

As shown in advantage of these methods lies in their ability to outperform the shallow techniques, but this comes with disadvantages such as their requirement to process a large amount of sensed data. Since, they are computationally expensive, and the duration of the development process is higher [42] . Due to the lack of annotated medical images in lung segmentation, both semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches are highly demanded to analyze the COVID-19 lesion [8] . The advantage of the proposed method is also confirmed by Table 3 , As can be seen, compared with U-Net [28] , Attention-UNet [29] , Gated-UNet [30] , Dense-UNet [31] , U-Net++ [32], Inf-Net [33] , Seg-Net 285 [34] , BiSe-Net [35], and ESP-Net [36] supervised methods. The proposed yields a better segmentation results with more sensitivity, precision and dice. In contrast, U-Net++ provides good results and compete, especially in sensitivity metric. substructure segmentation meets specific radiological criteria to be recognized through algorithms rather than offering a biological interpretation of the annotated image patterns. Moreover, we will use a small data-set from the EL-BAYANE center for Radiology and Medical Imaging which include data CT images on ten patients one of which got CT images twice. that has a significant impact on our case. For example, the interpretation of 'Jet 320 maps' has been split into three (Red, Blue, Green) color parts to distinguish image lesion features. Figure 9 , illustrates six different cases of lesion regions of COVID-19-CT data. From the first row, we can see that blue and green present low to moderate risk regions. Where yellow and red in the last row show three high risk regions. CT images of a total of 22 participants were retrospectively collected. In this data set, 10 among which were confirmed with COVID-19 by radiologists. The effect of COVID-19 can also be seen in Table 4 , (#9 T =1 -#9 T =2 ). patient Table   ( 4) statistically and visually in Figure 10 .Thus far, the CT-scan imaging is a widespread, affordable, detailed screening tool that effectively helps to visualize and to accelerate the evaluation of ","Algeria","first author","2020-11-02","11"

On January 30, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was declared a public health emergency of international concern, having spread to multiple countries outside of China [2] . By March 11, 2020 , it was declared a global pandemic, with approximately 118,000 confirmed cases and nearly 4300 deaths on all continents except Antarctica [3] . However, Uganda had not yet reported any cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.On March 13, 2020 , having noted the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in most other countries in the world, Uganda instituted multiple measures to prevent entry and spread. These included symptom screening at the airport, isolation and testing for symptomatic persons, and a mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine and testing of travelers from high-risk countries [4] . Persons entering from low-risk countries [4] were asked to selfquarantine but were not tested unless they had symptoms on arrival. Travelers in quarantine were tested if they developed symptoms or on Day 14 of quarantine, regardless of symptoms. Effective March 23, 2020, the country implemented a ban on all international travel, and closed both schools and universities. One day later, the Ministry of Health requested all travelers entering Uganda the United Arab Emirates in the past two weeks to self-present for testing. Subsequently, all persons who had traveled from any international destination into Uganda since March 7 were asked to self-present for testing. On March 30, 2020, the country instituted a complete lockdown, banning all public transport and public gatherings.On March 21, 2020, Uganda confirmed its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Ugandan traveler from the United Arab Emirates. By April 15, 2020, 54 cases had been reported in country [5] . The country implemented thorough contact tracing for all infected persons. We describe the interventions in place and the characteristics of and transmission from the first 54 case-persons to provide guidance for near-future interventions against SARS-CoV-2 spread in Uganda.We defined a confirmed case as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection identified during March 21-April 12, 2020 in a resident of or traveler to Uganda. A suspected case was defined as onset of acute respiratory illness with high temperature (above 37.5°C) and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the last 14 days prior to symptom onset, in a resident or traveler to Uganda from March 21-April 12, 2020. Laboratory testing of oropharyngeal and/ or nasopharyngeal swabs was done at Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) using real-time RT-PCR (Berlin protocol) [6] . All confirmed case-persons were isolated in hospitals. We reviewed case files and interviewed all casepersons at isolation centers located within four hospitals treating case-persons: Mulago National Referral Hospital, Entebbe Grade B Hospital, Adjumani General Hospital, and Hoima Regional Referral Hospital (Fig. 1) . All casepersons were tested for HIV on entry and were asked about other underlying diseases. We also conducted a telephone interview with one case-person who was isolated and being managed at home.We assessed for presence of symptoms during the 14 days preceding sample collection/testing. All case-persons were subsequently monitored for development of new symptoms while admitted in hospital using a self-monitoring tool for symptoms. We categorized case-persons as symptomatic if they had had any new or worsened typical or atypical COVID-19 symptom in the previous 14 days. We classified case-persons as having typical symptoms if they had temperature greater than 37.5°C (99.5°F) or selfreported fever, shortness of breath, or cough [7] . We categorized case-persons as having atypical symptoms if they had at least one of the following: chills, confusion/irritability, body weakness, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, joint pains, muscle pains, chest pain, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea without any of the typical symptoms [7] . We classified casepersons as asymptomatic if they had no new symptoms or no worsening chronic symptoms (e.g., stable chronic cough). Presymptomatic case-persons were those who were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection but developed symptoms within the 14 days of isolation/admission. Case-persons who did not develop any new symptoms in the 14 days after isolation were still classified as asymptomatic.Contacts were defined as persons with face-to-face contact (< 2 m) with a case-person or persons who spent time in a closed environment with a case-person, including coworkers or household members; healthcare workers or other persons providing direct care for case-persons without recommended personal protective equipment; persons sitting within 5 seats in any direction from the case-person in a vehicle or plane; or crew working in the section of the plane or vehicle where a case-person was seated. For symptomatic case-persons, all persons exposed to the case-person from two days before to 14 days after the case-person's symptom onset were listed as contacts as per Ministry of Health guidelines. For asymptomatic case-persons, all contacts exposed to the case-person in the 14 days before the case-person's laboratory confirmation were listed as contacts. This was done to account for our inability to identify the infectious period for asymptomatic case-persons. Contacts were initially tested just before release from quarantine, or any time they developed symptoms; however, guidance changed during the period to include a test midway through quarantine as well. We reviewed contact tracing records to identify the number of contacts per case.Data were entered and analyzed in Epi Info 7.2. Software (CDC, Atlanta, USA). We described method of case-person identification as well as epidemiologic, demographic, and clinical characteristics of casepersons. Continuous variables were presented as means (SD) if they were normally distributed or medians (IQR) if they were not, and categorical variables as frequencies (%). The clinical outcomes of the casepersons were described through April 12, 2020. For asymptomatic cases, we considered date of sample collection as a proxy for date of illness onset. A total of 5025 tests for SARS-CoV-2 had been carried out in Uganda as of April 12, 2020. Of these, samples from 54 (1.1%) persons were positive for SARS-CoV-2. From these 54 case-persons, 1257 contacts were identified. A total of 1105 high-risk travelers had been placed in institutional quarantine as of April 12, 2020, of whom 861 (78%) had been discharged by that date.The mean age of the case-persons was 35 (±16) years, with a range of 7-66 years ( Table 1) ; 34 (63%) were male. Most (91%) were Ugandan and 45 (83%) had history of international travel, mainly to United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom (Table 1 ). Of 37 case-persons who shared their occupation, 19 (51%) were in business (mainly dealing with imports/exports).Among the 34 case-persons who eventually developed symptoms, 47% reported fever, 38% reported headache, and 29% reported cough ( Table 2) . Among all 34 symptomatic case-persons, only one (3%) had all three typical symptoms of COVID-19 ( Table 2) . None of the casepersons developed severe disease requiring supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or life support, and none died.Approximately three-quarters of the case-persons had no known underlying illnesses. Among 15 (28%) case-persons with underlying disease, six had hypertension alone, four had diabetes alone, two had HIV alone, and one had a preexisting malignancy. In addition, one patient had both HIV and diabetes, and one had hypertension and diabetes. One case-person was pregnant in her third trimester at the time she was diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 2) .Of the 54 case-persons, 45 (83%) were persons who had traveled in the past 14 days. Among these, one was symptomatic and identified during airport screening when he entered the country (from Dubai), and had been sent directly from the airport to a testing site (Fig. 2 ).An additional 25 were sent to institutional quarantine after returning from countries that had been categorized by Uganda as high-risk. Of these, 10 (40%) case-persons became symptomatic while in quarantine and were tested as a result, while 15 (60%) were identified during routine testing of asymptomatic persons in institutional quarantine. All remaining 19 travelers had come in from countries categorized as low-risk [4] and self-presented following a request from the Uganda Ministry of Health that recent travelers present for testing. Ten (50%) of the travelers who tested positive after this request came from the United Arab Emirates.Among the nine case-persons who did not travel, five were identified through contact tracing in the community; two (40%) were symptomatic at the time of identification. The remaining four were identified at the health facility as part of routine screening of those who met definition for suspected COVID-19 case. Most of the case-persons were residents of the Kampala capital city (43%) and its periurban neighboring district, Wakiso (24%). (Fig. 3) .Contact tracing was carried out for all case-persons. Of the 1257 contacts identified as of April 12, 2020, 1244 (99%) were followed up. Of these, 603 (49%) had completed the mandatory 14-day follow-up period and had been discharged from daily follow up. An average of 31 contacts (range, 4-130) were identified for each caseperson. Contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 a mean of 1.3 times (range, 1-3 times); five contacts tested positive. We describe the epidemiological characteristics of the initial 54 persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda. Most (83%) cases were imported, had atypical symptoms or few symptoms, with nearly half of patients being asymptomatic. Many of the early cases in Uganda, including the index case, were in persons who had traveled to countries not previously known to be high-risk [4] , and were therefore not required to be in institutional quarantine. Despite extensive contact tracing and testing of contacts, few transmissions were identified.Other countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented Became symptomatic after sample collection 5 9 Never became symptomatic at all 20 37Had underlying medical condition 15 28 Comorbidities c (n = 15) on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries. This strategy had positive public health implications for Uganda and allowed detection of cases that would otherwise have been missed and could potentially have escalated community transmission. Recent data has shown that much SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from pre-symptomatic patients [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , suggesting that the earlier an infected person can be detectedeven an asymptomatic casethe more effectively transmission can be prevented [19] . Our transmission data appear to reflect this, with only five transmission chains identified from the 54 confirmed cases. The use of a primarily risk-based rather than primarily symptom-based testing strategy also likely accounts for why, as of early May, Uganda still had fewer cumulative cases than its neighboring countries [20] . Similarly, none of the case-persons developed severe disease or died. This contrasts with the outcomes of initial cases from most other countries [8, [21] [22] [23] [24] . This is also likely due to differential case ascertainment approach used in Uganda, compared with other countries. The majority of case-persons in this evaluation were unlikely to have been identified without active, targeted, risk-based testing. This is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25] [26] [27] . The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29] . The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31] . Although approximately two-thirds of the casepersons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.The main source of the outbreak in Uganda was returnees entering the country through Entebbe airport. At the time the first case-person was identified in Uganda, having traveled from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates was not recognized as a 'high-risk' country. Subsequently, many other travelers from Dubai to Uganda, as well as to other countries, were recognized as being infected [32] . Understanding the risk posed by travelers from specific countries, especially in the face of high proportions of persons with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and heterogeneous test availability and testing strategies, is a challenge. Countries that want to maintain a high degree of risk managementparticularly those that manage to control transmission after an initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak -may want to consider mandatory testing for all travelers at points of entry.With the closure of the airport for commercial travel on March 21, 2020, the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda has shifted to other points of entries, at land borders. Porous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33] . Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.Despite Uganda's efforts to prevent and control this pandemic, the high prevalence of asymptomatic infections will present a major challenge to continuing to keep the disease at bay. Traditional public health disease control and prevention strategies rely heavily on early disease detection, usually through identification of symptomatic persons, to contain spread. The fact that only one patient in this series had all the 'typical' features [7] of COVID-19 disease suggests that the Ministry of Health will need to rely on a high index of suspicion for the disease among the high-risk populations, regardless of their symptomatology. Consideration should be placed on routine testing of highrisk groups, even when asymptomatic, as well as mass community testing in priority settings if community transmission is suspected. Including asymptomatic individuals, especially for enclosed populations (schools, prisons, refugee settlements), into the screening algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 infection will require scaling-up and subsequent decentralization of testing in the country. Furthermore, these data support expanded symptom screening to improve early detection of cases in Uganda, given that a significant proportion of the symptomatic case-persons had atypical presentations. Delayed diagnosis, often as a result of few or no symptoms, are contributing factors to sustained community transmission of influenza-like illnesses [34, 35] . While few transmissions occurred in our small case series, none were identified from asymptomatic persons. Continued intensive contact tracing, as shown in other places [36, 37] , will be needed to continue to control the epidemic in Uganda.Our findings are subject to some limitations. We analyzed data from only 54 case-persons in a setting of low community transmission. This may not give comprehensive understanding of the disease or the trajectory of the epidemic in Uganda. In addition, little community testing was occurring at the time outside of contact tracing testing, meaning that we may have underascertained cases.The first 54 case-persons in Uganda with SARS-CoV-2 infection were primarily imported and had asymptomatic or mild disease. Transmission was low, even from symptomatic persons; asymptomatic persons did not transmit infection. Targeted testing interventions and other interventions implemented in Uganda enabled detection of these infected persons and likely enabled early disease control in Uganda in the setting of the initial phase of COVID-19 pandemic.The Ministry of Health should consider intensifying routine and systematic screening of travelers and at-risk persons and emphasize thorough contact tracing. Increasing targeted testing among persons with a wider range of symptoms than is typically considered for COVID-19 should also be undertaken. Uganda must strengthen control measures at the points of entry to include routine and mandatory screening for SARS-CoV-2 for all travelers regardless of their symptomatology or origin, to minimize the risk of importation of the disease with subsequent community transmission. We thank the patients who participated in this investigation. We are also very grateful to the support from the medical teams working with the confirmed cases in the isolation facilities in Uganda. We equally thank the administration of Mulago National Referral Hospital, Entebbe Grade B Hospital, Adjumani Hospital and Hoima Regional Referral Hospital for their support in conducting this investigation.The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data sets and the reports that support this write up belong to the MoH Uganda. For reasons of confidentiality, the datasets and reports are not publicly available. However, datasets and the reports could be availed upon reasonable request and with permission from the MoH Uganda.This was a public health emergency and the Ministry of Health (MoH) gave the directive to conduct epidemiological investigations for on persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the country. The investigation directive from MoH applied to all confirmed cases; however, we sought verbal consent from respondents in their respective languages during data collection. Participants were told that their participation was voluntary and that there would be no negative consequences if they refused to participate (none declined). During data collection, respondents were assigned unique identifiers instead of names to protect their confidentiality. Information was stored in passwordprotected computers and was not shared with anyone outside the investigation team. As this was a public health emergency, disclosure of patient information for the purposes of contact tracing was limited to the minimum needed to conduct contact tracing activities. The Office of the Associate Director for Science, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that this activity was in response to a public health emergency with the primary intent of public health practice (epidemic disease control activity). It was determined therefore to not be human subjects research.Not applicable.","Uganda","abstract","2020-11-25","11"

Subsequently, hospitals workload slashed by more than 50% during this unprecedented emergency scenario, as well as urology workload slashed by 72%. Moreover, the monthly estimated financial losses of USA hospitals reached up to 60 Billion $ [2] .In Europe, Italy was severely affected with COVID-19 pandemic, especially in March and April 2020. In Bergamo City, the marked surge of virus infection and increase in the number of critically ill patients led to a reduction in beds' capacity by two-thirds, and at certain time, urological procedures including some emergency surgery were stopped completely due to lack of resources and medical staff [3] .Urolithiasis is a unique disease that can lead to emergencies and can adversely affect kidney function during long-term follow-up, especially if infections coexist. Therefore, timely and appropriate management is essential. Recently, Flammia et al. studied the change of urinary stone emergencies in the time of COVID-19. Their findings suggested that urinary stone emergencies are mainly severe, as patients presented during COVID-19 pandemic had higher levels of serum creatinine compared to a non-COVID-19 time, and continuous care should be maintained for those patients [4] .We aimed in the current review to give a critical insight into the recently published recommendations, clinical pathways, and triage systems of the different treatment options for urinary stones in the time of COVID-19, to help urologists in their treatment decision during this unprecedented situation.In this non-systematic review, we searched articles in PubMed from January 1, 2020, through June 1, 2020. We used the search terms ""COVID-19, "" ""Coronavirus, "" ""SAR-SCoV-2, "" ""Pandemic, "" ""Urinary stones, "" ""Urolithiasis, "" ""Treatment, "" ""Triage, "" ""Guidelines, "" and ""recommendations. "" We included original articles, review articles, research letters, letter to editors, commentaries, and editorials. Non-English language articles were not included, as well as COVID-19 researches that were out of scope to our research.Finally, fourteen publications were the basis of our review article. Most of evidence in the present review is based on experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions.Urolithiasis practice pattern has markedly changed during COVID-19. According to the EULIS Collaborative Research Group, a large survey that included 60 physicians whose main area of expertise is urinary stones was conducted to evaluate urolithiasis practice patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey showed that 49% of experts experienced > 90% change in their routine clinical practice. Among them, 72.3% used telemedicine during the crisis. 89.4% of the responders tended to change the treatment strategy of emergency COVID-19 patients by planning temporary collection system drainage followed by an elective intervention afterward. Nevertheless, 10.6% of them continued to perform definitive stone surgical treatment. It is worth noting that 55.3% and 39.8% of the experts changed their elective surgical treatment approaches by a rate of 90-100% and 75-89%, respectively. On the other hand, 6.4% of them continued as before the pandemic [5] . Antonucci and colleagues studied the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on urolithiasis emergency department (ED) admissions, hospitalizations, and clinical management in three high-volume Italian centers. Among 304 patients included in the analysis, there was a significant reduction (48.4%) in the global number of patients admitted to ED for treatment of urolithiasis between March and April 2020 compared to the same period of the last year. Moreover, patients admitted to ED during COVID-19 had more complications (20.4% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.025), more frequently need hospitalization (38.8% vs. 20.9%, p = 0.001), and regarding clinical stone management a statistically significant increase in early stone removal procedures over urinary drainage only was reported (p = 0.015) [6] . Likewise, in Dallas, USA, Steinberg and colleagues observed a 38% and 44% reduction in the number of ED visits for stone disease at both their private academic and county hospitals, respectively [7] .In several hospitals, it took about 21 days to adopt changes related to COVID-19 and intervention for urinary stones. There was a significant increase in the rate of conservative approaches such as nephrostomy tube (NPT) insertion, double JJ stent placement or extraction from 38.2 to 81%, while definitive treatment options such as ureteroscopy (URS), retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) dropped from 60.8 to 19% (p < 0.001) [8] .In another study that compared the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for management of urinary stone emergencies during COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March-April 2020) with the management performed in the same hospital in a non-COVID-19 period (i.e., March-April 2019), the number of urinary stone emergencies, complication rates, urinary stone diameter, grade of hydronephrosis, and the use of NPT or ureteral stent for the first aid did not significantly change during COVID-19 pandemic [4] . However, patients had higher serum creatinine levels and stone position significantly changed with increase rate of middle and lower third ureteric stones during COVID-19 time due to delay of patient presentation to the hospital, related to the pandemic [4] . Similarly, Gul and colleagues found that serum creatinine levels and the white blood cell counts at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID period and the rate of grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis was higher. These findings reflect the increased rate of complicated ureteral stone disease during the COVID-19 restrictions period [9] .Recently, several researchers have published recommendations to prioritize the treatment of urinary stones during the COVID-19 pandemic [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Ribal and colleagues divided the priority of urological diseases into: low priority (if treatment delayed by 6 months, it is unlikely to cause clinical harm); intermediate priority (if treatment delayed by 3-4 months, it may cause clinical harm, but it is unlikely); high priority (if treatment delayed more than 6 weeks, it is likely to cause clinical harm); and emergency (a life or organ-threatening situation) [10] . Others have developed triage tier classification systems [11, 13] and clinical pathways [12] to facilitate decisions on surgical care of patients with urinary stones. Tier systems ranged from ""tier 0 to tier 4"" based on the urgency to intervene. Tier 0 was classified as top emergency cases that require intervention within 24 h, whereas tier 4 can be postponed >12 weeks.With regard to strategies for the prevention and treatment of urinary stones during this COVID-19 pandemic, patients can be divided into two groups. First group includes those who do not need urological intervention including non-struvite, non-cystine renal stones < 7 mm, with no anatomic abnormalities. In this group of patients, general dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications are helpful, and it is preferred to perform follow-up ultrasonography after cessation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The second group comprises those patients in whom urological intervention either emergent or nonemergent is indicated [19] . There are multiple parameters used to assess the urgency of surgical intervention for treatment of urolithiasis including stone size and site, severity of symptoms, control of symptoms, presence of hydronephrosis or infection, degree of obstruction, presence of indwelling JJ stent or nephrostomy tube (NPT), and if the patient has a solitary functioning kidney and/or renal function impairment [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .Of note, the treatment decision of urinary stones treatment depends not only on the patient and calculus-related factors, but also on other disciplines and healthcare resources, including the number of surgical staff and anesthesiologists, availability of hospital beds, operating rooms, and mechanical ventilators, as well as the burden of COVID-19 in the country.Medical staff are at risk of contracting COVID-19 infection from positive diagnosed COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic or patients in the incubation period.Anesthesiologists have more risk of contracting infection during intervention from exposure to the patient's airway [21] . Regional anesthesia may provide patients with a successful anesthesia method and help protect the anesthesia team [22] . Nevertheless, recent report showed that COVID-19 virus may also spread the virus during regional anesthesia as it can affect the central nervous system [23] . Thus, it is necessary to determine the principle of the best preoperative evaluation during a pandemic to protect healthcare workers.Recently, Gökce et al. studied the preoperative evaluation and methods of anesthesia applied for stone disease treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. They included 473 patients from 11 centers in 5 countries, and they found CT chest scan and PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab increased by 59.6% and 56.7%, respectively. In addition, there was significant alteration in anesthesia methods by 9.5%. General anesthesia, spinal/epidural anesthesia, and topical/local anesthesia were applied in 71.2%, 16.1%, and 11% of patients, respectively [8] .For treatment of obstructed renal or ureteric stones, all studies have assigned alarming indications and warning signs for intervention within <24 h, including infection, impaired renal function, solitary kidney, bilateral ureteric obstruction, and intractable symptoms, in order to prevent irreversible kidney damage and disease progression, or even death [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The ideal intervention time in case of treatment of longtime ureteric and renal obstruction is not determined yet, because several unpredictable variables affect the dynamics of renal function loss [24] . If obstruction is not associated with urinary tract infection, the time frame of intervention between 6 and 12 weeks seems suitable; however, if infection is superadded, immediate intervention is required to avoid any possible renal function loss [25] . Of note, delayed intervention for obstructed infected kidney might increase the risk of ICU admissions and mortality rates by 15% and 8%, respectively [26] .If obstruction is associated with infection and fever, we should drain the collecting system temporarily using either indwelling JJ stent or NPT, followed by definitive treatment when possible [12, 13, 15, 16, 18] . During COVID-19 pandemic, definitive stone treatment is still a matter of debate. Some endo-urologists prefer active stone treatment over temporary drainage to reduce the number of emergency room visits, except if infection or staged treatment is expected [6, 13, 15] , while others prefer to defer all procedures to treat urinary stones until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, with temporary drainage only if indicated [16, 18] .As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , there is a wide range of clinical scenarios to determine the appropriate intervention time, because if delay in intervention happens, clinical harm is likely to occur. Thus, endo-urologists should appropriately weigh the patient's risk and the benefit of the surgery to decide to intervene. If the risks outweighed the benefits to the patient, postpone the surgery. Moreover, it is advisable that endo-urologists should choose the treatment option that achieves the higher stone-free status and has a lower auxiliary treatment rate. For example, for treatment of stone upper third left ureter URS is recommended than SWL [13] . Emergency or Tier 0 [10, 11, 13] Organ-threatening or life-threatening < 24 h Obstructed infected kidney [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 20] Obstructing stone in solitary kidney [12] [13] [14] [15] 20] Obstructing stone associated with acute renal impairment [12] [13] [14] [15] 20 ] Bilateral ureteric obstruction [12] [13] [14] [15] 20 ] Severe unmanageable symptoms [12, 13, 15, 20] Offer temporarily drainage if infection and fever present Consider definitive treatment, except if staged treatment is expected High priority or Tier 1-3 [10, 11, 13] It is likely to cause clinical harm < 2-8 weeks Obstructing ureteric stone if failed MET (> 4 weeks), large to pass (> 8 mm) [13] or (> 10 mm) [20] Symptomatic stone on mediation [11, 13, 14, 16, 20] Extreme stent-related symptoms [13, 15, 20] Obstructing ureteral stone [11, 12, 14, 20] Obstructed staghorn stone [20] Recurrent UTI on non-obstructing renal stone [13] Stent exchange [11] Weigh patient's risk and surgery benefit before treatment Procedures with lower auxiliary retreatments are preferred, e.g., URS over SWL Stentless or stents with strings are encouraged If possible, insert stents and NPT under local anesthesia to spare a ventilator If possible, perform procedures as an outpatient or day surgery To reduce anesthesia time and complications, seniors should do surgery Low priority or Tier 1-3 [10, 11, 13] It may cause clinical harm, but it is unlikely <12 weeks Stone with well-tolerated stent or NPT [11] [12] [13] [14] 16] Bladder stone with recurrent UTI or obstruction [14] Ureteral stent removal [17] Postpone or Tier 4 [10, 11, 13] It is unlikely to cause clinical harm >12 weeks Asymptomatic renal stone [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Non-obstructing renal stone [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Non-urgent PCNL procedures [13] Normal renal function [12] No solitary kidney [12] Asymptomatic bladder stone [14] Ureteral stents and NPT exchange [14, 18] Ureteral stent removal [16] Several parameters indicate that surgical intervention should be postponed for more than 12 weeks, because clinical harm is unlikely to occur, including non-obstructing asymptomatic renal stones, normal renal function, PCNL procedures, ureteric stent and NPT replacement, and asymptomatic bladder calculi [11] [12] [13] 18] . It is worth noting that most of PCNL indications concern large, obstructive, and infected renal stones. They should not be postponed if there is no lack in unit care capacity. Thus, we should interpret the recommendations of PCNL indications carefully. Patients with renal colic should be managed conservatively with appropriate pain control and medical expulsive therapy with close follow-up just in case it becomes an emergency [12, 15] . Recently, concerns about the safety of using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), e.g., ibuprofen, for treatment of pain have been raised, as it might worse COVID-19 symptoms. No doubt that NSAID is an effective treatment for renal colic. Therefore, we should prescribe NSAID, except for patients with fever or have symptomatic viral infections, acetaminophen should be used instead.Of note, patients who have renal or ureteric stones with indwelling JJ stent or nephrostomy tube are not at risk of progressive renal function deterioration and stone treatment can be delayed up to 12 weeks [11] [12] [13] [14] 16] . However, early surgery may be indicated if patient develops extreme bothersome stent symptoms [13, 15] .Stenzel et al. recommended to postpone most procedures for indwelling ureteral stent removal, because for most stents with an indwelling time of 6 to 12 months, removal is simple [16] . Instead, Katz et al. recommended ureteral stent removal as an office-based procedure without delay to avoid stent encrustation, recurrent infections, and annoying stent symptoms that require emergency room visit or hospital admission, as well as to minimize the risk of stents being retained/forgotten [17] . In rare occasions, infections associated with ureteral stents can cause serious illnesses, such as acute pyelonephritis, bacteremia, urosepsis, and even death. Thus, during COVID-19, stentless procedures are encouraged after successful surgery. If inserted, we should consider using stents with strings outside the urethra, to be removed on an outpatient basis [12, 13, 15] .Urologists usually come into contact with urine during their work. Controversy exists regarding the presence of coronavirus in the urine, and the data are not yet robust. Viral RNA was found only in 6.9% among 66 patients who recovered from COVID-19 infection [27] . On the contrary, Wang and colleagues reported the absence of SARSCOV-2 in 72 tested urine samples [28] . This evidence showed that viral load in urine is not too high and the risk of urine contamination is extremely small, as well as standard sterilization of endourology reusable instruments is considered safe in terms of COVID-19 cross-contamination [12] . Nevertheless, patients with suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 should undergo endoscopy and urethral catheterization carefully, and endo-urologists should be protected completely from infection.It is now clear that the coronavirus infection is not a temporary major pandemic; nevertheless, it represents a challenging long-standing health healthcare problem. While waiting for a new COVID-19 vaccine or treatment, we should put into consideration that the recommendations made for treatment of urinary stone disease in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic focused mainly on a short-term crisis situation (12-16 weeks) . Thereafter, all urologists will face another major confronts for scheduling the long waiting list of patients and manage more complicated cases in a context of an extended period of pandemic, with a potential of second wave pandemic in many countries. While the literature evidence of how we restart after lockdown and scheduling the long waiting list of patients is insufficient, we believe that it is difficult to develop recommendations that fit all centers, owing to the major differences between them in terms of patients' number, healthcare coworkers, urology department facilities, the availability of hospital resources, the total number of beds including ICU capacity, as well as the severity and spread of COVID-19 infection in each country. Thus, urologists should deal with the large cumulative number of cases and schedule OR lists properly to provide maximum patient safety.Treatment options for urinary stones have markedly changed during COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding anesthesia methods, the optimal methods are still unknown. As patients with urolithiasis have a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, judicious treatment decision should be made by endo-urologists according to their surgical priority. Of note, it is recommended to postpone most non-urgent elective procedures, and if there are any alarming indications, emergency intervention is necessary. For intermediate-and lowpriority cases, endo-urologists should appropriately weigh the patient's risk and the benefit of the operation before intervention. ","Egypt","first author","2020-11-25","11"

There have also been claims that many crisis-affected countries are 'fighting the epidemic in the dark', due to a lack of testing and limited access to data on the pandemic (IRC 2020). While Uganda and Kenya, the sites of our fieldwork, have both recorded very low cases and death rates -101 and 902 deaths respectively at the time of writing (WHO 2020a, WHO 2020b) -there are concerns that many cases go unrecorded. At the same time, the swift actions taken by both the Government of Uganda and the Government of Kenya, including a strict lockdown in March 2020, effectively slowed the rate of transmission. However, as with many other countries, lockdown had adverse economic consequences, which have disproportionately affected the most vulnerable.Reports suggest that in the face of these compounding factors among those most seriously affected are refugees (CGD 2020), 85% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries (Furhman et al. 2020 ). In refugee camps, self-isolation and social distancing are nearly impossible, misinformation is endemic, and humanitarian presence has been reduced due to the suspension of international non-governmental organisation (NGO) missions (NRC 2020). In cities, amid food shortages created by lockdown, refugees have often been excluded from government food distributions.In ordinary circumstances, organisations created and led by refugees themselves (termed here refugee-led organisations, or RLOs) play an important role in meeting community needs ). i Our existing research has shown that refugee-led social protection -defined as activities designed to reduce populations' poverty, vulnerability, or risk that are provided by organisations or networks created by refugees -are frequently perceived to be among the most important sources of assistance by refugee communities (ibid.). Such activities are a key part of the social security apparatus of refugee camps and urban refugee communities, providing crucial services, from informal education to savings mechanisms, and even health services. In some contexts, United Nations (UN) agencies and NGOs use RLOs as a 'bridge' to work with communities, but this engagement is sporadic, and there are no clear international policy guidelines on how to do this equitably, systematically, and effectively.As COVID-19 spread, humanitarian organisations have struggled to respond effectively to the needs of refugees, and RLOs have frequently found themselves as default providers of assistance and mutual aid, but usually without additional or effective support from international organisations and NGOs. These developments underscore the urgency of situating RLOs within ongoing and longstanding debates on 'localisation' (i.e. the transfer of humanitarian and development funds, as well as agency and responsibility, to national and local actors). However, a criticism of RLOs is that they lack capacity to deliver at scale. In many cases, this is a fair criticism.They face a chicken-and-egg dilemma, unable to secure the resources to enable them to build capacity through growing in both scope and size. A main constraint is that donor governments are reluctant to engage in direct funding given, for example, many RLOs' inability to meet fiduciary and auditing requirements. And RLOs are only one of many segments of civil society cut off from funding opportunities: despite the humanitarian Grand Bargain's commitment to 'localise' 25% of humanitarian funding, less than 2% currently goes through national organisations, and less than 0.2% goes through local grassroots organisations (Singh and Mollett 2019 ).Yet despite these barriers in accessing available funding and overall funding shortages, RLOs serve members of their communities in significant ways. However, little discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic has explored locally-led responses, and the work of affected communities themselves has been largely off the radar. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mobilisation of RLOs to address its impact on refugees highlights the powerful role RLOs can play in public health response, as well as complementary areas such as food distribution and basic service provision. This research note draws upon a combination of completed pre-pandemic research and ongoing in-pandemic research. During 2018 and 2019, we undertook qualitative research covering around 80 RLOs in cities and camps in Uganda (Nakivale and Kampala) and Kenya (Kakuma and Nairobi), using a mixture of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observation undertaken with RLO staff and beneficiaries, and covering a range of social protection and other activities. This research has been published in a variety of peer-reviewed outputs (e.g. Pincock et al 2020a; Pincock et al 2020b) . Recognising the growing relevance of RLOs during COVID-19, we have embarked on a series of follow-up studies, with a particular focus on RLO-led public health and livelihoods activities in the context of the pandemic. This research has now taken on a longitudinal dimension, using qualitative and quantitative methods to follow a series of RLOs and their beneficiary populations over time, initially within East Africa. We will publish interim results in report form in 2021.So far, we have completed initial remote qualitative research as the basis for this longitudinal study, undertaking interviews and focus groups with key staff at 15 RLOs involved in our original study that are actively involved in providing COVID-19-related support services. Even though the in-pandemic research is ongoing and we have yet to implement survey-based data collection, the research offers provisional insights of immediate practical relevance for COVID-19 related public health delivery in refugee-hosting contexts. As of yet, we have been unable to reach many RLOs' beneficiaries remotely, which would allow us to better understand the impact of their work during the pandemic; we have therefore focused this paper on RLOs' roles and potential impacts, which are strengthened through secondary sources that indicate their significance as first responders during crises. Table 1 below presents an overview of these organisations and their activities both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Awareness-raising messages sent to the refugee community through the WhatsApp and Facebook platforms created for that purpose; making and distributing masks to members of the community; distributing food to a limited number of the most vulnerable people in the community.Skills development for youth in Kenya and Somalia.Awareness-raising about the virus in Eastleigh, Nairobi; awareness-raising photo campaign on social media; writing blogs on a refugee platform to fight Covid-19.Membership organisation, operates on monthly contributions from members to help vulnerable in community with basic needs and scholarships for skills training in Nairobi.Door to door food, face mask and sanitizer distribution to 6,000 refugees and host community members with a focus on the most vulnerable households; sensitisation of community leaders about the virus and how/where they could get assistance.Provides capacity building on legal matters, economics, and gender empowerment to fellow refugees.Providing vulnerable refugee community members with information, including translating materials into native languages; distributing PPE; assisting most vulnerable households with food, sanitizing materials, masks, soaps, and other essentials.SSURA seeks to represent the rights of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda. This includes teaching Sudanese refugees living in Arua Ugandan laws and code of conduct to try and prevent conflicts and violence from arising between refugees and host communities.Awareness raising (especially for elderly and the sick); liaising with agencies over urban refugees' access to food rations in settlements in the West Nile region.Kadana Refugee Network Human rights monitoring; promotes social cohesion between refugees and hosts through activities including sport; offers law and human rights monitoring trainings with Kenya National Human Rights Commission Awareness, sensitisation, advocacy with agencies and government for targeted support for refugeesPromoting community interests through advocacy, also organizes youth groups, women's groups in Kampala Sensitization and awareness campaign concerning spread and prevention of COVID-19 via Whatsapp and online; encouraging social distancing in cases where personal support is needed; established an emergency team which reports urgent cases to the government task force for responses; lobbying the government's COVID-19 task force to include refugee communities in food distribution especially during Ramadan and to vulnerable households who lack access to food rationsEmpowering refugees through leadership training, capacity development in KampalaFood distributionEducation and self-reliance promotion among young people in Kampala and rural refugee settlements.Distributed food items (10 kg of maize flour) and hand soap to 120 refugee households; sanitizers are distributed with mobile money cash transfers.Supports urban refugees through sports, English classes, and vocational skills training to address social challenges like ethnic conflict, unemployment, public health, and lack of access to education.Food distribution to over 800 refugeesEmergency shelter and livelihoods organisation (mushroom-growing, English classes, business classes)Distributed food and emergency cash to refugee household members of the centreSouth Sudanese humanitarian group working in camps and urban areas on GBV, human rights, documentation, peace-building and advocacyAwareness-raising to refugee communities to observe public preventive measures on hygiene and sanitation in campsConstruction and other livelihoods training, sensitization about peace and non-discrimination to youth.South Sudanese group for peace and reconciliation, advocacyOnline survey to learn about refugees' household assets, support, and access to needed suppliesTrains youth in conflict management and resolution, trauma healing, and entrepreneurial and vocational skills to encourage self-reliance and support peace and development at the grassroots level.Raising local community awareness about COVID-19 prevention and safety guidelines among refugee communities, through both online and offline channels; translated information, education, and communication (IEC) materials into refugees' native languages; putting up 800 COVID-19 Prevention Posters in local languages in key areas; created and shared awareness-raising videos on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube about COVID-19 and the situation faced by refugees (especially urban refugee women and girls) during the pandemic.Our data inductively reveals the type and scale of public health-related activities undertaken by RLOs in the context of COVID-19 and provides a sense of their impact on beneficiary populations.One of the key preliminary findings is a notable and growing focus on public health-related activities. We suggest that even this preliminary qualitative research demonstrates the significant and neglected potential of RLOs to complement international public health and wider humanitarian responses to the pandemic. We observe five important public health functions that RLOs are playing, and have the potential to play at increased scale. However, we further suggest that maximizing the potential contribution of RLOs will depend upon creating new mechanisms to rapidly identify, fund, and build capacity among RLOs.Existing research underscores the gap and the necessity of increasing refugees' access to public As the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic became clearer, some refugee organisations in them to cope during these trying moments since refugees can no longer go to collect food rations from refugee camps due to public and private transport bans. Additionally, starting next week our teams will be distributing and pinning on walls, entrance and exit points of markets, hospitals, clinics and water points 300 COVID-19 prevention posters translated into Bari to improve refugees access to reliable information about the coronavirus disease. (Interview, 24 June 2020)The organisation's founders feel that CECI has had success in spreading awareness about COVID-19 due to the strong community links it had already forged through its normal work. In addition to the work it has done in person, it shares regular information on its Facebook page, which has over 2000 followers, and twitter, where it has nearly 400. Through clips of members speaking about how to properly wash hands and socially distance, the organisation is able to share messages with members as trusted voices.With many senior humanitarian staff absent from refugee camps and aid budgets under threat, social services in camps may become stretched across a range of sectors (e.g. education, food distribution, and water and sanitation). Finding ways to deliver these essential services, while trying to observe social distancing, will require local staff and volunteers to play an important role. RLOs and informal groups can be effective actors for this type of work -in part because they are already undertaking it themselves.Between 2017 and 2019, we integrated a series of questions on refugees' sources of social protection into a broader survey on refugees' economic lives, with a sample size of over 5000 refugees for Uganda and Kenya. We asked, 'Who would you ask if you are looking for money for an emergency, for example to purchase medicine?' 90% said that they would first turn to community-level support, including community-based organisations, rather than larger international organisations or financial lenders. We found similar response levels relating to community sources of other forms of social protection such as the need for money or employment . This points to RLOs playing a significant role in 'bridging' gaps in healthcare and assistance, as well as the relative capacity some already have compared to individual refugees.Equally crucial is conducting advocacy to alert agencies of needs and gaps in capacity and other responses. Leaders of RLOs were among the first to speak out about the needs of urban refugees when Uganda went into lockdown on March 31 st . In contrast to refugees in camps, most urban refugees do not receive humanitarian assistance, meaning most survive on petty trade as informal street hawkers -livelihoods which lockdown immediately restricted. Given this, some refugees report being less afraid of the virus than of its secondary consequences: restricted access to food, medicine, and basic services. In Kampala, for example, many refugees face severe food shortages because of the lockdown. The government initially announced on national television that 'refugees should be in the camps' and that 'non-nationals will not get food aid' except in refugee camps (Betts et al 2020b) . While this was ultimately rescinded, RLOs immediately began organising to raise money and deliver food to their members. The RLO Hope for Children and Women Victims of Violence ordinarily supports around 1,300 refugees a year through vocational training, psychosocial support and English lessons. In the current crisis, it has been distributing food and soap to refugees and Ugandans in the Ndejje area of Kampala, with over 400 beneficiaries. Meanwhile, Young African Refugees for Integral Development (YARID), an award-winning organisation for refugee assistance, ii has distributed baskets of flour, soap, beans, sugar, and cooking oil to the most vulnerable in the community. It has identified recipients through community networks, and delivered food on bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) where needed.So far it has provided this support to more than 200 households.In recent years, community health workers (CHWs) have been recognised as key actors in health delivery in developing countries (WHO 2008). As noted earlier, they have been increasingly used in refugee settings, providing important local level support to public healthcare systems. CHWs can be rapidly trained, affordably equipped, and play a range of roles from public information to tracking, as well as providing basic preventive, promotional, and rehabilitative support. Some refugees are also formally trained doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, though many face restrictions on their ability to practice in their host countries. In our previous research, we found medically trained refugees working with communities who were unable to access treatment elsewhere due to barriers including discrimination and lack of transportation.However, many were unable to legally practice due to barriers such as document translation and licensing, and thus worked in an informal capacity .Health services for refugees in Uganda are provided through integrated humanitarian and development funding, meaning that refugees are in theory able to use the same public and private health facilities as local people. However, refugee access to healthcare is restricted by practical barriers including under-resourced services, which makes it difficult to handle the high disease burden in rural areas (Komakech et al 2019) . In cities, other challenges include inadequate information and awareness about the availability of services, and an inability to pay for treatment or transport (Langlois et al 2016 are also calls in Western countries of asylum to allow refugees to enter the medical workforce (UNHCR 2020). In instances where this is not formally possible, there is value in raising further awareness of -and legalizing -the support that refugee health workers deliver to their own community, such as in Turkey where Syrian physicians can assist fellow Syrians (Özdemir 2017) .RLOs may also play a role in shaping social norms that limit transmission of COVID-19. In wealthier countries, governments are using behavioural economics to design interventions that shape social compliance with public health policies. States in the global North have access to big data and top social scientists to design responses adapted to cultural context. This approach is not readily available in many humanitarian settings. In refugee camps, shaping social norms relies upon building trust. We already know from previous research that refugees consistently say that they rely on community-level support as much, if not more so, than international aid. Refugee-led organisations and initiatives are aware of community needs and appropriate responses because they are part of these communities; the trust they foster is generally borne from close, regular contact rather than one-off interventions, suggesting that guidance provided from them on COVID-19 may be more effectively received and adhered to. More research is needed on how community-level trust, legitimacy and authority are affected in the context of pandemics contact details of hundreds of their refugee members, which they are already using to spread awareness and, in at least one instance, send funds for food via mobile money. Some refugees live clandestinely in cities, meaning they risk being overlooked in formal monitoring programmes.RLOs have the potential to serve tracking functions, capable of interfacing with both communities and formal authorities to share information anonymously while retaining trust. However, this role has risks that must be carefully mediated. These include the concern that if outbreaks were identified within refugee communities, this could be used to justify stigmatizing public health controls which further restrict refugees' mobility and work. Long-term relationships which treat RLOs as equal partners with agency in the design and trajectory of data-gathering processes, and in the development of strategies to control outbreaks, must be built to sustain such trust. More research -and better transparency -will be needed to address ethical questions relating to the storage, use and long-term consequences of sharing data if RLOs are to promote contact tracing.COVID-19 highlights the vulnerability and marginality of refugees in low and middle-income countries. As the virus and its legacy continue to affect refugees, the challenge will remain how to respond to humanitarian needs, whether pre-existing or exacerbated by the pandemic, at a time when international capacity is stretched to its limits. Assistance may need to be more remote and participatory, and one of the humanitarian community's greatest assets is likely to be the affected communities themselves. In refugee settings -whether urban or camp-basedrefugees have long mobilised to provide various forms of protection and assistance to both refugees and host communities.Our research highlights how prior to COVID-19, RLOs in Kenya and Uganda were providing crucial sources of social protection in areas including health and livelihoods. From the perspective of the communities these were often regarded as more important than the assistance of international organisations and NGOs. Yet few RLOs received funding. Our follow-up research during COVID-19 shows how RLOs have pivoted their service provision to fill assistance gaps, including in areas directly related to public health. As the humanitarian system searches for ways to implement remote and participatory approaches to refugee assistance, RLOs offer great potential, if mechanisms can be found to identify those that are effective, provide them with funding, and build their capacities.","Kenya","abstract","2020-11-24","11"

The COVID-19 is a ravaging and infectious viral disease caused by a novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapidly increasing and contagious nature of the disease and its overwhelming influence on critical care and frontline healthcare staff as well as the possibility of transmission by asymptomatic carriers, governments around the world closed their borders, announced total or partial lockdowns, movement restrictions, social distancing, and wearing of facemasks (Biscayart et al., 2020; Zaka et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) as precautionary measures to curb the spread of the virus. However, as of August 10, 2020, the total number of infected persons worldwide had risen to 19, 718 ,030 cases with 728,013 deaths while Nigeria had 46,867 confirmed cases and 950 deaths (John Hopkins University, 2020) . While the most developed regions of the world have battled with the virus, recording thousands of infections and deaths, it is unknown how Nigeria with a fragile and less sophisticated healthcare system will be able to confront the disease and stop it from spreading among its densely populated and already vulnerable populations. With no proven and acceptable pharmaceutical cure, the best way to curb the virus and prevent it from spreading, may therefore be the adoption of precautionary behaviors (Güner et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020; World Health Organization WHO, 2020b) . Precautionary behavior such as quarantine of infected persons, social distancing (e.g., self-isolation, school, workplace and market closures, cancelation of large public gatherings, etc.) and hygienic practices (e.g., frequent handwashing with soap, using a face masks, use of hand sanitizers, etc.) have been identified as infection control measures which help curtail the spread of infections (Leppin and Aro, 2009 ). In extreme cases, communitywide containments are also adopted (Sjödin et al., 2020) . Hatchett et al. (2007) stated that the quarantine measure adopted during the 1918 Influenza pandemic was largely responsible for halting the widespread of the influenza. According to Li et al. (2004) , the number of secondary cases from an infected patient during the SARS outbreak of 2003 was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. Also, de Vlas et al. (2009) asserted that the enforcement of communitywide containments in China, was instrumental in the consistent and great decrease of infections during the SARS epidemic. In Nigeria, Liberia and other parts of West Africa, hygienic practices widely adopted during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreaks (Althaus et al., 2015; Czerniewska and White, 2020) and the 2012 Hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan (Phillips et al., 2015) proved very useful in curbing the spread of infections across the regions. All across the globe, the most effective way of delaying the spread of infections, especially in times when vaccines are not yet available, has been the adoption of precautionary behaviors (Tang et al., 2012; Ebrahim and Memish, 2020; Sjödin et al., 2020) . However, the challenge often is the knowledge and awareness level of individuals about the infectiousness of diseases (Hassan et al., 2017; Alam et al., 2020) and whether such knowledge will translate into precautionary behavior (Ho et al., 2013; Cain et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) .Already, a growing number of health-related studies suggest that there is very little association between knowledge of an infectious disease and actual engagement in a precautionary behavior (see for review Phillips et al., 2015; Seimetz et al., 2016; De Buck et al., 2017) . Studies now suggest that the path from knowledge/awareness to actual precautionary behavior is often mediated by certain factors such as risk perceptions/worry (Brug et al., 2004; Taglioni et al., 2013) , self efficacy (Rimal, 2000) attention, information surveillance and elaboration (Raza et al., 2020) , etc. Vartti et al. (2009) reported that people who are more knowledgeable about the related etiology of the disease, tend to worry more about being infected and therefore suggesting a link between knowledge and risk perception. It is worthy of note also that the trajectory of an infectious disease is often determined by the behavior of individuals, and the behavior is in turn related to individuals' risk perception (Abdelrahman, 2020; Vijayaraghavan and Singhal, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and beliefs about the disease (Janz and Becker, 1984) . Also, though there is relatively high knowledge of COVID-19 around the globe and among Nigerians in particular (Olapegba et al., 2020a,b) , there is the possibility that competing myths and sacred narratives (Chukwuorji and Iorfa, 2020 ) may be downplaying involvement in precautionary behavior and therefore, it is important to investigate the path from knowledge/awareness of COVID-19 to precautionary behavior and the mediators and moderators that may be on this path. This will help in understanding the correlates and pathways to curbing the spread of the virus in Nigeria and other parts of the globe.A study of this nature in the COVID-19 era is important because not only is a widely acceptable pharmaceutical cure currently unavailable, but amidst the high levels of social awareness of the pandemic coupled with its sudden and virulent nature, a lot of conspiracy theories have sprung up (Ahmed et al., 2020; Georgiou et al., 2020) leading to a possible decrease in willingness to engage in precautionary behaviors (Allington et al., 2020; Van Bavel et al., 2020) . Perceptions about the nature and causes of the pandemic are also largely unfounded around evidence (Chukwuorji and Iorfa, 2020) and may influence engagement in precautionary behaviors among the people as well. Therefore, since issues related to precautionary health behavior in populations have been linked to individuals' belief systems as well as their perceived fear or risks of contracting a disease, this study, borrowing from the health belief model (HBM) may offer explanations to the failure of the Nigerian people in adopting disease prevention strategies and screening tests for early detection and curbing the spread of the disease. Findings from this study may be used to guide health promotion and disease prevention programs in times of the COVID-19 or other pandemics and epidemics that may arise in the future.The HBM has been used to explain and predict individual changes in health behaviors (Becker, 1974; Jones et al., 2015) and may also be important in understanding precautionary behaviors in the COVID-19 era. Specifically, the HBM offers risk (threat) perceptions (perception of susceptibility to a disease and perception of the severity of the disease) as important elements (channels of influence) that help in predicting individual healthrelated behaviors (Becker, 1974; Champion and Skinner, 2008; Cameron et al., 2009 ). This study therefore investigated how COVID-19 knowledge and risk perceptions could influence precautionary behaviors, specifically if risk perception may be mediating the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behaviors. Also, in line with Gustafson's (1998) argument that gender structures give rise to systematic gender differences in the perception of risks, the study also sought to investigate if gender could moderate the mediating path from COVID-19 through risk perception to precautionary behavior. Although some studies have shown greater risk perception among males than females, the gender effect on risk behavior is partially mediated by risk propensity (a predisposition to risk) and this new and important insight tends to show that risk perception could assume any direction, depending on the potency of other underlying variables (Harris et al., 2006; Jayathilake, 2013) . Moreover, some variables such as the greater perceived likelihood of negative outcomes have been found to partially mediate female's lower propensity toward risk choices in gambling, recreation, and health domains (Harris et al., 2006) as well as the tendency of women being more risk averse than men (Nelson, 2015) . Based on these considerations therefore, the following hypotheses were formulated:• COVID-19 knowledge will predict precautionary behaviors such that higher levels of COVID-19 knowledge will give rise to higher levels of precautionary behavior. • Risk perception will predict precautionary behaviors such that higher levels of risk perception will give rise to higher levels of precautionary behavior. • Risk perception will mediate the prediction of precautionary behavior by COVID-19 knowledge (mediation hypothesis) and this effect will be stronger for females than their male counterparts (moderated mediation hypotheses).The conceptual model of the expected moderated mediation is shown in Figure 1 .This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Nigeria using self-administered questionnaires between 20 April and 30 April 2020. The general population of study covered participants aged 15 years and above in the 36 states of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory. Participants were recruited online through a blend of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) technique and Random Survey Sampling (RSS). RDS was considered appropriate due to social restrictions associated with the COVID-19 lockdown (occasioned by the rapid spread of the disease) which made it difficult to physically access prospective respondents at the time of data collection. Some persons across States, regions, and local governments in Nigeria were considered, and therefore helped in disseminating the survey links to others in the same category who also responded to the questionnaires. RSS was considered appropriate because it enables the dissemination of an online semi-structured questionnaire, with a consent form attached to it. The link to the questionnaire was sent through social media platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, and Nairaland) to the key persons. Prospective respondents were then driven to share the link of the survey to residents in other parts of the country. Persons with access to the Internet, who understood the English Language, and were as well willing to give informed consent, were included. To arrive at 1,554 responses, reminder messages with links to the Google form were posted online daily. Ethical approval was sought from the Faculty of Social Sciences Ethical Board, University of Ibadan. Strict adherence to the ethical provisions on confidentiality and autonomy was also observed. Informed consent was obtained from participants using an embedded form. Participants were informed of the confidentiality of the study and also informed they could withdraw from the study at any point if they so desired.The questionnaire assessed participants' demographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, educational qualification, religion, location, and perceived financial situation), and consisted of a battery of measures of COVID-19 knowledge, risk perceptions, and precautionary behavior.COVID-19 knowledge was assessed using a 5-item Likert-type scale adapted from the Ebola knowledge scale (Rolison and Hanoch, 2015) . An adapted 10-item Likert-type scale was used to examine the precautionary behavior of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic (Barr et al., 2008; Duncan et al., 2009) . The 10-item scale has statements dealing with actions taken in advance to protect against possible exposure to COVID-19. Sample items include: ""I prefer to wash my hands pretty soon after shaking someone's hand"" and ""I am comfortable going to very crowded places (reverse scored)."" Participants rated items on a separate 7-point Likert type scale (one strongly disagree; seven strongly agree). Items four and six are reverse scored. A reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.80 was obtained in a pilot study of the scale while the current data set yielded an alpha of 0.75.The data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 software. Descriptive statistics, using frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations, were conducted for socio-demographic variables and precautionary behavior. To compute COVID-19 knowledge, the mean score and standard deviation for the sample population were calculated and scores above the norm were indicative of high knowledge of COVID-19, while scores below the norm indicated low knowledge of COVID-19. For risk perception and precautionary behavior, scores in each scale were summed to obtain a composite aggregate for each measure. Higher scores indicated higher risk perception or precautionary behavior (as the case was). Pearson's correlation was used to establish the relationship between the demographics and major variables of interest. Moderated mediation analysis was carried out with model 58 of Hayes PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2018) . The model 58 of the Hayes PROCESS macro uses ordinary least squares (OSL) analysis for calculating the mediation and the moderated mediation effects and bootstrapping for calculating the confidence intervals (CI) (Miers et al., 2017) . Our choice of these statistics was influenced by the consideration that a moderated mediation would test the influence of a fourth variable (gender) on the mediated relationship between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior. In this moderated mediation model, precautionary behavior was entered as the outcome variable, COVID-19 knowledge as the independent variable, risk perception as the mediator. Gender was included as the moderator on the dependent variables risk perception and precautionary behavior. Age was included as a covariate in the model. See Figure 1 for a representation of the conceptual model.Participants were 1,554 persons (42.7% females and 57.3% males; mean age = 27.43, SD = 9.75). The sample characteristics of participants, including educational qualification, perceived financial status, relationship status, religion, and geopolitical groupings, and their statistical values are shown in Table 1 .Means, standard deviations, and correlations among the observed variables were computed separately for males and females and shown in Table 2 . Among females, being older (older age) was related to higher COVID-19 knowledge (r = 0.09, p < 0.05), and higher precautionary behavior (r = 0.10, p < 0.01), but not risk perception (r = 0.04, p > 0.05). Higher COVID-19 knowledge was related to greater risk perception (r = 0.09, p < 0.05) and greater precautionary behavior (r = 0.18, p < 0.01). Higher risk perception was related to greater precautionary behavior (r = 0.23, p < 0.01) ( Table 2) .For males, being older (older age) was related to higher COVID-19 knowledge (r = 0.10, p < 0.01), higher risk perception (r = 0.10, p < 0.01), and higher precautionary behavior (r = 0.10, p < 0.01). Higher COVID-19 knowledge was related to greater risk perception (r = 0.250, p < 0.01) and higher precautionary behavior (r = 0.18, p < 0.01). Risk perception was not related significantly to precautionary behavior (r = 0.06, p > 0.05).In Table 3 it was found that older age predicted increased risk perception. Gender did not predict risk perception. Greater COVID-19 knowledge predicted elevated levels of risk perception. Gender did not moderate the association of COVID-19 knowledge and risk perception, given that the interaction term was not significant. The predictors accounted for 1% of the variance in risk perception [R 2 = 0.01, F(4,1549) = 4.07, p = 0.003].In Table 3 also, it was found that older age predicted increased precautionary behavior. Gender did not predict precautionary behavior. Greater COVID-19 knowledge predicted elevated levels of precautionary behavior. Higher levels of risk perception predicted higher levels of involvement in precautionary behaviors. Gender did not moderate the association of risk perception and precautionary behavior, given that the interaction term was not significant. Our hypothesis of a moderated mediation effect was supported as evidenced by a significant indirect effect of COVID-19 knowledge on precautionary behavior through risk perception among females [B = 0.22, 95% CI = (0.01, 0.50)], but not males (B = 0.14, 95% CI = −0.05, 0.37). Note that the moderated mediation is significant when the 95% CI did not encompass zero as shown in the case for females. The predictors accounted for 9% of the variance in precautionary behavior [R 2 = 0.09, F(5,1548) = 31.46, p = 0.00]. The moderated mediation model with standardized coefficients is presented in Figure 2 .The study investigated COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary behavior among Nigerians and the moderated-mediation effect among the variables. Findings showed that COVID-19 knowledge had a significant influence on precautionary behavior. This supported our hypothesis and mirrored previous findings (Brug et al., 2004; Li et al., 2020) . It is logical to expect that when individuals are aware of threats, they will adopt reasonable behaviors that may avert the threat from causing harm. However, other studies (e.g., Phillips et al., 2015; Seimetz et al., 2016; De Buck et al., 2017) did not report this relationship but rather suggested that knowledge in itself may not always lead to precautionary health behaviors until the relationship is mediated upon by other factors (Rimal, 2000; Taglioni et al., 2013; Raza et al., 2020) . These may on the other hand explain the observation that even though the knowledge of the pandemic is relatively high, some individuals still do not adhere to precautionary measures according to the protocol laid down by authorities [see Table 4 (Appendix Table 1 )]. They may be said to be exhibiting attitude-behavior discrepancies, a tendency to be oblivious of the negative consequences due to inherent self-interests (as can be seen in pockets of disobedience to precautionary health behaviors in the face of the pandemic). Consistent with previous findings (e.g., Abdelrahman, 2020; Vijayaraghavan and Singhal, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) therefore, we postulated also that perception of risk will serve as a pathway through which knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 will influence precautionary behavior and that this influence may be more for females than for males. We also tested the direct influences of risk perception, age, and gender on precautionary behavior. As hypothesized, risk perception significantly predicted precautionary behavior, agreeing with previous findings (Brug et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2010) . This implies that perception of risk is an important variable that could inform valid and reliable precautionary behaviors and possible means of preventing a newly emerging contagious disease like COVID-19. Studies supporting the present result suggested that an individual's ability to promote precautionary behavior largely relies on the perceived risk of contracting a disease and that risk perception is a strong predictor of precautionary behaviors (Lau et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2020) . Moreover, as outlined by the HBM, for individuals to willingly engage in precautionary behaviors, they may have to, first and foremost, significantly perceive the risk that such disease poses to them.The study also showed that being older predicted more precautionary behavior and this is supported by Zhang et al. (2020) 's study. This finding indicates that older people and those with underlying comorbid diseases took more precautionary measures compared with younger people. International and national medical agencies have stated that older people and those with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to coronavirus and at risk of dying (World Health Organization WHO, 2020b). This may explain why elderly respondents reported engaging more in precautionary measures compared to the younger respondents who engaged in less precautionary behaviors as observed in the study.The result that gender differences existed in precautionary behavior is in line with past studies where females have consistently been found to engage in more precautionary behaviors than their male counterparts (Brug et al., 2004; Bish and Michie, 2010) . This implies that females have a greater tendency than males to engage in precautionary behaviors such as the washing of hands, use of hand sanitizers, wearing of face masks, cleaning of surfaces, and having plans to visit a hospital or call emergency numbers in case of suspected symptoms, etc. This may be related to the perceived global vulnerability of females to illness (Duncan et al., 2009; Dellar et al., 2015) . This relationship between gender and precautionary behavior may probably indicate that females perceive themselves as more susceptible to adverse conditions than males. Also, it was observed that risk perception mediated the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior. This outcome relates to previous studies, for instance, a study conducted among the Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims in 2014 on the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome showed that overall knowledge of causative agents, the symptoms of the virus and its similarity to the disease and risk perception of the virus were associated with precautionary behavior (Hosam et al., 2017) . The results showed that knowledge influenced precautionary behavior through the perception of risk. In other words, individuals who reported high levels of knowledge of the disease but did not perceive it as a risk did not initiate and engage in precautionary behaviors. This finding also strongly supports the assertion of the HBM that risk perception serves as a channel of influence that helps in predicting health behavior (Becker, 1974; Champion and Skinner, 2008; Cameron et al., 2009) .We hypothesized that the effect of the mediator (risk perception) will be moderated by another variable (gender). This hypothesis was influenced by previous findings that risk perception differs across gender. Most times the moderation may occur on any or all path(s) in the mediation model. Although, few studies have investigated if gender moderates the pathway of knowledge/awareness of an infectious disease through risk perception to precautionary health behavior, our study contributed to existing body of knowledge on the moderating influence of gender on the pathway of knowledge/awareness of an infectious disease through risk perception to precautionary health behavior, thus advancing the science in this area for other researchers to explore. Though no direct study with similar focus and results were found, a meta-analytic study on gender differences in risk perception pointed out that gender influences perception of risk (Byrnes et al., 1999) . Also, owing to the offspring risk hypothesis (Harris et al., 2006) , females tend to perceive greater risks than males because they are primary caregivers by nature and if people perceive more risks in the world, they will possibly be more effective at preserving any offspring under their care. Moreover, this finding corroborates a recent study that showed gender differences in risk perception of drug use between males and females (Ottu and Umoren, in press ). In sum, our findings showed that risk perception serves as a pathway through which COVID-19 knowledge may influence precautionary behavior and that this may be higher in females than in males.Much more efforts are needed to understand the factors that promote precautionary behaviors in times of pandemics and these efforts may benefit from the findings in this study. One, the dynamic nature of infectious disease transmission suggests that behavior by several individuals may have a significant impact on the trajectory of an outbreak. However, individuals may not take precautions if they are not aware or have wrong or inadequate knowledge about the outbreak. Therefore, in line with the findings of our study that more accurate COVID-19 knowledge predicted greater precautionary behavior, and coupled with the fact that there are already myths and conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and nature of COVID-19 (Ahmed et al., 2020; Georgiou et al., 2020 Shimizu, 2020 , we recommend enlightenment campaigns aimed at promoting adequate knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as addressing the current misconceptions and misinformation about the disease. In places where such knowledge is already influenced by conspiracy theories, it is important to reorient the public on the real nature and origin of the disease. In unaffected areas, true risks may be low, but due to the worldwide media coverage of the pandemic, there is the possibility of elevated levels of risk perception. Therefore, the scientific community may leverage on this to explore ways to best communicate risks to individuals without unnecessarily causing panic. Individuals who perceive themselves as being at risk of contracting the virus should engage in precautionary behaviors as suggested in this study rather than form stereotypes and prejudices against persons perceived to be the sources of the disease outbreak as reported in earlier findings (Chukwuorji and Iorfa, 2020; Olapegba et al., 2020a,b) . It is therefore, necessary that knowledge, realistic risks, and effective precautionary behaviors are communicated through various information sources so that people can engage in more preventive behaviors than depend on vaccines.Consequently and in line with the HBM, individuals may need to be informed about the potential risks of infection to adopt the right precautionary measures (Brug et al., 2004) . Campaigns at raising awareness of risks should therefore convey the consequences of the health issues associated with risk behaviors in a clear and unambiguous fashion. This will help individuals to understand perceived severity of the risks associated with the disease. Measures to control future outbreaks should not be limited to the development of vaccines, but also adequately informing the public about the true nature (and origin of the infections) as well as risks as these have shown to be predictors of precautionary behavior. The findings from this study along with previous findings justify the need to look more closely at the drivers of precautionary behaviors in individuals. This will serve as a proactive step toward curbing future endemics or pandemics.Our study revealed, COVID-19 knowledge predicted precautionary behavior and risk perception significantly predicted precautionary behavior. Moreover, age and gender emerged as important variables associated with precautionary behavior. Older people readily showed a heightened tendency toward precautionary behavior than young persons. Females had higher likelihood of exhibiting precautionary behavior compared to males. In the area of mediation, risk perception aided the relationship between COVID-19 Knowledge and Precautionary behavior. In other words, knowledge influenced precautionary behavior through the perception of risk. The test for moderation indicated that gender (in this case, being female) was important as a precautionary index in risk perception than being male. Specifically, our results show that gender moderated the indirect path from COVID-19 Knowledge to precautionary behavior. It was also noted that awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies on COVID-19 related activities may be particularly important for males than females. Drawing from the health belief model, we recommend that COVID-19 awareness campaigns should target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors.This study relatively utilized a limited number of participants considering the population of the country; studies utilizing larger sample sizes are suggested. The use of an online web survey data collection approach in our study may have resulted in underrepresentation of the unprivileged and the uneducated. The implication is that the views of that section of the society were left out of the study. This raises the issue of coverage in addition to other methodological concerns associated with non-probability sampling and these could pose problems of generalization. Thus, our findings should be treated with caution without considering these as representative of adequately sampled population with optimal distribution across commonly described socioeconomic strata. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary behavior among Nigerians. This data could be used as a baseline to explore differences with samples made up of persons without access to the Internet.The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

This disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in China in December 2019. Following that, the virus spread globally causing epidemics in almost every country. As with other infectious diseases, an effective vaccine would be the best weapon to slow the spread of the virus but this is not yet available. According to the WHO, there are currently 10 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation while 126 others are in pre-clinical phases (WHO, 2020b) . Until a vaccine is proven effective, produced, and distributed, interventions to reduce transmission focus on social and physical distancing, hand hygiene, using masks, and other personal protective equipment. There is no SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral treatment, so the management of COVID-19 cases focuses mainly on treating symptoms. However, several therapeutics are currently being tested through the WHO's ""Solidarity"" trial and other trials including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir, and lopinavir + ritonavir + interferon-beta (Brown and Mccullough, 2020) .Passive immune therapy has been employed in the treatment of several infectious diseases including COVID-19. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of convalescent plasma to treat critically ill patients (Tanne, 2020) . Among 25 patients who received this treatment, 76% showed clinical improvement and none showed adverse events (Salazar et al., 2020) . A critically ill obstetrics patient also improved after receiving convalescent plasma therapy (Anderson et al., 2020) . Two patients in South Korea who received convalescent plasma improved (Ahn et al., 2020) . In a case series of eight patients from Iran, authors reported improved respiratory status and total recovery among seven of the patients (Adeli et al., 2020) . Similarly, several reports from China cited improvement upon receiving convalescent plasma (Duan et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) .Egypt, like almost any other country, reported cases and deaths of COVID-19. The first case was reported on 6 March 2020 and as of 15 June 2020. Egypt had more than 42,000 cases and 1,672 deaths (3.6% case fatality rate). Studying the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy is ongoing. To this end, we tested plasma from convalescent donors for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also compared various protocols for testing neutralizing antibodies.RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent adults (n = 227) who have been symptom-free for at least 2 weeks donated plasma as part of routine blood and blood products donation programs at the Military Medical Academy, Ain Shams University Hospitals, Egypt. Three human serum samples, collected during the flu season 2018-2019, were used as a negative control. Positive sera from mice immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were used as positive controls in microneutralization (MN) and plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Research Center. Plasma was processed for testing at the same day of receipt in the lab. All samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min and stored at −20°C before testing.For the titration of the different tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of human coronavirus 2019 (hCoV-19)/Egypt/ NRC-03/2020 (hCoV-19_NRC-03, Accession Number in GSAID database: EPI_ISL_430820), plaque infectivity assay was carried out. Briefly, the 200, 100, and 50 TCID50/ml of hCoV-19_ NRC-03 were serially diluted 10-fold in FBS-free media then 100 μl of each dilution was mixed with 200 μl of infection medium and used to inoculate 80-90% confluent Vero E6 cells into one well of a 6-well plate. A control well was included in the plate that was inoculated with 300 μl of serum free medium. The plate was incubated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 for 1 h to allow virus adsorption and rocked every l5 min to ensure homogenous exposure of the cells to infection and avoid drying of cells. After 1 h, 3 ml of the over layer medium were added, and the plate was agitated to allow homogenous mixing of the virus inoculum through the over layer. To allow the solidification of the agarose component of the over layer medium, the plate was left at room temperature for about 10 min then further incubated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . After 72 h, 1 ml of fixation solution was added to each well for 1 h for cell fixation and virus inactivation. The fixer was later discarded, and the plate wells were flushed with water and dried. For visualization of the plaques, 1 ml of the staining solution (0.1% crystal violet) was added to each well for 5 min, the dye was discarded, and the plate wells were rinsed with water and dried. Viral plaques were visualized as clear unstained spots (due to viral infection) in a violet (stained cells) background. The virus titer was calculated through the following equation:Plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml = Number of plaques × inoculated volume of the virus × virus dilution ×10.The MN is conducted as described previously using Vero-E6 cell monolayers (Perera et al., 2013) . Briefly, serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated plasma starting with a dilution of 1:10 were mixed with equal volumes of 200, 100, and 50 TCID50/ml of hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, 35 μl of the virus-plasma mixture was added in duplicate to Vero-E6 cell monolayers in 96-well microtiter plates. After 1 h of adsorption, the inoculums were aspirated. The plates were then incubated for 3 more days at 37°C in 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. A virus back-titration was performed without immune serum to assess input virus dose. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was read at 3 days post infection. The highest serum dilution that completely protected the cells from CPE was recorded as the neutralizing antibody titer.Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 12-well culture plates (10 5 cells/ ml) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Previously titrated hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate was diluted to the optimal virus dilution that gave countable plaques (10 −2 ) and mixed with the heat-inactivated plasma. The virusplasma mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37°C before being added to cells. Growth medium was removed from the 12-well cell culture plates, and virus-sera mixtures were added to cells. After 1 h contact time for virus adsorption, 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% agarose, 1% antibiotic antimycotic mixture, and 4% bovine serum albumin were added to the cell monolayer. The plates were left to solidify and incubated at 37°C until the formation of viral plaques (3 days). Formalin (10%) was added to each well for 1 h and the overlayer removed. Fixed cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in distilled water. Untreated virus was included in each plate as control. Plaques were counted and the dilution of sera that gave 50% inhibition was counted. The neutralization titer (PRNT50) of the test plasma sample is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of plasma that reduces 50% of counted plaques compared with the untreated virus.Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 in plasma samples were tested using iFlash 1800 (YHLO Biotech, Shenzhen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. N and S antigens were coated on magnetic beads, and 200 μl of plasma were added undiluted. After antigen-antibody binding, anti-human IgG was added.Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare titers. Spearman's rho coefficient was used to assess correlation between titers. Statistical significance was determined at values of p ≤ 0.05. IBM SPSS Statistics software version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States) was used. Figure 1 shows the testing scheme followed in this study. We initially investigated potential assays to test the sera to determine antibody levels and suitability for use as convalescent plasma therapy in comparison to PRNT which is considered the golden standard for measuring neutralizing antibody titers. The first set of 40 plasma samples were tested by PRNT, chemiluminescence, and MN using 200, 100, and 50 TCID50/ml virus dilutions. To translate the applied TCID50/ml titers into PFU/ml, the three applied TCID50/ml were titrated using plaque infectivity assay ( Table 1 ). The geometric mean titers (GMTs) and titer ranges are shown in Table 1 . GMTs for the MN assay ranged between 30.3 and 59.6 increasing as the virus concentration decreased. The GMT for PRNT was 38.0 falling between the GMTs calculated for the 100 and 50 TCID50/ml MN GMTs. The GMT calculated for the chemiluminescence assay was 9.1. The titers for all neutralizing assays were 5-640 while that for chemiluminescence was 0.1-135. The distribution of titers generated by the neutralizing assays is shown in Figure 2 . The 50 TCID50/ ml MN assay provided higher proportions of sera as having higher titers than measured by the other assays. All negative and positive sera controls yielded the expected result in all assays.Measured titers were compared as ordinal variables using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the resulting p values are shown in Table 2 . Titers significantly differed between the Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org three different dilutions used for MN assays. Results from the PRNT assay were significantly different than the 200 and 50 TCID50/ml MN assays but were not different from the 100 TCID50/ml MN. Titers generated using chemiluminescence differed significantly than all neutralizing assays.Spearman correlation coefficients are shown in Table 3 . There were strong correlations between the three MN assays (rho 0.87-0.95). The PRNT assay had strong correlations with all three MN assays (rho 0.79-0.85). The chemiluminescence assay showed weak correlation with the MN and PRNT assays (rho ≤0.26). Correlation scatterplots are shown in Supplementary Figure 1 .All plasma samples were tested by MN with 100 TCID50/ml. The GMT was 22.4, and the range was 5-640. The distribution of titers is shown in Figure 3 . A third of the tested samples did not have neutralizing antibodies. Around 58% of the samples had antibody titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:80, while around 12% had titers of 1:160 and higher.Several countries reported using convalescent plasma as part of therapeutic intervention against COVID-19 especially for critically ill patients. The efficacy of using this strategy remains uncertain. Although several countries reported some improvement in plasma-treated patients, the evidence remains observational and not corroborated by findings of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). A review article that included five studies among 27 patients noted an overall improvement in outcomes (Rajendran et al., 2020) . A Chinese-based RCT among 103 patients found no significant differences between patients receiving plasma as compared to the control group. However, this study was terminated early and may have not achieved the sample size required to draw final conclusions . Hence, more RCTs are needed to conclude whether plasmapheresis is an effective treatment for COVID-19 or not.Protocols for using convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 are not yet standardized. However, most protocols require that patients should be convalescent for 2-4 weeks prior to donation, that only adults donate, that routine procedures for accepting blood and blood products donations be followed, and that plasma is tested to quantitatively FIGURE 2 | Distribution of titers resulting from various neutralization assays. assess the levels of antibodies (Chen and Xia, 2020; Tiberghien, 2020) . Antibody titer thresholds are also not standardized but a titer of 1:160 of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG is recommended (Chen and Xia, 2020) . The Egyptian public health authorities are testing the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients. Collected plasma was tested for neutralizing antibodies using MN assays with various virus concentrations as well PRNT, which is considered the golden standard for measuring neutralizing antibodies. Although the assays correlated well with each other, differences in titer levels were noted as titers increased when the virus concentration decreased. Results of testing sera with 100 TCID50/ml MN assay did not differ from PRNT results. Hence, we recommend using MN with 100 TCID50/ml for testing plasma as it has comparable results and strong correlation with PRNT and allows high throughput testing.There is a strong correlation between immunoglobulin titers against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies titers (Amanat et al., 2020) . We also compared neutralizing antibody assays to chemiluminescence that assesses IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins. Weak correlation was noted between chemiluminescence and all neutralizing antibody assays, and significant differences in titers were noted. The chemiluminescence assay gave a lower maximum titer and a lower GMT. Hence, although this assay may be sensitive and specific, its accuracy is questionable. We recommend testing plasma for neutralizing antibodies or using assays that have been extensively validated for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy such as the ELISA protocol developed previously (Amanat et al., 2020) .Our data indicate that not all convalescent plasma have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as the third of the tested samples were negative. Furthermore, around 58% had antibody titers between 1:10 and 1:80 that may make the plasma not useful as therapy. Only a small percentage had high antibody titers ≥1:160. A similar study in England revealed that around a quarter of the donors did not have neutralizing antibodies but had relatively higher titers than our study (Harvala et al., 2020) .A main limitation of this study was that information on the donor population was not available, and plasma samples were only provided with blind codes. Therefore, we were not able to correlate the results to gender, age, or the health status of the donors. Clinical data were not accessible to correlate with seroconversion and titers.In conclusion, it is important to test the plasma for the presence of antibodies prior to administration as a therapeutic.

Understanding what constitutes immune protection 60 against SARS-CoV-2 is key to predicting long-term immunity and to inform vaccine design. 61While much emphasis has been placed on the B cell and antibody response, it is not yet clear 62 what type of immune response confers protection to SARS-CoV-2 (Cox and Brokstad, 2020) . 63Several studies suggest that the T cell response may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 64 pathogenesis and reports indicating that patients lacking B cells can recover from SARS-CoV-2 65 infection further highlight the likely importance of T cell immunity (Altmann and Boyton, 2020) ; 66 (Quinti et al., 2020) . Additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that the presence of pre-67 existing, cross-reactive memory T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses may affect 68 4 (PBMC), requiring significant amount of blood. Therefore, whole blood assays could be more 75 advantageous than PBMC-based methods, by significantly reducing blood volume (~ 1 ml), 76 making them more applicable to paediatric populations. Moreover, such assays are rapid, as they 77 don't require cell separation, and preserve the physiologic cellular and soluble environments, 78 mimicking better human blood condition. Here we report a rapid (~ 7 hrs) whole blood-based 79 detection method of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses with simple steps that could be 80 adapted to settings of limited resources. This rapidly applicable assay could represent an easily 81 standardizable tool to assess SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity to monitor T cell 82 responses in vaccine trials, gain insight into what constitutes a protective response, or define the 83 prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responders population wide. 84 7 tuberculosis specific T cells in small volumes of blood (Hanekom et al., 2004) . However, 137 significant modifications have been made, including a reduced incubation time, the usage of a 138 fixation buffer allowing the simultaneous lysis of red blood cells to streamline processing time, 139 leading to faster acquisition of results (Riou et al., 2020) . Here, we adapted this assay to detect 140 SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator peptides (Miltenyi 141 Biotec, Surrey, UK), consisting of 15-mer sequences with 11 amino acid overlap covering the 142 immunodominant parts of the spike (S) protein, and the complete sequence of the nucleocapsid 143 (N) and membrane (M) proteins. All peptides were combined in a single pool and used at a final 144 concentration of 1 µg/ml. The workflow of the assay is presented in Figure 1 Even though RT-PCR is the most specific technique to detect acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 175 positivity rate drops rapidly as soon as 10 days post-symptom onset, particularly in individuals 176 with mild forms of COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020b) . Hence, serology assays 177 provide an important complement to RNA testing to identify individuals who have been 178 sensitized by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, to assess potential SARS-CoV-2 sensitization in participants 179 who did not have a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test performed or tested PCR negative, the presence of 180 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG) was measured 181 and a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay was also performed in all participants. 182While all participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test exhibited in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 183 neutralizing activity and 8/9 (88.8%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG, 184none of the participants who tested negative or did not undergo PCR testing were positive for 185 SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG (Figure 2A ) or displayed robust in vitro anti-SARS-186CoV-2 activity ( Figure 2B) . Overall, these results confirmed that PCR positive participants had 187 been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and mounted an immune response to the virus and suggested 188 that none of the participants who did not have a PCR test performed or tested PCR negative, 189 despite experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, have been SARS-CoV-2 infected. 190While the proposed assay can be performed using a limited antibody panel to identify the 220 frequency of SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, by solely measuring cytokine production, the use 221 of a more extensive antibody panel also permits definition of the phenotypic profile of these cells. 222","South Africa","first author","2020-11-03","11"

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, then a pandemic respectively on January 30 and March 11, 2020 (Balkhair, 2020) . As of September 8, 2020, 27,246,686 cases have been reported worldwide, with a global mortality rate of 3.3% (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020) . In Africa, at the date of September 7, 2020, all the 47 countries of the WHO Afro region were affected with a total of 1,862,609 cumulative cases and 23,053 reported deaths (Coronavirus | WHO | Regional Office for Africa, 2020). It is estimated that if containment measures fail during the first year of the pandemic in WHO Afro region, 83,000-190,000 deaths and 23,000,000-44,000,000 confirmed cases will be reported (Coronavirus | WHO | Regional Office for Africa, 2020 [New WHO estimates: Up to 190 000 people could die of COVID-19 in Africa if not controlled and WHO and Regional Office for Africa [WWW Document], 2020] ).In addition to known health consequences (especially respiratory ones) of this infectious illness on concerned patients (Cevik et al., 2020) , the psychological aspect on families has to be considered (especially in sub-Saharan Africa), due to both isolation and measures linked to corpses' management. Indeed, the fear to loss one family member and/or coping difficulties of grieved families can lead to detrimental psychological effects and have harmful social impact with the potential triggering of violence acts (Breen, 2020; Zhai and Du, 2020) . It's in this wake that in this commentary article we propose some support pathways to these COVID-19 patients' entourage especially in sub-Saharan African settings.In order to conceive this article, we made a concise research on PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online. We used three groups of key-words notably a first group pertaining to the term ""COVID-19"" or its synonyms/derivatives, a second one related to the term ""Families"" or its synonyms/derivatives, and a third one linked to the term ""Grief"" or its synonyms/derivatives.The COVID-19 spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced through coughs, sneezes or talks. SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces up to 9 days depending on the inoculum shed and type of surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020) . Therefore, contamination by coming into contact with an infected surface and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes is a possible way of virus spreading (CDC, 2020). Post-mortem examination of patients with COVID-19 has reported the presence of the virus in various samples, including respiratory track samples. In a series of 10 autopsy performed on deaths from COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in the respiratory tracts of all patients. Polymerase chain reaction testing was positive in pleural effusion (Schaller et al., 2020) . Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 in two patients who died in Oklahoma (United States) (Barton et al., 2020) . Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a virus close to SARS-CoV-2, have been detected in nasal secretions of human corpses (Mahallawi, 2018) . The possibility of surface contact transmission and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in post-mortem samples suggest a possible post-mortem infectiousness of COVID-19. This infection risk may concern all the aspect of corpse or sample manipulation including reconnaissance of the body, transportation, autopsy, sanitization of the autopsy rooms, dressing, exposure, burial/cremation, custody and analysis of the samples. This infectious risk from contact with dead people has been shown for other viral infections like Ebola. Indeed touching the corpse of deceased patients double the risk of infection (risk ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2) among household members (Vetter et al., 2016) . However, dead bodies are generally not infectious, apart from hemorrhagic fevers and cholera cases. When handled improperly during an autopsy, lungs of patients with pandemic influenza are also infectious. Data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dead bodies of confirmed or suspected cases are scarce, and to date there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from exposure to bodies of persons who died from COVID-19 (WHO, 2020).Multiple international guidelines and recommendations have been issued regarding the safe management of dead bodies with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A recent systematic review identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on handling suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 corpses throughout the different phases (Yaacoub et al., 2020) . Furthermore, some African governments have produced local recommendation for safe handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. For example, on 23 April 2020, the Cameroonian prime minister has instructed the minister of territorial administration to make sure that deceased patients from COVID-19 are buried in the city were the death occurs. Following the safety recommendations, corpses are therefore collected from hospitals immediately after death by local council staff and are handled and buried in a specified area in the presence of few or no family member.The COVID-19 pandemic has a huge burden on patients' families in several ways, either when these patients are alive or after death (Breen, 2020; Zhai and Du, 2020) . These consequences on patients' entourage are mainly psychological and social (Goveas and Shear, 2020; Mortazavi et al., 2020) , and are partly linked to cultural habits, especially among sub-Saharan African populations (Ekore and Lanre-Abass, 2016; Gysels et al., 2011) .Patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and especially hospitalized ones, experience poor quality deaths (also named ""bad deaths"") (Carr et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020) . Poor quality deaths are characterized by physical discomfort, respiratory difficulties, social isolation, and psychological distress, treatments without respect or dignity, and even unwanted medical interventions (Krikorian et al., 2020; Meier et al., 2016) . All these detrimental events occurring before death have a negative impact on bereaved families which might lead to harmful social consequences (McKay et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020) . Since the SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the international recommendations proscribe any contact of COVID-19 hospitalized (and isolated) patients with their friends, relatives, and families (Yaacoub et al., 2020) . This is negatively undergone by patients but also by their loved ones who are unable to assist their isolated relatives and more painfully say one's farewells to them (Carr et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) . These situations can generate negative psychological outcomes among families such as stress, anxiety, and depression (Goveas and Shear, 2020; Mortazavi et al., 2020) , but also anger especially in context where families (particularly low-literacy ones) do not understand or accept all the measures related to virus spread's prevention (Eisma et al., 2020; Manguvo and Mafuvadze, 2015) . The psychological consequences of COVID-19 on patients' families are worsened at the time of the death of these patients.The management of COVID-19 deceased patients tends to accentuate the families' detrimental psychological outcomes which started when their infected relatives were living and hospitalized/isolated. Indeed, according to guidelines, access to COVID-19 dead bodies is not possible for relatives, which thereby render the grief more stressing and difficult, and contribute to complicated grief (CG) (Carr et al., 2020; Eisma et al., 2020) . In this context, bereaved individuals might face sorrow, anxious ruminations, intrusive thoughts of the deceased person and depressive mood (Breen, 2020; Morris et al., 2020) . This is all the more important considering the importance of funerals in African (and specifically sub-Saharan African) cultures, and the fact that in these cultures, in part due to stigma, individuals are less likely to express their psychological distress (Ekore and Lanre-Abass, 2016; Manguvo and Mafuvadze, 2015) . The poor quality death of COVID-19 patients associated to the unfeasibility for their families to make traditional procedures of funerals and interments worsen the negative impact on mental health but also favor harmful social consequences (Ekore and Lanre-Abass, 2016; Gysels et al., 2011; Manguvo and Mafuvadze, 2015) . For instance, in some sub-Saharan African countries, the overall incomprehension of the management procedures of dead COVID-19 infected bodies associated to the difficulty to cope the loss of their relatives, lead to violence acts towards healthcare workers. Consequently, this could be highly deleterious for health systems since the COVID-19 pandemic (as previous outbreak) also have negative psychological consequences on health professionals in the first line, especially in areas where these systems are overwhelmed by the patient flux (Cai et al., 2020; Rosenbaum, 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) . All this could possibly decrease the effective response of healthcare systems facing this pandemic.To alleviate the issue of psychological impact of COVID-19 on concerned families, some care interventions might be helpful especially in sub-Saharan African settings. For instance, while COVID-19 patients are alive and isolated, regular and regulated audio/video calls can give the opportunity to families to assist and/or say ""good bye"" to their loved ones (Morris et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) . The connection with the entourage could also be maintained by the daily exchange of pictures with the help of the health care teams and the respect of confidentiality rules. One other measure before death can be the preparation (through communicationbased tools) of patients/families for a likely death (especially concerning patients in critical care units) in order to ensure an anticipatory grief work (Breen, 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) . When it seems that relatives of a COVID-19 dead patient do not accept the loss and that this loss appears ambiguous for them, healthcare workers can respectfully share pictures of the patients in order to confirm death (National Cancer Institute, 2002 [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board, 2002] ; Wang et al., 2017) .As aforementioned, the current context of pandemic can be faced with difficulties for families since they can't optimally assist their relative, before and after death. The ways to mitigate the grief's difficulties are virtual memorial services and celebrations. Indeed, families can be accompanied by professionals and/or volunteers in order to learn the use of streaming services and thus try to give memorial celebrations according to their cultures, their religions and the wishes of their deceased loved ones (Morris et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) . The establishment of specialized and trained teams regarding the management of bodies during inhumation ceremonies in villages (with the respect of preventive measures) can be another proposal to improve mourning conditions. These specialized teams could work together with families in order to ensure as much as possible the memorials' conditions aimed by bereaved families. In addition to all that, it appears necessary to provide systematic and tailored psychological support to bereaved persons. Assistance to grieved individuals could be provided by mental health professionals (individual and collective psychological support) but also previously bereaved persons (Carr et al., 2020; Eisma et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020) . Accredited people supporting bereaved families could help by boosting grieving individuals to communicate on their psychological pain, through social communication tools when face-to-face interviews are not practicable (Morris et al., 2020) . While talking of grief in remote sub-Saharan African rural areas, in a context where families didn't say goodbye to their dead COVID-19 relatives, another issue to consider is the unearthing of cadavers. To prevent it, it might be helpful to ask for a written commitment from families and to collaborate with local traditional authorities. Indeed, these authorities could contribute to optimal interment conditions by population sensitization. The proposals we stated here for the assistance and accompaniment of COVID-19 patients' families before and after death are summarized in Table 1 .For healthcare actors directly facing the current pandemic and possibly called to make death announcement, security measures seem needed to lessen any social vindictive violence. For these health professionals frequently coping death, specific psychological supports could also be of interest in order to allow them to effectively continue to help in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.These psychological interventions could be individual or collective (through group discussions) (Cai et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2020) .Psychological outcomes of COVID-19 deaths are issues to consider especially in sub-Saharan African settings. Tailored assistance to these patients, their families and healthcare workers implicated in their management, before and after death, could participate in the prevention of complicated grief and also social violence in reaction to grief. In this paper we tried to contribute to the establishment of such assistance, by providing proposals notably including transparent and adapted communication on disease prognosis, psychological intervention(s) and synergistic work with local authorities.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Francky Teddy Endomba https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7023 -1953 Table 1 .

It rapidly spread to other provinces in China and to the rest of the world. Registered cases continue to increase rapidly in early 2020, with a total of 7,145,539 COVID-19 cases reported worldwide, including 408,025 deaths according to the World Health Organization, report published on 10 June 2020 [1] . On March 17, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic [3] . Coronavirus is an infectious virus, which can be transmitted from human to human. The virus can be transmitted from an infected person to other people, through direct contact with handshakes and by touching surfaces contaminated with the disease, and then it affects parts of the body such as the eyes, nose and mouth. The virus is likely to cause more serious respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Coronavirus is thought to be more dangerous than SARS because it takes longer for the symptoms to appear. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but research is still underway. However, there are recommendations like social distancing for infection prevention, and temporary control of patients infected with COVID-19 in hospitals and quarantine areas [5] .The phenomenon of coronavirus spread varies from age group to age group. This difference is clear between these categories where we note that the group between the ages of 25 and 65 is most vulnerable to Coronavirus infection compared to the rest of the age groups. This age group is as active as it uses the means of transport to go to the workplaces and go to the markets and all those places mentioned the places of spread of the virus with distinction. This group is also the most important factor in the transmission of the virus to the rest of the age group (under 25 years of age and over 65 years of age) because they are living with them in the same family setting. As for the age group over 65 years, they are considered the most affected by the spread of the virus as they are low immunity and suffers from other chronic diseases. According to available statistics from the Moroccan Ministry of Health, the age group under the age of 25 is least affected by the spread of the virus [2] .There are several mathematical modelling studies have been developed to simulate, analyse and understand the dynamics of the Coronavirus [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . For example, Xia et al. [6] analysed the Transmission of Middle East Respirator Syndrome Corona Virus, in the Republic of Korea. Khajji et al. [7] study in this work a discrete mathematical model that describes, the dynamics of transmission of the Coronavirus between humans, on the one hand, and animals, on the other hand, in a region or in different regions. Kim et al. [9] formulated a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. They estimated the basic reproduction number using the estimates of the transmission rates in the first two periods. Tahir et al. [10] used a nonlinear mathematical model to study the dynamics of the transmission of MERS-CoV in human population through an agent known as camel. Drosten et al. [11] provided a description the fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses. Generally use compartment model to describe the spread of infectious disease (susceptible, infected, or removed). In 1927, Azhar et al. [12] were the first researchers on mathematical epidemiology to suggest the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that describes the rapid explosion of an infectious disease for a short time. After him, the research continued on the same subject, for example, in 2009, Yu et al. [13] studied a global stability of twogroup SIR model with random perturbation. In 2010, Pathak et al. [14] analysed the right dynamics of a SIR epidemic model. In 2012, Ji et al. [15] studied the behaviour of a SIR epidemic model with stochastic perturbation. In 2016, Laaroussi et al. [16] a SIR spatiotemporal epidemic model is formulated as a system of parabolic partial differential equations with no-flux boundary conditions. In this study, we divided infected people with Coved-19 disease into three types of infection because the patients go through steps, which is the step of infection, the step of the symptoms and the step of the complications. The patient can move on to the recovery step immediately, after one of the previous steps. In this work, we propose a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of people who have the COVID-19. Also, we propose an optimal strategy for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19, by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places for that and using masks to cover the sensitive body parts.In our model the population is divided into three types of age groups. ( j = 1 ) the first age group from 0 to 25 years, ( j = 2 ) the second group from 25 to 65 years and ( j = 3 ) the third age group over 65 years of age, and all age groups are divided into five com-partments. The susceptible individuals ( S j ), the infected population without symptoms ( I j w ), the infected population with symptoms ( I j ), the infected population with complications ( C j ) and the recovered individuals ( R j ). In order to decrease the number of infected population, we applied the theory of optimal control for our proposed model. The theory of optimal control, and the analysis of dynamic systems are fielding current research, that continues to arouse the interest of scientists. The aim of this theory is to model processes that evolve over time and to study their behaviours. This study makes it possible, among other things, to predict the behaviour of the system and to control it in order to get the desired results. In the theory the control of dynamic systems, there are two kinds of mathematical dynamic systems: the discrete-time models described by difference equations (see [17] [18] [19] [20] ) and the continuous-time models described by differential equations. The continuous-time models have been widely investigated in many articles (for example, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ).The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we explained the Statistical data on the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 on Moroccan territory. In Section 3 , we present our mathematical model that describes the dynamics of people who have the (COVID-19) and we give some results concerning the positivity, the boundedness and existence of solutions. In Section 4 , we present the optimal control problem for the proposed model. In Section 5 , we give some results concerning the existence of the optimal controls and the characterization of these optimal controls using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical simulations through Matlab software are given in Section 6 . Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7 .Since the announcement of the discovery the first case of coronavirus on 2 march 2020, for a person came from the Italian homeland, until 2 June 2020, the total number of infections has reached 7866 cases, including 1250 cases still under treatment and 6410 cases completely cured of the disease and 206 cases died [1, 2, 4 ] .An upward trend is noted with an average daily increase of 3% since 04/29/2020 (see Fig. 1 ) [2] . This situation is mainly due to the detection of the family and (especially) professional environment. All age groups are affected. About 9.02% of cases were over the age of 65, while children under the age of 15 accounted for only 9.88% and about 67.77% of cases where the aged between 25 and 65 (see Fig. 2 ) [2] .Over time, patients were rejuvenated. The average age rose from 50.15 years (+/ −18.97) for cases detected in March, at 37.25 years of age (+/ −18.03) in April. The trend average age of active cases is shown in Fig. 3 : it rises from 55 years to the week of 12 (from 16/03/2020), and at 34.5 years, at week 19 (04/05/2020) (see Fig. 3 ) [2] .At admission, 84.50% of COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic or had mild clinical symptoms. 12.66% had moderate clinical symptoms, while 2.84% were admitted in a critical condition. In total, nearly 4.70% of hospitalizations required for admission to resuscitation. More than 90% of these admissions are over the age of 40 ( Fig. 4 ) [2] . We consider a mathematical model S j I j w I j C j R j that describes the dynamics of a population having COVID-19 disease. Within a certain age group taking into account the fact that all age groups can transmit the infection to all other groups taking into account the specificity of each age group. The following illustration will illustrate COVID-19 disease in the compartments. These trends will be represented by vector arrows in Fig. 5 .The susceptible people subjected to COVID-19 ' S j ' is referring to people who are likely to have (COVID-19) disease. This compartment is increased by the recruitment rate denoted j 1 . It is decreased by a natural mortality rate μ j . Also It is decreased by an effective contact with I j w at rate β j 1 (the rate of patients who become infected people with COVID-19 due to contact with the infected people who do not show symptoms) and with ' I j ' at rate β j 2 (the rate of patients who become infected with COVID-19 due to contact with the infected people with symptoms).The people infected without symptoms The compartment ' I j w ' refers infected people with COVID-19 without symptoms. It is increased by the incidence rate of immigrants and carriers of the disease without symptoms denoted j 2 , and also this compartment is increased by β j 1 and β j 2 . The compartment ' I j w ' decreased by natural mortality rate μ j and by α j 1 which represent a rate of the infected people without symptoms. Also it is decreased by γ j 1 the rate of the infected people without symptoms and who become recovered.The infected people with symptoms The compartment ' I j ' refers infected people with symptoms with COVID-19 disease. It is increased by the incidence rate of immigrants and carriers people Infected with symptoms denoted Also it is increased by α j 1 . This compartment of ' I j ' is decreased by natural mortality rate μ j and α j 2 that represent the rate of the people infected with symptoms who have become infected with complications. Also it is decreased by γ j 2 that represent the rate of the people infected with symptoms who have become the recovered individual population.The compartment ' C j ' refers to people infected with complications with COVID-19 disease. It is increased by α j 2 . The compartment ' C j ' is decreased by natural mortality rate μ j and mortality rate due to COVID-19 disease denoted δ j . Also it is decreased by the rate of the people infected with complications who have become the recovered individual population denoted γ j 3 .The compartment ' R j ' refers to recovered individuals. It is increasing by γ j 3 , γ j 2 and γ j 1 and decreasing by natural mortality rate μ j .By adding the rates at which the steps of (COVID-19) disease enters the compartment and also by subtracting the rates at which people leave compartment, we obtain a differential equations for the rate at which patients change in each compartmeent during separate times. Therefore, we present the (COVID-19) disease model with the following system of differential equations:The both sides in the last inequality are multiplied byTo show the positivity of I k (t) and I jwe have two cases the first caseWe conclude that I n w (t) ≥ 0 and I n (t) ≥ 0 . Therefore we show the positivity of I k (t) and I jSimilarly we can prove thatProof. By adding all equations in system (1) , one has dN j dtThen all possible solutions of the system (1) enter the set j . It inplies that j is a positively invariant set for the system (1) .j is a positively invariant set.Theorem 3. The system (1) with the initial condition (1) can be rewritten in the following form:The function B( X j ) satisfaisies:Thus is follows that the function ϕ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous, and the restriction onconclude that a solution of the system exists [26] .So far, there is no treatment or vaccination for COVID-19. For this reason, scientists insist on two strategies for combating this disease and to reduce the risk of infection with this virus. First, avoiding exposure to this virus by following a prevention protocol: covering the mouth and nose, washing the hands with water and soap frequently, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, objects and goods. Second, putting people in quarantine areas and creating special protection programs for them especially those suffering from immunodeciency to reduce the risk of infection.Our objective in this proposed control strategy is to minimize the number of the infected people without symptoms ( I j w ); the Infected people with symptoms ( I j ) and the Infected people with complications ( C j ).So, in the model (1) ,we include control u j which represents the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19, by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places for that. The control v j which represents state efforts to encourage people to use masks to cover sensitive parts of the body. Thus, the controlled mathematical system is given by the following system of differential equations:Then, the objective is to compare the costs of these interventions and their effectiveness in the fight against COVID-19. To do this, we need to investigate the optimal level of effort s that would be needed to control the disease. For this, we use the objective function :where the parameters E j > 0 and F j > 0 , for all j ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 } are the cost coefficients at time t, T is the final time. In other words, weseek the optimal controls u j * and v j * such that :where U ad is the set of admissible control defined byWe first show the existence of solutions of the system (2) , After that, we will prove the existence of the optimal control [27] .Theorem 4. Subject to the controls system (2) with initial conditions. There exist the optimal controls u j * , v j * such thatif the following conditions are met:(1) The set of controls and corresponding state variables is nonempty.(2) The control set U ad is convex and closed.(3) The right-hand side of the state system is bounded by a linear function in the state and control variables.(4) The integrand,of the objective functional is convex on U ad and there exist constants κ 1 and κ 2 such thatProof. The existence of the optimal control can be obtained using a result by Fleming and Rishel [27] , checking the following steps:Step 1: It follows that the set of controls and corresponding state variables is nonempty. In Diprima and Elementary [28] . To prove that the set of controls and the corresponding state variables is nonempty, we will use a simplified version of an existence result [28] .X 5 from the right-hand side of equations of the system (2) . Let u and v for some constants and since all parameters are constants and X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 are continuous, then F S , F I w , F I , F C and F R are also continuous. Additionally, the partial derivatives, 5 are all continuous. Therefore, there exists a unique solution (S j , I j w , I j , C j , R j ) that satisfies the initial conditions.Hence, the set of controls and the corresponding state variables is nonempty and the condition is satisfied.Step 2: U ad is convex and closed by definition.Take any controls (u jStep 3: All the right hand sides of equations of system (2) are continuous, bounded above by a sum of bounded control and state, and can be written as a linear function of u and v with coefficients depending on time and state.From the system of differential Eq. (2) .Therefore, all solutions of the model (2) are bounded.So, there exist positive constants Z 1 ,We considerSo, we can rewrite system (2) in matrix form as :It gives a linear function of control vector and state variable vector.Therefore, we can writeHence, we see the right-hand side is bounded by a sum of state and control vectors. Therefore, condition 3 is satisfied.Step 4:is clearly convex in U ad . It rests to show that there exist constants κ 1 > 0 , κ 2 > 0 such thatThe state variables being bounded, letThen from Fleming and Rishel [27] we conclude that there exists an optimal control.In order to derive the necessary condition for the optimal control, we apply pontryagin's maximum principle [29] .The idea is introducing the adjoint function to attach the system of differential equations to the objective functional resulting in the formation of a function called the Hamiltonian. This principle converts into a problem of minizing Hamiltonian H j (t) at time t defined by:where f k is the right side of the system of differential Eq. (2) of the k th state variable at time t.Theorem 5. Given the optimal controls u * j , v * j and the solutions S * j , I * j w , I * j , C * j and R * j of the corresponding state system (2) there exists adjoint variables λ j 1 , λ j 2 , λ j 3 , λ j 4 and λ j 5 satisfying :With the tranversality conditions at time T : λ j 1 (T ) = 0 ; λ j 2 (T ) = 1 ; λ j 3 (T ) = 1 ; λ j 4 (T ) = 1 ; λ j 5 (T ) = 0 Furthermore, for t ∈ [0 , T ] , the optimal controls u j * and v j * are given by:Proof. The hamiltonian at time t is given by: with the tranversality conditions at time T : λ j, the optimal controls u j * and v j * can be solved from the optimality condition:N j F j by the bounds in U ad of the controls, it easy to obtain u j * and v j * in the form (8), (9) .In this formulation, there were initial conditions for the state variables and terminal conditions for the adjoints. That is, the optimality system is a two-point boundary value problem with separated boundary conditions at times step t = 0 and t = T . We solve the optimality system by an iterative method with forward solving of the state system followed by backward solving of the adjoint system. We start with an initial guess for the controls at the first iteration and then before the next iteration we update the controls by using the characterization. We continue until convergence of successive iterates is achieved. A code is written and compiled in Matlab using the following data ( Tables 1-3 ).In this section. We analyse numerically the effects of controls that are, the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19, by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places for that and using masks to cover the sensitive body parts. Different Table 2 The description of the parameters used for the definition of discrete time systems of age group between 25 and 65 years. simulations can be carried out using various values of parameters. We use the parameters values ( Tables 1-3 ) .We begin by presenting, in Fig. 6 -8 the simulations concerning the evolution of the number of the infected people of all age groups without control functions system (1) .We observe that the number of infected people without symptoms for all age groups ( Fig. 6 ). The number of infected people with symptoms for all age groups ( Fig. 7 ) and the number of infected people with complications for all age groups ( Fig. 8 ) all increase. This is due to the absence the application of any strategy, to face up the spread of the COVID-19. Table 3 The description of the parameters used for the definition of discrete time systems of age group over the 65 years. The proposed control strategy in this work helps to achieve several objectives: decreasing the number of people having COVID-19, infected without symptoms, infected with symptoms and infected with complications in all age groups.In this Scenario we use the masks to cover the sensitive parts of the body for all age groups. To lower the effect of bad contact with people infected with COVID-19 and to keep them as far as possible from the disease. After applying this strategic: Through Figs. 6 In this Scenario with temporary control of patients infected with in hospitals and quarantine areas, we apply in order to reduce the number of infected people. After applying this strategic: Through Figs. 6 and 12 notes that the number of asymptomatic infected people under the age of 25 decrease from 404,200 In this Scenario, we use two optimal controls U j and V j . We combine the two previous strategies, to achieve better results. That represent respectively the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19, by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places for that and using masks to cover the sensitive body parts. After applying this strategic, we observed : Through This table ( Table 4 ) shows the different numbers of the people infected with COVID-19 in different age groups obtained after the use of the three strategies A, B and C. We note that using Scenario C, we get impressive results. Since the announcement of the discovery of the first case of coronavirus in Morocco, on 2 March 2020, for a person came from the Italian homeland [2] . Immediately thereafter, it was quick to close borders, suspend travel with all countries. Suspend studies in all educational institutions, and impose a state of health emergency. In addition to other measures such as the Events of the Corona Solidarity Fund, and establish Field Hospitals and adopt the health protocol imposed by the World Health Organization [1] . Represented by imposing the wearing of masks on citizens and by imposing a quarantine on everyone, with the exception of the active category which is authorized, to move towards workplaces and markets. And temporary control of patients infected with in hospitals and quarantine areas. In the following, we examine the comparison of some results announced to the Moroccan Ministry of Health and the results obtained in this study at the end of the implementation of Scenario C.According to the Moroccan Ministry of Health [2] , all age groups are affected. About 9.02% of cases were over the age of 65, while people under the age of 25 accounted for only 23 .21% and about 67.77% of cases where the aged between 25 and 65 ( Fig. 2 ) . According to our study, we obtained the following results. About 6.2% of cases were over the age of 65, while people under the age of 25 accounted for 23.6% and about 70.2% of cases where the aged between 25 and 65 ( Table 5 ) . Clinical picture on admission of cases According to the Moroccan Ministry of Health [2] , At admission, 97.16% of COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic or had moderate clinical symptoms, while 2.84% were admitted in a critical condition. According to our study, we obtained the following results. About 96.5% of COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic or had moderate clinical symptoms, while 3.5% of cases in critical condition ( Table 6 ) .We note that there is a great convergence between the results obtained in this study and the results announced by the Moroccan Ministry of Health [2] .In this research, a mathematical epidemic model for all age groups human population of the COVID-19 disease was studied. After introducing the paper and discussing related literature. We formed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of all age groups population who have the new symptom-free Coronavirus. In order to minimize the number of infected people without symptoms, infected people with symptoms and infected people with complications. We have also introduced two controls that, respectively, represent the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places for that and using masks to cover the sensitive body parts. We applied the results of the control theory and were able to obtain the characterizations of the optimal controls. Finally, we have a numerical solution obtained from the mathematical model by the use of the maximum principle of Pontryagin to characterize optimal controls. The system of optimality is solved by an iterative method. This study allowed us to integrate many scenarios to see the impact each of these controls on the maximum. The numerical precision of the system with differential equations as well as numerical simulations allowed us to compare and see the difference between each Scenario in a concrete way. Referring to Table 4 , the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Scenario and we note that Scenario C performs better than Scenario B and A. In addition we note that there is a great convergence between the results obtained in this study and the results announced by the Moroccan Ministry of Health.Given the importance of tracking contacts people infected with covid-19, we will add a special compartment for this category in future research.No data were used to support this study.","Morocco","abstract","2020-11-04","11"

It is currently well known that both viruses belong to the same genus of beta coronaviruses and share multiple similarities including the same ACE2 receptor to enter the target cells, as well as immune cross reactivity [5] . Furthermore, SARS CoV-2-induced lymphopenia was recently described as an effective and reliable indicator of the severity and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients [6] . Thus, if we may find a possible hypothesis to explain the lymphopenia induced by SARS CoV, it might also help us to explore a potential treatment for SARS CoV-2.It was previously suggested that SARS CoV induced lymphopenia is likely to be caused by indirect mechanisms such as an increase in cortisol levels that occurred as part of the body stress response to this severe respiratory viral infection or by an iatrogenic effect of glucocorticoids used to manage those patients. Moreover, cortisol levels were demonstrated to be significantly higher in lymphopenic patients than in nonlymphopenic patients and to be significantly negatively correlated with monocytes and suppressor CD8 + cells, B lymphocytes and helper CD4 + cells in SARS CoV patients [4, 7] .Interestingly, the adrenal gland was previously shown to express ACE2 receptors and SARS CoV-related inflammation of various organs, including the adrenal gland, has also been reported. Similarly, SARS CoV has been demonstrated to cause architectural disruption and lymphocyte depletion in the spleen and lymph nodes despite no or trace ACE2 expression in examined human tissue specimens, and SARS CoV has also been associated with adrenal glands necrosis and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes [8, 9] . Relying on the previous mechanisms related to SARS CoV, to be added to our current knowledge that COVID-19 pathogenesis has been shown to be associated with excessive chemokines release; a cytokine storm that has been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, including some chemokines attracting lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells to infected tissues [10, 11] . We suggest that SARS CoV-2, like SARS CoV may cause, both directly and indirectly, progressive inflammation in different body organs and some J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of these released chemokines, and perhaps others yet to be discovered, are well known to attract lymphocytes to those organs causing lymphopenia encountered with COVID-19.Interestingly, an inadequate Th1-biased T-cell response was suggested to contribute to the immunopathology of SARS-CoV infection [12] and recently, patients complaining from severe COVID-19 outcome have been shown to exhibit a maladapted immune response profile as well as early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories [13] . Similarly, after a preprint of this manuscript was published [14] , reports of multisystem COVID-19 hyperinflammatory conditions have been released [15, 16] and we claim that their pathogenesis is consistent with this hypothesis. More importantly, we suggest that this lymphopenia, if occurred, should be considered a symbol for distraction of lymphocytes to multiple organs instead of being mainly directed to the lungs, the main target organ of COVID-19 and SARS CoV-2-induced lymphopenia has been previously liked with disease severity and prognosis [17] . Interestingly, it might also be considered another reflection of the previously described disturbance of the homeostasis of the interferons' immune response in COVID-19 patients [11, [18] [19] [20] .Notably, hydroxychloroquine has been previously reported to cause lymphopenia and increase human immunodeficiency virus, viral load which was suggested to be only explained by a biological effect of the drug [21] and a potential likewise relationship with SARS CoV-2 induced lymphopenia should be carefully and thoroughly investigated as it might reason for its inefficacy [22] , higher mortality rate in its high dose [23] that eventually might have led to its suspension[24] and formal discontinuation on the 4 th of July, 2020 upon a recommendation from the Solidarity Trial's International Steering Committee [25] .Acute inflammation of the adrenal glands increases cortisol secretion, especially early in the COVID-19 clinical course, which further augments lymphopenia and might complete the unfortunate vicious cycle. Moreover, short-duration, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy was not proven effective for early acute respiratory distress syndrome or for severe sepsis. This might be explained by glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression as well as lymphopenia [26] and when combined with mineralocorticoids, they only showed some J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f benefits in some selected critical cases classified with a poor prognosis, and moderate doses of glucocorticoids were suggested to be beneficial only for patients with late acute respiratory distress syndrome [27] . Furthermore, it has been recommended for patients with rheumatic disease on glucocorticoid therapy to use the minimum possible doses of glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection [28] . Thus, we would like to agree with the clinical recommendation against the routine use of glucocorticoids in the management of COVID-19 and to confirm they should be only discussed to be administered on a case by case basis [29] and to dispute with some other contradictory reports and encourage more colleagues to present properly performed clinical data to end any remaining controversy [19] . Consistent with this recommendation, dexamethasone has been recently shown to lower COVID-19 28-day mortality only among patients who were receiving respiratory support [30] . However, a study with some limitations has showed that prednisone or methylprednisolone was associated with a significant reduction in COVID-19 hospital mortality and recommended initiation of clinical trials testing corticosteroids during the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 [31] . Similarly, 40-80 mg/d (0.75-1.5 mg/kg/d) of methylprednisolone for 3 days, tapered to 20 mg/d, with a total treatment period of less than 7 days benefited COVID-19 patients with marked radiologic progression and LDH levels of less than two times the upper limit number and a tailored individualized course was suggested as rescue treatment in more severe or critically ill patients [32] . Moreover, an randomized open-label trial with some limitations showed the use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days over 28 days in patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, yet with no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days or ICU-free days during the first 28 days [33] . On the other hand, a meta-analysis showed that administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [34] . However, important concerns regarding the interpretation of data as well as the limitations of several studies showing potential benefit of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 have been raised and a call to individualize different steroid approaches depending of the host has been repeated [35] and we would like to agree with those concerns. We would also like to suggest trying hydrocortisone sodium succinate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 50 mg i.v./6 h, [36] which has a more rapid onset than those already tried, for selected critical cases of COVID-19, in situations when potential benefits exceeds the risks.Most importantly, based on the suggested pathogenesis of COVID-19 described in this manuscript, we suggest that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g.ibuprofen, might prove beneficial for the early management of COVID-19 trying to ameliorate the suggested inflammatory process leading to lymphopenia and immunosuppression. Theoretically, NSAIDs when used as early as possible during the clinical course of COVID-19 might prevent disease progression or even reverse lymphocytopenia and we suggest it might be added to his newly suggested nitazoxanide/azithromycin protocol for early management of COVID-19 [20] but in a separate arm for nitazoxanide/azithromycin/ibuprofen as well as to add NSAIDs to any other already adopted protocol for early cases of COVID-19 and compare the results against the already used analgesic/antipyretic paracetamol. Interestingly, we have recently provided the first clinical report that has shown this theory to be clinically valid when he has received numerous requests for treatment from Egyptian COVID-19 and both ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium have been shown more superior to the currently used paracetamol not only with regard to its analgesic antipyretic effect but also in significantly improving the lymphocytic count in COVID-19 patients, enhancing their immune response as well as recovery mostly in five days and NSAIDs were the most important component of his illustrated preprinted protocol which is currently under review in a reputed medical journal [37] . We were fully aware that his hypothesis is contradictory to another one that has led to practical avoidance of NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients [38] and we have, sinceMarch 2020, prepared a review article disputing that claim and it's been preprinted, sent to the WHO and recently published [39] . Other researchers have also criticized the theoretical basis upon which ibuprofen was avoided in COVID-19 [40, 41] and the claims against other drugs mentioned with ibuprofen in that contradictory hypothesis are similarly being revoked [42] . Notably, ibuprofen has been previously hypothesized to be hazardous in another medical argument and later on that hypothesis was proven incorrect [43] and recently a clinical study has shown that ibuprofen use was not associated with worse J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clinical outcomes, compared with paracetamol or no antipyretic [44] . Similarly, Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization or complications in Danish individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [45] . Moreover, ibuprofen has been used successfully and safely for decades to alleviate symptoms of naturally acquired common colds [46] and multiple mechanisms that interfered with the viral pathophysiological effects were suggested [47] .Finally, it might be considered a real misfortune that NSAIDs including ibuprofen have been practically avoided to favor the analgesic antipyretic paracetamol with no antiinflammatory effect. It is also probable that a safe short course of inexpensive and effective drugs like ibuprofen and other NSAIDs could have saved lives, but we have ignored them based on a hypothesis to be confirmed by more studies which are highly encouraged.However, we should learn from unintended mistakes and make sure not to be repeated.Funding/Financial disclosure NoneThe author declares no competing interests Funding NoneThe author would like to sincerely thank Dr. Danyelle Townsend, Editor in Chief of Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy for her gentle acceptance to manage this manuscript which has been handled in a highly professional manner after being denied an opportunity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to be peer reviewed for months by other journals.

Governments have started working on new strategies to manage spaces, social distancing, and supplies for medical staff and normal people. Also, the government has forced hospitals and other organizations to apply new infection prevention measures to stop the spreading of COVID-19. The COVID-19 transmission rate is about 2.4 [1] , [2] . However, the transmission rate may vary according to the measurement and policies applied by the governments. As COVID-19 is transmitted through airdrops and close contact, Governments have started applying new rules forcing people to wear face masks. The goal of wearing face masks is to reduce the transmission and spreading rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) among people and in medical care. However, the ability of most of the countries to expand the production of PPE is very limited [3] .Today, COVID-19 is a significant public health and economy issue due to the detrimental effects of the virus on people's quality of life, contributing to acute respiratory infections, mortality and financial crises worldwide [4] . According to [5] , more than six million cases were infected by COVID-19 in more than 180 countries with death-rate of 3%. The COVID-19 spreads easily in crowded environments and close contact.Governments are facing extraordinary challenges and risks to protect people from coronavirus in many countries [6] . As people are forced by laws to wear face masks in public in many countries, Masked face detection is a key to face applications, such as object detection [7] . To fight and win in the battle against COVID-19 pandemic, Governments need guidance and surveillance on people in public areas, especially the crowded to ensure that wearing face masks laws are applied. This could be applied through the integration between surveillance systems and Artificial Intelligence models.The main objective of this research is to detect and locate a medical face mask in an image as illustrated in Figure 1 . In this paper, the medical masked face is the main focus of research to reduce the spreading and transmission of Coronavirus specially COVID-19. Given an image, a region of the medical masked face on the input image based on YOLO-v2 with ResNet-50 will be illustrated in the output image. All object detection methods classify machine learning-based and deep learning. Machine learning detectors such as Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [8] , and Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [9] . Deep learning detectors such as region convolutional neural network (R-CNN [10] , Fast R-CNN [11] , Faster R-CNN [12] ), You Only Look Once (YOLO v1 [13] , v2 [14] , v3 [15] ), and Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD) [16] .YOLO family rather than region convolutional neural network family designed for high speed and performance.The main contributions of this paper are conducted as follows: 2) A New masked face dataset using two public masked face datasets to get rid of the dataset's scarcity problem.3) The proposed model improves detection performance by introducing mean IoU to estimate the best number of anchor boxes. 4) Two optimizers are used in training to get the highest performance possible. 5) YOLO-v2 detector is an effective model to find a masked face on input image based on ResNet-50.Object detection from an image is probably the deepest aspect of computer vision due to widely used in many cases. There has been supervised or unsupervised based learn in the field of computer vision to outfit the work of object detection in an image. This section conducts the recent academic papers for applying representative works related to object detection based on deep learning for the medical face mask. Most of mask face detection focus on face construction and face recognition based on traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, our focus is on detecting and find the human who is wearing a face mask to help in lessening the spreading of the COVID-19. The authors of this paper also designed a lot of deep learning architecture based on solving image classification problems in many scientific fields [17] - [22] .In [23] , authors have implemented a classical machine learning method to recognize masked and unmasked face using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The paper concluded that face without a mask gives a better recognition rate in PCA. It is found that extracting features from a masked face is less than an unmasked face.They found that the accuracy of mask face classification using the PCA is related to wear masks. When wearing a mask, the accuracy decreases to 70%. In [24] proposed a novel GAN-based network to remove mask objects in facial images. The proposed GAN used two discriminators: The first one extracts the global structure of the masked face, The Second one extract the missing region from the masked face. In the training process, they used paired synthetic datasets. The outcome of the introduced model producing high-quality results for removing masked from the face. In [25] , The authors proposed a hybrid deep transfer learning model with machine learning methods for face mask classification. The proposed model consisted two phases 1) feature extraction base on ResNet50 2) classification based on SVM, decision tree, and ensemble. Three datasets were used as benchmarks to evaluate the proposed methodology. The SVM classifier achieved the highest accuracy with 99.64%. In [26] , The authors proposed a model and dataset to find the normal and masked face in the wild.They introduced a large dataset Masked Faces (MAFA), which has 35, 806 masked faces. The proposed model based on a convolutional neural network called LLE-CNNs, which consists of three modules (a proposal, embedding, and verification). The works showed that LLE-CNNs using MAFA achieved the average precision equal to 76.1%.This paper conducted its experiments based on two public medical face mask datasets. The first dataset is Data augmentation is a method that can be used to artificially increase the diversity of datasets for training detectors. By transforming the original masked face images during training. Data augmentation improves the performance of the detector in training [28] - [30] . Data and their box labels were flipped horizontally to increase the masked face dataset as shown in Figure 7 . To evaluate the YOLO v2 with ResNet-50 performance to find and localize the medical masked face, different experiments have been conducted throughout this research. The proposed model was implemented on the system having the following specifications: The GPU used NVIDIA RTX with the CUDA with Tensorflow, MATLAB, and Deep Neural Network library (CuDNN) for GPU learning. The experiment configuration is presented in Table 1 . Table 3 . The training and validation process based on AdamThe performance measurement of the proposed detector model was quantitatively evaluating. The most common performance metrics in the field of deep learning detection are average precision and log-average miss rates. The average precision (AP) [34] combines recall and precision as shown in equation (6) to evaluate the ability of the detector to find all relevant objects and the ability of the detector to detect objects correctly. At all recall levels, the ideal precision is one. log-average miss rates are a mean of nine False Positives Per Image (FPPI) miss rate in the range of 10 −3 10 0 to give stable performance [35] , [36] . As shown in Figure 9 ,10, Adam optimizer AP =0.81 is better than SGDM AP =0.61 in all recall levels. Also, it can be clearly seen thatAdam optimizer log-average miss rates = 0.4 is better than SGDM log-average miss rates = 0.6. The proposed detector model outcomes of using YOLO v2 with ResNet-50 models in MMD and FMD datasets are shown in Figure 11 . In this work, we have introduced a novel model for medical masked face detection, focusing on medical mask object to prevent COVID-19 spreads from human to human. For image detection, we have employed the YOLO v2 based ResNet-50 model to produce high-performance outcomes. The proposed model improves detection performance by introducing mean IoU to estimate the best number of anchor boxes. To train and validate our detector in a supervised state, we design a new dataset based on two public masked face datasets.Furthermore, performance metrics such as AP and log-average miss rates score had been studied for SGDM and Adam optimizer experiments. We have shown that the proposed model scheme of YOLOv2 with ResNet-50 is an effective model to detect a medical masked face. As a future study, we plan to detect a kind of masked face in image and video-based on deep learning models.The author declares no conflict of interest ","Egypt","first author","2020-11-12","11"

Although pathologies associated with viral infection with the three severe viruses are not yet completely understood, host-virus interaction plays a key role in the severity of disease as a result of triggering an immune response against the viral infection [2] . Excessive immune response due to viral infection is commonly associated with immune pathogenesis, PLOS ONE a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 USA)with a direct capillary column TG-5MS (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm film thickness). The temperature of the column oven was initially kept at 50˚C and then raised by 5˚C /min to 200 C and kept for 2 min then raised to the final required temperature of 300˚C by 25˚C /min and kept for 2 min. The injector and mass spectrometry transfer line temperatures were held at 270 and 260˚C respectively. Helium gas was used as a carrier with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. Electron ionization (EI) mass spectra were collected at 70 eV ionization voltage over the range of m/z 50-650 in full scan mode. The components were identified by comparing their retention times and mass spectra with mass spectral libraries [16] .Vero-E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing fetal bovine serum (10%) (Lonza), and antibiotic antimycotic mixture (1%) (Lonza). The cells were incubated at 37˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . A SARS-COV-2, hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020 (Accession Number on GSAID: EPI_ISL_430820) virus was propagated in VERO-E6 cells. The virus was titrated using plaque titration assay.To evaluate the in vitro cell viability of the prepared EGYVIR extract, the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol -2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed as previously described [17] with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic antimycotic mixture. After 24 h of cell preparation, the growth medium was aspirated from each well and the cells washed with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Different concentrations of EGYVIR aqueous extract starting from 0.4 μg/ml were two fold serially diluted in DMEM then added to cultured cells in 96-well plate in triplicate and incubated for 24 h post treatment to determine the cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50). The medium was then removed and the monolayer of cells washed with 1X PBS three times before adding MTT solution (20 μL/well of 5 mg/ml stock solution) and incubated at 37˚C for 4 h till formulation of formazan crystals. Crystals were dissolved using a volume of 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the absorbance measured at λmax 540 nm using an ELISA microplate reader. Finally, the percentage of cytotoxicity compared to the untreated cells was determined. The CC50 of EGYVIR extract was determined from a linear exponential equation.The antiviral activity of EGYVIR extract was determined by plaque reduction assay [18] with minor modifications. Briefly, Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (10 5 cells/ml) and incubated overnight at 37˚C under 5% CO 2 condition. Previously titrated SARS-CoV-2 was diluted to optimal virus dilution, which gave countable plaques, and mixed with the safe concentrations of EGYVIR extract (0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 μg). The mixtures of virus and EGYVIR were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Growth medium was removed from the 6-well cell culture plates and virus-extract mixtures inoculated in duplicate. After 1 h contact time for virus adsorption, 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% agarose, 1% antibiotic antimycotic mixture, and 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) were added to the cell monolayer then the plates were incubated at 37˚C for 3 days. The cells were fixed using 10% formalin solution for 1 h and the over layer was removed from each fixed well. Fixed cells were stained using 0.1% crystal violet in distilled water. Untreated virus was included in each plate as a control. Finally, plaques were counted and the percentage reduction in virus count recorded as follows:Viral inhibition ð%Þ ¼ viral count of untreated cells À viral count of the treated cells=viral count of untreated cells x 100The Vero-E6 cells (80-90% confluency) were infected at MOI of 0.1 of the virus then treated with EGYVIR and hydroxychloroquine as control at concentration 0.4 μg/ml and 2.2 μM, respectively. The cells were incubated in infection medium for 24, 48, and 72 h post infection at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 . Mock-infected cells without treatment were used as control. Cell culture supernatants were collected at each time point and virus was quantified by RT-qPCR.Nucleic acid extraction for the cell culture isolates were done using the chemagic™ 360 instrument (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ORF1 ab) was performed using Viasure Sars-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit (CerTest Biotec, Zaragoza, Spain), the RT-PCR runs were done in triplicate and according to manufacturer's recommendations. The obtained Ct values were changed to viral RNA copy numbers using a standard curve of ORF 1 ab assay, the viral inhibition in RNA copy number at each concentration was determined.The mode of action of the tested extract was determined using three mechanisms, viral replication mechanism [19] , viral adsorption mechanism [20] , and virucidal mechanism [21] . The percentage of virus reduction of each mode of action was individually calculated based on untreated virus control wells.The human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cells were plated at 1.8×10 5 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight in DMEM. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 0.1 with and without EGYVIR extract at concentration of 0.4 μg/ml in triplicate. Supernatants were collected at 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h post infection and centrifuged. TNF-α, IL-6 and total Ikβα concentrations were assayed using ELISA (R&D, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For evaluation of cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB p50 levels, cell supernatants were collected at the above time point then nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction were done using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Thermo scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then NF-κB p50 ELISA was done using NF-κB p50 colorimetric transcription factor assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).Huh7 cells were plated at 1.8×10 5 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight in DMEM. Cells were then infected with SARS-COV-2 virus at MOI 0.1 alone or with EGYVIR extract 0.4 μg/ml in triplicate and cell supernatants were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 36 h post infection and centrifuged. The total RNA was then extracted from cells using Qiagen extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, 500 ng of the purified RNA were used to synthesize the complementary DNA (cDNA) with random hexamer primers (Thermo Scientific) and Revert Aid H Minus M-MuL V Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction mixture (25 μl) comprises the following: 0.5 μl of cDNA template, 12.5 μl of Maxima SYBR green PCR master mix (Thermo Scientific) and 1 μl of each primer (100 μM forward and reverse primers). Reactions were run in triplicate on Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50˚C, 2 min at 95˚C, cDNA were amplified by 45 The Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and P50 protein were obtained from protein database under numbers 6LZG and 1VKX, respectively. Ligand structures of ingredients of EGYVIR were obtained from zinc AC and chemspider databases and were converted to MOL2 format and adjusted for docking by UCSF Chimera as required prior to submission. The potential binding sites of each of the ligands to the target were determined using EA Docking provided by SwissDock using default parameters. After submitting each ligand and target, protein-ligand binding energy was scored using the CHARMM22 force field. Favorable clusters of lowest energy poses were visualized, manipulated, and analyzed by UCSF Chimera. Calculations were performed using switch dock server that evaluates protein-ligand binding energy using a scoring function based on the CHARMM22 force field.Data were summarized by means ± SD of triplicates and compared by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's least significant difference test. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.The prepared EGYVIR was analyzed using GC-MS to determine the amounts of the main components present. The active principles with their retention time (RT), molecular formula, molecular weight (MW), peak area in percentage are presented in Table 1 . The EGYVIR extract included fifty-three ingredients. The major ingredients are Pentatricontane (41.04%), Amyrin (9.49%), Lupeol (8.86%), Turmerone (8.13%), Sitosterol (7.61%), Bisdemethoxycurcumin (6.8%), Piperine (4,6%), Vitamin D3 (1.76%), and Curcumin (1.3%) (Fig 1) .The cytotoxicity of the EGYVIR extract was evaluated in Vero-E6 cells using MTT assay. The EGYVIR was almost not toxic for Vero-E6 cells up to a dose of 0.57 μg/ml (Fig 2A) . The toxic effect of tested extract was dose-dependent. The result showed that the cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) value of EGYVIR was 0.57 μg. Therefore, for further studies we selected the safe concentrations of 0.05-0.4 μg/mL for subsequent antiviral studies.The antiviral activity of EGYVIR against SARS-CoV-2 was determined using plaque reduction assay. The result showed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of EGYVIR was 0. 57 μg/ml (Fig 2B) . The concentrations from 0.4 to 0.1 μg/ml showed 92% to 88% SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. At 0.05 μg/mL of EGYVIR, the viral inhibition decreased to 54.6% (Fig 2B and 2C ).The infected Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of EGVIR showed a decrease in viral titer (78%) assessed by RT-qPCR (ORF1ab) after 24 h of infection. Also, the treated cells with hydroxychloroquine showed decreasing in viral inhibition (66%) compared to untreated cells. At 48 and 72 h of infection, a significant decrease of viral replication in the infected cells in the presence of either EGYVIR or hydroxychloroquine was noted in comparison to cells infected without treatment (Fig 3) .To understand the main action mechanism of the effective EGYVIR extract against SARS-CoV-2 virus, we considered three main possible antiviral mechanisms: (i) inhibited To investigate whether SARS-COV-2 virus can promote cytokine expression in Huh7 cells, we first measured the level of Ikβα, TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant of infected Huh7 cells. The were collected at a time ranging from 0-24 h and the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and Ikβα Huh7 were measured using ELISA. EGYVIR extract were significantly (p<0.001) down regulating the levels of IL-6, TNF-α and Ikβα in the culture supernatant of infected Huh7 cells at interval time points (Fig 5) .To further determine if IL-6, TNF-α, and Ikβα levels occurred at the transcriptional level, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA levels were evaluated by RT-PCR and normalized to β actin and log fold change was calculated. Huh7 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 with and without EGYVIR extract at concentration of 0.4 μg/mL. Data showed that SARS-COV-2 strongly induced the transcription level of IL-6, TNF-α, and Ikβα, which was consistent with the release of IL-6, TNF-α, and Ikβα in the supernatants of infected cells. The treated cells with EGYVIR extract were significantly down regulating the transcriptional levels of TNF-α and Ikβα by 2-4 folds at all time points (Fig 6A and 6B) . The IL-6 was significantly down regulated in the treated cells compared to untreated cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2 at 6-8 h (p<0.05), and 12-36 h (p<0.001). No significant difference (p>0.05) in the level of IL6 was recorded at 0-4h and at 10 h post infection (Fig 6C) .To monitor the activation status of NF-κB p50, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits in triplicate independent experiments, the samples were collected at a time point range between 0-24 h and Huh7 cells supernatant collected at each time point and then cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction were done and the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-κB p50 were detected in three independent experiments. EGYVIR significantly attenuated the nuclear translocation of p50 subunit in Huh7 cells compared with the SARS-COV-2 infected cells where the nuclear translocation became obvious after 2 h post infection and significantly stable for 24 h post infection (Fig 5D) .Based on the mode of action of EGYVIR on SARS-COV-2, docking analysis of the main ingredients of EGYVIR (ligands) with spike RBD and with P50 proteins were performed (Figs 7 and  8) . The rationale behind the choice of RBD was that the drug had a direct effect on the virus itself (virucidal). Interaction energy calculations suggest that all components of EGYVIR (except sitosterol and lupeol) bind directly to the spike protein at the site of its interface with ACE2 receptor as shown in the structure of novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexes with its receptor ACE2 (PDB code: 6LZG). Energy calculations also showed that Pentatriacontane, curcumin, piperine, sitosterol, turmeron, lupeol and alpha-amyrines are predicted to bind with the RBD of spike protein in places other than the interface with estimated delta G ranging from -6 to -9.7 kcal/mol. Regarding the docking of EGYVIR components with P50, all components were found to bind with it, except lupeol. All delta G results were lower than -7 (Table 2 ).In a pandemic, natural compounds become an important source for the discovery of new antiviral agents. Several previous reports indicated that curcumin has broad spectrum antiviral activities. Several efforts were achieved to overcome the problems associated with bioavailability of curcumin. During the current study, we developed an immunomodulatory herbal extract with potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 by fusion of water extracts from curcumin with piperine.EGYVIR showed virucidal effects on SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that the virucidal mechanism is probably due to direct and strong attraction of EGYVIR extract to the virus spike present on the surface of SARS-COV-2. Consequently, this prevents the virus from attaching to VERO-E6 cells [23] [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, it is possible that turmeron, lupeol, and sitosterol present in EGYVIR extract effectively inhibit the surface protein of SARS-COV-2 virus upon direct interaction or links with virions of virus through its amino group moieties with glycoprotein fusion.EGYVIR components docking data revealed that most of the components bind precisely and directly to the ACE2 binding motif in RBD of spike protein, which directly interferes with the binding of spike to ACE2 receptor, and to other sites which might affect the dynamic action of the protein or the stability of changing conformation and indirectly affect binding, note that Pentatriacontane was found to bind firmly and precisely with the lowest DELTA G (9.7 kcal/mol). This might be interfering with the dynamics of the trimeric spike structure movement and hence the binding to ACE2 receptors indirectly.The P50 docking with each of the components of EGYVIR (except for lupeol) showed strong predicted binding in the site of DNA binding, which causes the downregulation of IL6 expression and therefore down regulates the cytokine storm as shown in the results and confirmed by many previous publications.β-amyrin (oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid) was previously reported to exert antiviral efficacies against an influenza A virus (IAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [27] . In our analysis, the percentage of β-amyrin (9.4%) in EGYVIR extract likely supports its anti-viral activity, probably via attenuating the cellular oxidative mechanism. Also, the triterpenoids, referred to as phytosterols, exhibits a broad spectrum biological activities [28, 29] . For instance, lupeol is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, anti-proliferative and hypocholesterolemic efficacies [30] . Lupeol decreases the ROS level and recover the antioxidant enzyme activities in chemical-induced oxidative stress condition [31] . Although lupeol has weak antiviral activities, it was used as a lead drug to construct more effective compounds against IAV and HSV [32] . To our knowledge, lupeol antiviral activity against CoVs is not reported, so far. Nevertheless, lupeol (8.86%) in EGYVIR extract contributes probably to the overall anti-viral activity of the extract via direct or indirect mode of action(s).β-sitosterol is an immunomodulatory phytosterol with reported anti-HIV activities (in vivo and in vitro) via stabilizing CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, and a significant decreasing of interleukin-6 expression level [33] . Interestingly, β-sitosterol can attenuate in vitro chemicalinduced hepatotoxicity [34] and cardiotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial glutathione redox mechanism [35] that may help in decreasing the cytokine storm. In line with this, the inclusion of β-sitosterol (7.6%) in EGYVIR extract strongly supports independently or interdependently its in vitro antioxidative, hepatoprotective and anti-viral activities.EGYVIR has low IC50 value of 0.57 μg/ml against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we provide evidence(s) that supports a direct impact of EGYVIR extract on the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The amount of EGYVIR required to suppress Huh7 cell growth has been correlated with its ability to block the nuclear translocation of p50 (subunit of NF-κB), to hinder IκB phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation. In line with Kasinski et al. findings [36] , Curcumin alone, showed at least 10 times lower potency in all of the above-mentioned assays. Although the NF-κB signaling pathway is involved as one of the curcumin targets, the direct inhibitory effect of curcumin on IKK protein catalytic activity has not been validated yet [37] . Our research identifies EGYVIR as a NF-κB p50 inhibitor derived from the natural product curcumin and piperine extract, for controlling the IL6 expression [15, [38] [39] [40] . Sitosterol, turmerone and lupeol were also previously shown to be controlling the NF-κB and IL-6 expression. Notably, curcumin was previously reported an inhibitor of several kinases as well, in particular protein kinase C, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin serine/threonine kinase [41, 42] .On the other hand, under normal physiological conditions, the cytokine levels are maintained by negative and positive feedback regulation of their expression in a steady-state [43] . A large amount of virus in the body will induce over-reacted innate and adaptive immune response, triggering extravagant cytokines release, and lymphocytes activation, namely cytokine storm [43] . The loss of negative regulation of the production of inflammatory cytokines leads in turn to drive a high positive feedback regulation, resulting in exponentially growing inflammation and multi-organ failure. The release of cytokine promotes increased vascular permeability; consequently, the leukocytes increasingly migrate to damaged tissues through margination, rolling, adhesion, transmigration, and chemotaxis [44] . There is clear evidence from coronavirus-infected patients of both high cytokine levels and pathological changes in the lung [45] [46] [47] . For instance, in plasma of COVID-19 patients, high concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7 were observed [48, 49] .Numerous studies showed that curcumin and its analogs significantly inhibit the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo [10, 50] . In line with this, Zhang and his colleagues observed that direct pulmonary delivery of solubilized curcumin dramatically downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo in mice with severe pneumonia [51] .The mechanism principal of EGYVIR extract has been explored as illustrated in Fig 9. Among inflammatory pathway during SARS-CoV2 infection, NF-kB plays an essential role in developing of cytokine storm. EGYVIR extract blocked this pathway by inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kβ p50 in line with Xu et al. findings, [52] . In line with our finding, it was reported that curcumin has ability to regulate NF-kB signaling through IKKb [53] . Additionally, consumption of curcumin reduced activity of IKKb in a study of patients with head and neck cancer and this was associated with a decrease in the expression of IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-g [54] . Our docking studies showed that there are good bind affinities between EGYVIR extract active ingredients and RBD of human ACE2 receptor which disturbs the attachment of SARS-COV-2 virus with host, also our docking studies showed a good binding affinity between EGYVIR active ingredients and p50 subunit of NF-κB which attenuates NF-κB pathways. Our lab studies showed that EGYVIR inhibits the nuclear translocation of p50 and disturbs NF-κB pathway resulting in decrease of cytokine storm by down-regulating IL-6 and TNFα production. It has been documented that curcumin blocks NF-kB signaling upon infection with Influenza A virus (IAV) as a consequence of AMPK activation [55] . EGYVIR molecular mechanism as a virucidal and cytokine storm disturbance via NF-Kb pathway. EGYVIR works as a virucidal agent on SARS-COV-2 targeting the spike protein which prevent interaction with host cell receptor. Our docking studies showed that there are good bind affinities between EGYVIR extract active ingredients and RBD of human ACE2 receptor which disturbs the attachment of SARS-COV-2 virus with host, also our docking studies showed a good binding affinity between EGYVIR active ingredients and p50 subunit of NF-κB which attenuates NF-κB pathways. Our lab studies showed that EGYVIR inhibits the nuclear translocation of p50 and disturbs NF-κB pathway resulting in decrease of cytokine storm by down-regulating IL-6 and TNFα production.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241739.g009A curcumin-piperine infusion showed an immunomodulatory activity during in vitro infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Since it emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread from its epicenter to create a global pandemic (De Vlieger et al., 2018; Detalle et al., 2016) . Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 generally develop mild symptoms; however, in a minority of cases, the disease leads to severe pneumonia and even death (D€ orner et al., 2017) . Currently, no effective vaccines or specific drugs exist that can be used to prevent, mitigate, or treat COVID-19 (Ezzikouri et al., 2020; Hanke et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) . The pandemic is forcing authorities round the world to adopt interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, and lockdown, on a historically unprecedented scale. Such measures are causing significant economic losses, and underline the crucial need for the prompt development of anti-COVID-19 therapeutics and prophylactics. The scientific community is under pressure to devise effective therapeutic and preventive approaches to COVID-19 at breakneck speed. This pressure-coupled with finite resources available for any one approach-means that researchers must be open to exploring a number of different avenues in biomedical science, in the quest for strategies against this disease. In this paper, we highlight one such avenue: nanobodies (Nbs), which have potential utility for both therapeutic and diagnostic interventions to combat COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). Nbs, also called VHHs, are derived from the heavy-chain variable domains of camelids (llamas, alpacas, dromedaries, and camels) and sharks. They are single-domain antibodies devoid of a light chain component (Huo et al., 2020) . The Nbs domain comprises full antigen-binding potential, strong affinity to its cognate antigen, and is considered to possess the smallest naturally occurring (15 kDa), intact antigenbinding domain. Nbs hold promise as proteins for therapeutic use against infectious diseases due to a number of their characteristics: they are small and have a low molecular weight, they are highly stable and soluble, they can be produced cost-effectively, and they readily penetrate tissue (Ibañez et al., 2011) . In a range of studies, Nbs have been proposed as antiviral agents against respiratory diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Jailkhani et al., 2019; Jovcevska & Muyldermans, 2020) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020) , and influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (Mitch, 2018) .The therapeutic potential of Nbs against coronaviruses has been demonstrated in an exciting recent study (Respaud et al., 2015) . A pair of potent VHHs were isolated from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and successfully used to neutralize MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 in vitro (Respaud et al., 2015) . One particularly interesting finding in that study was the high-affinity binding of S-directed VHH to the spike RBD, which enabled the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 (Respaud et al., 2015) . Moreover, three VHHs, H11-D4, H11-H4 and Ty1, target SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and block interaction with ACE2 have been discovered (Rissiek et al., 2014; Sanaei et al., 2019) . This finding suggests a potential role for Nbs as therapeutic agents to be deployed in the COVID-19 pandemic (Respaud et al., 2015; Rissiek et al., 2014; Sheridan, 2020) .Nbs have suppressed inflammation in several models, suggesting that they may target inflammatory responses, and could thus mitigate the cytokine storms suggested to be experienced by COVID-19 patients after the development of characteristic lung damage. A further advantage for Nbs concerns their mode of administration; they can be nebulized and, using an inhaler mechanism, delivered directly to the lung, where they may be able to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in the context of COVID-19 pathology (Ibañez et al., 2011; Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Thanh Le et al., 2020) .Nbs have also advanced through the drug development process. Recently, the bivalent Nb caplacizumab has received approval as an indication for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in two regions covered by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (Europe and the United States) (WHO. Coronavirus disease \(COVID-19, XXXX). Moreover, the anti-IL-6R Nb vobarilizumab, which also has an anti-human serum albumin domain, has been evaluated for a marketing indication as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, reaching a clinical phase 2 b study in which it showed safety and ""a positive impact on disease activity"" (Wrapp et al., 2020) . The potential indications of Nbs clearly require further investigation; there are concerns that their fast renal clearance could lead to renal toxicity and failure to achieve an effective concentration in the target tissue. On the other hand, should such issues be overcome, Nbs have a clear development advantage. They can be easily engineered and genetically fused to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) (CH2-CH3) of different human antibody subclasses to target different viruses .Potential applications of Nbs are not limited to the therapeutic field; they may have utility in diagnostic interventions as well. Challenges are presented in the field of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, where several serological kits that detect the relevant immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG have been approved but are not being used for general screening due to the lack of the required specificity and sensitivity (Zhao et al., 2018) . Nbs represent a potential solution to this problem, as the basis for the rapid antigen tests with high specificity and sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection that are so greatly in demand during the current COVID-19 outbreak (Zhu et al., 2020) . Nbsbased ELISAs are already used to detect a range of specific antigens and biomarkers (Ibañez et al., 2011; Sheridan, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Nb technology can theoretically be levered to antigen detection in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; however, further investigations are needed.In conclusion, Nbs are small, stable, and simple to produce, and hold promise as therapeutic proteins to be used in novel interventions for COVID-19. As other coronaviruses are likely to emerge in the future, Nbs indications could be extended to cover such newly emergent coronaviruses as well. Furthermore, the potential utility of Nbs in diagnostics for COVID-19 is an area requiring further study. Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the heavy-chain variable domains (VHHs) generation process and their potential applications as therapeutic agents and as diagnostic tools for COVID-19 pathology. Blood is collected from SARS-CoV-2 antigen-immunized camelids to isolate PBMCs. RNA is extracted from PBMCs followed by RT-PCR to amplify VHH. The VHH DNA sequence is ligated into a phagemid vector and transformed into E. coli. VHH phage display is carried out to isolate SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific clones. After rounds of panning on the antigen of interest, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific VHH coding sequence is selected. The identified VHH coding gene is inserted into a yeast expression vector to produce a soluble VHH.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3982-6163 Jalal Nourlil http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0727-3282 Kyoko Tsukiyama-Kohara http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4403-2018 Marc P.

The Gross National Income (GNI) per capita for 2019 was US$ 12,740, with an estimated population of 1.27 million (1). Furthermore, Mauritius has a human development index of 0.796 and which after adjusting for inequality drops to 0.688. In the same breath, the country has a Gini index of 35.8 (2) . As a result of Coronavirus Disease , the economy is expected to experience its first contraction in 40 years. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth would contract by 6.8% in 2020 (3) .In 2017, which was before COVID-19 pandemic, Mauritius had a total of 10,332.65 deaths, of which 88.95% were from noncommunicable diseases (NCD), 5.28% from injuries, and 5.76% from communicable diseases (CD). The death rates per 100,000 population for various CDs were: 39.12 for chronic respiratory diseases; 25.31 for respiratory infections and tuberculosis; 7.77 for maternal and neonatal disorders; 7.63 for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections; 2.19 for enteric infections; 1.08 for nutritional deficiencies; 0.14 for neglected tropical diseases and malaria; and 2.66 for other infectious diseases (4) .The COVID-19 outbreak continues to accelerate with a total of 39,175,462 confirmed cases, including 1,102,941 deaths and a case fatality rate of 2.8%, reported globally at 16 October 2020 (5) . The African continent had a total of 1,621,853 cases, including 39,150 deaths and a case fatality rate (2.4%). South Africa is the hardest-hit country in the African continent and ranks eleventh globally after the United States of America (USA), India, Brazil, Russia, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and France (5) . As of 16 October 2020, there were 415 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mauritius, including 10 deaths, 364 recovered cases, and 41 active cases (5) . The case fatality rate was 2.4% and a recovery rate of 87.7% (5, 6) .Notwithstanding the growing interest for research in the area of COVID-19, there is a dearth of country evidence on the monetary value of human life losses associated with COVID-19. Brazil (7) , Canada (8), China (9) , France (10), Iran (11) , Italy (12), Spain (13) , Turkey (14) , the United Kingdom [UK] (15) , and the USA (16) are exceptions. Quantifying the real disease burden of COVID-19 in dollar terms is critical to building advocacy to increase investment into health-related systems. The objectives of this paper are 2-fold. First, to estimate the discounted money value of human life losses associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. Secondly, to estimate briefly the potential gains from preventive actions taken to contain the spread of COVID- 19. Mauritius is among the very few countries in the WAFR which has managed to halt the community transmission of COVID- 19 . There have been no confirmed cases of local transmission since 26 April 2020. The success might be attributed to four systemic reasons.First, relatively good governance compared to the rest of Africa continent. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) is a tool for tracking African governments progress in attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development (SDG) Goal 16 relating to effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels (17, 18) . In 2017, Mauritius had an overall IIAG score of 79.5%, which consisted of category scores of 81.3% in safety and the rule of law (SRL), 77.2% in participation and human rights (PHR), 74.8% of sustainable economic opportunity (SEO), and 84.6% in human development (HD) (19) . The Mauritius overall IIAG and the four category scores were higher than Africa's overall IIAG score of 49.9%, and category mean scores of 52.6% in SRL, 49.2% in PHR, 44.8% in SEO, and 52.8% in HD (19) .Second, Mauritius has more resourced national health system and other systems that address social determinants of health than those of many other countries in the WAFR. As shown in Table 1 , the health workforce, medical devices, infrastructure, essential health service coverage, per capita current health expenditure, and safely managed water and sanitation indicators for Mauritius are significantly higher than those of the WAFR (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) .The public and private health sector are manned by a total of 3,210 medical doctors (including 895 specialists), 411 dentists and 4,400 nurses and midwives (27) . The doctor population ratio (25.3 per 10,000 population) and nurse and midwifery ratio (35.2 per 10,000 population) in Mauritius are, respectively, 8-and 3-fold higher than those of the WAFR (20, 22) .In 2017, Mauritius per capita current health expenditure (CHE) of US$600 (Int$1,278) was 4.4 times higher than the average of Int$292 in the AFR (25) . The percentage of the population with household expenditures on health of more than 25% of the total household income increased slightly from 1.2% in 2012 to 1.8% of the population in 2018 (24, 28) . In 2012, 0.34% of households were impoverished by OOP (28) . The health system is adequately resourced to keep Mauritius on track to attaining the SDG 3 target 3.8 on achieving universal health coverage (UHC) (18, 29, 30) . The Mauritius UHC essential health services coverage index (measured on a scale of 0 to target of 100) of 63% in 2017 was higher than the average of 46% for the WAFR (23) .Third, stronger systems that provide services related to social determinants of health. The proportion of the population using at least basic drinking-water services in Mauritius of 99% was 3-fold that of the WAFR (24, 26) . Also, the proportion of the population using improved sanitation services in Mauritius of 91.0% was three-times that of WAFR in 2017 (24, 26) .Fourth, more robust disease surveillance and response system (DSRS) due to better International Health Regulation (IHR) core capacities as recommended by the 58th World Health Assembly (31, 32) . In 2013, WHO developed an IHR core capacity monitoring framework consisting of a checklist and indicators that countries can use to monitor progress in the implementation of 13 IHR core capacities (33) . Table 2 shows that, except for the Zoonotic and humananimal interface, all the other 12 IHR core capacity scores for Mauritius were higher than those for the WAFR (34) . The average of the 13 IHR core capacities score of 64 was higher than the average for WAFR of 44. Despite the past relative success, the Ministry of Health and Wellness acknowledges the need to sustain advocacy for increased and efficiently utilized investments to bridge the albeit limited persisting gaps in UHC and implementation of some of the IHR core capacities (35) . Card and Mooney (36) argue that given the resources available in any health system for saving life are limited, rational allocation of resources is needed, which call for monetary valuation of human life. According to Rice (37) , it is important to translate adverse effects of diseases, such as COVID-19, into dollar terms which is the universal language of decisionmakers in ministries of economic development, planning, and finance; the private sector; and the international development policy arena.The cross-sectional study reported in this paper was undertaken among the ten persons deceased due to COVID-19 in Mauritius between 18 March 2020 (when the first case was discovered) to 16 October 2020. The Republic of Mauritius implemented a wide array of public health containment measures since the outbreak of COVID-19 was reported in the country on 18 March 2020 to prevent widespread community transmission (6, 38) . These included bans on public gatherings, a curfew order, closing of borders, discontinuation of public transportation; closing of schools, universities, shopping malls, and tourist sites; suspending of employee attendance at government and private workplaces (except for essential staff); and introduction of mass testing for antigens on 27 April 2020. As the country recorded no new cases for nearly 3 weeks and no active cases since 11 May 2020, a strategically phased resumption of economic activities began on 15 May 2020. A Work Access Permit issued by the authorities, except for those working in essential sectors became mandatory for employees to resume their duties.Arrangements were made by the public transport companies to comply with the prescribed health measures and to adhere to the physical distance between passengers. Schoolchildren had to stay at home, while the courses continued to be delivered remotely. Banks and supermarkets still operated on alphabetical order, and the same applied to post offices. Two sets of legislations were enacted mid-May 2020, namely the COVID-19 Bill and Quarantine Bill. Both legislations delineated the transition process from the curfew by strengthening the surveillance control and health system preparedness. These actions ensured a progressive reopening of economic and other activities with strict sanitary rules and added measures to avoid a resurgence of the disease (6, 38) .Notwithstanding the curfew was lifted from end of May 2020, physical distancing guidelines remain in place, as well as the mandatory wearing of masks in public. While working access permits are no longer required, offices are required to incorporate physical distancing requirements, and encourage working from home. All schools reopened in July 2020 while the borders remained closed until the end of September (6, 38) .Every human being is imbued with unique capabilities that enable them to enjoy their right to life (Article 3), the right to rest and leisure (Article 24) (39), flourishing as a human (40) , and perform expected societal roles (e.g., spouse, carer, breadwinner/worker, taxpayer, commodity consumer, investor, innovator, inventor, mentor, learner, educator, religious worshiper) (41) . According to the OECD such capabilities (human capital) include ""The knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes (physical, emotional and mental health plus motivation, and behavior) embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic well-being (p. 18)"" (42) . The actualization of such capabilities during one's lifetime enables the individual, the family, and the society to flourish or thrive (43) . Premature death from COVID-19 (or any other cause) annihilates the stock of those embodied human capital capabilities (including health), capacity to enjoy leisure activities, ability to consume nonhealth goods and services, capability to contribute to government revenue (via service fees and taxes), ability to save and invest, and ability to produce goods and services for domestic use or export.The potentially productive years of life lost [YLL] from a COVID-19 death equals the average life expectancy at birth of Mauritius minus the age of onset of death of the specific person. Jones-Lee (44) and Mooney (45) explains and discusses the strengths and limitations of the three approaches used to value monetarily statistical human life, i.e., the human capital approach (HCA), the revealed preferences approach (or implied values), and the willingness-to-pay (or contingent valuation) approach.The current study employs the HCA originally developed by Petty (46) , and after that, refined by Weisbrod (47) and Rice and Cooper (48) . According to Weisbrod (47) , ""The present value of a man at any given age may be defined operationally as his discounted expected future earnings stream net of his consumption."" (p. 427). Weisbrod (47), Chisholm et al. (49) , and World Health Organization [WHO] (50) recommends use of per capita GDP net of current health expenditure in the valuation of YLL.Why use net GDP per capita, i.e., the difference between GDP per capita and health care expenditure per capita? Economic theory assumes that every rational individual strives to maximize utility (happiness or pleasure or welfare). The main direct determinants of utility are the consumption of health, nonhealth goods and services, and leisure (50) . Individuals demand health because it is intrinsically pleasurable, allows one to engage in activities of daily living (e.g., schooling, work), and enables one to enjoy leisure activities (e.g., eating and drinking in restaurants, local and international tourism activities, sports, socializing, visiting drama and movie theaters, sports). People demand health goods and services, which do not yield utility, because of the expected positive impact on health, i.e., healthrelated-quality of life and length of life. Thus, the demand for health goods and services is derived from the demand for health (51) . COVID-19 illness (or any other illness) compels individuals (and households) to pay for health goods and services, which reduces household disposable income, and hence, enjoyment of leisure activities and non-health goods and services that directly deliver utility (or pleasure) (49) . It is for this reason that WHO (50) recommends: "". . . it is important to note that GDP includes expenditure on health goods and services, so this component should be omitted, and the focus of analysis be redirected toward establishing the present value of discounted aggregate flows of current and future consumption of non-health-related goods and services linked to disease (p.4)"".The current study replicates the HCA model developed by Weisbrod (47) , and recently applied in Brazil (7), Canada (8), China (9), France (10), Iran (11), Italy (12), Spain (13) , Turkey (14) , the UK (15), and the USA (16) to estimate the monetary value of human lives lost due to COVID-19. The total discounted money value of human life losses linked with the 10 COVID-19 deaths in Mauritius (TDMVCL MAURITIUS ) equals sum of the discounted money value of each case whose outcome was death (DMVCL i ). Where 'i' equals Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, Case 4, Case 5, Case 6, Case 7, Case 8, Case 9, and Case 10. Formulaically:The DMVCL i for each i th COVID-19 case with death outcome is the sum of the multiplication of discount factor, net per capita GDP for Mauritius, and years of life lost (YLL) per ith case. Where: a) Discount factor (Q 1 ) equals 1 (1+r) t , r is the discount rate of 3% in this study (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) 52) , and t is the specific YLL; b) net per capita GDP equals the difference between GDP per capita (Q 2 ) minus current health expenditure per person (Q 3 ) in Mauritius; c) YLL equals the average life expectancy at birth in Mauritius (Q 4 ) minus the average age of onset of death for the i th case of COVID-19 (Q 5 ).The formula for estimating DMVCL i for the i th case can be expressed as follows:Where:t=j t=1 is the addition from the 1 st to year T of life for the i th case, and the meaning of other variables are as defined earlier. 2020 was taken as the base year for the analysis.The economic model (equations 1 and 2) was estimated using the following data and data sources: Excel Software (Microsoft, New York) was used to analyse data following the steps below:Step 1: Equations 1 and 2 in subsection Empirical Framework were built into an Excel spreadsheet.Step Step 4: The discounting of YLL at 3%, 5% and 10% discount rates yielded 124, 100, and 68 years, respectively (See Supplementary Table 2 ).Step 5: The economic model was estimated using a discount rate of 3%, which is widely applied in health-related studies (25-30, 43, 46) . It entailed multiplication of the discounted YLL of 124 years by the net GDP per capita (Int$25,182.57) (See Supplementary Table 3 ).Step 6: The average money value per COVID-19 death was calculated through the division of the total discounted money value of human lives lost in Mauritius by the total number of deaths, i.e., Int$3,120,689.13 divided by 10 deaths.Step 7: The average money value per person in population was estimated through the division of the total discounted money value of human lives lost by the total population in 2020 for Mauritius, i.e., Int$3,120,689.13 divided by 1,271,766.Step 8: Two univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of uncertainty surrounding two variables. First, due to the lack of consensus in the health economics literature, uncertainty surrounds the choice of discount rate (54, 55) . In order to test the impact of changes in the discount rate on the TDMVCL MAURITIUS , the model was recalculated using discount rates of 5% and 10% (7-16, 56, 57) . Second, there is no consensus regarding whether to apply the national average life expectancy at birth or the world highest average life expectancy at birth in the calculations of YLL (7-16). The economic model was first estimated using the national average life expectancy at birth for Mauritius, and subsequently, reanalysed with the global average life expectancy at birth and the world highest average life expectancy at birth (i.e., female average life expectancy in Hong Kong).Step 9: The potential gains due to COVID-19 contact tracing and quarantine were estimated. The step entailed calculation of the: Ethics approval was not necessary since the study did not involve human or animal subjects. It relied exclusively on the analysis of secondary data from IMF (53), Mauritius Ministry of Health and Wellness (6), WHO (24, 25) , and Worldometer (5) databases. The data is freely accessible to the public.As depicted in Without contact tracing and quarantine, a total of 43 persons would have died due to COVID-19 with a monetary value of An increase in the discount rate from 3 to 10% results in a drop in TDMVCL from Int$3,120,689 to Int$1,700,996. This represents a 46% decrease. Also, a 16.7% growth in the average life expectancy at birth leads to an expansion in TDMVCL of 50%. This result confirms the findings from past studies that indeed, the magnitude money value of human life losses is dependent on both the discount rate and the average life expectancies used (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Table 6 provides a comparison of the findings from the Mauritius study with those of 10 other countries that employed the HCA to estimate the monetary value of human life losses associated with COVID-19.The total discounted money value of human life losses in Mauritius was 1,151-fold lower than those of Brazil (7); 653fold of Canada (8); 296-fold of China (9); 3,362-fold of France (10); 1,125-fold of Iran (11); 4,188-fold of Italy (12); 3,086-fold of Spain (13) ; 352-fold of Turkey (14); 3,167-fold of the UK (15); and 6,338-fold of the USA (16) . The differences could be attributed to significantly lower number of COVID-19 deaths in Mauritius compared to the six other countries.The average discounted money value per human life in Mauritius was higher than the other six countries (Brazil, Canada, Iran, Turkey, UK, and USA), which is related to higher mortality rate in the younger age groups in Mauritius. As the share of deaths in Canada, France, Italy, Turkey, UK and USA in the older age group of 60 years and above was considerably much higher, This study applied HCA, a well-known economic methodology, to monetarily value the human life losses associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius. It is the first study of its kind in Mauritius. The evidence presented in this paper can be judiciously used by the Ministry of Health and Wellness to make a case for augmenting investments to strengthen healthrelated systems to bridge extant service coverage gaps. Universal coverage of health and health-related services would contribute in assuring every citizen's right to life, and achievement of the SDG3 on ""Ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"" and SDG6 on ""Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"" [(18), p. 14].The study had some shortcomings. First, the scope of the study was limited to the impact of COVID-19 on the life expectancy of the ten persons who died. Therefore, since the study did not evaluate both the costs and consequences of alternative COVID-19 control intervention options, the study findings can only be used for advocacy and not to inform policy development and decision-making.Second, the study did not include the cost of societal resources expended in prevention (water, sanitation, handwashing with soap, hand-sanitisers, facial masks, personal protective equipment for health workers), quarantine, testing, contacttracing, treatment, and rehabilitation of the 332 cases that recovered from COVID-19 infection. It did not also include the cost of diagnosis, treatment, post-mortem, mortuary storage, and interment of the 10 cases that died.Third, Santarpia et al. (59) conducted a study among 13 individuals with COVID-19 isolated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center to examine aerosol and surface contamination with SARS-CoV-2. The authors found that "". . . data indicate significant environmental contamination in rooms where patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are housed and cared for, regardless of the degree of symptoms or acuity of illness. Contamination exists in all types of samples: high and low-volume air samples, as well as surface samples including personal items, room surfaces, and toilets"" (p.3). This implies that since there may still be aerosol and surface contamination at quarantine and isolation centers, we may have overestimated the effect of quarantine, and hence, the potential discounted money value of human lives saved.Fourth, the HCA approach used has a number of weaknesses: (a) it uses GDP per capita to value the YLL, which ignores nonmarket contributions to societal welfare, the negative impact of economic production processes (e.g., on climate change), inequalities in the distribution of wealth and income, and quality of life (60); (b) values the YLL above the national average life expectancy at birth at zero; (c) assumes that the only objective of improving (or sustaining) human health (healthrelated quality and length of life) is to contribute to economic production (61) , which disregards other objectives such as assuring human rights (39) , and enabling homo sapiens to flourish (40) .This study succeeded in estimating the discounted money value of human life losses associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. The average discounted money value per human life loss associated with COVID-19 of Int$312,069 is significant, since it is 12-fold the per capita GDP for Mauritius. As noted earlier, the Republic of Mauritius prompt action in arresting the spread of COVID-19 infections, optimizing recoveries, and limiting the number of deaths is laudable. All measures implemented to prevent widespread community transmission of COVID-19 may have saved the country 837 human lives worth Int$258,080,991. This effectiveness has been attributed to relatively good political governance, and a highly performing national health system, disease surveillance and response system, and other systems that address social determinants of health.The Ministry of Health and Wellness can use the evidence contained in this paper, conjointly with human rights (to life, health, and health care) arguments, to sustain advocacy for further increase in multisector investments to bridge the existing limited gaps in UHC, IHR core capacities, and social determinants of health to mitigate and to respond to future public health emergencies, and to sustain the good health indicators.In order to guide decision-making related to COVID-19, there is a need for studies that estimate both costs and consequences of alternative prevention (e.g., lockdown, handwashing, physical distancing), contact-tracing, quarantine, treatment, and rehabilitation interventions (62, 63) .The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Materials, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.","Mauritius","abstract","2020-11-10","11"

Jia et al. (2020) [12] studied the control of COVID-19 and the impact of policy interventions with meteorological factors in China using seven compartments. After fitting their model with officially published data, they estimated parameter values for the proposed model using Least-Squares procedure. After obtaining the reproduction number of each province in China, they proposed that the quarantine period must be long enough to reduce contact. They also introduced comprehensive meteorological index to represent the meteorological factors as well as vaccination strategies for different control measures. Mushayabasa et al. (2020) [18] studied the role of governmental action and individual reaction on COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa using mathematical modeling approach. The proposed model examines relevant biological factors and effects of individual behavioral reaction including some interventions like consistent hygiene measures, quarantine, lock-down among others. Using officially published South African COVID-19 data available as at March 2020 to early May 2020, the model examines the optimal conditions necessary for the infection to die out and persist. Other commendable research works can be found in [15, 16, 34] and references therein.The current study examines the effect of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical controls in curbing the infectiousness of the novel coronavirus disease. The incorporated pharmaceutical interventions include a perfect vaccine with varying potency and efficacy level for the susceptible individuals. Due to the over saturated nature of both the private and public hospitals because of the rapidly growing number of confirmed cases, the model considered personal treatment as an alternative to the South African government's provided treatments. The same reason also applies to the already congested and oversubscribed isolation and quarantine centers provided by the South African government; we include self isolation mechanism as a non-pharmaceutical control techniques. Since no research has shown that some people are permanently immune from COVID-19, we considered that the infected individuals can become susceptible immediately after recovery. Furthermore, we considered the effect of social distancing and its efficacy level as well as vaccination. All these underline the novelty of this research work because to the best of our knowledge, no such model has considered both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control mechanism concurrently. To examine the reliability of the model, the model parameters were parameterized using officially published South African COVID-19 data that provide a realistic assessment and estimation of the severity of the virus in the country population.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discussed materials and methods used in the analysis as well as the model formulation. The main analytic results are discussed in section 3. Section 4 entails the numerical simulation and the projected impacts of the interventions while section 5 discussed and compared results with the existing literature findings. Finally, the paper ends with a concluding remark in section 6.The novel COVID-19 model we proposed consists of 10 mutually exclusive compartments of susceptible class S(t), vaccinated susceptible class S v (t), unvaccinated susceptible class S uv (t), Exposed class E(t), individuals on government's quarantined facility G Q (t), individuals on personal quarantine facility P Q (t), infected individuals I(t), individuals on personal treatment (P T ), individuals on government's treatment facility G T (t) and the recovered class R(t) such that the total population is given byWe need to declare here that Λ is the recruitment rate of individuals into the community. The susceptible class is reduced by a proportion ρ for the vaccinated susceptible individuals who move directly into the S v class while a proportion (1 − ρ) who are not vaccinated perhaps due to lack of information or fear of contracting the virus move to the S uv (t) class. The proportion of people who are found uninfected after the 14-day governments' quarantine move to the S class at the rate b 2 , e is the rate at which vaccinated susceptible persons loses their immunity and return to the susceptible class.Those who are equally found uninfected after the 14-day personal quarantine also move to the susceptible class at the rate b 1 , the recovered persons after treatment or after being tested negative loss their immunity and hence return back to the susceptible class at the rate η 2 . The susceptible class is further reduced through natural death µ and breakthrough of infection after successfully contacting an infected individuals leading to infection at the rate λ given bywhere θ 1 , θ 2 is the contact rate for the exposed class E and infected class I respectively through contact with infected surface, droplet and infected individuals who failed to practice social distancing. It is worth noting here that we only considered infection can be contracted by individuals in classes E and I only because all other infected classes are either on treatment or quarantined and are assumed to be less involved in the transmission process. The unvaccinated susceptible class S uv is reduced by breakthrough of infection denoted by λ and consequently moved to the I class.The exposed class E is composed of susceptible individuals who are infected at the rate λS and vaccinated susceptible individuals at the rate λS v who have been infected after successful contact with individuals who tested positive. They are reduced by movement of individuals at the rate v 1 in to G Q class, v 2 into I class, v 3 into P Q class and natural death at the rate µ. We should also mention here that the exposed individuals also include those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, this can be confirmed and affirmed by available published data from WHO that around 80% of the COVID-19 confirmed and tested cases show mild or no symptoms [30] . More so, persons in this class especially those who are 65 years and above or individuals suffering from underlying ailment can develop a mild form of pneumonia that are expected to self-isolate for minimum period of 14 days [23, 32] . Furthermore, majority of persons in this class whether with symptoms or not can be diagnosed through effective testing and contact tracing of the contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases which consequently move to I(t) class, quarantined or treated.The I class contains progression from E class at the rate v 2 , G Q class at the rate h 1 , P T class at the rate h 2 , force of infection from S uv at the rate λS uv and the class is reduced by treatment rates f 1 and f 2 , death rate µ and COVID-19 induced death rate δ. The compartment P T and G T consist of progression rates f 1 and f 2 respectively from I class, COVID-19 induced death rates δ 2 and δ 1 respectively and recovery rates τ 2 and τ 1 respectively while η 2 is the loss of immunity rate after recovery.The model is given by the following autonomous nonlinear differential equationsunder the following initial conditionsLemma 3.2. The biological invariant region χ = (S, S v , S uv , E, G Q , P Q , I, P T , G T , R) ∈ R 10 + :is positively attracting and invariant for the model (3)- (12) .Using Gronwall inequality, the solution of (14) is given byIt can be observed thatTherefore, χ is positively invariant. Hence, it is sufficient to study the COVID-19 model in χ. Thus, we conclude that the model (3)-(12) is epidemiologically welposed and attracting [9, 21, 22] .The virus-free equilibrium of (3)-(12) is given by, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 , (15) whereThe linear stability of Ψ * can be carried out using the next generation matrix operator [6, 26] on (3)- (12) . The new infection term F and the transfer term V are expressed asUsing ρ as the spectral radius (magnitude of the dominate eigenvalue) of the next generation matrix FV −1 , the reproduction number is given bywhereThe threshold parameter R A is the control reproduction number of (3)- (12) . It is used in measuring the average number of new COVID-19 cases generated by a single infected individual introduced into a community/population where a certain fraction of the population is under vaccination.Hence, we have the result below.The proof is standard and can be established using theorem 2 of [26] .We re-express equation (17) asThe constituent reproduction number R E can be interpreted as the product of the infection rate of susceptible and vaccinated susceptible individuals by the exposed humans near the VFE given bywhere the average period of time spent by the exposed humans in the exposed compartment E is given by 1 K 5 . The constituent reproduction number R I can be interpreted in component as follows.The proportion v 2 of exposed individuals that survive the incubation period progresses to the infected class I after spending an average period of 1 K 5 in E given by v 2 K 5 while that of v 1 is the proportion of exposed individuals quarantined in a government facility after spending a period of 1The remaining proportion v 3 goes back home to self-quarantined after spending a period of 1The expression h 1is for the proportion of individuals that progressed to the I class after 14-day period in government's quarantine facility (personal quarantine facility) respectively. The infection rate of susceptible, vaccinated susceptible and unvaccinated susceptible individuals by the infected humans near the VFE is given bywhere, as mentioned earlier, the average period of time spent in the infected compartment I is given by 1 K 8 . Thus, the summation R E + R I = R A .Furthermore, in the absence of any pharmaceutical interventions ie. setting all pharmaceutical intervention parameters ρ, γ 1 , f 1 and f 2 to zero in (17), we havewhereClearly R N P I > R A which means that the non-pharmaceutical intervention will significantly reduce the community transmission and the rate of secondary infection. Similarly, in the absence of all non-pharmaceutical interventions, ie. setting all non-pharmaceutical intervention parameters v 1 and v 3 to zero in (17), we havewhereK 5 = v 2 + µ. Clearly R P I > R A which also means that the pharmaceutical intervention will significantly reduce the community transmission and the rate of secondary infection. When strict social distancing measure is implemented, i.e. when θ 1 = θ 2 = 0 then R A = 0. This clearly means that strict social distancing can go a long way in reducing the generation of inter-community transmission of COVID-19 to zero. This is in confirmation with the recommendation of the World Health Organization [8, 20] and the work of [11] .To get the basic reproduction number without any control measures, we set all intervention parameters to zero i.e. ρ = γsince S * = N * . It is easy to conclude thatandwhich is in confirmation and agreement with the work of [11] . Simulating all the results in this section using the parameter values and data presented under section 4 when ρ = γ 1 = 0.8, the reproduction number in equation (17) when all the control measures are implemented gives 0.5521 (< 1 which is locally asymptotically stable). The one in equation (18) when only the non-pharmaceutical intervention is implemented gives 19.4827 (> 1 which is not locally asymptotically stable) while that of equation (19) when only the pharmaceutical intervention is implemented gives 0.8133 (< 1 which is locally asymptotically stable) . When all interventions are set to zero as appeared in equation (20), the reproduction number becomes 19.6815 (> 1 which is not locally asymptotically stable). All these are in good agreement with the expressions in equation (21) and (22).Taking South Africa as a case study, we present the numerical simulation of the presented model equations (3)- (12) to understand the impacts of all intervention strategies.The detailed acquisition of the data and the estimation of model parameters using the officially published COVID-19 data within the period of July 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 shall be extensively discussed here. The simple rationale behind the choice of taking South Africa as a case study is because South Africa has maintained the crown as the COVID-19 epicenter in Africa. The Figure 2 (reproduced in bar-chart form) shows the spread of the pandemic across several countries in the world.As at July 31, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in South Africa was 493,183 [31] with 135,214 active cases which account for approximately 2.5% of the total world COVID-19 cases [31] . More worryingly, South Africa is currently ranked 5th among the most affected countries. In the month of July alone, South Africa recorded more than 60% of their total confirmed cases. The month of July, according to experts, is the peak of cases detection in the country and it really underlines the reason why the country is considered best choice for this research.According to the South African mid-year population [25] , the migration/recruitment rate is estimated at 18% of the total population which is 1,039,749 equivalent to 2,795 people per day. Hence, parameter Λ = 2, 795. It is also revealed from the data that South African life expectancy for both sexes is 64.88 years, therefore the natural death rate is given by µ = 1 64.88 . The total reported death from COVID-19 complications with the period of July 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 is 5,256 which makes the death rate estimated at δ = 0.0157. Since the data for those that die under both personal and government treatments are not clearly differentiated, we assume that δ 1 = 0.0112 and δ 2 = 0.0142. It was also gathered that 71.% of infected people recovered so that the recovery rate is for people under treatment in a government owned hospital is 0.710 and we assume that τ 2 = 0.0212 for those under personal treatment.All other parameter values are extracted from available literature and referenced in Table 1 . After fitting the South African data to the model, from table 2, we set I = 159, 333 for the number of detected and confirmed cases. Since no vaccine is available presently, we set S v = S uv = 0. All other state variables can not be determined from the available data as at the time of this research, so we chose the following E = 290, 000, G Q = 220, 000, P Q = 40, 000, P T = 15, 000, G T = 120, 000, R = 85, 000.The South African population as at 2019 is estimated at 58,775,022 [25] , therefore N = 58 × 10 6 and hence S = N − (I + S v + S uv + E + G Q + P Q + P T + G T + R) = 55 × 10 6 .To test the suitability of the model equations (3)-(12) to assess the impacts of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions in curbing the global pandemic, we have extracted the monthly spread of the South African confirmed cases as appeared in figure  3 . Since the month of July is the focus, we have consequently extracted the number of daily confirmed cases for the said month as appeared in Table 2 .Using the earlier mentioned data, the equations (3)-(12) give a very good fit of the South African COVID-19 data for the period of July 1, 2020-July 31, 2020 as depicted in Figure 4 . More-so, to examine the closeness of the model equations to the published data, Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) method shall be used [13] .The model (3)- (12) is firstly simulated for the special case where the only implemented intervention is social distancing. Doing this will make it convenient for us to examine the impact of social-distancing measures as the only anti-COVID-19 intervention strategy in the country. It is worth noting here that social-distancing is measured in terms of the reduction in the numerical values of θ 1 and θ 2 (known as contact rates ) from their baseline values. The result obtained is presented in figure 5 in terms of the associated reproduction number.We also have to mention here that the point where contact rates θ 1 = θ 2 = 0 corresponds to 100% level of social distancing while θ 1 = θ 2 = 1 corresponds to absolute abuse/absence of the social distancing intervention. This is because social distancing is a measure of reduction in contact rates. When contact rates reduce, social distancing is upheld and when contact rates is high, social distancing is abused. From the presented figure 5 , when θ 1 = θ 2 = 0 (when social distancing is at 100%) the reproduction number which accounts for the rate at which community transmission occurs becomes zero. Also, when θ 1 = θ 2 = 1 (when social distancing is totally disregarded) the reproduction number becomes very high which is very dangerous in the fight against COVID-19. This is in confirmation with the recommendation of WHO regarding the importance of social distancing and lock-down.It can be observed that the higher the social distancing with different level of vaccination and vaccine efficacy, the lower the COVID-19 transmission rate. In fact when the vaccination is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction number was 2.2 in figure 6 (a) but when vaccination is at 100%, the community COVID-19 transmission reduced to 0.08 in figure  6 (d) which should be enough to contain the spread of the dreadful pandemic. We also note in figure (5) that in the absence of social-distancing measure ie. when θ 1 = θ 2 = 1 the reproduction number was 30 but when vaccination was introduced at %100, the transmission rate dropped to 0.08 as depicted in figure 6 (d) . This also underlines the effect of robust vaccination in the fight against the notorious pandemic.We further incorporate both personal and government treatments to the already established vaccination programme. Figure 7 shows the effect of different level of treatments under vaccination intervention.Finally we shall examine the combined effect of all the intervention strategies. We shall consider the combined effects of pharmaceutical interventions first followed by non-pharmaceutical interventions and then consider when both are concurrently implemented to combat the pandemic.A novel COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 which has infected 21,388,904 persons with more than 764,17 deaths across the globe as at August 15, 2020 at 3:00 pm [31] . Neither effective treatment nor vaccine is available at the moment, attentions are consequently shifted to non pharmaceutical interventions such as maintenance of physical/social-distancing, use of nose-mask, face-shield, lock-down enforcement, restriction of movement of non essential workers, shut down of economy, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of infected individuals among others. Efforts are also in advanced stage that an anti-COVID 19 vaccine will be globally approved sooner rather than later.After establishing the basic properties of the model which include positivity solution and invariant region, we established the condition for local stability of the virus-free equilibrium (VFE) and we claimed that the VFE is stable when the associated threshold parameters is less than unity. The Theorem was stated which can be proved using Theorem 2 of [26] . The biological implication of this is that the novel corona-virus will die out of the community whenever the associated threshold parameters R o < 1, R N P I < 1, R P I < 1 as the case maybe. In other words, if both recommended interventions (ie. social distancing, quarantine, treatment and vaccination) are fully implemented, the threshold parameters can be brought down to less than unity and consequently ensure the eradication of the pandemic. This has been simulated under equations (19)-(22) as mentioned earlier.Using the officially published South African COVID-19 data, the model equations (3)-(12) gave a very good fit of the South African COVID-19 data for the period of July 1, 2020-July 31, 2020 as depicted in Figure 4 . Furthermore, to qualitatively assess the closeness of the model against the real data, we employed the Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) method. We used MATLAB to obtain α o = 0.0832 and α 1 = 0.9707 (with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals [0.0360 0.1101] and [0.9281 0.9782], respectively) and R 2 = 0.9991 using the aforementioned initial data and parameter values in Table 1 and 2.Several reproduction numbers were calculated such as the basic reproduction number R o , the reproduction number for pharmaceutical intervention only R P I and the reproduction number for non-pharmaceutical intervention only R N P I . We also explicitly explain that the reproduction number (which is the measure of average number of new virus infection developed by a single COVID-19 infected individual in a community) is low (which makes the virus transmission controllable) when intervention programmes are adequately implemented and high when no intervention is implemented. This kind of analysis is missing in majority of the published COVID-19 models. Though it was partly analyzed in [11] which was not as detailed as the one presented here and obviously missing in [15] , [17] , [18] and [20] .The model was first simulated to obtain the effects of social distancing as the only intervention strategy, while the other intervention strategies are set to zero. The result as depicted in figure 5 shows that the reproduction number drastically reduced from 30 to 5 as the physical distancing is adequately implemented in the country. The reproduction number consequently becomes zero when the physical distancing is maximum i.e (when θ 1 = θ 2 = 0) and becomes 30 when no physical distancing is upheld and free mixing,We further examined the impacts of social distancing with different vaccination level and vaccine efficacy on the Reproduction Number in order to grasp the level of vaccination and vaccine efficacy needed to curb the dynamics in South Africa. We considered the effects of Social Distancing with 10%, 40%, 80% and 100% levels of vaccination and efficacy. It can be seen that when social distancing remains constant, the reproduction rate of new infected confirmed cases reduces drastically as the vaccine coverage and efficacy increases. According to figures 6 (a,b,c,d) , when the vaccination is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction number was 2.2 in figure 6 (a) but when vaccination is at 100%, the community COVID-19 transmission reduced to 0.08 in figure 6(d). Though it seems extremely difficult to obtain this level of vaccine coverage and efficacy for many reasons. This is because sufficient vaccine will be less available at the early stage of the vaccination process which may not be enough to cover a country of almost 60 million population like South Africa. The vaccine, at early production stage, may still be prone to some clinical errors needed to be rectified as time goes on. So vaccination level and efficacy of upto 80%, 90% etc for almost 60 million population will seriously take a long period of time before it can be achievable. That is the more reason why the simulation complemented vaccination coverage with treatment and other non-intervention strategies like social distancing.The impacts of vaccination with different treatment levels of anti-COVID-19 treatment on the Reproduction Number was also examined. It can be observed that the higher the vaccination and vaccine efficacy with different treatment levels, the lower the COVID-19 reproduction number. In fact, when the treatment level is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction number was 12, but when the treatment level is at 100%, the community COVID-19 transmission reduced to 4 which accounts for almost 70% reduction in community transmission. This also underlines the importance of treatment and vaccination as recommended by the WHO.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the causative agent of the novel COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Within a very short period of time, the virus has claimed lives of thousands of infected persons while more than 2 million persons are hospitalized.We considered the impacts of social distancing only on the Reproduction Number. We also investigated and compared the possible impact of social distancing with different levels of vaccination on the Reproduction Number. Furthermore, we examined the impacts of vaccination while different levels of treatment was administered. Using the officially published South African COVID-19 data, the numerical simulation showed that the community reproduction number will be 30 when there is no social distancing but will drastically reduced to 5 when social distancing is adequately implemented to some certain degree of compliance. This accounts for more than 80% reduction in disease transmission. More so, when vaccination with good efficacy was implemented, the community reproduction number was 4 which increases to 12 without vaccination. This accounts for almost 70% reduction in disease transmission.Finally, we established that the implementation of both interventions is enough to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus disease in South Africa, which is in confirmation with the recommendation of the world health organization and provided a better insight to the pandemic than several other existing research work such as [11] (whose model is less detailed) and [12] (whose work does not involve both interventions we considered).","South Africa","abstract","2020-11-16","11"

WHO subsequently declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020 following its spread to more than 114 countries with nearly 120,000 cases detected . As of mid-April 2020, more than 1.8 million cases were confirmed and a rising trend was observed largely due to low awareness on the novel virus, poor detection techniques, and delays in the implementation of interventions. It was particularly predicted that the outbreak would be worse in African countries due to the prevailing factors such as poor socioeconomic status, poor health systems, low testing efficiency, and the onset of the dry season (Zhao et al., 2020) .Africa was expected to be at a higher risk of infection due to her densely populated communities and the communicable nature of COVID-19 Kenya, among other African nations, was prioritized for monitoring by WHO due to her close links with the disease epicenter, inadequate and insufficient capacity among other challenges (Velavan and Meyer, 2020) . The first case in Africa was reported in Egypt on 15 th February 2020 while the first case in Kenya was reported in Nairobi on 12 th March 2020 by the Ministry of Health (Aluga, 2020) . Kenya promptly put in place several precautionary contingency measures since February 2020 to mitigate the pandemic in its early stages. These measures included: the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as face masks to limit the spread of COVID-19; use of surgical gloves for the protection against surfaces or items contaminated with the virus; use of alcohol-based sanitizers for disinfecting hands or surfaces and use of soaps for handwashing (NEMA, 2020; MOH, 2020a) . Additional prescribed measures included the observance of social distancing, working from home, staying at home and avoiding congregation, maintaining good respiratory hygiene while coughing and sneezing, travel restrictions, provision of hand sanitizers, and handwashing in public places by proprietors and in public transport among other measures (Aluga, 2020; MOH, 2020a) .COVID-19 has arguably underscored the importance of single-use plastic especially in the management of the virus (Schlegel, 2020) and as a safe alternative for many applications despite its environmental liability in most other applications (Klemes et al., 2020) . Single-use masks contain plastic polymers such as polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyacrylonitrile; gloves are made of latex rubber which contains some chemical additives (Tamir, 2019) . The other COVID-19 related products contain plastic polymers and plastic packaging materials that ultimately accumulate in the environment and degrade into microplastic pieces .Generally, the progression of the pandemic has created an upsurge in demand for PPE both for frontline healthcare workers and the general public. The global monthly demand by healthcare workers alone was estimated at 89 million medical masks, 76 million gloves, and 1.6 million goggles (WHO, 2020) . In China, for example, mask production increased significantly with 200 million face masks produced per day in June 2020 which was more than twenty times the amount produced at the beginning of February 2020 (Aragaw, 2020). The increase in demand for PPE was accompanied by an increase in post-consumer PPE waste. For instance, Wuhan hospitals generated a daily average of 240 tons of medical waste, representing nearly a 480% increase. Usage by the public is unquantified globally but may far exceed the demand by healthcare workers, for instance, there has been an increase in garbage from PPE such as masks and gloves in the USA (Calma, 2020). Although singleuse PPEs have been regarded as effective in the fight against COVID-19, there are rising environmental concerns about their contribution to the plastic waste that is leaking to the environment (Edmond, 2020; Mukhopadhyay, 2020; Winters, 2020) .The persistence of the pandemic globally has shifted the priority to people's health with little focus on the impact of the virus on the environment. The first studies pointed out the indirect impact on the environment i.e. reduction of particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and NO 2 concentrations in China (Yuan et al., 2020) ; drop in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy (Global Carbon Project, 2020) and cleaner beaches due to reduced waste generation by tourism activities in Acapulco, Barcelona and Salinas beaches (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) . Whereas these studies pointed out the positive effect of COVID-19 such as ecosystems recovery from air and water pollution, depletion of groundwater level, and other issues caused by human activities (Chakraborty and Maity, 2020), the pandemic has also elicited negative indirect effects, for example, the suspension of bans on single-use plastics and recycling programs in the USA due to concerns about the risk of spreading the virus in recycling centers. Some countries have also imposed restrictions prohibiting infected persons from direct waste handling/separation to protect the waste recyclers. These measures have reduced recycling and promoted the mixing of medical waste such as contaminated masks, gloves, used or expired medications with domestic waste Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) . The pandemic has further favored a shift to single-use plastics for safety and hygiene reasons as well as an upsurge in take-away packaging and online shopping.In general, several countries have experienced a significant increase in the discarded PPE items occasioned by their mandatory use and increased demand resulting in mismanagement due to incorrect disposal in public places and the natural environment . In Kenya, the production of fabric non-surgical masks by textile factories and tailors is on the rise for those who cannot afford the single-use masks. This follows a government directive to wear masks in public places (Arakpogun et al., 2020) . This initiative has enabled the country to fill in the gap in the demand and supply of surgical masks. About 60% of clothing materials used for fabric masks contain plastic, which includes polyester, acrylic, and nylon textiles (UNEP, 2019). These plastics pose a significant threat to marine life in the form of microfibers that may be ingested and cause the biomagnification of toxins at higher levels of the food chain (UNEP, 2019). The face masks can also degrade into smaller particles usually less than 5 mm due to various environmental conditions (Schimidt et al., 2018) . These particles can persist in the environment and continue to pose risk to human health and the environment by harboring infectious pathogens and polluting land and marine ecosystems (NEMA, 2020).In foresight of the potential risk of spreading the infection through discarded PPE and to control environmental pollution, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Kenya's principal Agency on environmental protection and conservation, developed guidelines for sound management of COVID-19 related waste. The guidelines outline comprehensive ways to manage COVID-19 related waste at the public, community, and household levels as well as those generated in the treatment and quarantine of COVID -19 patients (NEMA, 2020) . Despite the issuance of these guidelines, wastes related to the pandemic including disposable and reusable masks, gloves, soap wrappers, wet wipes, liquid hand wash, and alcohol-based sanitizer bottles are often mismanaged and are now becoming common on the streets, beaches, and dumpsites in Kenya. Mombasa metro area has a population of 1,296,000 people (KNBS, 2019) . It is estimated that over 1.3 million disposable masks are used in Mombasa daily assuming that each individual utilizes one disposable mask per day. This translates to about 16 million masks used annually, putting a strain on the already existing ineffective waste management system.Previous studies by Okuku et al. (2020a) on marine litter pollution along the Kenya coast reported that most beach litter originated from land sources and were mainly dominated by plastics (11.15 ± 4.49 items m −1 day −1 ). Currently PPE and sanitizing waste comprise less than one percent of the total waste in Kenya (Koome and Paffenholz, 2020). However, with the growing number of COVID-19 cases and lack of proper waste management strategies in place, it is expected that there will be an increase in PPE, sanitizer bottles, wet wipes, and other COVID-19 related waste loads on the streets, beaches, and other accessible public places (Kalina and Tilley, 2020). The directives on beach closure effected on 15th March 2020 in Mombasa and cessation of movement into and out of three coastal counties, (Kilifi, Mombasa, and Kwale) on 16th April 2020 (National Emergency Response Committee on Corona Virus, 2020) was therefore expected to reduce beach litter loads significantly. However, litter can still be transported to the waterways (if not disposed of appropriately) through surface runoff; particularly in the Kenyan coastal counties where consistent and sustainable waste disposal is still a challenge. Whereas medical facilities are equipped to deal with bio-hazardous waste, proper disposal of PPE from households is still a major concern.June 19 th , 2020 marked 100 days since the first case was reported in Kenya with 2,705 active cases, 4,374 total cases, and 119 deaths (MOH, 2020b). This paper explores the contribution of COVID-19 related litter to the litter stream in the streets, beaches, and in the coastal areas after 100 days since the disease was first reported in Kenya by describing their composition, quantities, and distribution.The surveys were carried out in June 2020. The surveys covered beaches in urban and remote areas ( Table 1 ). The study scope consisted of street, beach, and floating litter surveys. All the litter was collected and grouped as COVID-19 related and other categories which were non-COVID-19 (plastic, rubber, paper, processed wood, building and construction materials, marine and fishing gear, clothing, glass, foam, metal, hygiene products e.g. diapers, condoms and others). Litter items considered as COVID-19 related included masks, gloves, sanitizer containers, soap wrappers, wet wipes, and liquid hand wash bottles.Street surveys were carried out in the major streets connecting or adjacent to the surveyed beaches (Table 1) to determine the relationship between the COVID-19 related litter on the streets, beaches, and floating on the ocean. A distance between 200 m and 2000 m (depending on the length of the street) was surveyed for marine litter, with special attention to COVID-19 related litter. Litter was picked from a width of 2 m on both sides of the street (and not on the main street). All items were cleaned, characterized, counted, weighed, and the information recorded.Standing stock surveys on the beaches (Figure 1 ) were carried out with the main focus on COVID-19 related waste. The start and endpoints for the surveyed sections were geo-referenced using Garmin GPS Map 2S. The surveys traversed the entire width of the beaches from the edge of water up to 2 m into the vegetation or the wall at the back of the beach. The length of the sampled beach sections ranged between 50 m and 300 m depending on the length of the beach and the amount of litter encountered at the time of the survey ( Table 2 ).All macro litter (>25 mm) were collected following a parallel walking pattern from the water edge to the vegetation line or back of the beach. All the collected litter was thoroughly cleaned of trapped sand on the folds of the litter and stored in woven refuse bags for analysis. Litter items containing unknown substances were counted, characterized and the weights in our inventory list were used. Sorting and analysis were centrally executed by well-trained volunteers under the close supervision of senior scientists as a quality control measure. Litter counting and weighing were done per item type (such as lollipop sticks, diapers, bottles, etc.). The items were classified as COVID-19 related and others including; plastic, rubber, paper, processed wood, building and construction materials, marine and fishing gear, clothing, glass, foam, metal, hygiene objects, and other objects.Floating litter visual surveys were done concurrently with surface trawl surveys. Two observers seated on both sides of the boat observed and recorded macro plastics seen within 5 m bands. The start and end time, together with geo-referenced locations were noted. Floating litter trawl surveys were carried out using a 300 µm mesh sized Manta trawl net fitted with a flow meter. Trawl transects were georeferenced using Garmin GPS Map 2S as described by Dris et al. (2015) . Line transects were conducted collecting triplicate samples from every station. The manta net was secured towards the edge of a horizontally mounted pole to avoid collecting disturbed marine litter by the boat engine. The manta net was deployed depending on the direction of the prevailing waves while ensuring that the hood of the trawl net rode on the water surface to capture and deflect waves into the net at approximately 2 knots (Setälä et al., 2016) . The net was retrieved after every 15 minutes and the collected samples put in a clean bucket where the large seaweeds were washed and removed from the samples. The remaining samples were preserved with 70% ethanol, kept in tightly closed glass containers, and transported to the laboratory for analysis.In the laboratory, samples were sorted in trays by three people who worked alternately on each sample for 15 minutes each. Observers picked any visible litter item using a tweezer, placed them in a petri dish, and recorded: date of sample collection, transect code, the litter type, and count in datasheets. The litter was categorized as COVID-19 related, soft plastics, foam and Styrofoam, fiber and plastic line, and hard plastic. Thereafter, the results were tallied and entered into a Microsoft® Excel database for further analysis.The density of litter items was obtained using the formula: The density of COVID-19 related litter items encountered on the surveyed streets were in the order of Nyali > Mkomani > Pirates > Gazi > Mtwapa/ Coppacabbana > Forty Thieves > Shariani/ Kuruwitu while the rest of the sampled streets (Warm sea sand, Jacaranda beach road, Malindi Jetty and Tiwi) had densities of less than 0.01 items m -1 (Figure 2 ). Mombasa County (Nyali, Mkomani, and Pirates) reported the highest number of COVID-19 related litter items compared to Kilifi and Kwale counties. Most people in Mombasa County were observing guidelines set by the Kenya Ministry of Health after the county was ranked second, countrywide, following Nairobi County that had recorded high numbers of COVID-19 cases in Kenya (MOH, 2020b). When COVID-19 epidemic was declared a national disaster, there was heightened public health awareness which resulted in the large use of PPE and sanitizing resources; especially single-use disposable masks, with little effort put on environmental awareness on proper disposal of generated waste . The majority of the COVID-19 related litter items found on the streets of Mkomani and Nyali were wet wipes and single-use masks.In comparison, a study was done by Ouhsine, (2020) in central Morocco found an increase in PPE (masks and gloves) during the COVID-19 lockdown while a study by Fadare and Okoffo (2020) reported the presence of face masks along a highway and drainage in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Single-use masks were similarly encountered in parks and along the roads in the USA and Hong Kong (Mukhopadhyay, 2020; Winters, 2020) .Low densities of COVID-19 related litter items in relatively remote areas reported in a survey of 31 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f provinces in China were similarly observed during this study. This observation could be due to rural residents not strictly adhering to COVID-19 preventive measures as much as urban area residents (Chen and Chen, 2020) since the spread of COVID-19 in sparsely populated areas is lower than in urban areas (Diop et al., 2020) . This can also be attributed to the preference and reliance on affordable reusable cloth masks and bar soaps for handwashing compared to the higher-end cleansing products common in urban areas. The government has promoted investment in innovative ways through which the demand for face masks has been met locally i.e. manufacture of fabric masks. Since then, there has been a surge in their numbers due to their accessibility affordability and they can be reused over time contrary to the single-use masks (Aloui-Zarrouk et al., 2020) .Eleven out of fourteen streets surveyed recorded COVID-19 related litter as a result of improper disposal. This poses risks to the environment, by adding to the bulk plastics in the aquatic environment. Prata et al., (2020) similarly reported inappropriate disposal of PPE as the main contributing factor to litter pollution in several public places as well as in the natural environment. The litter on the streets is of concern given that they can be washed into water bodies through surface runoff thus adding to the number of macro-plastics in the ocean (Fadare et al., 2020) . For instance, wet wipes are a source of white microplastic fibers in the marine environment that may enter the food chain and act as a vector for potentially harmful contaminants (Galafassi et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2004) .Among the COVID-19 related litter, sanitizer and detergent hand wash bottles that were recorded during the survey were perceived to be as a result of their use as a preventive measure to curb the pandemic. A report from global hand sanitizers on impacts of COVID-19 analysis forecast 2019-2020 reported an increase from 1.35 billion before COVID-19 to 1.87 billion during COVID-19 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020). These items are similarly a potential risk to the marine environment and human health (Geissen et al., 2015) since they have a low biodegradation rate (Ammala, 2013) .Generally, the waste from responses to disasters has not been discussed with regards to waste management but is lightly discussed in disaster relief and logistics literature (Kalina and Tilley, 2020). Moreover, little scholarly attention has been directed to sustainable and hygienic management of infectious waste (Brown and Milke 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . Safe management of domestic waste could be critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, since domestic medical waste such as masks, gloves, due to self-medication at home can easily be mixed with domestic waste and leak into the environment (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020).Generally, COVID-19 related items were encountered in low densities (0.1 items m -2 ) representing 0.43% of the total litter items (Figure 3 , Supplementary S1-S6) The low densities could be attributed to the closure of beaches for recreational purposes and cessation of movement into the three counties which hindered both domestic and foreign tourism. Zambrano-Monserrate et al., (2020) similarly concluded that reduced touristic activities, as a result of the social distancing measures had caused a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f notable change in the appearance of many beaches in the world. Beaches such as Acapulco (Mexico), Barcelona (Spain), and Salinas (Ecuador) were cleaner with crystal clear waters. Ormaza and Castro (2020) also reported cleaner beaches in a study carried out in Ecuador which was attributed to confinement and social distancing measures set by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic season. This positive observation was despite the reported increase in use and existence of PPE such as face masks, gloves in over 50 countries including Ecuador, Austria, Venezuela, Morocco, Argentina, Spain, Portugal (Ormaza and Castro, 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020) .During the study, 18 out of the 24 surveyed beaches along the Kenya coast had COVID-19 related litter items in the order: Mkomani > Copacabana > Kuruwitu > Vanga > Turtle Bay > Msambweni > Nyali > Kwa Ngala > Kenyatta > Tiwi > Malindi Jetty > Shelly > Pirates > Tradewinds > Maua Watamu beach, while the remaining beaches (Gazi, Gazi Boardwalk, Baobab, Jacaranda, Mkwiro, Forty Thieves, Scorpio, Shimoni, Warm Sea sand and Wasini beaches) had less than 1.0×10 -4 items m ⁻ 2 (Figure 3 ). The existence of these items in the beaches could be attributed to illegal beach visitation and runoff from the streets that transport improperly disposed PPE and other COVID-19 related wastes as also reported in Portugal by Prata et al. (2020) .Mkomani, an urban beach in Mombasa County located near the mouth of Tudor creek, had the highest density of COVID-19 related litter items (Figure 3 ). This is potentially due to the beaching of seaborne litter discharged into the creek through runoff from Nguu Tatu, new Mombasa solid waste dumpsite, (Hamid, 2017) , runoff from Mombasa town through the storm drains as well as litter input from Kombeni and Tsalu rivers flow into the creek. Similar studies by Asensio-Montesinos et al. (2020) found that beaches located close to the mouth of a river had more diverse litter, and wastewater and surface runoff deposit hygiene products like earbuds, wet wipes, and condoms, with numbers increasing disproportionately after heavy rain events. Additionally, the position of Mkomani beach in Tudor creek could further facilitate the deposition of litter ashore (Okuku et al., 2020a; Okuku et al., 2020b; Liubartseva et al., 2019) . Notably, recreational beaches in urban areas of Mombasa (Pirates, Nyali) that are frequented by visitors all year-round had low densities of COVID-19 related litter.Densities of COVID-19 related litter items in urban beaches ranged between 0.00 to 3.8×10 -2 items m -2 whereas in remote beaches ranges were from 0.00 to 5.6×10 -2 items m -2 (Figure 3 ). The higher densities in remote beaches could be partly attributed to the differences in compliance with the Government of Kenya directive on the closure of public beaches (National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus, 2020). People in rural areas tend to adhere less to the directive. It was noted that there were still beachgoers and activities (e.g. swimming and sports) ongoing in Msambweni and Kuruwitu beaches during the survey, despite the Government directive on beach closure. Similar findings of non-adherence to directives were also observed in China by Chen and Chen, (2020). The encounter of COVID-19 related items in remote beaches has similarly been reported by Oceans Asia (2020) in a 100 m stretch in the remote Soko islands beach, Hong Kong. Large quantities of latex gloves, face masks, and bottles of hand sanitizer were also encountered in the Mediterranean Sea (Konyn, 2020). No COVID-19 related litter was reported in Baobab, Shimoni, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Warm Sea sand beaches (Figure 3 ).A total of 150 litter items were observed floating in an area of 0.92 km 2 surveyed during the sampling period. The density of floating litter was higher in the areas adjacent to beaches of Kwale county (66 items km -2 ) compared to the areas adjacent to the beaches of Kilifi county (86 items km -2 ). There were no COVID-19 related items encountered. This could be attributed to their tendency to absorb water and float below the ocean surface or sink to the ocean floor where they are transported by water current and tidal movement (Oceans Asia, 2020; Fazey and Ryan, 2016). Genries, (2020) and Ammendolia et al. (2020) reported PPE debris on the seafloor of the Mediterranean. Masks were also discovered underwater in the remote Soko islands bay beach, Hong Kong (Oceans Asia, 2020)Generally, no COVID-19 related litter was captured during the surface trawl surveys, whereas the non-COVID-19 litter category had a density of 347,337 items Km -2 . The non-COVID-19 related litter included soft plastic (126,236 items Km -2 ), hard plastic (137,950 items Km -2 ), and plastic line/fibres (82,109 items Km -2 ) were the most dominant among the litter items encountered, while foam and styrofoam (1,042 items Km -2 ) were the least abundant ( Figure 4 ).Floating litter in Kilifi county was higher (289,698 items Km -2 ) compared to Kwale county (75,922 items Km -2 ) and could be attributed to the litter input from the Athi-Galana-Sabaki river (Table 3) . Athi-Galana-Sabaki river is the second largest coastal river along the Kenyan coast with a lot of activities upstream and in the wider catchment area encompassing Nairobi city and other major towns that discharge their waste into the river before ending up in the Indian Ocean. Lebreton et al. (2017) estimated that between 1.15 and 2.41 million tons of plastic currently flow from the global riverine system into the oceans annually. They further estimated that 7.8% of river inputs of plastics into the oceans come from Africa, with the Indian Ocean having the second-highest quantity of floating plastics (59,130 tons) after the North Pacific (96,400 tons) (Ericksen et al., 2014) . Another major factor that may be contributing to higher floating litter counts in Kilifi County in comparison to Kwale County was the strong currents experienced during the South East Monsoon (SEM) that tend to transport litter towards the North. The contribution of the ocean currents as one of the factors that influence floating litter density in the ocean has been reported by Galgani et al. (2015) . Other studies have documented large variations in the density of floating debris in coastal water although, little is understood of the influence of nearshore dynamics (Compa et al., 2020) .The highest litter density (35,466 items Km -2 ) in Kwale County was observed off Gazi beach (Table  3 ). This could be due to the high density of the mangrove forest that trap litter in the bay as well as litter input from Kidogoweni and Mkurumudzi River as reported in Vietnam and Thailand by Norris et al. (2017) and Horstman et al. (2014) respectively. The sheltered nature of Gazi bay, against wave J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f action and ocean currents, may also lead to higher retention and harbor marine litter as reported in Cala d'Or, Mallorca Island by Compa et al. (2020) who documented higher retention of marine debris in small coves.COVID-19 prevention measures that restricted people's movement; lockdown, curfew, beach closure, and travel restriction, led to a significant decrease in the amount of marine litter on the beaches. Indicating that targeted intervention on the beach can greatly help reduce marine litter pollution. Although higher amounts of COVID-19 related litter were found on the streets, it is expected that this litter will ultimately end in the ocean through surface runoff, thus proper waste management is encouraged for all litter classes with special emphasis to COVID-19 related ones.

Such people might not be traceable all the time if they are unaware of being infected (i.e., asymptomatic), or if they have mild symptoms and choose not to take the COVID-19 test and to be reported. This issue could create a massive infection in the population if the control measures are not respected (such as wearing the face mask and social distancing). In fact, in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed superspreading [1, 2] events in several countries due to a single unreported case ( see, for example, in [3] [4] [5] ).Many countries used different approaches to identify infected people, such as massive testing. However, not every country has the meaning to test the maximum possible of their populations. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how unreported the COVID-19 cases contribute to the dynamic of the spread of this ongoing pandemic and the best public health control measures needed to contain this issue.To study this problem, we aim to investigate a mathematical model of the unreported cases of the COVID-19 in three north African countries: Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. We choose these countries because they belong to the same geographical region, North Africa, and their population similarity. However, each country is dealing with COVID-19 testing differently. From the available data in Our World Data Website [6] , only Morocco has reported the number of tests performed every day. As far as the testing policies, Egypt and Algeria test people with symptoms and key groups (i.e., key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, and returned from overseas).For Morocco, the testing policies are open public testing, which also includes the asymptomatic. For the tracing policies, public health in Morocco follows the ""Limited"" tracing. However, Algeria and Egypt are using the ""Comprehensive"" tracing, which means all cases are traced. Our study does not include Libya, due to the lack of data about the COVID-19, and Tunisia because the epidemic seems to be under control. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a wealth of mathematical models studied different aspects of the spread of the COVID-19; we mention a few [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In contrast to the mathematical model of reported and unreported COVID-19 infections by Magal and Webb [8] , we predict, in this work, the reported and unreported cases by taking into consideration the mobility of the population of three countries, which is provided in [18, 19] . These data allow justifying our choice of the right transmission rate of the disease in each country. For this purpose, we proposed the following system of differential equations), E(t) = β(t)S(t)(U(t) + E(t)) − µE(t), I(t) = pµE(t) − (γ + ρ)I(t), U(t) = (1 − p)µE(t) − γU(t),with the following initial conditionswhere S(t), E(t), I(t), U(t), and H(t) stand, respectively, for the susceptible population, exposed and asymptomatic individuals, reported infection cases, unreported infection cases, and hospitalized individuals due to the COVID-19 disease at time t. The incubation period for the COVID-19 is denoted by 1/µ = 5 days; 1/γ = 10 days is the average of the infection period for the COVID-19 [7, 10] . 1/ρ = 5 days represents the average of the period for an infected individual to stay in the infected stage (non declared infection case) for the COVID-19 infection until a complication appears. On the other hand, we assume that 80% of the infection cases are reported (p = 0.8) (see in [8] ). An infected individual remains in hospital for medical care from 10 to 22 days, depending on the individual's age and possible comorbidity. Here, we consider that this average to be 1/m = 15 days. The transmission rate functional is denoted by β(t) where it is assumed to take the following form.The time T stands for the date of implementing an efficient lockdown that leads to a decrease in the number of active infection cases. The rate ε represents the degree of efficiency of this restriction, where ε = 0 shows that this restriction is inefficient. The transmission functional β(t) in the suggested form Equation (2) represents the effects of the lockdown on the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease.The justify of our choice of β(t) is motivated by the mobility data and the data of reported cases in each country as presented in Figure 1 . In fact, the decline of mobility in public places and its increase in the residential area shows the level of adherence of the population to mobility restriction implemented by each country. On the other hand, the increasing part corresponding to Morocco and Algeria, can be expressed in our model by a constant transmission rateβ and the decreasing part can be expressed by the decreasing transmission where the degree of decrease is measured by rate ε, i.e., the efficiency of the governments restriction. The analysis of the data for Egypt is different from the other two countries. In this case, the active infection cases data continue to rise, which correspond to constant transmission rate β(t) =β (or ε = 0). To achieve the above goals, we arrange the paper in the following form. In the next section, we approximate the main parameters of our predictions and highlight the countries that have controlled the spread of the COVID-19 disease. Then, we project the peak of the active cases and the end of the epidemic in each of the three countries. In Section 3, we propose some measures that help to reduce the burden of the epidemic, such as increasing the number of tests per day to identify the unreported cases. Furthermore, the influence of these tests on predicting the epidemic peak is investigated. A conclusion section ends this paper.Based on WHO and Johns Hopkins University reports [20, 21] , we obtain the time series of the evolution of the reported active infection cases Figure 1 . Our goal is to understand how the evolution of the number of individuals asymptomatic stages affects the number of symptomatic persons. We will then give the approximative number of people in these stages using a system Equation (1). We will also connect the data obtained in Figure 1 and the mobility reports presented by Google [18] and Apple [19] .We start with Egypt. From Figure 1 , it is clear that the infection is increasing exponentially. This means that the control measures are not well respected. Although the mobility report in [18] shows a reduction of mobility of −50% in public places, −2% in grocery and pharmacy, −26% in parks, −44% in transit stations, and −13% in workplaces, there is +12% increase in the places of residence. We apply the least square method to estimate the parameter β(t). In fact, we can consider a constant transmission functional β(t) = β 0 . For the initial conditions, we assumed that all the population is susceptible, i.e., S 0 = 9.842 × 10 7 . For the reset of the initial, we used following values, E 0 = 785, I 0 = 160, U 0 = 128, and H 0 = 160. The best fit forβ isβ = 1.98 × 10 −9 , ε = 0. Moreover, the basic reproduction number corresponding to this country is R 0 = 1.3641 (Appendix A). Figure 2 shows that by 14 June there was ∼10,000 unreported COVID-19 cases and ∼48,000 asymptomatic cases. These predictions could an explanation to why the number of cases continue to rise in Egypt after 14 June. In the case of Morocco, from the mobility report [18] , we clearly see the mobility restriction implemented by this country had lead more reduction of population mobility compared to Egypt, with −54% in shops and leisure, −23% in food and pharmacies, −41% in parks, −51% in transit stations, −31% in workplaces, and +20% for the places of residence. These data reflect the impact of the state of medical emergency (lockdown) that Moroccan authorities declared on 20 March. On 9 June, the lockdown was relaxed in some less affected regions with the partial opening of the economy. The data in Figure 1 reflect this situation. We also find that the turning point which starts from T = 92 (8 April), where it shows the result of the complete restriction of the social movements, which reduces the active infection cases immediately. Based on this facts we approximate the parameters, where we find p = 0.8, γ = 1/10, µ = 1/5, m = 1/15, and ρ = 1/5. For the initial condition, we used the total population of Morocco S 0 = 3.603 × 10 7 . For the rest of the initial values, we used the following approximations E 0 = 694, I 0 = 35, U 0 = 50, and H 0 = 35. For the transmission rate, we gotβ = 6.4 × 10 −9 and ε = 0.0105. As shown in Figure 3 , the epidemic peak is reached at t = 102, starting from 22 January 2020 with 3447 infection cases. At the peak, the unreported infection cases are approximated by 8690. Furthermore, notice that on 14 June the number of unreported cases is around 1000 and that of asymptomatic cases is ∼2000. The basic reproduction number corresponding to Morocco found to be R 0 = 1.6141. The following figure shows the results of our approximations. Although we could not find the mobility report for Algeria, there are similarities between Algeria and Morocco in the timing of the control measures taken by both countries. In fact, the Algerian authorities started the lockdown on 12 March, but it was partially relaxed on 13 June in a similar fashion to Morocco. Further, from on Figure 1 , we can tell that there is partial respect to restriction of the population mobility in Algeria, which can be placed in the same level of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 as Morocco. However, we find the efficacy of this restriction was less compared to Morocco. Our fitting shows T = 110, which is around 29 April. The estimation parameters give us p = 0.8, γ = 1/10, µ = 1/5, m = 1/15, and ρ = 1/5. For the initial conditions, we choose S 0 = 4.223 × 10 7 , which is Algeria's actual population. The data give the following approximations to the rest of the initial conditions E 0 = 615, I 0 = 38, U 0 = 30. The transmission rate isβ = 4.35 × 10 −9 with ε = 0.0043. The epidemic peak will be reached at t = 120 starting from 20 April 2020 with 3211 cumulative infection cases (green color figure) . Besides, the unreported infection case will be approximated by 1506 active infection cases. Moreover, the basic reproduction number corresponding to this country is R 0 = 1.2859. Figure 4 shows the fitting of data and the prediction of the other variables of our model.We should notice the efficiency of the lockdown rate ε for Morocco is greater than Algeria, which indicates that the Moroccan authorities had more success in controlling the population mobility. We are now interested in approximating the time of the end of this pandemic in North African countries. For Egypt, and based on the data in Figures 1 and 2 , we can deduce that the turning point is not yet there. Therefore, we can predict that the infection cases will continue to rise. By expanding the time in the previous figure, Figure 2 , we predict the evolution of the infection cases in Figure 5 . Therefore, we can highlight that symptomatic cases (I(t)) will disappear at t = 400, this shows that it 260 days of epidemic starting from 14 June 2020 remain. The highest number of symptomatic active infection cases is about 2 × 10 6 . The pressure on hospitals is also high where it will reach its highest number at t = 276 with 5.53 × 10 6 active infection cases. Moreover, the unreported cases will rich a high number with 9.68 × 10 5 active infection cases. More details are offered in the following figure.The scenario in Morocco is different, where this country exhibits an effective lockdown. As shown in Figure 6 , the highest number of infection cases is reached at t = 97 with 3447 active infection cases at t = 102 starting on 22 January 2020. Our simulation shows that the individuals in the asymptomatic stage are 4322 individual at t = 102. Hospitalized individuals are also approximated by 8683 individuals at the same time. The unreported cases are also reached at this peak time by 1594 infection cases. By our simulation, the epidemic in Morocco would have end by 7 August 2020. More illustrations are highlighted in the following figures. The evolution of the number of active infection cases in Algeria is similar to Morocco. In fact, Algeria was also on its way to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease, where there is a turning point in the curve of the number of symptomatic infection cases as it is highlighted in Figure 4 . Hence, from Figure 7 , we estimate that the epidemic in Algeria should end after 110 days from 14 June 2020 (i.e., 1 October 2020 ). Moreover, the higher number of symptomatic infection cases is reached at t = 120 with 3230 infection cases. The unreported cases reach the highest number at t = 127 with 1506 infection cases. At t = 40, the higher number of hospitalized individuals is reached with 8361 individuals. More illustrations are offered in the following figure.The restriction of human mobility by the lockdown has a clear effect on the reducing the number of infected individuals. This fact can be seen thorough the difference between the prediction of Algeria and Morocco cases compared to Egypt. The lockdown reduced the epidemic peak and the predicted time of the end of this epidemic in these North African countries. Figure 8 shows that in the absence of the lockdown, the number of reported infected cases will have similar exponential growth as Egypt. However, maintaining the number of reported infected cases after relaxing the lockdown is a big challenge to Algeria and Morocco. The current increase in the number of the COVID-19 cases in these two countries in mainly due to the timing of relaxing the lockdown and management of the COVID-19 after the lockdown aftermath, particularly with respect to the unreported cases. With the relatively late lockdown in Egypt, which was implemented by the end of May, and the early relaxation at the end of June, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Egypt was the highest in Africa [22] . One major issue in containing this epidemic is the low number of COVID-19 tests performed (4000 per day) [22] . This problem would obviously increase the number of unreported cases. In fact, one of the solutions that proposed by Peto [23] to end the epidemic is to have mass testing facilities. In this section, we propose to study the impact of increasing the COVID-19 testing capacity in Egypt and the effect of such a measure on reduce the disease outcome on the public. For this purpose, we will augment our model Equation (1) to the following system,where T(t) represents the rate of the revealed individuals by a test of the COVID-19 disease. We presume that this function takes the following special form,where T * refers to the additional quantity of tests for revealing infected asymptomatic and unreported individuals, and 1/T is the average time spent by an infected individual in each class before being diagnosed positively by the COVID-19 disease (which are in E-class or U-class). Moreover, M represents the time initiating the massive population testing for the COVID-19. The remaining parameters have the same epidemiological meaning of the model Equation (1). We can see clearly, from our simulations (Figure 9 ), that as we increase T, the peak of the epidemic delays slightly. However, we found that by increasing the test capacity in Egypt ( from T = 0 to T = 0.01), we reduce the number of unreported cases (U) by 42% and asymptomatic individuals (E) by 36%. Moreover, we can also observe a reduction in the number of hospitalized people by 30%. Therefore, by increasing Egypt's testing capacity to the maximum, it is possible to control the COVID-19. The relaxation of the North African countries' control measures was about a month before an Islamic holiday, ""Eid al-Adha"", which we will refer to as the Eid. The Eid was celebrated on the 30-31 July. From the last week of June, the North African countries' population start preparing for the celebration by shopping and traveling to celebrate with their families. The decision to relax the lockdown and the restriction on population mobility, in this particular time, comes with a huge increase in the COVID-19 cases. This increase in the number of reported cases is reflected by the data that can be seen clearly through Figures 10 and 11 . In this section, we will treat the cases differently (see in [24] in terms of the quality of the decisions made by the three governments and their influence on the spread of COVID-19 disease:Algeria: In the previous section, our simulation showed that the COVID-19 epidemic in Algeria would be finished by the end of September, which has been highlighted clearly in Figure 10 by the figure in blue. However, because of the wrong time of relaxing the population mobility, the actual data highlighted in red points in the same figure suggest a different outcome. Indeed, as shown in Figure 10 , there is an increase in infection cases (stage 3). After this holiday, the rate decreased slightly (stage 4). The relaxation of measures was inevitable because the lockdown made a huge economic deficit. It left no choice for the decision-makers to reduce the severity of the measures and try to live with the fact that COVID-19 will continue spreading in the Algerian community. The corresponding transmission rate that considered in the fourth stages in Figure 10 is expressed in the following manner,where T 1 = 110 T 2 = 148, T 3 = 191, andβ 1 = 4.25 × 10 −9 ,β 2 = 3.66 × 10 −9 . In Figure 12 , we can deduce that this decision will have a huge impact on the evolution of the infection cases, which needs to be revised again before losing control of the spread of this contagious disease. We predict a higher decrease in the first weeks of October because reopening the schools and universities on 20 September 2020 will lead to more acute infection cases. Morocco: As the data show, the similarity between the evolution of the infection cases in the two countries (Algeria and Morocco) can be seen clearly in Figures 10 and 11 , where it is obtained that the COVID-19 disease spreads in this country through four principal stages as it is highlighted in Figure 11 . Morocco's situation is similar to Algeria, where the Moroccan authorities decided to relax the population mobility before the Eid, which led to an increase in the number of acute infection cases. Based on these mentioned points, we can write the transmission rate aswhere T 1 = 90 T 2 = 140, T 3 = 202, andβ 1 = 5.35 × 10 −9 ,β 2 = 4.35 × 10 −9 . It can be seen clearly that there is a continued increase in infection cases, as highlighted in Figure 13 . If the disease's progress goes in the same way, we also expect that the infection will disappear by the end of 2021. Egypt: The case in Egypt is entirely different than Algeria and Morocco. The relaxation of the measures in the Eid period did not make any difference in the number of cases. Our only explanation is the lack of reported cases. The evolution of infection cases follows three stages, as it is highlighted in Figure 14 . It worth mentioning that there is a decrease in the number of in the period of Eid; this decrease continued until mid-September. If the situation continues in the same way, the infection will disappear by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 as it is shown in Figure 15 . Using Figure 14 , we can consider that the transmission rate takes the following formulation,where ε = 0.0105, T 1 = 132, T 2 = 169, β 1 = 5.35 × 10 −9 . Table 1 shows the basic reproduction number of each country in each stage of the disease.For Morocco, we obtained that the variance is equal to ≈311, equal to ≈379 in the case of Egypt, and ≈170 in the case of Algeria. The coronavirus epidemic outbreak happened in the North African countries of Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria at the beginning of March. The reported infection cases in these countries were just a part of a larger number of real infection cases, including infected individuals with no symptoms. Here, we considered a model that investigated the approximation of this category of the infected class. Further, the number of individuals under medical care was considered. We used the available data [20, 21] from the beginning of the world pandemic until 14th, 2020to estimate fit the curve of infected (reported) cases and to estimate the parameters of the model. Consequently, we predicted the number of unreported and hospitalized people in each country. By looking at the mobility data (from Morocco and Egypt) and the similarity between these countries (specifically Algeria and Morocco) in the measure taking, we analyzed the efficacy of the lockdown measure. Applying lockdowns was not easy for the authorities; respecting these restrictions, by populations, vary from one country to another. The evolution of the disease in these North African countries is different, which was reflected in the large difference in predictions, as so we draw the following conclusions.The restrictions in this country were not well respected. This conclusion is based on the evolution of the infection cases presented in Figure 1 where all the infection cases (asymptomatic, reported, unreported, and hospitalized) continued to rise. This led us to claim that if not measure is taking, the infection will not disappear any time soon (see Figure 5 ). As the lockdown and restriction of human mobility can be costly on Egypt's economy, it is important to find alternative measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19. For this purpose, we suggested having massive testing for the population. Augmenting the number of tests per day is one of the most useful tools to reduce the size of the epidemic and lower the burden on the public health facilities, Figure 9 shows that with T = 0.01, can reduce the number of unreported cases by 42% and hospitalize by 30%. As we could not track the number of tests performed by the Egyptian authorities, by increasing T to a level the fit the data after 14 June to 9 August, we could get the level of the infected case as of today. We also investigate the impact of the Eid holiday on the progress of the disease in Egypt. Our study showed no effect of the relaxation of the restriction on human mobility on the number of cases. Morocco: Up to relaxing the lockdown, Morocco was doing great in obligating citizens to respect the lockdown. The infection cases were going remarkably down, and the population mobility in the public places was substantially reduced. We also predicted that the infection would disappear from the Moroccan community by 7 August 2020. The lockdown in Morocco was more effective than one done in Algeria and Egypt, which is reflected by the high rate of the lockdown efficiently ε = 0.0105. It was proved that the lockdown had a huge role in reducing the number of infection cases in this country and reducing hospitals' pressure. Without the restrictions, there would have been a drastic increase in infection cases, as highlighted in Figure 8 as the restriction had a very bad influence on the economy. Therefore, many countries, including Morocco, tried to ease its lockdown by removing some bans on the population mobility, which led to an unavoidable increase in infection cases due to the mobility's augmentation. In fact, the authorities relaxed the restriction one month before the Eid, and the country could not manage the aftermath of the lockdown (See Figure 11) , and the country is having a second wave of the COVID-19 disease. As of the 14 June, the number of unreported cases was over 1000 and the number of asymptomatic was around 3000. By increasing the number of tests COVID-19 capacity in the country, it is unavoidable to see a huge increase in the number of the COVID-19 cases. With this trend of daily increase of cases, our simulation projects the end of 2021 ( see Figure 13 ). Algeria: As mentioned before, this country is similar to Morocco. It exhibited an effective lockdown with less efficiency (ε = 0.0043). We predicted that, if the aftermath of the lockdown was managed adequately, the COVID-19 epidemic would end by 1 October 2020. In a similar fashion, the Algerian authorities tried to relax the lockdown by reducing the severity of the restriction population mobility between regions and opening stores and parks in the cities that did not report any infection cases. However, such a decision should be strictly observed by the population and mandate everyone to follow the government guideline. The relaxation of the restriction before the Eid was the reason for the second wave of the COVID-19 (See Figure 10 ). In fact, by 14 June, the number of unreported cases was over 1500, and the number of asymptomatic was around 3300). By increasing the number of tests COVID-19 in Algeria, we see a continued increase in the number of the COVID-19 cases. Our simulation projects the end of 2021 ( see Figure 12 ).In summary, although the restriction of population mobility at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the economies of the North African countries studied herein, it has been beneficial in reducing the increase of infection cases. Removing the lockdown should be planned to maintain low endemicity and protect the population from unreported COVID-19. This can be achieved by having strict guidelines to manage the aftermath of a lockdown and increase the testing during the lockdown and after the lockdown. Taking such strict protection measures while enforcing social distancing and face masks in public places would help to avoid a second wave of COVID-19, which would exhaust the public health capacity.

Countries were urged to institute preventive strategies to minimize viral transmission. Accordingly, the Ugandan government progressively implemented several stringent public health measures to prevent and contain any local COVID-19 epidemic. By 18 March 2020, the Ugandan President banned all public gatherings and encouraged the public to observe physical distance, not to cough, sneeze or spit in public, and to observe strict hygienic rules (handwashing with soap and water or using sanitizers, regularly disinfecting surfaces, such as tables and door handles among others) [2] . The country further banned travel to and from other countries that had a large number of COVID-19 cases. Not only did the President suspend discos, bars, sports, cinemas, dances, and concerts, but also discouraged extravagant weddings that attracted large numbers of people. Later, on 20 March 2020, all institutions of learning were closed. The first case of COVID-19 in Uganda was reported on 21 March 2020. On 25 March 2020, a ban on public transport was instituted, and all passenger movements into Uganda by air, land, or water were stopped following reports of multiple escapes of people from mandatory quarantine centers. A 14-day total lockdown started on 30 March 2020, with a nationwide curfew from 7 p.m. to 6.30 a.m.; the use of private cars was equally banned, except for essential staff. The lockdown was later extended until 2 June 2020, when a phased easing of the restrictions commenced.However, the adherence to personal preventive measures, such as physical distancing, mask use, hand and cough hygiene, were not evaluated. Understanding the level of adherence to and satisfaction with personal preventive measures is essential for the containment of the COVID-19 epidemic in the long-term. We assessed the level and determinants of adherence as well as the population's satisfaction with respect to the COVID-19 preventive measures recommended by the government.We conducted a cross-sectional national survey as part of the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to preventive measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak. The ICP consortium created a generic questionnaire to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on populations living in low and middle-income countries [3] . We modified this questionnaire based on the local situation in Uganda by adding questions that probed for the practice of disinfecting phones, bag handles, laptops, door keys/locks, and TV remotes. Additionally, the questionnaire was modified to probe for the level of satisfaction with each personal COVID-19 preventive measure. Other questions added were those that probed for reasons for discontinued medication when one had an underlying disease. The questionnaire collected information about socio-demographic characteristics; the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on daily life, professional life, and personal well-being; adherence to personal and community preventive measures, and acceptability of these measures. The questionnaire (in English) was hosted securely on the study website (https://www.icpcovid.com), and the web-link was widely shared during the lockdown period via emails and social media platforms, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter from 16 to 30 April 2020. The emailing list of District health officers was obtained from the Ministry of Health. District health officers from all over the country were given the survey web-link by email, and thereafter, they were asked to share with all district public servants and any other person outside local government. Whoever got the link was asked to disseminate it further, share it with any other persons in their networks. Moreover, the Facebook and Twitter platforms of the Ministry of Health and Makerere University School of Public Health actively shared the survey web-link. People with access to the internet either on smartphones or computers were able to voluntarily participate in the study by clicking on the link and anonymously submitting their responses.To determine the overall level and determinants of adherence to the preventive measures, we generated a composite outcome variable called ""overall level of adherence"" using a 4-item Likert scale (1 = very poor adherence to 4 = high adherence). We generated this composite adherence outcome using the following four variables, each having a weight of 1: frequent handwashing (Many times in a day after contact with persons or surfaces), wearing face masks, physical distancing, and covering mouth or nose with tissue paper or fabric when coughing/sneezing. These four variables were selected since they were considered the most effective COVID-19 prevention measures [4] . Very poor adherence, represented by score 1 of the Likert scale, meant that the person did not adhere to more than one of the four preventive measures. Poor adherence, score 2 of the Likert scale meant that the person adhered to two out of the four major preventive measures. Moderate adherence, score 3 of the Likert scale meant that the person adhered to three out of the four major preventive measures. Adherence to all the four preventive measures was categorized as high adherence.To determine the overall level and determinants of satisfaction with the preventive measures, we generated a 5-item Likert scale composite outcome variable of the overall level of satisfaction (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied) with the four preventive measures. Very dissatisfied, which is represented by score 1 on the Likert scale, meant that the person was extremely satisfied with less than one of the four preventive measures. Dissatisfied, score 2 on the Likert scale meant that the person was extremely satisfied with only one of the four preventive measures. Neutral, score 3 on the Likert scale meant that the person was extremely satisfied with only two of the four preventive measures. Satisfied, score 4 on the Likert scale meant that the person was extremely satisfied with only three of the four preventive measures. Extremely satisfied with all the four preventive measures was categorized as very satisfied.Independent variables, including socio-demographic, daily personal health, and professional factors, were included as independent determinants of adherence and level of satisfaction to preventive measures. Using principal component analysis, we generated a composite variable on wealth index quintiles from household-item possession variables, such as possession of a car, television set, radio, etc.Descriptive statistics were generated using means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes and percentages (%) for categorical variables. We summarized the number of times of handwashing in a day and the extent of adoption of the preventive measures using mean and SD.We used ordinal logistic regression to determine the factors associated with adherence and satisfaction with preventive measures. We considered a p-value of <0.05 to determine the level of significance and a stepwise approach to ascertain the best fitting model. During multivariate analysis on the level of adherence to preventive measures, variables, including working from home, and flu-like symptoms, were dropped because of collinearity.Data extracted from the secure server were cleaned using Microsoft Excel version 2013 and thereafter analyzed using Stata/SE 14.The ICP study was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Antwerp, Belgium (20/13/148), and School of Public health, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda (HDREC number 809). All participants consented and entered their data anonymously.A total of 1726 persons participated in the study, mean age of 36 years (range = 12 to 72). The majority of the respondents (59%) were males; only 47 (3%) of participants were non-Ugandans (Table 1) . Other town/city center, n (%) 329 (19%)Jobless, n (%) 124 (7.2%)Work for a person, institution, or company, n (%) 731 (42%)Work for the government, n (%) 378 (22%)No, n (%) 1108 (64%)Yes, n (%) 618 (36%)No, n (%) 1479 (86%)Yes, n (%) 247 (14%) Only 495 (29%) of participants were adherent to all the preventive measures. However, there was a high level of adherence to some of the individual preventive measures. Overall, 96% adhered to frequent handwashing, 90% to physical distancing, and 86% to cough hygiene, whereas the use of masks was low at 33%. Other preventive measures with low adherence included disinfecting phone (42%), Laptop (26%), bag (20%), and TV remote (18%) ( Table 2) . Yes, before use, n (%) 201 (12) No, n (%) 1282 (74) In multivariable analysis, participants living in the Kampala City Centre (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.6), those who obtained COVID-19 information from healthcare workers (AOR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.01-1.5), those who obtained COVID-19 information from village leaders (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.02-1.9), or those worried about their health (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9) were more likely to adhere to the preventive measures positively. Staying with siblings reduced the odds for high adherence (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.93) ( Table 3) . Overall, 545/1726 (32%) of the participants were very satisfied with the preventive measures. Most [1251/1726 (73%)] of the participants were extremely satisfied with the measure of covering one's mouth when coughing, followed by handwashing [1180/1726 (68%)], and wearing face masks [520/1726 (30%)] (Table 4 ). Wear a face mask In multivariable analysis, females (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), health care workers (AOR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.02-1.5), and those in the second wealth quintile (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.02-1.9) were very satisfied with the preventive measures (Table 5 ). Participants who reported violence or discrimination at home during the lockdown period (AOR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.67) were less likely to be very satisfied with the COVID-19 the preventive measures. This study assessed adherence to and satisfaction with COVID-19 prevention measures in the early phase of the outbreak in Uganda. Only 29% adhered to all preventive measures of interest, although adherence to some measures was very high. Nearly all participants (96%) reported frequent handwashing with soap, but only 33% reported wearing a face mask when going out. It has been estimated that proper masks use with a coverage of 80% would halt the transmission of the virus [5] . However, like other countries in Africa, masking is not commonly done and was only introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Low usage of masks could also be a result of the initial inconsistency in information about the value of mask use by the general population to prevent COVID-19 transmission [6] . Additionally, there was information that the threat of COVID-19 posed to Africa and Uganda would be mild, given the tropical environment and the largely young population structure [7] . Furthermore, many Africans did not wear a mask because it was uncomfortable, or because they did not even think that it was necessary [8] . At the start of this study, Uganda had only 55 cases and 0 deaths due to COVID-19. The numbers increased to 63 cases by the end of the study, still with no fatalities. An exponential increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases did not occur despite the low adherence to personal preventive measures. The reasons for this low COVID-19 morbi-mortality warrant further investigation. Although lockdown measures and cross border movement restrictions [9] may have contributed to downplaying the local COVID-19 outbreak, recent findings suggest that in most African countries, even where less strict lockdown measurements were implemented, the COVID-19 outbreak did not seem to cause a dramatic increase in mortality [10] . However, more sensitization regarding the importance of face masks use in containing the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly needed as well as subsidies and free masks for those who may not be able to afford them.The low levels of adherence revealed in this study could imply that the compliance to the government preventive measures could have potentially further declined during the course of the outbreak, reflecting the need to upscale risk communication strategies in the COVID-19 response and future similar outbreaks. Additionally, enforcement of preventive measures, such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing, in the population, could stabilize the outbreak and halt the viral transmission. When the Arizona state in the USA enforced mask use and other preventive measures, cases reduced by 75% in about a month [11] .Living in Kampala City Centre was associated with high adherence to preventive measures. This is probably explained by the fact that the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Kampala and that people in Kampala were more exposed to information about COVID-19 than elsewhere. Respondents who reported living in a household with other siblings were less likely to adhere to the preventive measures. This could be because some of the siblings are young people, thus have a low-risk perception of COVID-19 [12] , and for them, physical distancing may be difficult. In addition, larger families may have more financial and space constraints.Receiving COVID-19 related information from health workers was also associated with good preventive behavior. The country's Ministry of Health, through its decentralized systems, used health workers to sensitize the public on COVID-19 through various fora, including community outreach. The population is more likely to trust information from health workers and any other trusted source [13] .Worry about one's health was also associated with high adherence to preventive measures. This concurs with findings from a Canadian study, which described how concerns about health status may be associated with adherence to disease preventive measures [14] . Risk perception is indeed an important determinant of the adoption of health promotion and preventive measures. However, in Uganda, health promotion to prevent COVID-19 transmission has been a major challenge due to widespread misinformation and disinformation, which downplayed the risk of COVID-19 [12] .Satisfaction with preventive measures was associated with increased adherence. This is not surprising but also highlights the need to ensure that trust and satisfaction are maintained to sustain adherence to government interventions [15] . This, coupled with the perception of the effectiveness of COVID-19 preventive measures, should be integrated within the COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement, especially for the men who reported lower satisfaction and adherence levels compared to the women [15, 16] . Men generally have more challenges, poorer health-seeking behaviors, and less contact with the healthcare system [17] . Of note, participants who experienced violence reported lower satisfaction, perhaps because the violence could have been related to enforcement of the preventive measures [18] . Punitive measures in ensuring adherence to COVID-19 measures is an emerging area of concern that has not been fully explored and requires more research.The study was conducted online, and this required access to smartphones and internet connectivity for participation in the survey. The study sample may not be demographically representative enough as it comprised mostly educated people with a certain social standing. Therefore, our findings could have overestimated the level of adherence and satisfaction.Relatively low proportions of respondents adhered to all the recommended preventive measures, and adherence was especially low concerning the use of masks. The proportion of respondents who were very satisfied with preventive measures was also low. Behavior change programs need to be intensified to improve the level of adherence and satisfaction with preventative measures, especially the use of masks. Special messages and efforts should target men, large families, and people living outside Kampala city center and be popularized at the community level by health workers and community leaders.","Uganda","abstract","2020-11-27","11"

The transmission of viruses such as COVID-19 occurs by two principal means: (1) airborne droplets containing virus (a sneeze or cough); and (2) contact transmission, that is, the physical transfer of virus from a biological source (blood or other liquid, skin) to another person (from a person's hand to another person) or from a surface (counter, table, respirator mask, clothing, carpet or hospital curtain) to another surface (a person's skin, mouth or eye). This fast spreading of COVID-19 is due to its stability for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces [1] .It is recently noticed that COVID-19 can readily undergo in mutation or genetic changes which is making the situation more difficult. Since this virus is a new type of corona virus, the details of COVID-19 are yet under study by people throughout the world and its vaccine and medications have not been established yet. Therefore, many collective measures (washing or sanitizing hands, maintain social distancing, quarantining suspected people, complete or partial lockdown of the cities, closing schools and other public gathering places, cancelling sports and public events, and disinfecting public places and use of respiratory mask) are needed to decrease infection rates in the whole world. The doctors and the health care staff are at extreme risk of getting infection and hence have to wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as respirator masks to minimize contact transmission onto facial skin or airborne inhalation of COVID-19. Although respiratory mask helps trap larger respiratory droplets and protect from contracting the COVID-19, but these masks are presently of one time use as pathogens on their outer layer. Single use of these masks is increasing the problem. Therefore, if their surfaces can be made of anti-viral, these masks can be re-used. Additionally, working while wearing PPE kits by health workers is not easy, particularly, in hot and humid seasons. Therefore, if their clothes are bactericidal and virucidal in nature, then PPE will not be needed and extent of virus spread can be reduced.Although there are several antimicrobial N95 masks and clothes in the market utilizing iodine, silver or tryclosan, but none of them is efficient of killing or inactivating viruses. The size of microbes and COVID-19 are different. Recent study has been confirmed the structure of COVID-19 [2] and the average size of this virus is 70-80 nm. Therefore it is required to develop new specialized anti-viral coating on cloth surface especially for COVID-19.To overcome the above mentioned issues, the work has been devoted to design the artificially protective cloth (antibacterial, antiviral) to reduce the transmission of infection with body fluid repellency properties from its surfaces. Antimicrobial and antiviral cloth does not only protect the health care worker from of disease but also prevents the growth of fungus on its surface. If cloth is itself anti-wash in nature, then it can also reduce the risk of spread the disease by repelling the body fluid [3, 4] .Several other studies have been done in the preparation of anti-wash and antimicrobial cloth by using nanoparticles (Ag, ZnO and Cu) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Aforesaid these surfaces have some drawbacks such as low durability, poor bonding, high cost, and complex preparation. The nanoparticles are incorporated into the woven fabric matrix by either physical or chemical method. Thus, due to the poor bonding with the fabric, the nanoparticles may gradually detach from the cotton fabric after a period of use and come in contact of human skin, causing serious health problem [9, 10] . Additionally, some nanoparticles (eg. TiO 2 ) are toxic in nature after exposure to sunlight [11] .Nowadays, the variety of green approaches have been carried out in developing the antimicrobial and antiviral cotton fabric. From the literature, the antimicrobial cotton clothes have been produced using plant leaves extract such as aloe vera [12] , Azadirachta indica (neem) [13, 14] , lotus [15] , ginger, and curry leaves [16] . Plant leaves extract has been chosen as a coating material because it is economical, eco-friendly and bioactive in nature with antifungal, antibacterial and anti-viral activity.at [17, 18] . Among these, aloe vera or aloe barbadense has been used as a curative agent. Its gel consists of 99.3% water and remaining 0.7% solids part [19] . It has 75 active ingredients such as aloesin, anthraquinones (aloin and aloe emodin), aloemannan, acemannan (gel polysaccharides), aloeride, verectin, giberellinlike substance, aloeresin I, 5-methylchromone, flavonoids, glycoprotein fraction, anthraglycosides, reducing sugars, cardiotonic glycosides, saponins, naftoquinones, sterols, triterpenoids, amino acids, vitamins and others [19, 20] .Due to presence of several active ingredients, aloe vera possesses antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antioxidant, angiogenic, immune system modulator, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, cathartics, analgesic, antiinflammatory, wound healing, antihepatitis, antigastric ulcer, and antineoplastic activities [20, 21] . Presence of anthraquinones and polysaccharides in aloe vera make it useful as antiviral activities for human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), H1N1 subtype influenza, and poliovirus [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In all studies, anti-viral mechanism of aloe vera is likely the physical inhibition of binding between the virus and host cell. This property of aloe vera holds promise that anti-microbial coatings based on cotton fabric will be effective against many types of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.In the past studied, it has been found that the various anti-viral and anti-bacterial polymeric and nanoparticles (copper, silver) based coatings are available on the fabric surface. But no anti-viral, anti-dirt and anti-stain coating is produced using green approach. In this work, the simple and low-cost technique (green approach) was used to fabricate the aloe vera based anti-wash coating on cloth. Durability, anti-dirt, stain-resistance ability of prepared coating was examined. Anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of coating have been examined in details using E. coli and A. Niger, respectively. Additionally, anti-viral mechanism of coating for COVID-19 has been proposed in this paper.Commercially available cotton fabric was purchased from Asia Hosiery Mills Private Limited, India. Aloe vera powder was purchased from Axi Rejuvenate Life Care Products, India. HDTMS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol was purchased from Merck Life Science Private Ltd., India. All chemicals were used as received.The aloe vera extract was prepared by extraction process from the aloe vera powder.The powder was prepared from the dried leaves of aloe vera. One g of aloe vera powder was poured in a conical flask containing 10 ml ethanol, and kept for 12 h at room temperature for extraction. Here, ethanol was used as a solvent for the extraction. The aloe vera extract was filtered by using Whatman filter paper grade-1 to remove particulate matter from the extract solution. An obtained yellow-brownish color clear solution (extract) was used for further experiment.The cotton fabric was cut into a square shape with a dimension of 3 cm × 3 cm. TheCotton fabric was washed several times with ethanol and water mixture using ultrasonication for 30 min to remove the wax and other impurities on its surface and dried in the hot air oven for 1 h at 80 ºC. Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of superhydrophobic cotton fabric.The coating solution was prepared by mixing HDTMS (5%, v/v) and aloe vera extract followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Cleaned cotton fabric was immersed in the prepared coating solution for 24 h. Afterward, fabric sample was dried in the hot air oven at Scanning electron microscope (SEM, Supra 55V, Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used to examine the surface morphology of cotton fabric before and after modification. To examine the wettability of cotton fabric, a contact angle measurement (DSA 25, Krüss, Germany) was performed on its surface at the room temperature with 3-5 µL droplet of water. Water contact angles (WCA) were measured four times at different positions on each sample and mean value of them were reported. Functionality of the cotton fabric sample was recorded using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Cary 660, Agilent Technologies, USA) in the wavelength range of 400-4000 cm -1 . The FTIR spectra was recorded at the scan number of 16 . The resolution of the FTIR analysis was maintained at 4 cm -1 .The antibacterial activity of uncoated and coated sample was measured against E. coli. bacteria using disk diffusion method [28] . Initially, both uncoated and coated cotton fabric were cut into the circular shape with diameter 7 mm. Subsequently, approximate 25 ml prepared Muller Hinton agar was poured onto the sterilized petri dishes and left for 30 min to get solidified before inoculating. 1 ml of bacteria culture with a concentration of 1×10 -5 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml was spread onto the Muller Hinton agar plate and then a hole was punched into the each plate and sample was kept in it. After that, the petri dishes were The antifungal assay of uncoated and coated samples was performed using agar disc diffusion method against Aspergillus niger. Sabouraud dextrose agar media was prepared in autoclave and poured into the sterile petri plates. The fungal isolate was inoculated on the solidified culture media plates. The samples were cut in the disc (7 mm) and were placed on the media with the help of sterile forceps. The plate was incubated at 27 ºC, and then the zone of inhabitation was measured at different time intervals (24 h, 48 h).In self-cleaning experiment, the dust particles were spread over the both uncoated and coated surfaces. Later, the water was dropped on the dusted clothes using dropper. Behavior of the water on both dusted samples was observed by capturing the optical images using camera (Oneplus A6000, f/1.7). In stain resistant experiment, blue color water droplets were kept on both uncoated and coated cotton fabric. After that, both samples were dried for complete vaporization of the water droplets from its surfaces, and the stained on both coated and uncoated samples were observed before and after drying at room temperature.In thermal stability test, coated sample was annealed in the hot air oven (120 ºC to 170 ºC) for 1 h. After that, the WCA of annealed sample was measured to examine the wettability of its surface. In washing durability test, coated sample was immersed in the water containing detergent and placed into the ultrasonication bath at 40 ºC. After 1 h, the washed fabric sample was rinsed with water to remove the excess detergent solution from its surface and dried at 80 ºC. Finally, the WAC was measured after washing to check its superhydrophobicity.An antimicrobial cotton fabric was fabricated using aloe vera extract and fluorine free silane by a simple immersion process. An aloe vera extract shows antibacterial and antifungal properties. The main bioactive components present in aloe vera such flavonoid compounds, have been identified. So, alkali reagent test was performed to identify the flavonoid compounds. In this test, natural color of aloe vera extract (reddish) was changed into yellowish-brown color by adding the dilute NaOH (0.1N) dropwise into the extract and became colorless after adding drop of dilute acid in the mixture, found the similar observation from literature [29] . Modify cloth shows the same property of cotton cloth like before while the color of its surface was slightly changed because of the aloe vera extract natural color. are attached chemically with silane (low surface energy material) and flavonoid (by crosslinking). The WCA captured image of the coated surface is shown in Fig. 3 , which exhibits superhydrophobicity. The contact angle for water-based products and oils are found to be more than 150 º as shown in Table 1 . Scanning electron microscopy was used to study of the surface morphology of both uncoated and coated cotton fabric. It is found that the cotton fabric is tightly woven with dozens of threads. SEM images reveal that a pristine cotton fabric has an inherent surface roughness consisting of micro-structures as shown in the Fig. 3 (a) . The morphology of coated sample reveals the microstructures of the surface with the in-homogenously distribution of coating material (aloe vera extract) or the aggregation of the flavonoid's molecules (enclosed in red circle) as shown in Fig. 3 (b) . Increase of the contact angle is because of roughness on the surface and the long chain alkyl molecules which is hydrophobic in nature. As explained by Cassie-Baxter wetting state, these rough microstructures present on coated surface contains air pockets beneath the water droplet and these air pockets enhance the water contact angle, making the surface superhydrophobic [30] .To further confirm that cotton fabric was successfully modified by HDTMS and aloe vera extract, FTIR study was done to understand the chemical bonding. The existence of all signature peaks on uncoated, coated cotton surface, and the aloe vera extract solution were shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4 (a) , peaks at 1458 cm -1 and 1656 cm -1 correspond to the C=C (aromatic ring) and C=O (flavonoids groups), respectively [31] . Commonly, the peaks at 3336 cm -1 and 2901 cm -1 in uncoated cloth are attribute to -OH stretching groups [32, 33] . The C-H bond is stretching vibration of CH 2 group. Furthermore, the band appeared at 1162 cm -1 and 1054 cm -1 are attribute to the C-O-C and C-O, related to the asymmetric vibration of the betaglycosidic linkage in cellulose [34, 35] as shown in Fig. 4 (b) . The presence of the absorption peak at 1650 cm -1 , which is assigned to the C=O stretching vibration, demonstrates that flavonoid compounds have been successfully attached onto the cotton fabric. At this peak, it shows the strong antioxidant compound [31] . The peaks at 2916 cm -1 due to the C-H asymmetric shows the presence of long chain alkyl groups [36] , indicating that the cotton fabric was well coated with HDTMS and flavonoid compounds as shown in Fig. 4 (b) .In general, chance of bacteria growth is high in humid environment, and cotton works as a resource of nutrient for bacteria due to the presence of cellulose materials. So, the large number of bacteria could easily adhere on the cotton fabric. In this paper, antibacterial activity of both uncoated and coated fabric was evaluated against the gram negative bacteria (E. coli). Fig. 5 (a-c) shows that the bacteria are adhere to the uncoated sample at the different time intervals (24 h, 48 h, 72 h) due to its water absorption property. On the other hand, coated cotton fabric has the tendency to repel water from its surface, making difficult to adhere and penetrate into the cotton fabric matrix. So, the coated sample shows the inhabitation zone surrounding it as clearly shown in Fig. 5 (d-f) (Table 2 ). It is concluded that the coated cotton fabric shows the excellent antibacterial activity for a long time against the E. coli bacteria. The anti-fungal activity of both uncoated and coated cotton fabric was calculated against the A. Niger fungus. The uncoated cloth was wetted quickly, and visible spore is seen near the sample, implies the growth of fungal as shown in Fig. 6 (a-b) while the coated cloth when exposed to fungal shows no growth over its surface as well as around the sample as shown in Fig. 6 (c-d) . Even after 48 h it exhibits the antifungal activity. The antifungal activity on the coated surface is observed due to its moisture control ability along with aloe With the help of primarily results of antibacterial and antifungal activities of aloe vera coating and its antimicrobial and antiviral mechanism given in literature, we have been proposed the antiviral mechanism of aloe vera coating for COVID-19 virus. The main mode of transmission of virus is aerosol droplets containing COVID-19 (a sneeze or cough) which is water based and present coated cloth surface exhibits extremely good water-repellent nature. Therefore, inhibition of virus from the cloth is by repelling aerosol droplets from the surface (Fig. 7) . and this amino acid is later delivered in ribosome in protein synthesis.Aloe vera has 75 bioactive agents such as anthraquinones (aloin and aloe-emodin), aloemannan, acemannan (polysaccharides), aloeride, verectin, giberellinlike substance, flavonoids, glycoprotein fraction, anthraglycosides, reducing sugars, cardiotonic glycosides, saponins, naftoquinones, sterols, triterpenoids, amino acids, vitamins and others [19, 20] .structures analogue of tetracycline) inhibit the protein synthesis by preventing the association of aa-t-RNA with the ribosome [20, 24, 37] . It is because of negative charge present on anthraquinone and its derivatives which can attract the positive charged aa-t-RNA as shown in Fig. 8 . It can be concluded that the water-repellent nature of the coating combined with the use of anti-viral agent aloe vera makes it a potential anti-COVID-19 coating. Further viral testing is required to demonstrate the concepts discussed herein. Therefore authors are in the process of carrying out the viral testing of present coating and the findings will be content of a future publication. After aloe vera based coating on cloth, multi-layered clothing and full body cover PPE kits will not be needed and virus transmission will also be reduced.The clothes need regular washing to remove the dirt, contamination and stain. Due to daily washing, cotton fabric does not lead permanent effect, and degrades its quality. So, to avoid this problem, the anti-washing properties has been developed on the cloth surface in this paper. To demonstrate the anti-dirt property of coating, the hydrophilic dust particles were placed on both uncoated and coated surfaces. When water droplet is dropped on the uncoated cloth, it becomes completely wet with the dust particles, and spread over the sample surface as shown in Fig. 9 (a) . In case of coated sample, spherical drop is formed with the dust particles and roll-off from its surface and turning the cotton fabric dust free ( Fig. 9 (b) ).The above observation clearly indicates the excellent anti-dirt ability of coating which is due to its high water repellence property.Nowadays, stains are growing concern in clothes related to many purposes such as wearing, household, and medical. Stain comes from food, liquid, detergents, and disinfectant.The uncoated fabric has the ability to absorb all water and oil based products, is stained immediately. Some stains are very difficult to remove from the clothes. Even, it could actually cause permanent damage the clothes. Since after coating cloth can easily repel water, water based liquid (cold drink, tea, coffee, etc.), and other liquid, therefore it should also show the stain resistance property. In stain resistance experiment, the color water droplets are placed on both coated and uncoated samples as shown in Fig. 9 (c) , the coated fabric does not get wetted by the colored water and forms the spherical drop on it while the uncoated cotton fabric becomes quickly wet. Later, both uncoated and coated samples are dried at room temperature. Color stained marks are seen on the uncoated whereas a little stain is observed on the coated sample ( Fig. 9 (d) ) because of a small area of the spherical drop is touched on its surface, and left the small stain due to the diffusion of color in the fiber present on the surface. The above results confirm the stain-resistant property of cloth after coating. The chances of damage of coating are more likely from gentle uses. In practical application, the laundry durability should be good for reuse of coated cloth. The laundry durability experiment of coated sample was carried out by the ultrasonication bath. The coated sample was kept into the beaker containing detergent solution in the ultrasonication bath for 1 h at 40 ºC. Although, the coated sample has the high water repellency, but due to the addition of detergent, the surface tension of water decreases. It was immersed into the water detergent solution without applying any external force. The optical images of water droplet on coated cotton fabric before and after laundry with WCA are shown in the Fig. 10 (a). There is no change in the WCA of coating. The above observation clearly indicates the excellent washing durability without losing its wetting property. To study the effect of elevated temperature on coating, the coated sample was annealed at high temperature of 120 ºC to 170 ºC for 1 h in hot air oven. It is found that after annealing up to 160 ºC it maintains its color along with superhydrophobicity (WCA ≈ 156º) and losses its superhydrophobicity above 160 ºC with WCA ≈ 148º due to the decomposition of HDTMS (boiling point =155 ºC) from its surface [40] as shown in Fig. 10 (b) . No change is observed in its color even after annealing at 180 ºC. In comparison, the uncoated cotton fabric starts to decompose gradually at 149 ºC after exposing the heat. This test implies that coating is thermally stable and provide the protection to the cloth form the heat.In this work, a simple green approach has been used to prepare the anti-wash and antimicrobial cloth using HDTMS and aloe vera extract. Aloe vera acts as an antimicrobial and antiviral agent and HDTMS reduces the contact of the water and other liquids from surface by lowering the surface energy. The coated cloth shows the excellent water repellency with a WCA of 164°. It also shows that the coated cotton fabric possesses remarkable washing durability in detergent solution. Coated cloth is also able to survive upto 160 ºC. Moreover, coated cloth exhibits the excellent anti-dirt and stain-resistant properties.The coated cloth surface shows the antibacterial and antifungal activity against the E. coli and A. niger, respectively over a long time period (≈72 h). In this paper, we have demonstrated two antiviral mechanisms: repellency of aerosol containing viruses due its superhydrophobic nature and inhibition of protein synthesis of virus due to presence of aloe vera on the coated surface. The water-repellent nature of the coating combined with the use of anti-viral agent aloe vera makes it a potential anti-COVID-19 coating. Further viral testing is required to demonstrate the concepts discussed herein, which has yet to be reported. Therefore, authors are in the process of carrying out the viral testing of present coating and the findings will be content of a future publication. Importantly, after aloe vera based coating on cloth, multilayered clothing and full body cover PPE kits will not be needed and virus transmission will also be reduced.","Niger","abstract","2020-11-16","11"

Wir führten eine random effects meta-analysis (REM) durch, da die eingeschlossenen Studien aus verschiedenen Populationen ausgewählt wurden und eine hohe Heterogenität erwartet wurde. Mit Hilfe der Cochran's Q-Statistik wurde die beobachtete Streuung (Heterogenität) zwischen den Effektgrößen bewertet. Der Prozentsatz der Gesamtvariabilität bei den Schätzungen der Effektgröße wurde mit dem I 2 -Index berechnet. Zur Überprüfung des Publikationsbias wurden die Egger-gewichtete Regression, die Begg-Rang-Korrelation und das Meta-Tunnel-Plot verwendet. Wir führten eine Meta-Regressionsanalyse durch, um die Variabilität zwischen unseren Ergebnissen und den Kovariaten unter Verwendung von Berechnungsoptionen wie ""Momentmethoden"" und dann ""Maximum-Likelihood""-Verhältnis zu bewerten. The morbidity and mortality rate associated with COVID-19 is not unrelated to co-infections with bacterial pathogens [1] . Respiratory and blood culture studies of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have shown that bacterial infections rather than the direct effects of the virus have resulted in a number of recorded fatalities [2] . Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is persistently and asymptomatically present in the nares of 20% of the human population [3] , [4] . In response to physiological changes during infection, bacterial factors involved in the shift of S. aureus from commensalism to pathogenesis is poorly understood [5] . The bacteria have been associated with secondary staphylococcal pneumonia following COVID-19 infection [6] , [7] . However, the overlap of symptoms makes the identification of co-infected patients and the co-infecting pathogens laborious [8] . Although previous studies investigated the frequency of selected bacterial species in COVID-19 cases [9] and the overall extent of co-infection [10] , the pooled rate of S. aureus among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is largely undocumented. This study aims to address this issue by conducting a meta-analysis to determine the burden of S. aureus co-infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Knowledge about specific etiological agents may reduce the strain on the resources of healthcare systems worldwide and lead to more appropriate treatment and medication, as well as shorter hospitalization.We examined databases for studies that reported data on S. aureus and MRSA co-infections in patients with COVID-19 infection. Studies with fewer than 10 participants and case studies were excluded. Searches were performed in Pub Med, Google Scholar, Web of Science and SCOPUS from 1 st of January 2020 up to 20 th of October 2020. The search terms included: 'COVID-19 and MRSA', 'bacterial infection and MRSA', 'S. aureus and COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2 and MRSA or S. aureus' 'bacterial pathogens and COVID-19'. These were combined with search terms such as 'hospital', 'healthcare', 'communityacquired', 'hospital-acquired', 'bacteremia', 'pneumonia', 'secondary infections', 'supra-infection', 'co-infection'. The bibliographies of identifed articles were also searched. The abstracts and full texts of identified studies were screened for eligibility by two reviewers (SSA and ABS). The quality of studies was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data [11] . Discrepancies in evaluation were settled by consultation with a mediator (SMG). PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) protocols were used for this analysis [12] . The data gathered from the included studies comprised author's name, country of study, type of study, setting, culture type, and number of patients with: influenza-like illness (ILI), COVID-19 positive results, co-infections, S. aureus co-infections or MRSA co-infections.Random effects meta-analysis (REM) was performed because the studies included were sampled from a universe of different populations and high heterogeneity was anticipated. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis ® software, version 3.3070 (Bio-stat, Englewood, NJ, USA), was used to perform the analysis. Using the Cochran's Q statistic, the observed dispersion (heterogeneity) among effect sizes was assessed. The percentage of total variability in the estimates of the effect size was calculated with the I 2 index. To check for publication bias, Egger weighted regression and Begg rank correlation methods with a metafunnel plot were used. A p-value <0.05 was presumed to reflect a statistically significant publication bias. In order to structure the search results and document relevant studies, Zotero desktop ® (version 5.0.92) reference software was employed. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to gauge the impact of each study (by omission) on the pooled rates [13] . Meta-regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the variability between our outcomes and the covariates (study type, study quality, setting and country). Covariates were first tested individually in a univariate analysis and then simultaneously in a multiple meta-regression model through the computational options ""methods of moments"" followed by the ""maximum likelihood"" ratio. The R 2 analog was used to compute the total variance of all studies about the grand mean effects. Outlier diagnostics were performed using Cook's distances, covariance ratios, heterogeneity test statistics and weights (Attachment Fig. S4 ).Our search yielded 207 titles after removing duplicates, of which 148 were removed during the initial screening. At this point, the abstracts of the outstanding 59 studies were reviewed, and 41 studies were discarded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 18 studies included in the study (Figure 1) . The study quality ranged from 6 to 9 (median 7.1) on the Joanna Briggs Institute scale. All included studies reported on S. aureus/COVID-19 co-infection amongst hospitalized patients. df=4, I 2 =86.369%, p=0.000). The sensitivity analysis did not significantly affect the overall proportion of our results by excluding one study, nor did it affect the heterogeneity. Some indication of publication bias among the analysed studies is shown by the asymmetric distribution of the studies in the funnel plots (Attachement Fig. S1, Fig. S2 , and Fig. S3 ), highlighting the statistical heterogeneity observed. Egger's and Begg's tests (Attachement Tab. S1) did not demonstrate statistical significance for bias in any of the analyses (p>0.05). None of our covariates were statistically significant using the ""methods of moment's"" computation method. In the multivariate meta-regression model (maximum likelihood method), study type (p=0.029), study quality (p=0.000) and country of study (p=0.000) were significantly associated with heterogeneity of results (Attachement Fig. S4 ). Of all the moderator variables, only study settings was not statistically significant (0.123). Overall, at a Q-value of 53.79, with df=13 and p=0.000, the covariates were associated with our observed effect. The variance of true effect sizes at any point on the regression line (T 2 ) was 0.2048, p≤0.05. Only 83% (R 2 =0.83) of the variance in true effects can be explained by the covariates using our model ( Figure 5 ).Normally, an underlying infection is expressed as symptoms. Traditional approaches (qualitative and quantitative) for detecting co-infections are not always effective due to overlapping symptoms. As a result, clinicians prefer empirical antibiotic therapy with an emphasis on etiolo-gical staphylococci and streptococcal agents [14] , [15] . Although the danger posed by bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients is recognized, the extent of co-infection with S. aureus has hitherto not been systematically evaluated. This meta-analysis found that overall, in the included studies, more than one-fourth of COVID-19 hospitalized patients had a co-infection (bacterial, fungal or viral), underscoring the need for establishment of protocols for the detection of coinfection to improve clinical data and patient therapy. Similarly, in about onefourth of recorded co-infections, S. aureus was the prevalent co-pathogen. This finding is consistent with a coinfection rate of 25% (S .aureus) previously reported by [16] . The finding that MRSA was associated with over half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19/S. aureus coinfection is consistent with the prevalence rate of 50% reported by [16] in the 2009 influenza pandemic. The rates observed may be attributable to widespread antibiotic use on skin and nasopharyngeal microbiota, which may degrade the respective ecosystem [17] . The reported MRSA rates may be linked to non-judicious administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to a large proportion of patients. The sensitivity of S. aureus culture methods could have been limited by the excessive use of antibiotics, so that our findings may have underestimated the actual situation.In our meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity exists, which led us to an enquiry into its origin. The maximum likelihood model explained that covariates such as study type, study quality and country of study were associated with heterogeneity. The unexplained heterogeneity (20.48%) may be due to differences between studies in terms of disease severity, patient co-morbidities, treatment differences, use of antibiotics prior to and during hospitalization, or other unidentifed covariates.The strengths of the present study include our use of statistical models to assess the sources of heterogeneity, a systematic search strategy to classify potentially suitable studies from different sources, as well as scrutinizing the supplementary information of preprints and publications up to our search date. While research is ongoing, there are few studies documenting S. aureus and MRSA microbiological cultures among COVID-19 positive patients to date. This influenced the distribution of the studies covered. It is also likely that, considering the extraordinary conditions and immense burden on healthcare systems, patients with a suspected secondary infection would not have had extensive microbiological examinations. The data provided by the included studies did not distinguish between the sources of secondary infections and colonizers. This research focused solely on patients who were hospitalized and did not take into account patients who had not been hospitalized.The pooled rates of S. aureus among COVID-19 patients documented in this study justify the concern of clinicians about the presence of S. aureus in co-infections. This data is not sufficient to support widespread-and often inappropriate empirical use of antibiotics in patients 8/10 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020, Vol. 15, ISSN 2196-5226 hospitalized with COVID-19, as reports of co-infection in admitted patients are scanty. Improved antibiotic stewardship can be accomplished through rapid diagnosis by longitudinal sampling of patients to allow targeted antimicrobial therapy.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-11-27","11"

Sources of COVID-related distress include constant fear of contracting the virus, actually contracting the virus, losing loved ones to the illness, and being socially isolated or quarantined. These factors can precipitate mental health problems in those with no previous mental health history or exacerbate symptoms in those with pre-existing mental health problems. COVID-19 traumatic stress constitutes a new type of traumatic stress that has at least three components: the constant threat/fear of contracting the virus, the economic loss, for example, loss of business or job, and disturbed routines, and isolation (Kira et al., 2020b) .COVID-19 traumatic stress is a new type of traumatic stress. In other trauma types, we can identify and control the perpetrator through the law and other legal means but controlling the virus (COVID 19) depends on medical science and measures of social and political policies and will. Further, COVID-19 is a continuous ongoing traumatic stress. It is a type III trauma (i.e., still ongoing), which is a more severe form of traumatic stress (Kira et al., 2008) . No data are indicating when it will stop or on its long term impact. Prominent formulations of traumatic stress retain the assumption that traumas have occurred in the past, disregarding traumatic stress that may be ongoing and continue into the future (Eagle & Kaminer, 2013; Kira et al., 2013a) . However, several studies (e.g., Goral, Lahad, & Aharonson-Daniel, 2017; Kira, Ashby, et al., 2013a) have found that when a traumatic experience is present and ongoing, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms become more significant and severe.One distinctive of the experience of COVID-19 is that a person's fears are more focused on the present or the future. Time perspective and anticipation, and not the past, is the primary focus. The person has a realistic fear and anticipation of being a present or future victim. This anticipation is particularly salient as research has suggested that a present or future negative time perspective is the strongest predictor of perceived distress (Rönnlund, Åström, Adolfsson, & Carelli, 2018) . Further, COVID-19 consists of multiple complex traumas. COVID-19 traumatic stress includes at least three main threats (Kira, Shuwiekh, et al., 2020b) : threat/fear of the present and future infection and potential subsequent death (e.g., Ornell et al., 2020; Porcelli, 2020) , the actual economic hardship (e.g., McKibbin & Fernando, 2020) , and the stressors and traumatic stressors related to the disturbed life routines, isolation, and family and social life (Brooks et al., 2020; Palgi et al., 2020; Usher et al., 2020) . Additionally, COVID-19 is a mass collective and global pandemic. It may affect everybody everywhere, either directly or indirectly, through secondary stress and traumatization dynamics and media and social media.The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the planet and had a profound effect across all inhabited continents. One of the regions where the mental health impact of COVID-19 has received little research attention is the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Arab countries. It is important to explore this outbreak's influence on mental health in this region as it is area that is often neglected.Due to a variety of factors, COVID-19 is under-reported in most Arab countries (e.g., Tuite et al., 2020) . As a result, measuring its psychological impact can offer some additional information. While investigations of the psychological impact of COVID-19 in Arab countries is limited, a recent study on the potential mental health impact of COVID-19 in an Egyptian sample found that 41.4% of the sample scored on the high end of a measure for PTSD (El-Zoghby, Soltan, & Salama, 2020) . However, the study did not control for other stressors and, as a result, it is impossible to determine if PTSD symptoms should be attributed to the experience of COVID-19 or to other pre-COVID-19 stressors or traumas.The Arab world (pre-COVID-19) has gone through several historical traumas. These include the Arab Israeli conflict (e.g., Sayigh, 2013; Schulze, 2016) and Iraqi gulf wars (e.g., Heidenrich, 1993; Wehrey, 2013) in addition to Arab Spring and Arab-Winter (e.g., Dabashi, 2012; Kurzman, Fahmy, Gengler, Calder, & Whitson, 2013) and the Syrian and Libyan civil wars (Kira, Shuwiekh, Rice, Al Ibraheem, & Aljakoub, 2017; Kira, Shuwiekh, Al Ibraheem, & Aljakoub, 2019d) . Further, the Arab world is currently going through political turmoil and economic crises that overlap with COVID-19 continuous traumatic stress. These national collective traumatic factors are added to the individual factors that each individual in the region may have endured.A number of different factors affect the spread of COVID-19 and its subsequent mental health impact, including population density, the economic and income level, and age. The study of the spatial epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 spread in China (Kang, Choi, Kim, & Choi, 2020) and the spatial diffusion process of SARS (Meng, Wang, Liu, Wu, & Zhong, 2005) showed that population density was more significant than the population size in their spread, although both were important. For Arab countries, Egypt has the highest population density compared to Saudi Arabia and Algeria, especially larger cities (e.g., Barr & Tassier, 2020; Tabutin, Schoumaker, Rogers, Mandelbaum, & Dutreuilh, 2005) .Income is another critical economic and demographic factor in COVID-19 impact. For example, Walker et al. (2020) found in their computer model of worldwide COVID-19 impact that lower-income countries showed significantly more death from the virus. One of the critical impacts of COVID-19 traumatic stress is economical (e.g., McKibbin & Fernando, 2020) . The economic impact of COVID-19 goes beyond morbidity and mortality resulting from the virus to the disruption of global and local economies' functioning. Many companies across the world, irrespective of size, have experienced significant contractions in production. Service-oriented economies are significantly negatively affected. Countries like Egypt that are more reliant on tourism (more than 15% of GDP), and those that are more reliant on oil, like Saudi Arabia, are more affected by this crisis. Countries highly dependent on foreign trade (most or all Arab countries) are also more negatively affected (e.g., McKibbin & Fernando, 2020) .Another demographic factor related to the COVID-19 threat is age. Older age is associated with more death from COVID-19 than younger or middle-aged groups (Zhou, Snoswell, et al., 2020a; Zhou, Yu, et al., 2020b) . Additional effects of COVID-19 also appear to be age-dependent. Rates of hospitalization and death are less than 0.1% in children but increase to 10% or more in older people (Promislow, 2020) . The COVID-19 mortality risk is highly concentrated at older ages, particularly those aged 80+ years. In China, the case fatality rate estimates ranged from 0.4% for 40 to 49 year-olds, jumping to 14.8% for those 80+ years. The fatality age pattern had been starker in Italy, where, as of March 30, 2020, the reported fatality rate was 0.7% for those aged 40 to 49, and 27.7% for those older than 80, with 96.9% of deaths occurring in those aged 60 years and over (Dowd et al., 2020) . While older age appears to be a significant risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, it does not appear to be a risk factor for the potential infection of COVID-19 or its potential mental health-related symptoms. As Palgi, Shrira, and Shmotkin (2015) have noted, the elderly may be vulnerable or resilient and may have developed sufficient coping skills from previous and ongoing traumas and loss.The purpose of this study was to measure the differential COVID-19 mental health impact, over and beyond the impact of previously experienced trauma. Specifically, we gathered data from different Arab countries intending to differentiate the impact of COVID-19 as a new added, ongoing, and developing traumatic stress, separate from all other previous and concurrent collective and individual stressors and traumas that may be different in its spread and mental health impact for each Arab country.1. What are the differences between Arab countries in the impact of COVID-19 traumatic stress mental health after controlling for the impact of previous cumulative stressors and trauma? 2. Does COVID-19 traumatic stress account for unique significant variance above and beyond the variance accounted for by cumulative stressors and traumas for PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety in samples from each Arab country?Hypothesis 1 The more densely populated Arab countries that are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease will show greater COVID-10 related mental health impact, regardless of their previous level of exposure to stressors and traumas.Hypothesis 2 Income can be potentially a protective factor against the mental health impact of COVID-19, regardless of their previous level of exposure to stressors and traumas, as the economic impact of COVID-19 is one of the critical stressors that impact the individual's mental health.Hypothesis 3 Old age can be protective or risk factors for the mental health impact of COVID-19.Three core researchers developed the initial English version of the COVID-19 questionnaire from two centers that study stress, trauma, and cumulative traumas in the United States. The questionnaire included measures of COVID-19 as traumatic stress, PTSD, anxiety, cumulative stressors, and traumas, among other measures. The Arabic version of the questionnaire was translated and back-translated and culturally adapted by a researcher at Fayoum University, Egypt. The team used Google Drive and developed a survey link. The collaborating professionals in different Arab countries followed the chain recruiting method in collecting data from their respective countries by emailing the survey link to their contacts and asking the contacts, after completing the questionnaire, to email the survey link to their contacts to participate and subsequently send on to contacts with the same request. Once the participant completed the survey, it was sent anonymously to Gmail and then downloaded to an Excel file. All questionnaires were answered individually by participants from 4/28/2020 to 5/25/2020. Participation was voluntary; each person took approximately 25 min to complete the full questionnaire. The Fayoum University IRB approved the research as a cross-cultural study of the COVID-19 mental health impact.One thousand and three hundred seventy-four (N = 1374) adult participants were recruited from seven Arab countries (Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Algeria, Iraq, and Palestine). Because the number of participants from Palestine (N = 72) and Iraq (N = 67) was relatively small, and the initial analysis indicated that they are similar regarding their trauma load; also, they live under similar circumstances of internal and external conflicts, we combined the participants from the two countries in one subsample (N = 139). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the subsamples.COVID-19 Traumatic Stress Scale (Kira, Shuwiekh, et al., 2020b) The COVID-19 traumatic stress scale is a 12-item scale including three subscales ""threat/fear of the present and future infection and death"" (5 items), ""traumatic economic stress"" (4 items), and ""isolation and disturbed routines"" (3 items). Items are scored on 5 point Likert-scale, with (1) indicating not at all and (5) very much. Examples of items include, ""How concerned are you that you will be infected with the coronavirus?"" ""The Coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted me negatively from a financial point of view."" ""Over the past two weeks, I have felt socially isolated due to the coronavirus."" In the initial study (Kira, Shuwiekh, et al., 2020b) , the scale showed good construct convergent-divergent and predictive validity. The COVID-19 scale had an alpha of .88 in the current study and. Its three Subscales had Cronbach alphas of .84, .75, and .70, respectively.Cumulative Stressors and Traumas Scale (CTS-S-36 Items) (Kira et al., 2008) The CTS-S-36 scale was designed to measure seven types of stressors/traumas (collective identity trauma, personal identity trauma, identity/achievement trauma, survival trauma, attachment trauma, secondary trauma, and gender discrimination). Additionally, the scale includes three items that measure chronic and significant life stressors. Example items for the collective identity traumas (e.g., discrimination and oppression) include: ""I have been discriminated against because of my sexual preference."" A personal identity trauma (e.g., early childhood traumas such as child neglect and abuse) example is: ""I was led to have sexual contact with a person who was older than me (when I was young.)"". An example of a status identity/achievement trauma (e.g., failed business, fired, and drop out of school; noncriterion A traumas) is: ""I have been fired, terminated, laid off suddenly, or have had a failed business."" A survival trauma (e.g., combat experience, car accidents, and natural disasters) example item is: ""I have experienced a life-threatening medical condition (e.g., cancer, stroke, serious chronic illness, major injury, etc.)."" As indicated above, the scale also includes items related to attachment trauma (e.g., abandonment by parents), secondary trauma (i.e., indirect trauma impact on others), and gender discrimination by parents and society. The CST-S evaluates cumulative stressors and traumas by measuring their occurrence, frequency, type, negative and positive appraisal, and chronological age at the first event. However, in the present study, we used only trauma occurrence (whether a trauma had occurred for a participant) and frequency, measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = never; 5 = many times Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-V) (Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015) The PCL-V is a 20-item self-report measure. Each item is scored on a five-point scale with ""0,"" indicating ""not at all"" and 4 indicating ""extremely."" Initial research suggests that a PCL-5 cut-off score between 31 and 33 is indicative of PTSD. A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 = ""Moderately"" or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule, which requires at least: 1 B item (questions 1-5), 1 C item (questions 6-7), 2 D items (questions 8-14), 2 E items (questions 15-20). The Arabic version of the PCL-V has been previously validated in Arabic samples (Ibrahim, Ertl, Catani, Ismail, & Neuner, 2018) . Cronbach's alpha reliability of the scale in the current study was .94.Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that assesses general anxiety. Items are scored on a 4-point scale with (0) indicating ""does not exist,"" and (3) indicating ""nearly every day."" The scores range between 0 and 21, with a cut-off point of 15, indicating severe GAD. The GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82%. Increasing scores on the scale have been strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (Spitzer et al., 2006) . The Arabic version of the GAD-7 was previously validated in Arabic samples (Sawaya, Atoui, Hamadeh, Zeinoun, & Nahas, 2016) . Cronbach's alpha reliability for the scale in the current study was .92.Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001 ) is a 9-item self-report questionnaire that measures the degree of depression symptom severity. Items are scored on a 4-point scale with (0) indicating ""does not exist,"" and (3) indicating ""nearly every day."" The scores range between 0 and 27, with a cut-off range of 15-19 indicating moderately severe depression and 20 and above indicating severe depression. The Arabic version of the PhQ-9 was previously validated in Arabic samples (Sawaya et al., 2016) . Cronbach's alpha reliability for the instrument in the current study was .88.We used Cohen's (1992) criteria and recommendations to confirm the sample size necessary to detect a medium population effect size at power = .80 for α = .05 for the study's number of variables. The data were analyzed utilizing IBM-SPSS 22. There were no missing data reported. In addition to descriptives, we conducted a linear polynomial one-way ANOVA. We used the Tukey HSD Post hoc for multiple comparisons to test for differences between the Arab countries in cumulative traumas, trauma types, COVID-19 traumatic stress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. We conducted stepwise multiple regression analyses, for each Arab subsample, with PTSD, depression, and anxiety as dependent variables. The data were evaluated to ensure that the multivariate tests' assumptions were fulfilled (linearity, multicollinearity, homogeneity of variances, and homogeneity of covariance-variance matrices). The results of Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (p < 0.001) and the residual SSCP matrix shows that the variables under analysis met the assumptions of linearity and multicollinearity. Also, the results of Levene's test of equality of variances and Box's M test of equality of variancecovariance matrices indicated that homogeneity of variances and homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices were satisfied (p > 0.01). We tested for collinearity between variables, and variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 5.00 for the model, indicating no multicollinearity (e.g., Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2017; Williams, Grajales, & Kurkiewicz, 2013) . In the first step in each analysis, we recoded the categorical variables into dummy variables and entered gender, age, religion, education, and income as independent variables.In the second step, we entered ""cumulative stressors and traumas"" as an independent variable to control their potential impact. In the third step, we entered COVID-19 traumatic stress as an independent variable. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the overall sample and each country subsample. The mean occurrence score for cumulative stressors and trauma for the overall sample was 6.94, with SD of 5.62. For COVID-19 traumatic stress, the overall mean was 33.52, with SD of 8.45. For PTSD (M = 25.54, SD = 16.70), 36.6% of the complete sample scored at 31 or above (the cut-off score for probable PTSD diagnosis). For the generalized anxiety disorder scale (M = 5.94, SD = 5.19), 6.3% scored at 15 or above, which is the cut-off score of severe generalized anxiety disorder. For depression (M = 7.91, SD = 6.06), 12.1% of the total sample scored at 15, which is the cut-off score for moderate depression, while 4.9% scored at 20, which is the cut-off score for severe depression. While Iraqis and Palestinians had the highest cumulative stressors and traumas load, Egyptians had the highest score on COVID19 traumatic stress and the highest probable PTSD (49%) and depression.The differences between the countries (in linear terms) in CTS, COVID-19 traumatic stress, its three subscales, PTSD, anxiety, and depression, were all significant (see Table 3 ). Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that Egypt had significantly higher levels of overall COVID-19 traumatic stress than all the other Arab countries. Egypt also had significantly higher levels of the COVID-19 fears subscale for all other countries except for Algeria, the COVID-19 economic trauma subscale (except for Jordan), and the COVID-19 disturbed routine and isolation subscale (except for Jordan and Palestine and Iraq). The Egyptian sample also had significantly higher levels of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The Palestine and Iraq subsample was significantly higher in cumulative trauma load than the other Arab countries, but not higher in COVID-19 traumatic stress or PTSD. Table 1S in the supplemental material provides the statistical details of multiple comparisons. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 present the difference in the means of COVID-19 traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and cumulative stressors and traumas in the different Arab subsamples. Figures 1S, 2S , and 3S in the supplemental material provide the means of COVID-19 traumatic stress subscales (fears of infection and death, economic trauma, and disturbed routines/ isolation) in the different Arab subsamples.To measure the impact of COVID-19 on PTSD, anxiety, and depression (as dependent variables) in each country, after accounting for the variance explained by other stressors and traumas (other than COVID-19 traumatic stress), we used stepwise multiple regression. We entered gender, age, religion, education, and income in the first step. In the second step, we entered cumulative stressors and traumas, and in the The results indicated significant main effects for previous cumulative stressors and traumas on PTSD, depression, and anxiety across all countries. Betas for these effects ranged between .48 and .24 for depression, between .45 and .22 for anxiety, and between .39 and .22 for PTSD. In analyses for each country, COVID-19 stress accounted for unique significant variance above and beyond the variance accounted for by cumulative stressors and traumas for anxiety in all country subsamples. Betas for COVID-10 traumatic stress predicting anxiety ranged from .19 to .32. COVID-19 traumatic stress also accounted for unique significant variance above and beyond the variance accounted for by cumulative stressors and traumas for PTSD in all country samples, except for Algeria (see Table 4 ). Betas for COVID-10 traumatic stress predicting PTSD ranged from .06 to .26. Similarly, COVID-19 traumatic stress accounted for unique variance in predicting depression in all country samples except for Algeria, with Betas ranging from .12 to .19 (see Tables 2S and 3S for results of all of these analyses). Note that, in all the analyses, variance inflation factor (VIF) values indicated no collinearity present in the data (see, for example, Table 4 ).The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 traumatic stress uniquely contributes to increased mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD symptoms), over and above the experience of previous trauma, in most Arab countries. Of particular note is that, while Palestinians and Iraqis had the highest trauma load in the Arab samples due to previous cumulative stressors and traumas, they did not have the highest load of PTSD, depression, or anxiety. The Egyptians sample had the highest PTSD, depression, and anxiety rates, and the highest rates of COVID-19 traumatic stress, suggesting a relationship between these variables. This study also suggests that the effects of COVID-19 related traumatic stress differ across Arab countries according to population density and economy. For instance, more densely populated countries like Egypt that have a more significant potential for spreading the virus had greater mental health impact than the countries with lower population density like Algeria and Saudi Arabia. While El-Zoghby et al. (2020) , as mentioned in the introduction, found that 41.4% of their Egyptian sample scored on the high end of a measure for PTSD, the results of our study also found that Egyptians had a higher probability of PTSD (49%) (which may be comparable to El-Zoghby et al., 2020, earlier findings) and the highest scores on COVID19 traumatic stress. These PTSD ratings are Fig. 1 The mean of COVID-19 traumatic stress in different Arab subsamples Fig. 2 The mean of anxiety in different Arab subsamples higher than in previous studies where, three years ago and before the pandemic, researchers found that 32.2% of the participants in a comparable Egyptian sample met the criteria for PTSD (Kira, Shuwiekh, Rice, & Ashby, 2018b) . This study's results indicated the unique contribution of COVID-19 traumatic stress in predicting PTSD suggests that these increases may be attributed to the additive impact of COVID-19.The results of the stepwise multiple regression suggest several demographic factors are related to mental health outcomes. For instance, older age was consistently predictive of less PTSD, depression, and anxiety in most countries in this COVID-19 context. In a recent study, Palgi et al. (2020) found similar results. The authors that, while old age increased the risk of the negative physical impact of COVID-19, age was unrelated to depression or anxiety. Specifically, they found that adults above 60 who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications displayed greater resilience to psychiatric disorders associated with the COVID-19 crisis. This finding may Fig. 3 The mean of depression in different Arab subsamples Fig. 4 The mean of PTSD in different Arab subsamples be because the elderly are more aware of the risks associated with COVID-19 and, consequently, more disciplined and less impulsive in taking preventive measures.While education was not a significant predictor of distress in this study, income was a significant predictor of lower PTSD, anxiety, and depression in the relatively higherincome countries of Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, but not in Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, or Palestine. This finding suggests that the economic impact of COVID-19, which is one of the critical stressors of COVID-19 (e.g., McKibbin & Fernando, 2020) , may be lessened for individuals with higher incomes. This case might be especially evident in Arab countries with higher average incomes like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.Religion (e.g., being Christian) was also a significant factor in predicting mental health outcomes in this study, but only in the Egyptian sample. In this study, identifying as Christian was predictive of increased PTSD, depression, and anxiety in the Egyptian subsample. The Egyptian subsample had a relatively sizeable Christian minority (20.4%) compared to other country samples (9% in Jordan, Algeria, and Iraq/Palestine, respectively). In this study, Christian minority participants in Egypt had higher PTSD, anxiety, and depression scores than participants in the Muslim majority. Increased mental health among a Christian minority in Arabic countries is consistent with social identity and minority stress theories (e.g., Kira et al., 2019c ) and a recent study on Egypt's Christian minority (Kira & Shuwiekh, in press) , suggesting that this additional stress significantly undermines well-being.The current study has several conceptual and clinical implications. Conceptually, the study highlights the multiple dimensions of economic, and isolation) and their unique and pervasive mental health impact. The study results also suggest the need for additional studies to determine whether the combination of symptoms related to COVID-19 traumatic stress (i.e., PTSD, anxiety, depression) can be best understood using existing comorbidity frameworks within a new unique diagnostic category such as post-COVID-19 traumatic stress disorder. Clinically, the current study indicates a clear need for mental health intervention for Arab countries, especially those most affected. The results suggest high levels of distress that would warrant the attention and assistance of world health organizations. National centers, universities, and mental health services in these countries might also be mobilized to provide effective prevention and intervention strategies. Telehealth and online interventions and utilizing social media also can be useful as proven to be effective options (e.g., Zhou et al., 2020a, b) .The current study has several limitations. One of the limitations is that we conducted the study in a convenient sample that is relatively skewed towards younger ages and females with limited and biased representation. We recommend more studies that use more representative and balanced samples and in more Arab countries. Further, the measures we used depended on participants' self-reports, which could be subject to under-or over-reporting of events due to current symptoms, embarrassment, or social desirability. Also, the study utilized a cross-sectional design. Future studies may use longitudinal studies if feasible. Despite these limitations, the current study results highlighted the differential negative impact of COVID-19 on different Arab countries. Further, this study offers evidence of the impact of COVID-19 traumatic stress in predicting mental health outcomes in several Arab countries and has significant conceptual and clinical implications.

By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), we aim to shed light on the patterns of infections in South Africa.Two of the largest provinces, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, had a slow growth rate on the number of detected cases, while in Western Cape and Eastern Cape the epidemic is spreading fast. Our estimates of transmission potential suggest a decrease towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths but a subsequent estimated R average of 1.39 between 6-18 th of May 2020.We also demonstrate that early transmission in KZN was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B and provide evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic.The COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa was very heterogeneous in its spatial dimension, with many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV2 in KZN and evidence of nosocomial transmission, which inflated early mortality in KZN. The pandemic at the local level is still J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in China in late December 2019. On 30 January 2020, it was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . By 15 th of May 2020, there were 4,621,410 COVID-19 cases and 308,542 related deaths (Worldometer, 2020) worldwide involving almost every country in the world. Within five months, the virus had spread to Europe, America and eventually to Africa. The first case in Africa was reported in Nigeria on 28 th of February 2020 (Adepoju, 2020) , and at the time of writing, the pandemic has spread to almost all countries on the African continent. South Africa has had the highest number of COVID-19 cases to date with a total of 13,524 people infected and 247 deaths (as at 15 th May)(COVID-19 WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGY BRIEF PROVINCES AT A GLANCE, n.d.).The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on 5 th of March 2020.Decisive early action was taken by the government: a national state of disaster was declared on 15 th of March 2020, and a nationwide lockdown was enforced on 27 th of March 2020 to avoid the first wave overwhelming the health system. While initially only people who had travelled to at-risk countries and their contacts received PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the recommendation broadened to include all people with an acute respiratory illness. Furthermore, a program of community-based screening and testing was rolled out across the country (NICD, 2020). Testing increased rapidly and by the middle of May 2020, over 600,000 tests had been carried out in South Africa (approximately 10,000 per million population) (Roser M et al., 2020) .As the global pandemic has expanded, WGS and genomic epidemiology (Grubaugh et al., 2019) have been consistently used to investigate COVID-19 transmission and outbreaks (Deng et al., 2020; Eden et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020; Grubaugh, 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Munnink et al., 2020) . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance of COVID (NGS-SA) was formed (Msomi et al., 2020) , which is a network of five large government laboratories and five public universities funded by the Department of Science and Innovation and the South African Medical Research Council. In this paper, our consortium focuses on a detailed analysis of the epidemic in South Africa and preliminary genomic analysis of some of the first introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). We show that although the South African epidemic started in KZN, which have the first cases and deaths, other provinces in the country, namely the Western Cape (WC), Gauteng (GP) and the Eastern Cape (EC), have overtaken KZN in the number of confirmed cases. We also show evidence of many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in KZN and early evidence suggesting nosocomial transmission.We used publicly released data up to 11 May 2020 from the National Department of Health (NDoH) and the NICD in South Africa, which are collected in the repository of the Data Science for Social Impact Research Group at the University of Pretoria (Marivate et al., 2020) , as well as global data on confirmed cases from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre (Dong et al., 2020) . The NDoH releases daily updates on the number of new confirmed cases, with a breakdown by province. In the early stages of the epidemic, individual-level information on sex, age and travel history was released, but detailed reporting was discontinued on 23 rd of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fMarch. In addition, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) releases daily updates on the number of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests performed across all public and private sector laboratories, as well as the number of cases testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (c). We also extracted information from government press releases and speech transcripts to chart a timeline of the government response to the epidemic. To understand the epidemic trajectory, we plotted the cumulative number of confirmed cases by province since the report of the hundredth case in the country by province.The effective reproduction number (R) was estimated by taking into account the observed epidemic growth rate r and two theoretical relationships (i, ii) of R with r previously described in the literature. (i) We used the relationship R=(1+r/b) a as described in Imperial College London's COVID-19 report 13 (Flaxman et al., 2020) , where a=m 2 /s 2 and b=m/s 2 , m the serial interval (SID) mean and the SID standard deviation. The SID distribution used is the one estimated by Nishiura and colleagues (Nishiura et al., 2020) , with m=4.7 and s=2.9. We term this approach the Flaxman et al. approach (Flaxman et al., 2020) . (ii) We used the relationship R=(1+r/sigma)(1+r/delta), with 1/sigma the infectious period and 1/delta the incubation period, as described by Wallinga and Lipsitch (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) , which is based on an SEIR modelling framework and expects both periods to be exponentially distributed. We used exponential distributions with mean 5.1 days for incubation (Kucharski et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020) and 4 days for the infection (Kucharski et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020) .We term this approach the Wallinga et al. approach . To obtain the epidemic growth rate r, we used maximum likelihood estimation in R (function optim), by fitting the exponential growth J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f model A0e rt to the reported time series of cases and deaths (independently), where t is time, A0 is the number of reports at t=0, and r the growth rate. We used daily reported deaths and cases.The time periods for which we had data for deaths was 27 th March to 11 th May, and for cases was 5 th March to 12 th May. This approach is similar to that implemented by Xavier et al (Xavier et al., 2020) . Tiling Polymerase Chain Reaction cDNA synthesis was performed on the RNA using random primers followed by gene specific multiplex PCR using the ARTIC protocol (Quick, 2020) . Briefly, extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) and random hexamer primers. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification by multiplex PCR was carried out using primers designed on Primal Scheme Raw reads coming from both Nanopore and Illumina sequencing were assembled using Genome Detective 1·126 (https://www.genomedetective.com/) and the Coronavirus Typing Tool (Cleemput et al., 2020; Vilsker et al., 2019) . The initial assembly obtained from Genome Detective was polished by aligning mapped reads to the references and filtering out low-quality mutations using bcftools 1·7-2 mpileup method. All mutations were confirmed visually with bam files using Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). All of the sequences were deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Shu and McCauley, 2017) .We downloaded all sequences and associated metadata from the GISAID sequence database (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Shu and McCauley, 2017) as of 1 st of May 2020 (n=15,793). Due to the low variability of SARS-CoV-2, we wished to only include high quality sequences in our downstream analyses. To this end, we filtered out sequences that were <25kbp in length as well as sequences with a high proportion of ambiguous sites (>5%). Additionally, we also removed sequences that lacked any geographic and or sampling date information. The resulting 10,959 sequences were analyzed along with 20 sequences that were generated by the laboratory at the (Rambaut et al., 2020) , which suggest this to be the first lineage (hence A).Lineage A genomes are characterized by two unique mutations (8782C>T and 28144T>C), relative to lineage B. Lineage B, on the other hand, shares no common mutations since this lineage contains the global SARS-CoV-2 genome reference (Wuhan-Hu-1). From these lineages, sub-lineages (e.g. A·1, A·2, A·3 and so forth) are then designated, each defined by an additional set of unique mutations. For example, for sub-lineage A·1, these mutations would be; 11747C>T, 1785A>G and 18060C>T. Sub-lineages can further diversify into sub sublineages (e.g. A·1·1). Please refer to the schema provided in Supplementary Figure 5 for more information.Phylogenetic analysis 10,959 GISAID reference genomes and 20 KRISP sequences were aligned in Mafft v7·313 (FF-NS-2) followed by manual inspection and editing in the Geneious Prime software suite (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). We constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree topology in IQ-TREE (GTR+G+I, no support) (Nguyen et al., 2015; Tavaré and Miura, 1986) . Due to the large size of the alignment and the low variability, we opted to not infer support for splits in this tree topology. In any tree topology of SARS-CoV-2 the majority splits will be poorly supported with only the major splits separating the major lineages having good support. The resulting ML tree topology was transformed into a time scaled phylogeny using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) with a clock rate of 8x10 -4 and rooted along the branch of Wuhan-WH04 (GISAID: hCoV19/Wuhan/WH04/2020) and Wuhan-Hu1 (Genbank: MN908947). The resulting phylogeny was viewed and annotated in FigTree and ggtree.Based on this large phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, we randomly down sampled the GISAID reference sequences that passed initial sequence quality checks to ~10% of the original size.All African sequences in the GISAID subset, the 20 genotypes that were generated in this study, as well as a select few external references (e.g. Wuhan-Hu-1) were included. The resulting dataset of 1848 sequences was used in a custom build on the NextStrain analysis platform In short, sequences were aligned in mafft v7.313 and visualized and manually edited in Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand) as previously described. ML-tree topologies were inferred from each alignment in IQ-TREE v1·6·9 (GTR+G+I, with transfer support values) (Nguyen et al., 2015; Tavaré and Miura, 1986) . Resulting tree topologies were analyzed in TempEst software suite for temporal clock signal (Supplementary Figure S4) . Coalescent molecular clock analyses were performed in BEAST v1·8. In short, analyses were run under a strict molecular clock assumption at a constant evolutionary rate of 8x10 -4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year and an exponential growth coalescent tree prior. The Markov Chains were run in duplicate for a total length of 100 million steps sampling every 10,000 iterations in the chains. Runs were assets in Tracer for good convergence (ESS>200) andTreeAnnotator after discarding 10% of runs as burn-in.Data Availability SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated in this study have been deposited in the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/), under the following accession IDs: EPI_ISL_421572, EPI_ISL_421573, EPI_ISL_421574, EPI_ISL_421575 EPI_ISL_421576 EPI_ISL_436684 EPI_ISL_436685 EPI_ISL_436686 EPI_ISL_436687. In addition, raw short and long reads have been submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) and can be accessed under BioProject Accession: PRJNA636748 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA636748).The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on 5 th of March 2020 in KZN, a South African citizen returning home from a skiing holiday in Italy. A steady increase in the number of confirmed cases in South Africa (all imported cases) followed over the next week, with the first suspected case of local transmission reported on 13 th of March 2020 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. The early cases were predominantly located in the three provinces with the main urban populations and international travel hubs, namely GP (main cities Pretoria and Johannesburg), the WC (Cape Town) and KZN (Durban). In these three provinces, the doubling time for confirmed cases was approximately three days prior to the lockdown ( Figure   1 ). However, since the lockdown on 27 th of March 2020, the epidemic seems to be growing at different rates in South Africa.The South African epidemic has been very heterogeneous. For example, the first cases and deaths happened in KZN and GP. This was more pronounced in KZN, as a large nosocomial outbreak in a private hospital in Durban caused KZN to lead the country in number of deaths until the WC overtook it on 21 April 2020. In addition, GP, home of the largest metropolitan area of Johannesburg, had an unusual epidemic, as the majority of initial cases were in middle age and rich individuals who traveled overseas for holidays. This translated in a very small number of deaths over time and infections were concentrated in the rich suburb of Sandton in Johannesburg. However, the epidemic expanded the fastest in the Western Cape (WC) province, especially in Cape Town, which is the capital and most populated city of the WC. At the time of writing this report, this province has over 60% of all of the cases and deaths in South Africa (Figure 2 ). There is mounting evidence that the Western Cape is seeding the growing epidemic in the Eastern Cape as the funerals from some of the deaths in the Western Cape are taking place in the Eastern Cape.This dynamic and heterogeneous epidemic complicates the estimation of effective reproductive number (R) over time and space. For example, deaths, which is normally one of the gold standard data for estimation of R0 for South Africa in May 2020 were stable at 1·12 (1.0-1.2) (Supplementary figure 1) . KZN, the first province affected by COVID-19, initially had the highest death rate but in the last period analyzed, had only 3 deaths. We have therefore attempted to estimate R from two data sources: aggregated reported cases and deaths at the country level (See Methods). Similarly, to that observed in other regions of the world, our estimates of R for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported, independently of the data source used. By the last period analyzed between 6-18 th of May, using the Wallinga et al approach (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) , we find that R was still 1.39 (1.04 -2.15, 95% CI), suggesting potential of sustained transmission for the near future.In order to determine the route of introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 in KZN, we assessed 27 of some of the first confirmed cases in the province. Samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs represented fourteen females and ten males between the ages of 23-74 years. We managed to produce 20 near-whole genome sequences (>90% coverage) from these samples, and six partial genomes (Supplementary Table S2, Table S3 ). To this dataset, we added an extra genome from the NICD, which was sampled in KZN (a close contact of the first reported case) on 7 th of March 2020. The 21 KZN whole genomes (20 KRISP and one NICD) were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f assigned to SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages according to the nomenclature proposed and lineage classification obtained from >5000 genomes analyzed by Rambaut et al. (Rambaut et al., 2020) .Given uncertainties pertaining to the low diversity of this virus (Moreno et al., 2020) The spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe has given rise to one of the largest evolving pandemics in modern times. South Africa currently has the highest number of infections in Africa. South Africa seems to be moving to the next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increasing community transmission even during the stringent lockdown and the epidemic growing at different rates in different regions of the country. At the time of writing this report, Cape Town, the main city in the WC, has the fastest increase of new infections and deaths in South Africa. Recent data indicates that over 62% of the new infections and deaths are happening in this province, although only 17% of the South African population lives in this region. The fast spread of COVID-19 in the WC is not fully explained by the higher testing rates as this province has performed between 20-22% of the tests in South Africa, but the positivity rate has been around 9%, were as in the other provinces the positivity rate is around 1-2%. Our estimates of transmission potential for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported, similarly to that observed in other regions of the world. By the last period analyzed between 6-18 th of May, when using the Wallinga et al estimation approach applied to time series of reported cases, we estimate that R was on average 1.39 (1.04 -2.15, 95% CI). Overall, these results suggest of an epidemic still in expansion at that time, in spite of a very early lockdown.Sequencing of viral isolates from early COVID-19 cases in KZN, which is the province of South Africa with the first infections and early deaths, provided useful insights into the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. From the first twenty-one genomes analyzed, we found thirteen independent introductions in KZN. These introductions were related to lineages B, B·1 and B·2, which have spread widely in Europe and North America. We also found a cluster of cases in health care workers in Durban, highlighting the potential importance of nosocomial transmission in this pandemic and potentially two other transmission pairs. The production of genomes from the WC will be crucial to understand the drivers of transmission during the lockdown period, and particularly whether health care facilities, prisons, workplaces and other institutions are acting as amplifiers of transmission. This is one of the main activities that our consortium, NGS-SA, is currently working on.Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa has proved challenging on many fronts. First, sequencing of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not a straightforward task. For example, a survey of thousands of sequences deposited in public databases has revealed a number of putative sequencing issues that appear to be the result of contamination, recurrent sequencing errors or hypermutability (Virological, 2020). These might arise from laboratory-specific techniques of sample preparation, sequencing technology or consensus calling. Furthermore, the low diversity of this virus and the small number of mutations that define lineages have prompted caution in the interpretation of early phylogenetic analysis worldwide (Lu et al., 2020) . Often apparent local transmission clusters can in fact be the result of multiple introductions from under-sampled regions from non-uniform sequencing efforts (Grubaugh et al., 2019; Kraemer et al., 2019) . To mitigate this we confirmed phylogenetic results by manual inspection of mutations relative to the reference of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table S4 ).Second, the pandemic is still evolving and grouping of SARS-CoV-2 into lineages and subclades is likely to be dynamic at this stage and it is influenced by proportionally larger number of sequences produced in the northern hemisphere (Rambaut et al., 2020) . Third, the travel histories of apparent community transmission need to be thoroughly investigated in order to elucidate the true dynamics of transmission in a particular area. In our case, a subsequent investigation into the samples comprising the monophyletic cluster revealed the association with a big hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Durban, KZN (Lessells et al. manuscript in preparation 2020) . This paper has some important limitations. The first is related to estimation of R from a limited number of deaths in a high heterogeneous epidemic both in time and space -for which we were able to estimate R only at the aggregated country level. The second is a lack of well set up genomics laboratories that can sequence the virus in Africa. This is also amplified by the difficulty of acquiring reagents that are in high demand, coupled with the disruption of air freight. It is therefore a high priority for our consortium, NGS-SA, to evaluate and share protocols among national laboratories in South Africa that could generate sequences of highquality and capacitate our laboratories with the protocols and bioinformatics pipelines to properly investigate virus introduction and to validate the call of variants with a detailed and reliable bioinformatics system. NGS-SA is also working with the Africa Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen genomics surveillance in the African continent.In this paper, we provide an early analysis of COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, showing very heterogeneuos epidemics in the different provinces. We also estimated SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in KZN using the first twenty one genomes from some of the first cases in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f country. We find that KZN had many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV2, but also had early evidence of nosocomial transmission. The pandemic at the local level is still developing and the objective of NGS-SA is to clarify the dynamics of the epidemic in South Africa and devise the most effective measures as the outbreak evolves. The authors have no conflict of interest to declare. The geographic region of the other sequences is marked with coloured circles.","South Africa","abstract","2020-11-12","11"

The disease was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] . COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic (global epidemic) affecting over 200 countries and territories a e-mail: solaniyi@lautech.edu.ng (corresponding author) optimal control model using optimal control theory. In another development, Srivastav et al. [16] applied optimal control theory to analyze a mathematical model for COVID-19 model using real data from Italy and Spain.This study is motivated by the ongoing community spread of the novel coronavirus disease in the most populous African nation -Nigeria with a view to flattening the infection curve. To achieve this aim, a new nonlinear deterministic epidemic model for COVID-19 incorporating transmission routes from three infectious classes, including symptomatic infectious humans, asymptomatic infectious humans and hospitalized individuals, is parameterized and analyzed based on the cumulative number of reported active cases. The behavior of the model over a long period of time is qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. Sensitivities to changes in the parameters of the model with respect to the epidemiological threshold are evaluated to provide insights into formulation of policies required to curb the spread of the disease. Moreover, optimal control theory is applied to the epidemiology of COVID-19 transmission in order to assess the optimal levels of time-dependent prevention and management measures that will significantly minimize the number of infectious humans in the population. The costeffective intervention strategy capable of flattening the virus infection curve over a definite time horizon is suggested.In this section, an epidemic model which focuses only on the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in the absence of demographic effects (natural births and deaths) is considered (see, e.g. [19, 20] ). Thus, the host population is stratified into seven mutually exclusive epidemiological classes: susceptible class S(t) (those who are prone to contract COVID-19 infection), exposed class E(t) (those who have been infected, but are not infectious), symptomatic infectious class I (t) (those who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms and are capable of spreading the disease), asymptomatic infectious class A(t) (those who are not symptomatic, but are infectious), hospitalized class H (t) (infectious individuals who are admitted to healthcare facility due to virus infection (active cases)), recovery class R(t) (those who have been recovered from the disease), and death class D(t) (those who have died as a result of COVID-19 infection).It is pertinent to mention that over 800 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19 in Nigeria due to inadequate protective equipment [21] . This necessitates the transmission route from hospitalized class as appeared in [20] . It is also important to state that the remains of persons (i.e., symptomatic infectious and hospitalized individuals) suspected or confirmed to have died due to COVID-19 are carefully handled in accordance with the recommended standard procedure [8] . Further, incidence of death due to the presence of the virus in asymptomatic individuals is unknown, thus the disease-induced death rate for asymptomatic class is neglected. Figure 1 shows a flowchart depicting the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the total host population size N , which is given byConsequently, the following system of nonlinear differential equations is obtained.Eur. Phys. J. Plus (2020) 135:938 Table 1 The parameters of the COVID-19 model (1) Parameter Description β Effective transmission coefficient ε 1 Modification parameter for a reduced transmission from asymptomatic humans ε 2 Modification parameter for a more reduced transmission from hospitalized class α Rate of disease progression from exposed class l 1 Proportion of exposed with symptoms after the incubation period It should be mentioned that the parameters of the formulated model (1) are non-negative since the model describes disease outbreak in human population. Therefore, it is suffices to state that solutions of the model (1) are non-negative.The potential spread of disease outbreak in a population can be determined by finding an epidemiological threshold known as the basic reproduction number. In the context of the novel coronavirus, the basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 , can be defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by one COVID-19 infected person during the course of infectiousness in a wholly susceptible population. To obtain R 0 for the COVID-19 model (1), the next generation operator technique is employed following the notations in [22] . Matrices F and V evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium (N , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) are given, respectively, byThe spectral radius of F V −1 , given by R 0 = ρ(F V −1 ), is obtained aswhere, k 1 = h 1 + r 1 + δ 1 , k 2 = h 2 + r 2 and k 3 = γ + δ 2 . Thus, the following local stability result is claimed in the sense of [22] . (1) is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1, and unstable if R 0 > 1.The implication of Theorem 1 from epidemiological viewpoint is that a small number of infected individuals present in a population will not cause an outbreak as long as R 0 < 1. It must be emphasized that this result depends on the initial sizes of infected individuals in the population. Hence, to rule out this dependency, a global stability result becomes necessary.The global asymptotic stability of the COVID-19 free equilibrium, given by (N , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is explored as follows.The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the COVID-19 model (1) is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 ≤ 1.The following continuously differentiable and positive definite linear Lyapunov function is carefully constructed for the COVID-19 model (1) (see, e.g., [23, 24] ).where,The time derivative of (3) along the solution path of the COVID-19 model (1) is given bẏIt follows thatḞ ≤ 0 if R 0 < 1 with equality,Ḟ = 0, if and only if E = 0, I = 0, A = 0 and H = 0. Therefore, it can be concluded from the LaSalle's Invariance Principle [25] that the DFE is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 ≤ 1.The implication of Theorem 2 from the epidemiological viewpoint is that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in the population if R 0 < 1 regardless of the initial sizes of the infected individuals. This theoretical result will be graphically illustrated later.This section is devoted to the estimation of parameters of the COVID-19 model (1) based on the reported data of cases in Nigeria [8] . In particular, the formulated model is parameterized to assess the burden of COVID-19 in terms of the number of individuals currently infected (active cases) in Nigeria. In this study, the values for parameters such as effective transmission coefficient (β), modification parameter (ε 2 ), and hospitalization rates (h 1 and h 2 ) are estimated, while the values of other parameters are chosen from the well-established literature as appeared in Table 2 . The estimation of parameters is carried out using the least squares method implemented in Excel Solver [26] with a view to minimizing summation of squared errors given by (Y (t, p) − X real ) 2 subject to the COVID-19 model (1), where X real is the real reported data, and Y (t, p) represents the solution of the model corresponding to the number of active cases over time t with the set of estimated parameters, denoted by p. Moreover, initial conditions for the exposed humans, symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals are estimated to account for the possibility that the actual number of cases is most likely much higher than reported in Nigeria as in other parts of the world, due to limited testing and the possible presence of COVID-19 infected individuals with no symptoms [27] . In order to accommodate the foregoing possibility, the estimations of parameters and initial conditions for the model fitting are allowed to commence from March Page 7 of 20 938 [16, 31] 10, 2020, exactly a day after the second COVID-19 confirmed case was reported by NCDC [8] , so that H (0) = 2. Keeping in mind that the total population of Nigeria is estimated at N = 200 million people [28] , and that no report of recovery and deaths due to the disease was made as at March 10, 2020 (i.e., R(0) = D(0) = 0), then it is easy to determine the initial susceptible population asThe model is fitted to the real data along with the following initial conditions: E(0) = 880, A(0) = 330, I (0) = 190, so that S(0) = 199, 998, 600. The model fitting with reported active cases is depicted in Fig. 2 . Consequently, the value of the basic reproduction number using the parameter values in Table 2 is R 0 = 1.412, which still exceeds the novel coronavirus pandemic threshold of one.It is important to explore how sensitive the COVID-19 model (1) is to changes in each of its parameters in order to suggest intervention strategies that will help in bringing down the infection trajectory. In other words, carrying out sensitivity analysis will help in providing insights into what should be done or avoided to prevent the outbreak of the novel coronavirus [32] . Thus, as defined in [33] , a relative change in the basic reproduction number, R 0 , when each parameter changes is measured using the followingwhere, ϒ R 0 p is the sensitivity index of a differentiable R 0 with respect to any parameter, p. Consequently, the sensitivity indexes for the model (1) are graphically shown in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that of all the positive indices, the effective transmission coefficient, β, is the highest, and therefore the most sensitive parameter. This means that an increase (or a decrease) of the value of β will increase (or decrease) R 0 by 100%. However, of all the negative indices shown in Fig. 3 , the recovery rate for the hospitalized class (active cases), denoted by γ , is the most sensitive parameter. This means that an increase (or a decrease) of the value of γ will decrease (or increase) R 0 by 42.1%.In addition, contour plots of R 0 as a function of other parameters are shown in Fig. 4 to demonstrate how changes in these parameters affect the basic reproduction number, R 0 . Figure 4a shows a decrease in R 0 with increasing recovery rates for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. This spontaneous recovery from infection is due to the body's innate immune response which is capable of inhibiting virus replication, promoting virus clearance, and triggering a prolonged adaptive immune response against reinfection [34] . Moreover, it can be confirmed, as shown in Fig. 4b , that the basic reproduction number can be brought lower than the threshold of one if efforts are geared towards lowering the transmission rate while simultaneously improving on the management of active cases.In Fig. 5a , the effects of effective transmission coefficient at different values are illustrated. It is projected that the cumulative number of active cases in Nigeria, given the current infection trajectory with β = 0.38974, may get up to 5 × 10 6 (equivalently, 2.5% of the total estimated population) unless drastic measures are taken to bring the basic reproduction number below one. As shown in Fig. 5b , the cumulative number of active cases reduces with increasing value of recovery rate for hospitalized individuals from γ = 1/15 day −1 to 1/5 day −1 . In particular, if it takes 5 days or less to effectively manage infected individuals, the risk of infection transmission from the hospitalized class will reduce significantly. This indicates that the longer it takes to effectively manage COVID-19 patient, the heavier the burden of the disease on the healthcare facility and the population at large. More explicitly, Fig. 6 reveals how the potential spread of the novel coronavirus in the population is affected by the model parameters in order to influence effective policies that can guide against the burden of the disease transmission. The blue rectangular box in Fig. 6a indicates a safe region where the effective transmission coefficient, β, is below a value of 0.27613, so that the key epidemiological threshold, R 0 , is less than one. Above this region, the basic reproduction number which determines the spread potential of the disease increases as the rate of transmission increases through effective contact between susceptible and infectious individuals in the population. Hence, to stay in the safe region, measures such as strict social distancing and maintenance of good personal hygiene are strongly advised. This result is consistent with previous findings in the literature [9, 11, 13, 15, 17] . Furthermore, the potential spread of the diseases decreases with increase in the recovery rate as shown in Fig. 6b . The safe region of R 0 < 1 in this case is attained at recovery rate above the value of 0.1727. Hence, given the high infectiousness of the novel coronavirus disease, treatment regime which ensures recovery within a short period of 5 days is strongly advised. In Fig. 6c , the effects of the modification parameters, ε 1 and ε 2 , respectively for virus transmission from asymptomatic (black solid line) and hospitalized (blue solid line) individuals on the basic reproduction number are shown. The red rectangular box is the safe region where ε 2 is below a value of 0.1. Above this value, R 0 will increase up to 3.6828 which may lead to a more serious pandemic situation. Hence, strict usage of personal protective equipment when attending to the hospitalized COVID-19 individuals is strongly advised to avoid further spread of the disease. Table 2 except for β = 0.19487 and ε = 0.12, so that R 0 = 0.522 < 1To validate the global stability result (Theorem 2), Fig. 7 illustrates the convergence to the COVID-19-free equilibrium irrespective of the initial sizes of the infectious individuals in the population.In the light of the sensitivity analysis result, optimal control theory is applied to the COVID-19 model (1), as applied to other infectious diseases models (e.g., [33, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] ) in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the population optimally. This is done by introducing two time-dependent control variables u 1 (t) and u 2 (t), which are described in details as follows.(i) u 1 (t) denotes the preventive strategy targeted at inhibiting the virus transmission from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized humans. This can be achieved through public heath advocacy for social distancing, good personal hygiene, wearing face masks in public places, and provision of protective gear for healthcare workers. Noting that u 1 (t) = 1 implies the strategy is effective for protection against infection, while u 1 (t) = 0 implies strategy failure. (ii) u 2 (t) represents control variable to step up the management of hospitalized individuals with a view to ensuring prompt recovery and preventing deaths due to complications. This can be achieved through prompt provision of supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation for hospitalized individuals with severe COVID-19. If u 2 (t) = 1, then the control is effective in managing the disease, while u 2 (t) = 0 means the absence of control.Consequently, the optimal control model with the two aforementioned time-dependent variables is given by the following differential equationsThe aim of introducing the two control variables is to seek the optimal solution required to minimize the numbers of symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus in the population at minimum cost. Hence, the objective functional for this control problem is given by (6) where, constants w i , i = 1, 2, ..., 5 are positive weights required to balance the corresponding terms in the objective functional. Following other literature on COVID-19 control problems [9, 16, 17, 40, 41] , quadratic costs on the controls are chosen, where 1/2w 4 u 2 1 (t) is the total cost of implementing the preventive measure, and 1/2w 5 u 2 2 (t) is the total cost of managing active cases over the time interval [0, T f ].Precisely, the optimal control double uwhere, U is the non-empty control set defined by U = (u 1 , u 2 ) : (u 1 (t), u 2 (t)) are measurable with 0 ≤ u 1 , u 2 ≤ 1 for t ∈ [0, T f ] . Thus, to determine the necessary conditions that the optimal control double (u * 1 , u * 2 ) must satisfy, Pontryagin's maximum principle [42] , which transforms the control problem (7) subject to the model (5) into a problem of minimizing pointwise a Hamiltonian H, is used. Thiswhere, λ i , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 7, represent the adjoint variables associated with the state variables of the model (5) . The standard existence result for minimizing control problem as appeared in [43, 44] is adapted as follows.Given that (u * 1 , u * 2 ) minimizes the objective functional (6) subject to the corresponding state system (5) , then the adjoint variables λ i , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 7, satisfy the following systemwith the terminal (transversality) conditionsFurther, the optimal control double (u * 1 , u * 2 ) is given as follows u * 1 = max 0, min 1,Proof The existence of the optimal control double (u 1 , u 2 ) is based on the a priori boundedness of the state variables of model (5) , convexity and boundedness of the Langragian of the control problem. The system of ordinary differential equations (9) governing the adjoint variables is derived by differentiating the Hamiltonian H. Further, the control characterizations in (11) are derived by solving, on the interior of the control set U, the partial differentials of the Hamiltonian H with respect to each of the controls u 1 and u 2 . Hence, by standard arguments involving control bounds, it follows thatandThis ends the proof.Forward and backward Runge-Kutta method of order four implemented in MATLAB is used to solve the resulting optimality system which consists of systems (5) and (9) with the characterizations (11) within the time interval of [0, 100] days. The weight constants used for balancing the terms in the objective functional (6) are chosen to ensure that no term dominates the other. Thus, equal weight constant for minimizing the infectious classes is chosen, so that w 1 = w 2 = w 3 = 1. On the other hand, the weight constants for measuring efforts or costs required to implement the controls are comparatively different. This results in values for w 4 = 50 and w 5 = 100. Details of the numerical procedure for simulating the obtained optimality system are contained in [45] . Figure 8 demonstrates how single preventive measure, u 1 (t), affects the spread of the novel coronavirus in the population. As shown in Fig. 8a , to minimize the objective functional (6), the optimal control u 1 (t) is maintained at maximum level of 100% for about 93 days before relaxing to the minimum in final time. As expected, the sizes of COVID-19 infectious individuals are reduced when control is in place. Further, in Fig. 9a , b, the effects of single management control, u 2 (t), are shown in minimizing the number of virus infection in the population, but not as much as when only preventive strategy is applied. More importantly, Fig. 10 shows the significance of combining the two optimal controls in bringing down the total number of infectious humans to zero. It is observed that optimal solution is attained when preventive measure is strictly adhered to at maximum level of 100% for 45 days, while the management control of the hospitalized individuals is at maximum level of 100% for 32 days. It can be seen that combination of the two controls is significantly more effective in curbing the spread of the virus than when each control is singly applied.It is important to determine the most cost-effective optimal control measure among the single and combined implementation of the two given control measures in order to optimally miti-Page 15 of 20 938 gate the spread of COVID-19 at the lowest cost possible. Hence, cost-effectiveness analysis is explored using the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) [9, 24, [46] [47] [48] . To avoid dissipation of available limited resources, ICER is used to compare any two competing measures for controlling the spread of disease or related problems. The ICER formula is given by ICER = Change in total costs between control measures Change in total number of infection averted by control measures .The total cost for each of the single implementation and combined effort of the control measures is derivable from the objective functional 6, while the infection averted is obtained by calculating the difference between infectious individuals without and with control measures. Let C 1 , C 2 and C 12 represent single implementation of the preventive measure u 1 (t), single implementation of the management control u 2 (t) and combined effort of the two measures, respectively. In what follows, Table 3 summarizes the ICER for each and combination of the control variables u 1 (t) and u 2 (t) in an increasing order of the total infection averted.Using (12) , the ICER for C 1 , C 2 and C 12 shown in Table 3 are calculated, respectively, as follows. Comparing C 1 and C 2 , it is seen that ICER(C 1 ) is less than ICER(C 2 ). This means that C 2 is more costly and less effective than C 1 . In other words, C 1 dominates C 2 . Thus, single implementation of management control is removed from the list. As a consequence, C 1 and C 12 are assessed in Table 4 using similar procedure. It is revealed in Table 4 that C 1 is dominated by C 12 since ICER(C 1 ) is greater than ICER(C 12 ). This implies that C 12 is less costly and more effective than C 1 . Hence, single implementation of preventive measure is excluded from the list. This shows that combined effort of the two control measures is the most cost-effective intervention capable of diminishing the burden of the novel coronavirus optimally in the host population.This study presented a mathematical analysis of transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with a view to providing further insights into the disease transmission, and to explore possible prevention and control measures capable of curbing the rising tide of the disease spread in the population. A deterministic mathematical model was formulated by subdividing the host population into susceptible, exposed, symptomatic infectious, asymptomatic infectious, hospitalized, recovered and dead classes. The nonlin-ear model has been developed by considering transmission routes from symptomatic infectious humans, asymptomatic infectious humans and hospitalized individuals. The theoretical analysis carried out, based on Lyapunov stability, showed that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. This is an indication that COVID-19 outbreak can be effectively controlled in the population irrespective of the number of the infectious individuals initially introduced into the completely susceptible population.In particular, the formulated model was fitted to the reported data of cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) due to COVID-19 in Nigeria, and estimates for parameters such as, effective transmission coefficients (β), modification parameter for the transmission of virus infection from active cases (ε 2 ), hospitalization rates for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (h 1 and h 2 ) were determined using the least squares method. Sensitivity analysis of the fitted model was performed to find the parameters that drive the spread of the virus infection mostly in the population. It was revealed that β is the most sensitive parameter, followed by ε 2 and the recovery rate for active cases denoted by γ . In addition, given the high infectiousness of the novel coronavirus disease, safe regions where virus infection dies out at certain threshold values of the model parameters were derived in order to facilitate and strengthen formulation of effective policies that can help to avoid a more serious pandemic situation. Further insights into the projection of the disease transmission indicated that the cumulative number of active cases in Nigeria, given the current infection trajectory, may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population of 200 million, unless drastic measures are taken to bring the basic reproduction number below one. It was shown by simulations that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Moreover, the model was extended to include time-dependent optimal control variables (preventive and management measures) to examine their impacts in minimizing the burden of COVID-19 in the population using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The optimal preventive measure was shown to be better than management control in reducing the burden of the disease, but the combined effort of the two controls has significant effect in reducing the number of infectious individuals in the population. This result was further supported by carrying out the cost-effectiveness analysis, and it was therefore established that the combined implementation of the two control measures is the most cost-effective when compared with the single implementation of each control measure.In view of the above, it can be concluded that flattening of the novel coronavirus infection curve largely depends on two key parameters, namely effective transmission coefficient and recovery rate. Efforts geared toward lowering the transmission rate and improving on the treatment regime for quick recovery of cases are required to ensure virus-free region and effectively overcome the spread of the novel coronavirus in the host population. To achieve this optimally, it is recommended that adherence to the combination of preventive and management control measures should be strict. These measures include continued public advocacy for social distancing, good personal hygiene, wearing face masks in public places, provision of protective gear for healthcare workers caring for people with COVID-19 infection. If strict adherence is practiced, transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals will be effectively hindered, and availability of supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation for hospitalized individuals with severe COVID-19. In addition, given the ongoing community spread of the virus in Nigeria and almost all the countries of world, the need to scale up the testing capacity for detection and prompt treatment of asymptomatic individuals cannot be overemphasized in order to nip the transmission of the novel coronavirus in the bud. It is also pertinent to advise that healthcare facilities should not only be increased, but well equipped to accommodate the increasing spate of cases and effectively manage patients who may develop complications due the novel coronavirus infection.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-11-25","11"

(2020b) ; ; Lai et al. (2020) ; Flaxman et al. (2020) ; Ferguson et al. (2020) . The transmission pathways of COVID-19 from person to person are: i) close contact through respiratory droplet, ii) direct contact with infected persons, and iii) contact with contaminated formites (objects and surfaces) Kassa et al. (2020) . Public health measures are intended to diminish these transmission mechanisms.Mathematical models have been previously used with success in understanding the transmission dynamics and control mechanisms of infectious diseases (Anderson and May (1979) ). To understand the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 under different scenarios, a number of mathematical models have been proposed in the literature, Prem et al. (2020) ; Li et al. (2020) ; Walker et al. (2020) ; Ivorra et al. (2020) ; Ngonghala et al. (2020) ; Nicholas et al. (2020) . Those epidemiological and mathematical models contributed important insight for public health decisionmakers to enforce different mitigation strategies in different countries. As COVID-19 has spread worldwide, most countries are utilising mathematical models to inform on public health measures. Many countries (for example the UK, China, Germany, USA, Morocco) revised their public health measures based on COVID-19 modelling results. We believe that, due to the difference in the age-structure of the population, social interaction and life style in Ethiopia, mathematical models developed in other countries may not work to study the dynamics of disease in lower income settings. This study employs the use of mathematical models to simulate the spread and interruption of transmission of the disease in Ethiopia.Assessment of implemented and proposed intervention strategies for combating , and predicting the number of new cases and deaths is a major challenge to both the public and scientific community. Banholzer et al.Our study proposes a modified mathematical model of the classic SEIR model (Anderson and May (1979) ) and this modified model is used to compare the effect of different NPIs individually and in combination. The proposed model classifies the human population into eight non-overlapping stages of infection: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Asymptomatic infectious (Ia), Symptomatic infectious (Is), Isolation of cases with mild/moderate health condition (at home or hospital) (HIm), Hospitalized with critical health condition (Hc), Recovered from the disease (R), and Death due to COVID-19 (D).Our proposed model (1) has a number of advantages: i) provide estimated time and size of the peak under the implementation of NPIs with different adherence level in urban and rural population settings, ii) proposed model differentiates asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious which influences the number of ICU cases and death due to the disease, iii) the effect of indirect transmission of the disease through contaminated environment is taken into account, and iv) provide the estimated impact of individual and synergy public health measures on the dynamics of the disease. The projected number of people in each stage of the disease at the peak period and the time of the peak in urban and rural areas of Ethiopia helps the government to choose and enforce better intervention mechanisms.In our modeling framework, the population is divided into different compartments according to the infection status of individuals: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infected (Ia), symptomatic infected (Is), isolated at home or hospital with moderate health condition (IHm), hospitalized with severe health condition (Hc), recovered from the disease (R), and death (D) due to the disease. Contaminated environment is also a means of transmission for COVID-19 as the virus can stay up to several days on different surfaces van Doremalen et al. (2020) . To account for the impact of contaminated objects in the transmission, an additional compartment for contaminated environment is included. Paramter description with these assumed initial values are presented in Table 1 . Those values were extracted from a number of key papers and reports of the situation in Ethiopia (Institute (2020); Goshu et al. (2020) ; Baye (2020) ; Kebede et al. (2020) ; Siraj et al. (2020) ) and epidemiological scientific facts of COVID-19.where the force of infection, γ, is obtained using the following formula:To check the mathematical and biological meaningfulness of the model, both positivity and boundedness properties of the proposed model are assessed as follows. Let the domain space be defined by Ω = (S, E, Is, Ia, Hc, IHm, R, D, Env) ∈ R 9 + Theorem 2.1. int(Ω) = {(S, E, Is, Ia, Hc, IHm, R, D, Env)|S > 0, E ≥ 0, Is ≥ 0, Ia ≥ 0,The proof of theorem 2.1 is presented in the Appendix and the theorem implies well-posedness of the system.In order to identify parameters which significantly influence the model system, sensitivity analysis was performed.The uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is done by using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) analysis with N=10,000 samples for various input parameters Wu et al. (2013) ; Marino et al. (2008) . The partial derivative of the threshold value Ro with respect to the input parameters were computed by varying the parameters around normal values.Equilibrium points are those points where each equation in the system in Equation (1) is equal to zero. Equating the right hand side of each equation in Equation (1) to zero will provide disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. In this subsection, the disease-free equilibrium point is described as follows.When there is no COVID-19 in the population, the disease-free equilibrium point is given by E0 = (S, E, Ia, Is, IHm, Hc, R, D, Env) = ( π µ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)In this study, to compute the basic reproduction number, Diekmann et al. (1990) , next-generation method for the disease-free equilibrium is employed. The basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary infection cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infectious individual. According to the definitions stated in Diekmann et al. (1990) and van den Driessche and Watmough (2002a) , in the next-generation method, R0is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix which is given byThe infection compartments of our model are (E, Ia, Is, IHm, Hc, Env)Computing the Jacobian of f and evaluating it at the disease-free equilibrium point using the force of infection, we have,and the Jacobian of v evaluated at the disease free equilibrium point using the force of infection is given by the matrixFinding the inverse of V and computing the product F V −1 , the next generation matrix is given by (9)The corresponding Spectral radius of the matrix F V −1 is given bywhich can be expressed as A = R0 = R0a + R0s + R0Env and the quantity R0 is the basic reproduction number of the Model (2). The quantity R0 is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new COVID-19 cases generated by symptomatically infectious humans (R0s), asymptomatically infectious humans (R0a) and contaminated environment (R0E nv ).Theorem 2.2. The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of model 2 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1, and unstable if R0 > 1.Proof. It follows from Theorem 2 of van den Driessche and Watmough (2002b) The implication of Theorem 2.2 is that a small introduction of COVID-19 cases will not generate a COVID-19outbreak if the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity.Theorem 2.3. The disease-free equilibrium of model 2 is globally asymptotically stable if R0 ≤ 1.The endemic equilibrium is attained in the presence of the disease, which is denoted by:From Equation (14), solving for E * , we havefrom Equation (15) solving for I * s we havefrom Equation (16) , solving for H * m we havesolving for H * c from Equation (17) we havesolving Equation (18) for R * we haveby solving Equation (20) for E * nv , we can getDue to the very limited number of available ventilators in Ethiopia (below 1000 ventilators in total), knowing the projected number of individuals who need ICU under the implementation of different NPIs with varying adherence level of hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing are important to save lives. Many studies showed that most of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 are of older age and have more co-morbidities than the non-critically ill patients. Hence, projection is done for all active case, symptomatic cases, asymptomatic cases, ICU cases, and death due to the disease using the proposed model.In our model, common COVID-19 related parameters were obtained from previous studies (Table 1) . 2Further, based on the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey, 27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural population wash hands by soap, respectively. Thus, in the simulation, we assumed improved percentages of hygiene due to the awareness created by COVID-19 in both population settings. Due to differences in access to sanitation materials, lifestyle, cultural norms and other factors, adherence levels to the recommended NPIs are also different in the urban and rural populations. As a result, projection on the number of COVID-19 related cases is done separately for urban and rural populations of Ethiopia.In this study, data on daily number of COVID-19 cases, cumulative number of deaths, and number of critical patients was extracted from Ethiopian Public Health Institute website (www.ephi.gov.et/) and Ministry of Health official Twitter page(https://twitter.com/FMoHealth/) on daily basis. We used initial parameter (1) (2020); Kassa et al. (2020) . The projection model considers daily number of cases in Ethiopia up to 210 days (October 08, 2020) since the first case of the disease was recorded.Based on the current evidence about COVID-19, implementing different NPIs are essential requirements for limiting the spread of the disease. The main objective of NPIs is to reduce the rate of transmission, thereby minimizing the size of the epidemic peak and delaying peak time, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be developed, approved and used, Table 2 ). We assume that implementing NPIs alone or in combination affects the rate of contact between uninfected people and infected people or objects. As a result, transmission probability of the virus from infected individuals or objects to the susceptible population is reduced.We evaluated the impact of the three NPIs, alone or in combination, on the time and size of the peak by varying the adherence level to each of them.By fixing the adherence levels to hygiene to 30% and 40% of the urban population based on the aforementioned reasons, the projected number of active COVID-19 cases was obtained by varying the percentages of social distancing and face mask coverage. Figure 2 presents the projected number of active COVID-19 cases with varying adherence levels of NPIs.At 15% face mask coverage and with 10% of the population implementing social distancing measures, a 10%In the rural parts of Ethiopia, physical distancing is a custom and part of the life style. This custom greatly minimizes the spread of the disease that is caused by contact and contaminated environment. Furthermore, due to low coverage of road accessibility (accessibility index=22%), in our simulation we assumed 20% of the population are Keeping adherence to face mask wearing and physical distancing constant, a 5% increase in hygiene will decrease the number of cases by 200, 000 and shift the peak time to the future nearly by one month (Figure 3) . For a given implementation of face mask wearing and hygiene, improving the percentage of physical distancing by 10% will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases by one-fourth.The following projected number of symptomatic (broken line) and asymptomatic (solid line) cases were simulated by assuming 30% and 40% of the urban population wash hands with soap, with different face mask coverage (5%, 15%and 25%) with 35% mask efficacy. When 40% of the urban population wash hands with soap or keep hands clean using sanitizers, 25% wear face masks, improving the implementation of physical distancing greatly reduces both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. By increasing the percentage of physical distancing in the population from 10% to 20%, the peak size will decrease by half for both infection compartments (Figure 4) .Practicing recommended NPIs properly (40% physical distancing 5% face mask and 20% proper hand washing) could greatly reduce the number of death due to COVID-19. Table 3 and Table 4 presents summary of the projected number of active COVID-19 and ICU cases under different adherence levels of hygiene, wearing-masks and physicaldistancing in the urban and rural population of Ethiopia, respectively.In this respect, increasing physical distancing directly reduces β1 as this lowers the likelihood of a susceptible individual getting in contact with a potentially infected individual. In addition, practicing good hygiene (such as regularly washing hands, using sanitizers to disinfect the infected environment, ventilation of rooms and avoiding touching the T-zones of the face) is associated with lowering the chance of contracting the virus from infected surfaces.Anything contrary to the above increases the likelihood of getting the infection through the two aforementioned routes.Moreover, improving hand wash practices will reduce viral contamination of the environment by infected individuals.On the other hand, the processes underlying the parameters with negative PRCC have a potential to contain the number of cases when enhanced.In this study, a modified SEIR model was developed to project the number of COVID-19 cases with different stage In the rural population setting, implementing hygiene measures, physical distancing, and wearing face masks at 20%, 40%, and 5%, respectively, could shift the peak time into to 2021. The projected number of active cases during the peak time could reach around 360,000 if 5%, 40%, and 20% of the population wear masks, keep physical distancing and hand wash with soap, respectively. As social distancing is already a custom due to the life style in the rural population of Ethiopia, improving hygiene by 20% could help to decrease the number of cases by 2-3 fold.In the urban population setting, if 20% of the population implements physical distancing and 30% adopt hygiene measures, and 25% wear face masks the peak time of the pandemic will happen on December, 2020 with 119,000 estimated cases (Table 3) . During the peak time of the pandemic, except for some scenarios (30% physical distancing and above ≥ 15% face mask coverage), the projected number of ICU case are above the capacity of the Ethiopian health system, which needs the government attention (Table 3) .COVID-19 is a deadly virus for which vaccination or effective medical treatment is not yet available. Hence the government should focus on prevention of infection using NPI mechanisms. Low socioeconomic status and behavioral attitudes lead to closer interactions in congested households, hampering the successful implementation of social distancing measures. Lack or improper use of masks and use of low quality masks may exacerbate the spread of infection. It is therefore imperative that the prudent use of NPIs is implemented in Ethiopia to contain the pandemic. NPIs used in combination are able to decrease cases and fatalities due to Covid-19. Separate implementation of each of the NPIs shortens the peak time of the pandemic and the number of new cases will increase by two-fold. We considered the place of residence being urban and rural as a factor since adherence to the recommended NPIs and the life style and living conditions, varies greatly in urban and rural society of Ethiopia.Similar to the urban population projection, projection of cases in the rural setting was done by modifying the model parameters in the context of rural population practices. Table 4 presented summary of projected active COVID-19 cases and ICU cases in rural population of Ethiopia under 30 scenarios. The results shows that, at the peak of the pandemic, the number of projected cases in rural population will be higher than the urban population.Studies on COVID-19 showed the distribution of cases strongly depend on age. The resources available could not get data on the number of cases by age group from concerned organizations in order to get age-structured predictions and to assess the impact of school closure on the pandemic. Further, the projection to the rural population setting is less reliable as the analysis has been constrained by different factors (i.e. exact number of incidences were not known, adherence to the implemented NPIs greatly vary across different regions of the country, estimated number of protected individuals assumed 20%,and others). Further, the study did not account for under reporting of COVID-19 cases.This work was supported by Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, and as a sandpit project of the One Health Regional ","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-11-18","11"

During the initial phases of this closure, most institutions were at a loss on how to proceed with learning as universities in Nigeria use mainly the didactic lecturing model. As the lockdown progressed it became imperative to the institutions to set up e-learning media for continued instruction of students. It was found that in the institutions with e-learning facilities, the preclinical years remained mostly unaffected by the closure of medical schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while all institutions came to a standstill as regards providing a suitable alternative for clinical exposure. This therein has caused loss of valuable time and a change in the calendar of the school year, making it uncertain as to when the next set of qualified medical professionals will emerge in Nigeria. In this essay, we take a look at medical education in Nigeria, its challenges and progression in the COVID-19 era. We also take a look at the effect of the pandemic on learning and the subsequent interventions introduced to mitigate it.Medical education in Nigeria: medical education commenced in the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan in 1948 and has since then evolved over subsequent generations. Most of the newer medical schools adopted the curriculum of the older schools with little or no modification [1] . Several years after establishment, most of the medical schools have not revised their curricula unlike their counterparts in other regions of the world. Currently in Nigeria, there exist 42 medical schools of which; 17 are Federal, 18 are State institutions and 7 are privately owned. Globally, it has been reported that the most populated regions and countries have most of the medical schools; India, US, China, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan and Russia account for over 40% of the total 2,409 recognized and operating medical schools in approximately 180 countries. The fastest growth rate was noticed in sub-Sahara Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia and South America [2] . Historically in Nigeria, the first three years of medical education consist of didactic lectures in the classrooms with the subsequent 3 years consisting of interactions within the confines of the hospital in the form of patient interactions and ward rounds. This format of medical education has held this way for the past half a century across most institutions in the country.Thus, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no room for off-site or digital education in many of the medical training institutions in Nigeria. Adapting medical school in Nigeria to function efficiently during this pandemic has been an especially difficult endeavor because of the absence of infrastructure for digital learning. This commentary focuses on the need to review the curriculum across most medical training institutions in the country and introduce a dynamic digital component without diluting the core concept of the rigorous medical education. According to the Nigerian medical association, Nigeria produces 3,000 doctors annually with about 41,000 doctors currently working in the country. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has revealed that the doctor to patient ratio in Nigeria is four doctors per 10,000 patients, in comparison to other countries like the US and the UK with ratios of 26 and 28 doctors per 10,000 patients respectively [3] . Thus, it is important that Nigeria increases her capacity to produce doctors. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have lost 7 months and counting as a result of the lockdown of services and institutions by the government. This may very well lead to inability to graduate doctors this year further worsening the doctor to patient ratio. The aim of this commentary is to highlight the challenges of face-to-face learning and proffer solutions that will accelerate the incorporation of digital learning platforms.Historical perspective of medical education in Nigeria: during the pre-colonial era in Nigeria, medical care was essentially provided by traditional practitioners, who were trained as apprentices under relatives who were conversant with the art of healing. This is still the major source of medical care in some parts of Nigeria [4] . The first attempt at medical education in Nigeria was in 1927 when the government set up an institution to train medical manpower to diploma level [4] . This institution had a five-year training program like British medical schools; but it was ineffective as the teachers and facilities that were available were inadequate to train doctors acceptable outside the country. The ineffectiveness of this institution, resulted into its abolishment [4] . Formal medical education began with the establishment of UCH Ibadan, a college branch of the University of London in 1948 [1] . This institution was to train premedical students in Ibadan, preclinical students in Lagos with the clinical years at Ibadan [4] . The graduates were to be trained at the same level as the British and thereafter awarded a degree of the University of London. However, the general hospital that was to function as a teaching hospital was inadequate and could not meet the standard of the University of London. Thus, a decision was taken to establish an appropriate teaching hospital, the UCH Ibadan [4] .The very first set of medical students to graduate from Ibadan, Nigeria did so in the year 1960 utilizing the curriculum of the University of London with slight modifications in pediatrics with a focus on tropical diseases [4] . Medical education in Nigeria expanded between 1960-1972 as medical schools were established in Lagos, Zaria, Enugu, Benin and Ile-Ife [5] . The period from 1972-1998 saw further creation of additional medical schools at Ago-Iwoye, Ekpoma, Port Harcourt, Calabar, Nnewi, Ilorin, Jos, Kano, Sokoto, Maiduguri and Ogbomoso. These were regarded as the third generation of medical schools in Nigeria [4, 5] . Each of these medical schools developed standards and curricula that were very similar to that of the first medical school at Ibadan with only slight adjustments. Medical education has since then expanded rapidly with the establishment of universities in almost every state in the country consisting of federal, state and private universities [5] .Medical education during COVID-19 pandemic globally: the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in the closure of universities and medical institutions globally. With the most effective strategy for the prevention of COVID-19 being social distancing in the absence of a vaccine, it is not certain how long this closure will last. This sustained closure of medical schools has created a challenge which e-learning platforms like WebEx (Cisco Webex, Milpitas, CA, USA) and Zoom may help to solve [6] . Medical education in many parts of the world is divided into pre-clinical and clinical years. With e-learning evolving has the mainstay during this period; it may be argued that preclinical medical education will not be significantly affected. The use of digital platforms for clinical engagements and electives may be difficult thus creating a significant gap in medical education. An innovative solution to this is the use of three-way telemedicine software which allow medical students to be a part of remote medical consultations [7] . This allows medical students take part in history taking, diagnosis and treatment of patients remotely. This will indirectly integrate telemedicine into the present medical curricula [7]. It will require dealing with issues around patient privacy and confidentiality. Other models which have been integrated in a bid to mitigate the effect of the pandemic to clinical medical education include case-based studies, problem-based learning in small virtual groups and use of simulators [7].In a country like Turkey where medical education is transitioning into a more individualized model, physical presence is not required in the first 3 years except for laboratory sessions [8] . Virtual learning had been adopted so with the pandemic learning was not disrupted [8] . The transition was also easier in Hong Kong, with their previous history of suspension of clinical activities of medical students during SARS outbreak [9] . The model used then, which was highly accepted by their students involved the use of problem-based learning and case studies which has aided continuation of medical education in the course of this pandemic [9] . It is very impressive how innovative clinical academics have been in ensuring the continuity of medical education. However, all of these may not replace bed side teaching and authentic patient interactions. It is important to note that actual face to face interactions serve to inculcate skills such as communication, empathy, compassion as well as teamwork in medical students.In resource constrained countries, the story is not the same with several challenges faced by medical educators in these settings hindering the continuity of medical education. In Brazil, it was observed that private universities were able to carry on by deploying electronic platforms which were not available to the public institutions. Unavailability of appropriate infrastructure and the presence of socially vulnerable students serve as a deterrence to online learning there [10] . The absence of sufficient IT infrastructure, uninterrupted internet access, stable power supply, access to computers by the socially vulnerable students and poor online content development by the faculty. The challenge of incorporating socially vulnerable students into the e-learning model in resource poor countries like Nigeria is a big one as it is a very costly process. There are problems such as high cost of internet subscription, unreliable internet service and epileptic power supply. This challenge brings forth certain questions: how do these schools incorporate virtual classrooms without exempting some students? Is e-learning feasible despite these infrastructural challenges? For final year medical students just short of graduation, will an extension of their medical training be warranted? Academics in these settings will have to make use of learning models that can bypass these problems to enable the provision of high-quality education to their medical students. What needs to be remembered is that the crisis of the global pandemic forced the transition into flipped classrooms not based on evidence on what works. Medical educators need to keep assessing this new form of educating medical students to determine if it could be continued after the pandemic abates.Nigeria: on March 20 th , 2020, the Federal Government of Nigeria ordered the closure of all educational institutions including tertiary institutions as a precaution to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the country. In Nigeria, where medical education largely involves person to person interaction, this posed a great challenge to continuing medical education. To study the impact of this pandemic on medical education in Nigeria, a survey was carried out involving 72 medical students in different levels from medical schools throughout Nigeria. Medical students from public and private medical schools were included in a bid to get a full picture of the situation and also pick up on observable disparities in their medical education.Findings from this survey showed that the majority (75%) of the participants stated that e-learning platforms were not used by their institutions prior to the pandemic. Interestingly, majority of those who stated that e-learning platforms were already in use were medical students from private institutions. With the mandatory closure of schools, 45% percent of the schools in this survey have managed to continue providing medical education to their students using various elearning platforms. It was observed that all the private institutions continued education while only a few public institutions were able to continue providing education for their students. Furthermore, among the public medical schools, it was shown that the continuation of their education using e-learning platforms were available to some classes instead of all. The transition to e-learning by these medical schools was described to have taken about 4 -8 weeks to put adequate structures in place. This shows that medical students were left with nothing to do for almost 2 months thereby creating a delay in their school calendar.Exploring the e-learning model used by these various institutions, it was shown that multiple elearning platforms were used including Zoom, WhatsApp, Google classroom, WebEx (Cisco WebEx, Milpitas, CA, USA) and institution owned platforms. Although the most commonly used platform was zoom, with a 75.6% use rate among the participants. The use of e-learning in medical education brings forth certain challenges when it comes to clinical clerkships and laboratory sessions. It was discovered that none of the schools had clear strategies to solve this problem as they deferred all clinical and laboratory sessions to when students that eventually return back to the clinical setting. In some schools, though clerkships had been deferred, a method of using pictures of disease conditions, videos of patient interactions and physical examinations were adopted for their medical students. The effectiveness of this method is uncertain.Transition to the e-learning model was unprepared for in Nigeria but inevitable due to the pandemic. As a result of this unpreparedness and the situation of Nigeria as a resource limited country, this new method of learning comes with different challenges. It was interesting to note that the challenges highlighted by the students in private institutions largely differed from those in public institutions. Challenges noted by students in private institutions ranged from problems of poor internet connection to the inability of lecturers to use the digital platforms. While for students in public institutions, their challenges are two pronged, institutional and personal. Institutional challenges included; industrial strike of university lecturers, poor funding and administrative capacity, absence of existing e-learning platforms in schools, lack of technical support and knowledge, while the challenges influenced by the students include non-ownership of devices/gadgets to access virtual resources and online platforms by majority of the student population, high cost of internet service subscription and epileptic power supply.Even though the private institutions appeared slightly more prepared for this transition, all the institutes are at a loss when it comes to graduating students without them completing their clinical exposure. Without the adequate infrastructure to bypass this challenge, the question is: will Nigeria induct final year students into the medical profession this year?Recommendations: in light of the above, the following are recommended for the advancement of medical education in Nigeria (Figure 1 ): complete conversion of preclinical lectures to virtual learning through: online-based lectures using virtual meeting platforms; student led casebased discussions; video or live virtual demonstrations of laboratory sessions. Partial conversion of clinical lessons to virtual learning through: online lectures using virtual meeting platforms; video demonstrations of procedures and examinations. Short stay on-campus in-person sessions for: small group laboratory sessions; oncampus short-stay rotations for clinical exposure and lessons; small group community immersion carried out under strict supervision and monitoring. Migration of exams to computerbased tests (CBT) through: computer based test (CBT)-type examinations for in-course assessments and multiple-choice questions (MCQ) examinations:computer based objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE); socially distanced essay examinations with progressive transition to computer based tests through training of personnel and students.It is important to blend the current curricula with virtual learning models to enhance the learning experience of the students as well as strengthen the system for any eventualities in future. There is also the need for appropriate investment in personnel, equipment and infrastructure that will allow education to continue seamlessly regardless of environmental circumstances.The authors declare no competing interests.All the authors have read and agreed to the final manuscript.

As a means of curbing the pandemic, strategies such as physical distancing, school closures, trade restrictions, and country lockdowns have been introduced. However, they have significantly increased food insecurity by affecting the production and sales of nutritional and affordable food products, which have led to millions of families relying on nutrient-poor alternatives. Strained health systems and interruptions in humanitarian response are eroding access to essential and often life-saving nutrition services. 2 Social protection systems in many LMICs are overloaded as vulnerable families struggle to access the food and services they need in the context of an economic downturn.In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a recent modeling exercise using estimates of potential impacts of COVID-19related economic deterioration, food insecurity, and interruption of community-based malnutrition programs suggests that the prevalence of wasting could increase by 10-50%, with an excess of 40,000-2,000,000 child deaths. 2 Concurrently, more children are becoming malnourished because of the deterioration in the quality of their diets, interruptions in nutrition and other essential services, and the socioeconomic shocks created by the pandemic in LMICs. 3 It was suggested that without timely action, the global prevalence of child wasting could rise by a shocking 14.3%. 3 With an estimated of 47 million children younger than 5 years affected by wasting globally before the COVID-19 pandemic, 4 this would translate to an estimated additional 6.7 million children with wasting during the first 12 months of the pandemic, 80% of them in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and more than 10,000 additional child deaths per month during this same period. 4 With services for the prevention and treatment of wasting to a large extent up-ended in LMICs, 4 millions of children are at risk of not receiving the care they need to survive and thrive. UNICEF reports from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a 30% reduction in the coverage of essential nutrition services in LMICs and declines of 75-100% under lockdown contexts. 5 UNICEF estimates that a minimum of US$2.4 billion is needed immediately to protect these children, prevent and treat malnutrition, and avoid human loss. There is an estimate of U$2.4 billion including an essential package of four life-saving interventions: prevention of wasting in children at risk, treatment for children who are wasted; biannual vitamin. A supplementation for children aged 6-59 months (90% coverage) 6 ; and mass communication for the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding that focuses on caregivers or families of children aged 0-23 months. 7 COVID-19 is making access to and availability of food more challenging for many worldwide, an undesirable situation that is likely to remain for the foreseeable future as an aftershock of the pandemic. 8 The economic, food, and health system disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to exacerbate all forms of malnutrition. 9 Estimates from the international food policy research institute suggest that because of the pandemic, an additional 140 million people will be thrown into living in extreme poverty on less than 1.90$ per day in 2020. 9 According to the World Food Programme, the number of people in LMICs facing acute food insecurity will nearly double to 265 million by the end of 2020. 10 Aside the estimated increase in marasmus, the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to increase in other forms of child malnutrition such as stunting, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight. The lack of action from the global community will have a devastating long-term effect on young children, human productivity, and economy of many nations.Protecting children's right to nutrition in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly needed at this time. This requires a swift response and investments from governments, donors, the private sector, and the United Nations. Five actions must be taken and tracked immediately.Access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets needs to be safeguarded and promoted as a cornerstone of the response to COVID-19. This can be performed by protecting food producers, processors, and retailers; discouraging trade bans; and designating food markets to be essential services and keeping them functioning and safe for workers and consumers.Investments are needed to improve maternal and child nutrition through pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood by protecting breastfeeding and preventing the inappropriate marketing of infant formula in the context of COVID-19; securing children and women's access to nutritious and diverse foods; and providing accurate information on infant feeding to caregivers.Services for the early detection and treatment of child wasting need to be reactivated and scaled up while maintaining and expanding prevention and other nutrition services, including vitamin A supplementation for children, and micronutrient supplementation and nutritional support for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and minimizing the risk of infection.Maintain the provision of nutritious and safe school meals for vulnerable children through home delivery, take-home rations, and cash or vouchers when schools are closed. These efforts also need to ensure adequate nutritional value of school meals or food packages and avoid the provision of unhealthy foods and beverages.Finally, organizations working on providing social protections to safeguard access to nutritious diets and essential services among the poorest households should be supported. They should be assisted in creating interventions that will reach families with young children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.Globally, different nongovernmental organizations provide food palliatives as awareness on good feeding habits during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, more than ever, all stakeholders including the government, private organizations, and civic societies must collaborate and act together to invest and create interventions that will help reduce the burden of malnutrition caused by the COVID-19 crisis in low-and middle-income countries.","Nigeria","first author","2020-11-06","11"

About 46 million people worldwide have been infected as of 1, November 2020, and over 1 197 000 have died. It is worthy to mention that this pandemic has the same symptoms as a flue. Fatigue, fever, headache, runny nose and dry cough are the principal clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Thus far, there is no effective antiviral medication or vaccine against COVID-19 virus has been developed. Where the World Health Organization announced it as one of the most dangerous health catastrophes in human history [4] since this virus is accelerating very quickly more than predicted by experts [5] . Therefore, searching for effective antiviral agents to battle against this virus is urgently needed. In this context, our investigations are destined for the development of therapeutic agents for COVID-19 diseases. Many scientists are working on the designing of efficacious antiviral agents with few aspect effects. Where recent research informed an inhibitor effect of the chloroquine and its derivatives on the growth of coronavirus [6] [7] [8] .Clinical trials have been done on Chinese patients COVID- 19 ; have shown that the chloroquine has a great effect in terms of clinical results and viral clearance, in comparison to the control groups [9] . They have been proposed as a potential antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19 diseases based on their antiviral activities [10, 11] .In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficiency of two approved drugs which are chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate against the COVID-19 using molecular docking calculations. Docking is a technique of designing drug molecules via computer-aided by simulating the geometric of these molecules and their intermolecular forces [12, 13] . From this calculation, we can predict the different interactions between medications and targets which have an important role in the investigation of the mechanism of the effects of drugs. In this context, many nowadays papers is dedicated to searching in drug design using molecular docking studies [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the same frame, we can cite our previous paper [18] in which we used molecular docking analysis in the determination of the biological activity of the Niclosamide compound. As a result, the niclosamide is found to be a good inhibitor of the COVID-19 virus and can, therefore, be effective in controlling this disease.The main contribution of this paper is to identify the potency of inhibition of chloroquine derivatives against COVID-19 virus by using a molecular docking study. To this end, we first determine the optimized structures of chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate molecules by using the density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Utilizing optimized structures is more exact in docking calculations, which makes the program more trustworthy to be employed in structure-based drug design. Subsequently, their reactivities were foreseen at the same level of theory by using the frontier orbital studies [19, 20] . From this analysis, we can found the most reactive antiviral ligand. Moreover, molecular electrostatic potentials surfaces were carried out to investigate which are the most reactive nucleophilic and electrophilic regions of a molecule against reactive biological potentials.Docking calculations were performed using four structures of COVID-19 (PDB codes: 6M03, 5R7Y, 5R81 and 6LU7) [21]. Basing on the binding affinities and the different interactions that exist between amino acid residues and ligands, molecular docking results were discussed. Thereafter, Rapid-Screening docking was carried out using iGEMDOCK program [31] . It is a Drug Design System for docking calculations and screening by BioXGEM labs. All the trials were docked with a population size set to 800, with 80 generations and 10 solutions.Optimized structures and numbering of atoms of chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate molecules are shown graphically in Figs. 1 and 2, obtained at B3LYP/6-31G* method. Table   1 illustrates their geometrical parameters such as the calculated total energies, the dipole moments, the RMS and the maximum Cartesian force. The global minimum energies are found to be -1326.0352 a.u (≈ -36083 eV) and -2614.3242 a.u (≈ -71139) for chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate, respectively. The RMS Cartesian force values are equal to 2.412 .10 -6 , 0.04067 in chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate. Their maximum Cartesian forces are found to be 8.593 .10 -6 and 0.1449. The dipole moment of a molecule is given in the form of a three-dimensional vector and which reflects the molecular charge distribution. Hence, it can be employed as a descriptor to describe the charge movement throughout the molecule. As a result of DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* calculations, the highest dipole moment was observed for the chloroquine phosphate (~ 24.49 Debye) whereas the smallest one was observed for the chloroquine (~ 6.05 Debye). Of course, the adding of other atoms in the geometry of the chloroquine has an influence on their stability. We can notice that the chloroquine compound becomes more stable when adding the phosphate groups since the global minimum energy decreases. Also, the strong increase in the dipole moment value shows that the chloroquine is harder before adding the phosphate groups. Moreover, it promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds.The optimized geometrical parameters of chloroquine derivatives have been determined by the above method and they are given in Tables [33] . We find that the RMSD value is equal to 0.065 Å for the bond distances and 3.382° for the bond angles. Results reveal that the carbon-carbon bond distances are found in the range 1.374-1.546 Å for C 20 -C 22 and C 5 -C 7 , respectively for the chloroquine. In the benzene ring (I), the carbon-carbon bond lengths C 13 -C 17 , C 13 -C 18 , C 17 -C 20 , C 18 -C 21 , C 20 -C 22 Table 4 , where orbital energies, energy band gap and reactivity descriptors (like electron affinity, chemical softness, ionization potential, chemical softness….) are reported.The gap between two energetic states describes the molecular chemical reactivity. The Using the energies of FMOs, we calculated the reactivity descriptors of chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate molecules. A= −E LUMO : represent the electron affinity; I = −E HOMO represent the ionization potential and μ= 1/2(I+A) is the electronic chemical potential. The chemical hardness (η) is found to be 2.239 and 2.629 eV for chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate, respectively. The chemical softness () has been computed and found to be 1.1195 and 1.3145 eV -1 . Moreover, the electrophilicity index () is about 2.512 eV for chlroquine and 2.912 eV for chloroquine phosphate. Based on the value found of the electrophilicity index, we can conclude that the chloroquine phosphate is a good electrophile better than chloroquine. Therefore, it is able to accept an electron doublet in order to form bonds with another reagent which is necessarily a nucleophile. Electronegativity is also determined (χ= (I+A)/2) and it is found to be χ chloroquine =3.3545 eV and χ chloroquine phosphate =3.9135 eV.The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a well-established tool for the study of Molecular docking studies of chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate ligands were carried out with four structures of COVID-19 protein (PDB ID: 6M03, 5R7Y, 5R81 and 6LU7). The two ligands were tested for drug-likeliness properties. Calculations were performed using the iGEMDOCK program through the generic evolutionary method (GA) and an empirical scoring function. Both ligands and target proteins structures were adapted with Discover Studio Visualizer software. All crystallographic water molecules were removed.Our goal is to determine the modes of interaction of protein-ligand complexes while looking for favorable orientations for the binding of a ligand to a receptor [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . In our case, the receptor represents the COVID-19 protein which has one or more specific active sites, more or less accessible. At each step, the interactions are affected and the best pose of the ligands is determined. 10 poses have been obtained; we have chosen the best pose with the lowest energy. These best poses were selected for investigating the different types of interactions that introduce a biological signal.The examination of Table 5 revealed that the chloroquine ligand presented the highest total energy score with the target protein 6M03 which is equal to -81.866 kcal/mol. Note that the total energy is the sum of the three energies interactions: VDW, hydrogen band and electronic. Van der Waals interaction is a potential energy of attraction between two In order to upgrade the recognition of the interactions existing between receptor and ligand, the affinities of these complexes were calculated by using AutoDockTools (ADT) [45] . These affinities describe the strength of a non-covalent interaction between the ligand and its target which binding to a site on its surface. It is premised on the numeral and the nature of the physicochemical interactions. As illustrated in Table 5 , the affinities values (in ultimate value) of chloroquine are found to be in the order of 6.7>6.6>6.1 kcal/mol for (6M03 and 5R81), 5R7Y and 6LU7, respectively.According to the energetic related results of the docking calculations and the corresponding docking positions, the chloroquine phosphate has better binding interaction with 5R7Y protein (as seen in table 5 and fig. 8 ). This protein strongly interacts with the The results obtained show that the chloroquine penetrates well into the active areas of the protein. Therefore, it can be considered to be a potent inhibitor against COVID-19 diseases. But the chloroquine phosphate molecule showed a better activity rather than chloroquine since it interacts stronger with the receptor. This can be justified by the effect of the addition of the phosphate groups.Of course, each compound has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the rest. The chloroquine phosphate is initially made up of chloroquine. Evidently, the adding of other atoms in the geometry of the chloroquine has an influence on their stability. The chloroquine compound becomes more stable when adding the phosphate groups since the global minimum energy decreases. Moreover, the smallest dipole moment was obtained for the chloroquine whereas the highest one was obtained for the chloroquine phosphate. This increase shows that the chloroquine is harder before adding the phosphate groups and also it promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds. We also find that by adding phosphate group the gap energy decreases, which involves a high reactivity for the chloroquine phosphate. This decrease in gap energy makes the flow of electrons easier, so the molecule becomes soft and more reactive.Given their high efficiency in the treatment against COVID-19 pandemic, chloroquine derivatives have been studied combining DFT method and molecular docking calculations.The optimized molecular structures of chloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have been carried out using DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* method and their geometrical parameters were also determined. The comparison of the observed and calculated results showed a good agreement.Molecular properties such as frontiers orbitals, gap energies and reactivity descriptors have also been discussed. Results reveal that the addition of the sulfate group resulted in a decrease in the gap energy, which involves an expected high reactivity for the chloroquine phosphate.This decrease in gap energy makes the flow of electrons easier, so the molecule becomes soft and more reactive. The density of states (DOS) was determined and it allowed bettering describing the border orbitals. Thereafter, the calculated MEP maps show the positive potential sites are favorable for nucleophilic attack, whereas the negative potential sites are favorable for the electrophilic attack. Docking results were discussed based on the different interactions between the ligands and proteins. The chloroquine derivatives are found to be a good inhibitor of COVID-19 virus and can, therefore, be effective in controlling this disease.We found that chloroquine phosphate was considered to be the best inhibitor of coronavirus pandemic.

This viral infectious disease is an acute respiratory illness, 1 which has now spread across all the countries of the world. 2, 3 Governments and medical officials are also trying their best to curb the spread as much as possible. 4 The virus is transmitted by aerosols that could remain suspended in the air for many minutes after coughing or sneezing or via close personal contact, such as by touching or shaking hands with an infected person. These viruses may also spread when people touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then their mouth, nose, or eyes. Moreover, it can remain viable for a few days on multiple surfaces. 5, 6 All population has been identified to be at the risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their demographic composition, however, people with comorbidities and males older than 60 years have been reported to be more at risk of the virus. 7 The virus was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern on 31 st January 2020, and on 11th March of the same year, WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. 4, 8 As at 2 nd May 2020, over 3.3 million cases and 330,000 deaths have been reported in all the continents, 9 and these cases are still growing. Gilbert and colleagues' modelling study of the risk of COVID-19 importation from China indicates that the ability of African countries to manage the local transmission of the virus after importation hinges on implementing stringent measures of detection, prevention, and control. 10 The country with the second-highest import risk ranking was Nigeria, with moderate capacity but high vulnerability and potentially significantly larger populations that are exposed toThe COVID-19 is ravaging the world with daily increase in mortality and morbidity rates. The impact of the pandemic on public health is enormous and individual health are at stake, including the psychological effects due to the social restrictions on the general quality of life.ineffective healthcare system. 3 The first reported case of the novel virus was imported into Nigeria in February 2020 by an Italian citizen. 10 The current number at the time of this report stood at 2,170 reported cases and 68 deaths. 9 Since the vaccine is currently not available, it seems that the virus can only be slowed by extreme behavioral change and societal coordination, else the virus will spread within the country very fast. 2 Preventative measures implemented by national, state, and local governments worldwide now affect the daily routines of millions of people worldwide, and the rule includes social distancing and non-movement between and within countries. [11] [12] [13] These changes are essential to beat coronavirus and protect health systems. 14 Existing studies have demonstrated that the current most effective and efficient public health interventions are only feasible when the public duly accept them. 15 However, preliminary reports show vast differences in peoples' willingness to practice measures that can reduce pathogen transmission. 2, 16 A study in Italy concluded that majority of the respondents adherend to national prescribed health measures. 17 Also, a sentiment study conducted on compliance to lockdown in India showed a positive curve despite, the negativity, fear, disgust, and sadness about the lockdown. 4 Due to the high cost of complete isolation and healthcare, compliance with prescribed recommendations and national lockdown to strategically reduce contact are expected be higher. 15 During the lockdown people were asked to stay at home and socially and physically isolate themselves to prevent being infected. 18 These measures are necessary to fight the novel coronavirus disease. Although effective in preventing the uncontrolled spreading of COVID-19, these measures can negatively affect mental health, 19 and relaxation will almost certainly trigger a further epidemic wave of deaths. 20 Social separation or quarantine of noninfected persons for an extended period may have adverse effects, such as loneliness, a rise in fear and anxiety and also, mental health consequences. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 21 The previous outbreaks of another family of coronavirus such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) had been linked to anxiety, depression, and psychological challenges. 22 Fear of the unknown raises anxiety levels in healthy individuals as well as those with pre-existing mental health conditions. 23 There has been a global rise recently in the spread of misinformation that has plagued the scientific community and the public. The public health crisis emerging due to COVID-19 is also now beginning to feel the effects of misinformation. 24 In our current digital world, online platforms are perhaps the most accessible source of health-related information for the public. 25 As more social interactions move online, the conversation around COVID-19 has continued to expand, with growing numbers turning to social media for both information sourcing and social interaction globally and in Nigeria. 11 Twitter and other social media platforms are essential sources of breaking news around the globe. It can also be a crucial vehicle in disseminating new public health information. 26, 27 Limited studies have been able to link socio-demographic predictors of compliance to prescribed recommendations and lockdown psychological impacts and if this can either inflate or deflate the propagation of COVID-19. Thus, this study examined the socio-demographic predictors of compliance to COVID-19 prescribed recommendations and psychological impacts of COVID-19 among Nigerian social media users.The current estimated population of Nigerian social network users stood at 28.15 million which accounts for about 14% of the total population and it is projected to reach 44.62 million by the year 2025. 28 Social media users were selected as the study population as a result of the current restrictions on movement and physical interpersonal interaction in the country. This cross-sectional survey used a Google-based, anonymous online questionnaire to gather data from respondents via social media platforms such as Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. On these platforms, the google based questionnaire link was shared among the participates. A snowball sampling technique was adopted to involve more Nigerians social media users currently residing in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown by telling those who were first sent the external google based questionnaire link to share with their contacts with the same characteristics. This unidentified online survey was conducted for one month (between 1 st April to 31 st May 2020), and a total of 1,131 participants were involved.Due to the social distancing rules imposed by the Nigerian Government and the enforcement of curfew/lockdown, physical interaction was not feasible, so the study survey was promoted online via social media platforms, and existing study participants were encouraged to share the online google based questionnaire with potential respondents. Participation was completely consensual, voluntary and anonymous. All respondents were asked an informed consent question at the beginning of the questionnaire by asking if they were interested in participating in the online google based questionnaire for this study, those who chose that they are not interested in participating were signed-out from completing the next phase of the online google based questionnaire while those who agreed to participate were allowed to move to the next phase involving the completion of the online google based questionnaire. The online google based questionnaire elicited socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, educational attainment, professional history of the respondents, while outcomes variables such as compliance to prescribed recommendations and psychological impacts of lockdown during the lockdown among Nigerian social media users.Respondent age, gender or sex, educational level, and professional background variables were used as explanatory variables. The outcome variables were recommendation compliance and feeling regarding COVID-19 pandemic, and respondents' adaptation. Recommendation compliance refers to whether respondents comply with the country's ministry of health recommendations while feeling regarding the COVID-19 pandemic refers to the respondent's feelings concerning their feelings during lockdown.Respondents were asked about their opinions regarding the COVID-19 epidemic; those that reported nervous/anxious, fear, angry, lonely, and bored were coded stressed while those that said just fine, happy, and relaxed/optimistic were coded not stressed. Respondent adaptation refers to coping strategies used by the respondent. Respondents were coded adapting well, if engaged in positive activities like watching television, reading books/magazines, volunteering, working from home, etc. Respondent was coded not adapting well if they engaged in harmful activities like The data collected were analysed using Stata 14 statistical tool. Findings were described in table and figure formats, using frequencies and percentages to explain specific variables of the sample population. A bivariate analysis ( 2 -test) was conducted to predict the influence of socio-demographic factors on the outcome variables. Results with a p-value less than 0.05 were significant predictors in the bi-variate analysis.The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria. Participants' permission was sought before filling out the online google based questionnaire. All those who agreed to participate in the survey were granted access to the online form. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic distribution of the respondents. The table revealed that more than 77.6 percent of respondents were between the ages of 18 to 39, while the remainder were between the ages of 40 and above. Sex reveals 42.1% were male, and 57.9% were female. The table shows that respondents were well educated with 5.7% without college education. More than half of respondents were from scientific/medical professional background (61.3%). The respondents' compliance with prescribed recommendations shows that 9 out of every respondent reported that they follow the country ministry of health recommendations (Table 2) . When asked about the extent they follow the recommendations, 4 out of every ten reported that they follow all the recommendations. Respondents were asked how frequently they touch their face, only 3.8% reported that they never touch their face, 34.3% rarely touch their face, 34.7% touches their face sometimes, 21.2% touches their face often, and only 6% touch their face always. Table 3 presents the respondents' psychological impacts and coping strategies & source of information. Six out of every ten respondents reported that they were stressed, and about four reported that they were not stressed. Concerning coping and adaptation during the lockdown, 83.7% reported that they are adapting well by watching TV/movies, spending time with family, reading books/magazines, and working from home. Source of information about the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that 8 out of every ten respondents heard the information from social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp profile, etc.) while the remaining heard from TV (14.1%), friends/family (2.4), newspaper (2.0%) and other sources (1.4%).The association between recommendations compliance and respondent socio-demographics is illustrated in Table 4 . As age increases, the number of respondents' compliance to recommendations decrease but almost all the respondents in both categories adhere to recommendations. There is no statistically significant relationship between the age of respondents, gender, level of education, and respondents' professional background and compliance with the recommendations. Table 5 describes the association between respondents' sociodemographic variables and feelings of the respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of respondents in both age categories reported been stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The same trend was observed for level of education. More than half of respondents with no college education and college education feel stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this is not statistically significant in this study. Gender and professional background of the respondent are also not statistically significant. Table  6 presents the respondent's socio-demographics and adaptation during the pandemic. Across all socio demographics, it was observed that majority of respondents were adapting well. About 8 out of every 10 respondents in both age group categories were adapting well. Age group of respondents, gender and level of education were not statistically significant. About 8 out of every ten respondents in the level of education categories reported that they were adapting well. The professional background of the respondent shows a statistically significant relationship in that more of the respondents with a scientific/medical background were adapting well.This study was carried out to examine the socio-demographic predictors of adherence to prescribed recommendation and psychological impacts of lockdown among Nigerian social media users. As the world faces the coronavirus threat, many commentators and national leaders around the world are beginning to recognize this as a genuine threat to national security. 29 The danger of spreading COVID-19 does not come from an external adversary but from peoples' behaviour, 30 adherence to prescribed recommendations have been studied to have positive effect on the spreading of the virus. 4, 17 The same level of compliance was observed across all the selected socio-demographic characteristics in this study as majority of the respondents reported to have been complying to the recommendations prescribed by the Nigerian government. However, none of the selected socio-demographic characteristics was a predictor of adherence to prescribed recommendations. It is crucial to know how people are adapting to their various environments in this unprecedented period, as such this study further examined the socio-demographic predictors of psychological impacts of COVID-19 on Nigerian social media users. The findings show that respondents who are young and active were adjusting well. This may be because they have the energy to engage in different activities. Also, young people are the best with technology, with the internet they can relate with their friends in any part of the world. The educational level category also shows that respondents who were more educated were adapting well. This is because they are more knowledgeable and can easily understand the situation compared to those with no formal education. The respondents' professional background was another variable explores on adaptation in this study. The finding shows that respondents with science/medical background are more likely to adapt well and this maybe because of their awareness of preventive measures.The study also assesses the psychological impacts of lockdown on respondents concerning whether they are stressed or not. The finding shows that younger age groups, female respondents, those educated respondents and respondents with scientific professional background in this study reported been stressed during coronavirus lockdown in Nigeria, it is paradoxical because these same categories of socio-demographic characteristics reported to have been adapting well based on the activities they are engaging with during lockdown, however, only among the selected socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents only professional background shows to be a predictor of psychological impacts of COVID-19 lockdown among Nigerian social media users. It is pertinent to know that this same level of variation was reported previously in another study with same focus on other coronavirus family outbreaks such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 22, 31 The main strength of this study ability to capture accurate data during pandemic without any physical contact with any of the respondents and this is also linked to the fact that answering of the questions were done at the convenient of the respondents without any interference. However, this study is also susceptible to certain limitations. The study data collection was done via social media platforms, younger population were more than the older population, and this is because larger number of younger population is more acquitted to the use of technology than the older population as such the study findings does not depict the true picture of Nigeria populations as a whole.The study concluded that majority of Nigerian social media users were adhering to the prescribed recommendations outlined by the government or health minister. As much as some selected socio-demographic characteristics of Nigerian social media users were not predictors of adherence to prescribed compliance, feelings and adapting well during COVID-19 lockdown, some sub-cat- egories of the socio-demographic characteristics such as younger age group, female respondents, educated respondents and respondents with scientific professional backgrounds showed that higher proportion of the respondents reported feeling stressed during COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. Psychological programmes that will put into consideration the mental health and encourage these sub-categories of respondents should be promoted in Nigeria.The study further concluded that among the selected sociodemographic characteristics only professional background of the respondents was the major predictor of psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown among Nigerian social media users, as such an intervention that will address mental health and wellbeing of Nigerians during COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic should be targeted at Nigerian social media users with scientific background","Nigeria","abstract","2020-11-25","11"

The severe situation is causing mental health problems such as anxiety. [1] [2] [3] Generalized anxiety disorder is the most frequently occurring mental health disorder, which is characterized by excessive worry or fearfulness about events and is associated with heightened tension, nervousness, and irritability; it may cause physical symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and trouble concentrating or sleeping. 4, 5 The HCWs are facing the pressure of working in resource-deprived settings and ever-growing patient load all over the world. 6 According to the studies conducted in the era of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Ebola epidemics, the onset of a sudden and immediately lifethreatening illness could lead to extraordinary amounts of pressure on HCWs and might cause adverse psychological disorders, such as anxiety, fear, and stigmatization. [7] [8] [9] [10] The other study conducted in Italy reported a significant proportion of HCWs experienced anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances during This psychological pressure exerts an adverse effect on the quality of care given for patients. HCWs are expected to wear heavy protective garments and other personal protective equipment during pandemic like COVID-19, making it much more difficult to carry out medical operations or procedures than under normal conditions. These factors, together with the fear of being contagious and infecting others, physical exhaustion, inadequate personal equipment, and the need to make ethically difficult decisions on the rationing of care could increase the possibility of psychological issues among HCWs. 9,12-14 A study conducted in China reported that 13% of HCWs experienced anxiety during the fight against COVID-19. 15 Another study conducted on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers in Singapore reported a 10.8% anxiety prevalence. 16 Besides, a Hong Kong study found that health workers suffered high anxiety scores after directly treating confirmed SARS patients. 17 Studies revealed that having comorbidities, living in the rural areas, being a female health worker, marital status, profession, having children, and contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for developing anxiety among health workers. 15, 16 Ethiopia faces the most critical phase of the pandemic, with community transmission. HCWs across the country are facing a fight like never before. Frontline health-care workers, faced with heavy workloads, life-or-death decisions, and risk of infection, are particularly affected. 18 Even though there are some studies conducted  on the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 and its associated factors globally, it is a new disease and the medical  system and culture of different countries vary which  necessitates the need for further research on the psychological experience of frontline health workers fighting  against COVID-19 . Currently, as far as our literature search is concerned, there are no published studies on anxiety related to COVID-19 in Ethiopia in general and Southern region in particular. Therefore, this study aimed to assess generalized anxiety disorder and its associated factors among healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia. The findings of this study are timely and would help the local program planners and policymakers to plan appropriate interventions at the early stage to prevent a detrimental psychological outcome of HCWs.Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health workers working in Gamo, Gofa, Konso, and South Omo Zones of Southern Ethiopia from 20, May to 20, June 2020.There are a total of two general and 10 primary hospitals, and 134 health centers in the four zones. There are 4820 health professionals providing health services in the Zones. All health care workers working in four Zones during the data collection period were included in the study.A single population proportion formula ((Zα/ 2 ) pq/d 2 ) was used to estimate the sample size required for the study. The sample size calculation assumed the proportion (p), the estimated level of anxiety among HCWs was estimated to be 50% because there is no prior study finding in Ethiopia, 95% confidence level, margin of error of 5%, and a design effect of 2 which gave the sample size of 768. In consideration of a 10% non-response rate, the final sample size was 845 HCWs. Mathematically, it is calculated as follows: Z= the standard score corresponding 95% confidence interval (1.96) P= level of anxiety among HCWs, it was estimated to be 50% d= margin of error, 5% By considering a design effect of 2 because we used a multi-stage sampling technique (384 *2=768). Then, we considered a 10% non-response rate, the final sample size used for this study was 768 + 77= 845.The study participants were selected using a multistage sampling technique. First, 20% of health institutions were selected using a simple random sampling technique (computer-generated random numbers) after allocating a proportion to each Zone based on the size of health institutions. Then, the sample size was proportionally allocated to the health institutes based on the size of health care workers. Lists of active health care workers were taken from each selected health institute. Finally, a simple random sampling technique (computergenerated random number) was implemented to recruit the health professionals in each selected health institute.A pretested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The tools were developed by reviewing different works of literature and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The survey questionnaire included Socio-Demographic characteristics, medical history, alcohol use, physical exercise, and miscellaneous psychosocial questions. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess the level of anxiety among health professionals. 19 It is a 7-item questionnaire developed to screen patients for anxiety and rate the severity of anxiety. Each item is rated on a 4-point likert-scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) on the symptoms in the previous 2 weeks. The total score of GAD-7 ranged from 0 to 21, with increasing scores indicated more severe functional impairments as a result of anxiety. For the purpose of this study, the score of anxiety assessing questions was calculated for each respondent then the overall score was computed and the levels of anxiety were classified into none to minimal, mild, moderate, and severe. Scores represent 0-5 None to Minimal, 6-10 mild, 11-15 moderate, and 15-21 severe anxiety. During data collection, a reliability analysis was done and the result showed a good score of internal consistency between the items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.807). Language experts translated the questionnaire from English to Amharic and back to English to ensure consistency in meaning. A pretest was conducted on an unselected health institute by taking 5% of the total sample size. After we made appropriate corrections, the revised version of the questionnaire was used for final data collection. Twelve trained public health professionals participated in the data collection. We used KOBO collect survey tool to collect data. KOBO collect survey tool is mobile applications that allow for the collection of data using mobile devices, analysis of data, and storage of data -either online or offline. Data were collected using face-to-face data collection technique. All WHO recommended COVID-19 protective measures were applied during the data collection period.Data collectors and supervisors were provided with intensive training on the techniques of data collection and components of the instrument. Before the commencement of the data collection, a pretest was conducted. A standard tool, which was developed by experts, was used to collect the information. The KOBO collect survey tool that was very important to control the quality of data was used to collect data by using tablets. The Authors and supervisors critically checked the data for completeness before being uploaded to the KOBO collect cloud server.The collected data were downloaded from the KOBO collect. It was then edited and cleaned for inconsistencies, missing values using excel, and then exported to SPSS version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for further analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed and summarized in tables, figures, and text with frequencies, mean, or standard deviations where appropriate. The association between the level of generalized anxiety disorder and its independent variables was examined by ordinal logistic regression. The ordinal logistic regression model was used because the level of anxiety was determined by using ordinal data (None to Minimal, mild, moderate, and severe). The proportional odds model (POM) was fitted to identify factors associated with the level of generalized anxiety disorder. The necessary assumptions for POM were checked using parallel line tests. The Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress chi-squared test (χ2) for the proportional odds assumption was calculated to see whether the model assumptions were violated or not. The Pearson χ2 goodness-of-fit test showed that the observed data were consistent with the fitted model; the deviance test (χ2=920.875, p =0.622) was non-significant. Additionally, the appropriateness of the POM was calculated by the parallel line test, and it showed that the general model did not significantly differ from the fitted POM (p= 0.092), this indicated that the model fit the data well. Furthermore, the χ2test of parallelism showed that the odds ratios were constant across all cutoff points of anxiety level for the final model at a 5% level of significance. Bivariable analyses were performed between the dependent and independent variables. All variables with a p -value <0.25 in the bivariable analysis were fitted into the multivariable POM to control for confounding effects. An adjusted proportional odds ratio with a 95% CI was used to calculate the strength of the statistical association between the independent and dependent variables.Ethical approval and clearance were obtained from Arba Minch University Institutional research Ethics Review Board, College of Medicine and Health Sciences with reference number (IRB/406/12). A letter of cooperation was obtained from the Zonal health department and health institutes of the respective Zones. The purpose of the study was explained and informed written consent was taken from each health care worker. To ensure confidentiality, their names, and other personal identifiers were not registered in the survey tool. Besides, this study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all ethical and professional considerations were followed throughout the study to keep participants' data strictly confidential.The data were collected from 798 study participants with a 94.2% response rate. Out of the total respondents, 482 (60.4%) were male. The mean age (± SD) of the participants was 29.29 years (± 5.69) years. The majority of the participants were town residents (88.3%) and more than half of the participants were protestant religion followers (52.3). Among the participants' health workers, 356 (44.6%) were clinical nurses and 363 (45.5%) were diploma holders (Table 1) .Among the respondents, 85% of them reported no adequate personal protective equipment in their health institute. The majority of the participants (96%) had access to media. Of respondents, 96 (12%) had no confidence in coping with stress-related with COVID-19, 682 (85.5%) had a feeling of susceptibility, and 633 (79.3%) had COVID-19 related worries. Among the participants, 630 (78.9%) believed that the suggested prevention and control practices can contain the pandemic (Table 2) .Among health care workers who participated in this study, 31.0%, 51.2%, 16.2% and 1.6% of them believed the community members were responding to the prevention practice of COVID-19, not at all, somewhat, moderately, and to the great extent, respectively. More than two-thirds (72.2%) of HCWs felt valued by their families. The data revealed that from the participant health care workers, 27.9%, 51.4%, 17.7% and 3.0% of them agreed the government is supporting the prevention and control of COVID-19, not at all, somewhat, moderately, and to the great extent, respectively.The prevalence of mild and moderate anxiety disorder among HCWs was 29.3% and 6.3%, respectively. There was no severe stage of anxiety observed during the data collection period (Figure 1 ).In ordinal logistic regression analysis, variables such as contact with confirmed or suspected cases, COVID-19 updates, confidence in coping with stresses, COVID-19related worries, feel overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life, and feeling cannot make it were statistically significantly associated with an anxiety disorder. The risk of being in the higher order of anxiety was almost two times (aPOR =1.97; 95% CI: 1.239, 3.132) higher among health professionals who had contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases compared to who had no submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2020:13 contact. Likewise, health care professionals who had no COVID-19 update were almost 5 times (aPOR=4.81, 95% CI=2.957, 7.842) more likely to develop a higher order of anxiety than those HCWs who had an update. Similarly, HCWs who were somewhat confident in coping with stress were 2.7 times (aPOR=2.74, 95% CI=1.633, 4.606) more likely to develop a higher order of anxiety disorder than their counterparts. Regarding COVID-19 related worries, the odds of health care workers who had COVID-19 related worries were 1.85 times (aPOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.120,3.056) more likely to experience higher order of anxiety than who did not worry. The odds of health care workers who had not felt overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life were 48% (aPOR=0.52, 95% CI=0.370,0.733) less likely to develop a higher order of anxiety than who was feeling overwhelmed. Similarly, the odds of health care professionals who did not feel that they cannot make it were also 56% (aPOR=0.44, 95% CI=0.308, 0.626) less likely to experience higher order of anxiety than who felt they can make it (Table 3 ).The study examined the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and identified risk factors for increased anxiety. The finding of this study revealed that 29.3% and 6.3% of HCWs suffered from mild and moderate anxiety disorder, respectively. A study from China reported that 44.6% of the HCWs had symptoms of anxiety. 20 A related study conducted in Turkey indicated that 51.6% of respondents had anxiety-related symptoms. Of this, 16.3, 13.1%, 10.6%, and 11.5%, of HCWs had mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe anxiety symptoms, respectively. 21 Another recent meta-analysis of studies reported the prevalence rate of the anxiety of HCWs during COVID-19 was ranging between 22.6%-36.3%. 22 Pockets of studies from different corners of the world had been reported the prevalence of anxiety among HCWs with a range of 11.350% 20,23-25 and finding of the present study was within this reported range. The finding of the current study showed that the majority of the HCWs experienced mild symptoms of anxiety, while moderate and severe symptoms were less common among the participants. In our view the reported figure is huge since the study was conducted at the early stage of the pandemic in Ethiopia; this alarms the need for early detection and the importance of picking up and effectively treating the milder clinical symptoms of anxiety DovePress before they evolve to more complex psychological disorders. Furthermore, a lower moderate and severe level of anxiety might be associated with the lower report of confirmed cases due to limited testing capacity during the study period in comparison with other countries. There was also a lower report of confirmed cases in the study area. A study from China which was the epicenter of COVID-19 showed that working outside the epicenter was associated with a lower risk of psychological symptoms than working in the epicenter even in the same country. 20 However, mild anxiety symptoms were higher among HCWs in the study area. This high level of anxiety among the HCWs in our study area could be attributed to fear of transmission of the disease to their family, no updates on COVID-19-related issues especially HCWs working in a rural area with no mobile network and internet connection, lack of specific drugs treating COVID-19 patients, an increasing number of suspected and confirmed cases and inadequate personal protective gears. Eighty-five percent of the participants perceived that personal protective equipment was inadequate in their health institutions. The difference in the prevalence of anxiety in different parts of the world could be attributed to variations in the health system characteristics, the culture of patient care, technologies, availability of PPE, and the tool used to assess anxiety and heterogeneity in cut off points. In the present study, we used the standard and validated tool developed for measuring generalized anxiety disorder after we checked its validity and reliability in our context. 19 Authorities at different hierarchies should assess the hazards to which their health care workers are exposed; evaluate the risk of exposure; and select, implement, and ensure workers use controls to prevent exposure to the virus. Occupational health surveillance has paramount importance to enhance the wellbeing of HCWs. Such type of study is helpful for different stakeholders to monitor mental health issues to understand the mediating factors and inform evidence-based interventions in a timely fashion. 26, 27 Our study further indicated that health professionals who had contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases were two times more likely to develop a higher order of anxiety than those who had no contact. The finding of this study was consistent with the studies conducted in China, 24,25 the score of anxiety increases among health care workers having direct contact with suspected and confirmed cases. This can be reasoned out that contact with suspected or confirmed cases increases the risk of transmission and exposure. The health workers working in low resource settings (weak health system, low economic status, and poor technology) like Ethiopia may limit their ability to follow the recommended measures; these and other factors exacerbate the fear of HCWs. Although the Ethiopian government and people presented recognition for HCWs for their dedication in fighting COVID-19which could make health workers feel honored and proud to participate in this difficult assignment -the local and national authorities should also focus on implementing measures targeting the psychological well-being of HCWs. Likewise, health care professionals who had no COVID-19 update were almost 5 times more likely to develop a higher order of anxiety than those health care professionals who had an update. This can be explained by HCWs getting information on the route of transmission, the availability and effectiveness of medicines/vaccines, experience in handling COVID-19 patient, the number of infected cases and locations, and advice on prevention of the COVID-19 increase the confidence of HCWs otherwise working in an uncertain environment without up to date information might worsen anxiety. This finding was also in agreement with the study conducted in China. 29 The odds of health care professionals who had COVID-19 related worry were more likely to experience higher order of anxiety than those health care workers who did not worry. This might be justified as health care workers are working in a highly risky environment so that increases the probability of being infected so that they might worry about transmitting the infection to their families and loved ones, separating with their children, and being stigmatized. The finding was also supported by other studies; 28,29 respondents were very worried or somewhat worried about other family members getting COVID-19. Furthermore, personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks face mask, eye goggles, protective clothing, gloves, and sanitizers, were severely deficient during the early stages of the outbreak in Ethiopia which might exacerbate worries of health care workers. Overwhelmed by daily activities and cannot make it were also significantly associated with developing higher order of anxiety among HCWs. This might be due to work overload, inner conflict about competing needs and demands of HCWs, stigma, and fear of being removed from their duties during a crisis heighten anxiety.This study has some limitations which have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the findings. As being crosssectional in the design, it does not confirm the definitive cause and effect relationship. We were unable to differentiate the preexisting anxiety from the new cases of anxiety. The other limitation of the study might be social desirability bias but we tried to minimize it by reminding participants about confidentiality and anonymity during data collection. However, the current study had strength; To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessed the prevalence of anxiety among HCWs during COVID-19 in Ethiopia, we used a strong method of analysis (Ordinal logistic regression), a validated and standardized tool with an appropriate cut off points to The study revealed that the prevalence of anxiety disorder among health care workers was high in the study area. COVID-19 updates, contact with confirmed or suspected cases, confidence in coping with stresses, COVID-19 related worry, feel overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life, and feeling cannot make it were significant factors associated with the higher order of anxiety. The findings of the current study suggest immediate psychological intervention for health care workers in the study area is vital. Therefore, proactive measures should be taken by the stakeholders at different hierarchies to promote the psychological wellbeing of HCWs in order to control the impact of the Pandemic on the HCWs, and containing the pandemic.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-11-05","11"

Worldwide, the pandemic has caused over 41 million confirmed cases and more than 1.1 million as of 22 nd Oct 2020 2020 [2] . The African continent has the lowest number of globally confirmed cases, standing roughly at 1,685,589 and registering 40,690 deaths. As of 22 nd October 2020, Ethiopia has confirmed 91,693 COVID-19 cases, 1,396 deaths, and 45,260 recoveries from over 1,423,505 tests performed to date. At the moment, Ethiopia stood at 4 th from Africa in terms of the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases next to South Africa (1 st ), Egypt (2 nd ) and Morocco (3 rd ). Thus far the case fatality rate of Ethiopia, which represents 1.5% of the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, is less than the average for Africa (2.4%) and the world (3.3%). Nonetheless, recent reports from the country suggest a spiking rate of coronavirus transmission in the community [3] .Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline of defense in combating COVID-19 and they play a critical role, not only in the management of COVID-19 patients, but also in ensuring adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare settings. As a result, they are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with the virus and could potentially contribute to the transmission [4] [5] [6] . In Ethiopia, over 1,311 health workers have contracted coronavirus as of 17 th September 2020. About 11% of HCPs retrospectively studied in Spain had tested for COVID-19 [7] . Early evidence from countries with the highest mortality rates indicates that healthcare workers are considerably at greater risk of being infected with COVID-19 ranging from 15% to 20% of the infected population and are therefore at a disproportionate risk to the rest of the population [8, 9] . For instance, the Italian Regional Reference Laboratories reported that healthcare workers accounted for 10% of 162,000 cases of COVID-19 in the country [10] .Similarly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that accounted for about 11% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States between [11] .Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the use of appropriate PPE, proper handwashing, and hand hygiene are critical in preventing the transmission and risk of infection of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. The use of appropriate PPE by healthcare workers in particular during the current COVID-19 pandemic is highly recommended and the national and international safety protocols for healthcare workers should be strictly followed [1, 12] . Since the initial outbreak report of COVID-19 in China in December 2019, there has been an increasing demand for PPE globally. In many healthcare settings particularly in Africa HCPs have limited access to appropriate PPE to protect their health in many healthcare settings [6] . As a result, many healthcare workers remain concerned about the risk of infection from the SARS-COV-2 due to the shortage of appropriate PPE recommended by WHO, and they have become ill-equipped to care for patients with COVID-19 or other causes, due to acute shortage of appropriate PPE [13] .A lack of PPE puts both HCPs and patients at risk of contracting coronavirus infection. It also presents many HCPs with challenging decisions about whether to care and provide treatment for COVID-19 patients in the absence of effective PPE. In addition, compliance with guidance on the correct use of PPE in healthcare setting is another challenge. On the other hand, the number of COVID-19 cases is rising and the shortages in PPE remains a major concern. The purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported availability and use of PPE as well as satisfaction level of HCPs practicing in public hospitals in Addis Ababa during the current COVID-19 pandemic.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9 th to 26 th June 2020 at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia in March 2020. Addis Ababa city is the most populated urban city in Ethiopia, and is home to about 17% of the urban dwellers in the country. In 2019, the city had a projected population of about 3.6 million and accounted for 3.7% of the total population [14] . The city has the highest number of health infrastructure and medical personnel compared with any city or region in the country. There were 12 hospitals and close to 100 health centers belonging to the public center, and about 25 private hospitals in Addis Ababa city. There were also over 17,000HCPs in the city, including 2,441 (14%) physicians and 8,172 (47%) nurses by the end of July 2019. Addis Ababa city has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia. As of 22 nd Oct 2020, a total of 46,570 confirmed COVID-19 confirmed cases and 122 deaths were reported in Addis Ababa [15] . The hospitals selected for the current study were the leading hospitals in the country and provided outpatient and inpatient services for the city residents and patients coming from different parts of the country.Sample size was calculated using a single cross-sectional study design formula based on a 50% prevalence estimate of the availability of PPE in the hospital at 95% confidence level, 4% precision, a design effect of 1.5 and 25% non-response rate. Accordingly, the minimum total sample size targeted for this survey was 1,200 respondents. A mix of purposive and random sampling was applied to select participants based on their availability and willingness to participate in the study. In each hospital, the types and number of wards were initially identified and the number of healthcare workers within each ward was obtained from the human resource department. The sample size allocated to the hospital was distributed to the wards proportional to the size of their healthcare workers. Since it was difficult to obtain the complete list of healthcare workers in each ward at the time of the study, proper random sampling was not followed to select the study participants. Some healthcare workers in particular physicians or nurses were on duty, some were working in different departments in the same hospital or another hospital, and others were reluctant to accept the invitation to participate in the study. The list of the available voluntary healthcare workers was obtained and a simple random sampling was applied to select potential respondents based on the sample size allocated to each ward. All eligible participants who consented to participate were recruited into the study.Before handing out the questionnaires to the potential study participants in the selected hospitals, the data collectors introduced themselves to the respondents, build a rapport with them and explained the aims of the study and data collection procedures. After obtaining consent from the participants, the questionnaires were handed out to the respondents and appointed for return to recollect the completed questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed with a cover letter (consent form), introducing the study and explaining the purpose of the survey, instructions on how to complete the questionnaire, and researchers contact information for any questions the respondent might have. Participants completed the questionnaires by themselves in English language. Data collection took place concurrently in all hospitals. Upon return of the questionnaires, the data collectors checked for completeness and consistency, and incomplete questionnaires were taken back to the respondents for completion as much as possible.Before data entry, each questionnaire was checked for completeness. Data were entered into the Census Surveys Professional (CSPro) Version 7.2 statistical software package and subsequently exported to SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA) for cleaning and data analysis. Continuous data were summarized using means and standard deviations, while categorical data were presented as frequency counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study variables. The Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups.The overall satisfaction score regarding the availability and use of PPE for each respondent was calculated by taking the sum of the scores of the four questions. Responses to these questions were summed to form a total satisfaction score ranging from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher level of satisfaction. Using the total satisfaction score, individuals were classified into two groups: dissatisfied (≤ median score) and satisfied (>median score). The reliability of the questionnaire was measured by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and the Cronbach's alpha for the satisfaction level was 0.769. A bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed to identify the main factors associated with healthcare professional's satisfaction level regarding availability and use of PPE. Individuals were classified into two based on their satisfaction level: satisfied group(1), and the rest were placed in the dissatisfied group (0). Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the associations between potential predictors and outcome variable, satisfaction level. A value of P<0.05 was used for all tests of statistical significance.Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Permission to undertake this study was obtained from every relevant authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each hospital to cooperate and participate in the survey. All participants gave their informed consent prior to data collection. Anonymity and data confidentiality were ensured, and no identifiable data from individual participants were collected. All personnel involved in the survey received orientation on COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures.From a total of 1,228 questionnaires distributed in six hospitals, 1,146 were completed and returned. Of these, 12 questionnaires were discarded due to missing data, resulting in 1,134 (92%) valid questionnaires for analysis. About 53% were females. Among the respondents reporting age, the mean (±SD) age was 30.3 ±6.4 years, about 58% aged between 20-29 years, and 32% aged 30-39 years ( Table 1 ). The largest number of respondents were from TASH (25%, n=283) and SPHMMC (20.5%, n=233), followed by ZMH (15.6%, n=177) and MH (15.3%, n=174). Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall study participants, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%) and midwives (10.3%). Among 252 physicians (22.2%) participated in the study, GPs and resident doctors accounted for 44.8% and 42.9%, respectively, while specialists and sub-specialists consisted the remaining 12.3%. With Gyn&Ob department constituting 17.2% of the respondents, surgical (13.9%), pediatrics (13.1%), medical (13.0%) and OPD (10.5%) departments represented a fairly similar number of study participants. Among the study participants reporting work experience, about 49% and 25% of the respondents reported that they served in the hospital less than 5 years and 5-9 years, respectively. However, the majority of the respondents (67%) at SPHMMC only served less than five years as compared to 28.3% of their counterparts at TASH.The HCPs were asked the types of PPE that were frequently available in the hospital before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 2 shows the self-reported availability of different PPE by HCPs before and during the COVID-19. Gloves and gowns were reported as the most frequently available PPE in the routine care of patients before and during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequent availability of most PPE as reported by the study participants has improved, for example, the frequent availability of surgical facemask and N95 respirator has increased from 59.3% and 12.6% before the pandemic to 82.6% and 24.2% after the pandemic, respectively. The self-reported availability of gloves before and during COVID-19 was >90%, and statistically not significant for any of the hospitals. The availability of gowns for all study hospitals was >60% before and during the COVID-19, with no significant increase during the COVID-19.The HCPs were asked the types of PPE that were frequently used in the hospital before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 3 presents the self-reported frequently used PPE by HCPss before and during COVID-19. Gloves and gowns were identified as the most frequently used PPE in the hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of gloves by all HCPs was above 90%, while the self-reported use by other healthcare workers before and after COVID-19 was relatively lower than others, despite showing some improvement during COVID-19. Likewise, the self-reported use of gowns remained not statistically significant before and during COVID-19, whereas its use rate remained less than 80% for the different categories of HCPs. The use of surgical facemask has increased from 47.2% before the pandemic to 85.7% during the pandemic for all HCPs (P<0.001).The use of N95 respirator has also increased from 9.1% before the pandemic to 21.2% after the pandemic (P<0.001). Similarly, the use of eye protection (goggles and face shield) has increased from 11.6% before the pandemic to 22.4% during the pandemic (P<0.001). A statistically significant increase in the percentage of respondents reporting the frequent use of hair covers during the pandemic as compared with the time before COVID-19 was also reported (P=0.008).The self-reported use of N95 respirator was the highest for physicians than other even before (16%) and after (23%) COVID-19, while the least use of N95 respirator was reported by interns. Overall, the self-reported use of N95 respirator was lower than other PPE except the use of hair cover.The total satisfaction score regarding the availability and use of PPE for each respondent was used as dependent variable and dichotomized into two groups: dissatisfied (≤median score) and satisfied (>median score). This dependent variable was further subjected to bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses using eight potential independent variables (gender, medical profession, working unit, hospital, whether received training in PPE during the COVID-19The odds of satisfaction among those health workers who used any 'homemade' or 'creative' PPE such as homemade fabric, face covering clothes or sewed cotton masks (OR=2.01, 95% CI:1.53-2.66, P<0.001) and those who reported that they were prepared to provide direct care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (OR=1.45, 95% CI:1.12-1.87, P=0.004) were higher than among other healthcare workers.Lack of appropriate PPE itself can put the HCPs at risk of contracting the virus and infecting other healthcare workers and their family. Although this problem did not only exist in Ethiopia, it was also reported from China [18] and other countries. In one study in Jordan, only 18.5% of frontline doctors reported that all PPE were available and most shortage was reported in protective facemasks [19] . Several studies emphasized that adequate training, proper use and uninterrupted availability of adequate PPE give HCPs a minimal risk of infection when treating suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18, 20, 21] . A study in China found that of 420 doctors and nurses deployed to frontline work at Wuhan hospitals between January and April 2020 none of them contracted COVID-19 after receiving training in proper use of PPE and provided with appropriate PPE [22] . A study from Hong Kong demonstrated that correct use of PPE by healthcare workers was associated with no cases of infection over a 42-day observation period [23] . Studies have also revealed that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is significantly higher particularly among frontline HCPs with inadequate PPE caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients [24] .Evidence indicates that N95 respirators maintain their protection when used for extended periods [28] although using them for longer than four hours is not recommended due to increased discomfort [28, 29] . The choice of PPE is also dependent on the level of protection provided by PPE and the risk of exposure, thus understanding them is the key in choosing appropriate PPE [30] . In this regard, the WHO IPC recommendations have proven to be an invaluable resource and were quickly adopted and implemented in many countries in preparing their response to the COVID-19 pandemic [31]. As a result, the WHO guidance on the rational use of PPE for COVID-19 has provided appropriate criteria on how to select and use appropriate PPE in different settings when PPE is in short supply [13] .The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the satisfaction of HCPs regarding the availability and use of PPE were affected by different factors, such as gender, hospital, perception that PPE is adequately available, and preparedness to provide direct care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Male healthcare workers reported statistically significant higher satisfaction level with PPE than female health workers. Among the healthcare workers, those who reported that PPE was adequately available to protect themselves from the risk of infection when managing COVID-19 patients rather than those who reported the inadequacy of PPE in their hospitals had statistically significant level of higher satisfaction about PPE. As there is limited published research on the relationship between healthcare workers satisfaction level with regard to the availability and use of appropriate PPE and associated factors, this study contributes additional knowledge in this area of research.Finally, this study had some limitations. First, the study might be affected by selection bias.Second, the study focused on more general populations of HCPs similar to other studies [33, 34] rather than healthcare workers who might have direct contact with COVID-19 patients [35] .Relying solely on respondents to determine the availability and use of PPE can introduce recall bias. Lastly, the results of this study are based on a self-reported questionnaire using a crosssectional design, and the self-reported response might not represent actual or genuine answers.In conclusion, this study has illuminated the level of the availability and use of PPE by HCPs working at hospitals, and identified a critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19. The availability of N95 respirator was particularly insufficient, and the use of goggle and gown were unsatisfactory, which might increase the risk of COVID-19 infection among HCPs.The study shows that the HCPs had an overall low level of satisfaction with the current availability and use of PPE in their hospital, which might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness among health workers to fight against COVID-19 infection. With the current critical shortages of PPE in hospitals, the ongoing widespread COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia could result in devastating consequences. The findings provide considerable insights into the importance of urgent need and concerted efforts to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the current challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventing the risks of COVID-19 infection among HCPs through providing proper and adequate PPE should be strengthened and needs to be a top priority for Ministry of Health and the Government of Ethiopia.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University.

The high level of illiteracy and poor infrastructure causes set back to educational development. The recent coronavirus outbreak compounded to the problem and has taken tolls on all socio-economic sectors without exception to the educational system in Nigeria. During the lockdown, many female students have become victims of rape which have led to unwanted pregnancies, and cases of death also reported. For instance, a female undergraduate student of Laboratory Technology Department, Federal College of Animal and Production Technology, Moor Plantation Ibadan, Oyo State was raped to death (Ajayi, 2020) ; equally incident of gang-raped and death of a female undergraduate student, University of is very significant as it represents 25 percent of Nigerian total population. From the global perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the largest devastative impact on the education sector and affected learners and teachers from pre-primary to the tertiary education level (Andreas, 2020) . Universities closed their premises and countries shut down their borders in response to lockdown measures. Findings from 200 countries in the mid-April 2020 showed that 94 percent of learners were affected by the pandemic around the world, which represents 1.58 billion learners (United Nations, 2020) . Additionally, UNESCO (2020) reported that the closure of higher institutions has affected over 91 percent of the students' population in the world and that 23.8 million students may drop out or not be able to secure admission to schools in the 2021 academic calendar.Remote learning became a lifeline for education during the pandemic but, the opportunities that digital technologies offer go well beyond a stopgap solution during a crisis (Andreas, 2020) . According to Eze et al. (2018) , e-learning education is the all-inclusive blending of ICT gadgets and modern telecommunication equipment into the education system. Andreas (2020) and Eze et al. (2018) maintained that e-learning is a hallmark of distance learning. Digital technology offers entirely new answers to the question of what people learn, how they learn, and where and when they learn. Andreas (2020) further stated that technology enables teachers and students to access specialized materials well beyond textbooks, in multiple formats, and in ways that bridge time and space. Meanwhile, Eduard and Lucian (2020) hinted that e-learning is an innovative platform for transmitting knowledge and skills to the learners; it is cheap, saves time, has a wider coverage, and as well promoting team learning and collaboration. Andreas (2020) reiterated that technology promotes deep learning, and allows schools to respond better to the varying needs of the students.In a bid to avoid brain-drain and prevent the total collapse of the education sector in the country, Nigeria joined other leagues of developed countries and incorporate e-learning in the education system. Although Nigeria Open University operates e-learning to deliver lectures and give assignments to the students this digitization has not been sufficiently harnessed in many tertiary institutions across the country. It is either the lecturers are not ICT-compliance or the students are disadvantaged. In some tertiary institutions where ICT is applied it is limited to students' registration and examination. Much effort has not been geared towards effective teaching and learning process and students' academic performance through e-learning.While COVID-19 has forced Nigeria to embrace e-learning to keep pace with rapid development in the area of technology the implementation is at a very low pace.In advanced countries, the changes are eminent in the educational sector as traditional teaching methods have been transformed into modern methods (Kacerauskas and Kusaityte, 2020) . Students in the College routinely learned and studied with technology in advanced countries.For instance, the Chinese Ministry of Education introduced a Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning policy to ensure that learning was not compromised at any time during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Zhang et al., 2020) , and provide flexible online learning to hundreds of millions of students from their homes (Huang et al., 2020) . Online platforms were the most popular tool used during the COVID-19 pandemic in the OECD countries (Schleicher and Reimers, 2020) . The instructional tools are designed in such a way that students could explore educational content at will while teachers delivered the lessons using virtual meeting platforms (Andreas, 2020) . In Sweden, post-secondary schools have switched to mainly distance learning from the onset of the pandemic (UNESCO, 2020). In the online review conducted by Chaka (2020) in South Africa and the United State of America, it was found that during the COVID-19 lockdown 17 of the 21 South African universities and 63 of the 64 U.S. universities migrated to e-learning and utilized Zoom, Canvas, and Blackboard as the topmost online tools and resources. In March 2020, the Italian government equipped schools with digital platforms, trained school instructors on techniques for e-learning, and gave digital devices to poor students to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (The Republic of Italy, 2020). In the same March 2020, Pakistan's Higher Education Commission (HEC) compelled higher institutions to commence e-learning. Also, teachers in Greece conducted virtual real-time classes in conjunction with other online learning tools (Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, 2020; Schleicher and Reimers, 2020) . Australia rapidly switched to online learning in the wake of the pandemic (Ali, 2020) . This would prevent compromising education in a pandemic situation (The News, 2020).In the Nigerian context, the number of students attending tertiary institutions outnumbered the schools' infrastructure. The high cost of ICT accessories and inadequate resource persons are among the problems limiting e-learning in Nigeria (Adeoye et al., 2020) . In Nigeria, many institutions find it difficult to conceptualize and implement e-learning initiatives locally.Specific objectives are to:i. examine the level of compliance of instructors to e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown; and ii. identify limitations to the use of e-learning in the selected private tertiary institutions.H 01 : Constraints have no significant influence on the instructors' compliance with e-learning in the selected tertiary institutions.This hypothesis is premised on the assumption that constraints could affect the optimization of e-learning in Nigerian tertiary institutions. According to the United Nations (2020) report, some tertiary institutions jettisoned e-learning during school closure due to the lack of information technology (IT) infrastructure.Firstly, the power supply in Nigeria is erratic, barbaric, and worrisome. It has become a national problem, very embarrassing as it affects all sectors in Nigeria (Oyediran and Dick, 2018; Adeoye et al., 2020) . Part of the effort put in place by the government was the diversification of power source from hydroelectric to the use of gas to generate higher megawatt yet there is no significant improvement, it is even getting worst. The power generation in the country is abysmally low, about 1400 Megawatt (Thisday, 2016) .Secondly, ICT hardware to power e-learning is imported to Nigeria since the country has not been able to develop its local manufacturing industries. The cost of importation is very high going by the ever-rising foreign exchange rate which is as high as ₦380 to $1USD. This has led to inflation and escalating prices of ICT hardware. Computer accessories are becoming too expensive to buy and it becomes an impediment to elearning. Adeoye et al. (2020) reported that the price of computer hardware and software is several times more expensive in Nigeria than in advanced countries.Thirdly, the ICT experts are very scanty to the extent that the available ones have been over-stretched due to the high demand for their service. Also, the charges of expatriates are outrageous when consulted whereas the cost of international personnel training is highly exorbitant. Nigerian tertiary institutions cannot afford all these costs going by their meager fund allocated to them in the national budget. The budgetary allocation to education is as low as 4-7.24% of the annual budget in the last decade which contradicts the 15-20% recommended by UNESCO (Ameh and Aluko, 2019) . This invariably affects manpower development and e-learning in Nigeria. Network administrators and local technicians to service and repair computer facilities do not receive any training at all (Adeoye et al., 2020) .Fourthly, the state of infrastructure is generally appalling in Nigeria. The lecture rooms are dilapidated, incomplete, and not conducive to effective learning. The laboratories, libraries, and ICT units are illequipped. Alternative power supply through a big generating set (MIKANO) is expensive to run in terms of fuelling, servicing, and repairing. Mahmood (2020) and Ali (2020) reported that poor state of infrastructure and manpower development affects the efficient use of the internet. High tariff significantly contributed to the high purchasing cost of ICT facilities which make it difficult for the government to institutionalize e-learning in many tertiary institutions.Going by the rapid rising cases of COVID-19 in the country, the Federal Government of Nigeria locked down two states (Lagos and Ogun) where the index visited, and FCT Abuja while other affected states joined as the coronavirus spreads. Federal Ministry of Education enforces electronic learning in the tertiary institutions as a way to ensure the school system is not collapsed. Beyond the government pronouncement and swift shift to e-learning across the world, researchers have not empirically examined the influence of socio-economic variables of instructors and constraints on e-learning compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. More so, the World Bank (2020b) is of the view that few pieces of research have been conducted on the scale of e-learning provision, compliance, and limitations in the higher institutions. Many studies focused on necessity of e-learning during lockdown (Ali, 2020) , instructional strategies for online (Mahmood, 2020) , level of preparedness for e-learning (Eduard and Lucian, 2020; EiEWG, 2020) , e-learning and tertiary education experience (Adeoye et al., 2020) , and use of online instruction, tools and resources during COVID-19 (Chaka, 2020) . It is hereby imperative to investigate the SEV influence on e-learning compliance and pros and cons of e-learning strategy to strengthening Nigeria's educational system. E-learning a technology-driven model and makes teaching take place without physical contact with the learners. The practical avenue to avoid drawback in the Nigerian education system during the COVID-19 is elearning. E-learning supports knowledge and performance management (Mahmood, 2020; The World Bank, 2020a) . According to Eduard and Lucian (2020) , educational technology as a field of education or new terminology has been like teaching aids or apparatus. E-learning has offered tremendous opportunities for teaching by electronic means (Kacerauskas and Kusaityte, 2020; The World Bank, 2020a) . Students that undertake electronic studies generally performed better than those in face-to-face courses. Andreas (2020) opined that the academic performance of learners that used the electronic approach supersedes those who studied the traditional approach. E-learning is a new learning model in Nigeria, with all its potentialities.This study was carried out in the southwest, Nigeria. The southwest geo-political zone comprises of six states which are Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and the Oyo States. Kothari (2004) sample size determination formula was used to estimate the sample size to be selected for this study, the formula is:At the confidence interval (c) of 5% and confidence level (z) of 1.96 for 95%, a 69% proportion of an attribute of the population (p), and 17% desired level of precision (q), the estimated sample size is 180.2. For ease of distribution, the sample size was approximated to 180.A multi-stage sampling method was used for the selection of a representative sample. This sampling method is chosen because it is an advance of the principle of cluster sampling. The method is recommended for a big inquires extending to a considerable large geographical area (Kothari, 2004) , like the case under study, private tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The merits of this method are that it is easier to administer than most single-stage designs, and a large number of units can be sampled for a given cost because of sequential clustering, whereas this is not possible in most of the simple designs. The three states randomly selected out of six states in the first stage are Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo. Private Universities, Polytechnics, and Colleges of Education in Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo the States, Nigeria were chosen for this study. There are five accredited private Universities in Lagos State, seven private Polytechnics, and five private Colleges of Education. Ogun State has eleven private Universities, four private Polytechnics, and two private Colleges of Education while Oyo State has six Private Universities, five private Polytechnics, and three private Colleges of Education. In the second stage, one University, one Polytechnic, and one College of Education were selected from each state; these gave rise to 3-Colleges of Education, 3-Polytechnics, and 3-Universities selected. In the third stage, a systematic sampling technique was adopted to select every 13 th name on the staff lists to arrive at twenty instructors per institution. Systematic sampling is spread more evenly over the entire population; it is an easier method of sampling and can be conveniently used even in the case of large populations (Kothari, 2004) . Thus, 180 instructors were selected from the nine tertiary institutions. Government-owned institutions particularly Universities were on industrial action at the time of conducting this research so they are exempted.The authors highly considered the issues of validity and reliability in the study. To ensure the validity of the study, the content validity of the instrument was carried out by experts in ICT and Education. Content validity according to (Dave, 2012; Wilson et al., 2012) is the extent to which a measure represents all facets of a given social construct. It is the most critical criterion and indicates the degree to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure (Kothari 2004) . Similarly, the reliability of the instrument was carried out by the test re-test method. The coefficient of reliability was 0.79, an indication that the instrument is reliable.This study adopted a survey method for the primary data collection on socio-economic variables, compliance, and constraints to e-learning in the private tertiary institutions. Respondents showed a willingness to provide answers to the questions contained in the questionnaire. This is a quite popular method of data collection. It does not give room for the interviewer's bias; answers are in respondents' own words hence the results can be made more dependable and reliable (Kothari, 2004) . In the course of conducting this study, authors strictly adhered to all standards of ethical principles to safeguard the rights of respondents in terms of the respondents' autonomy, privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality. All procedures adopted in the conduct of this study followed ethical standards of the institution approved by the Institution Committee on Research (ICR) and Joint Technical Task Team on COVID-19 (JTTT), Ogun State, Nigeria on April 23rd, 2020 for the period of 3-5 months.Age and years of experience were measured at ratio level and converted to an interval level for presentation. Educational Attainment was measured as the number of years spent in the schools to obtain various qualifications by the respondents. Compliance (ϒ) with e-learning was conceptualized as Complete (3), Partial (2), and Not at all (1) for descriptive statistics and ANOVA.Model Specification:n 1 (t.q 1 )þn 2 (t.q 2 )þn 3 (t.q 3 )…þn i (t.q i ) ¼ ϒwhere; t is the time taken to deliver the course online, q is the course taken, and n is the number of the times the course was taken.f n x n ¼ L nf ¼ frequency, x ¼ score and L n 's referred to the problems confronting the adoption of e-learning such as poor electricity supply, high cost of elearning facilities, and poor internet connectivity. Multiple linear regression models determine the extent of variations to e-learning compliance among the instructors in the selected private institutions (See Table 1 ).According to Kothari (2004) , the primary function of regression analysis is to determine the various factors which cause variations of the dependent variable. The functional form gives the best fit in terms of the high value of the R 2 , the low value of Durbin-Watson, the sign of coefficients, as well as better F-ratio (see Table 2 ).Thus the explicit model is:where ϒ is compliance with e-learning and β n 's referred to the parameter to be estimated.3.1. Influence of selected socio-economic variables on e-learning compliance Figure 1 portrays age categories of the respondents with seventy-five percent fell within 35-39 years while 12.5% were older than 40 years. The estimated average age was 36.8 years for the respondents. Table 2 shows the regression results of the age of the respondents as a predictor of compliance with e-learning. The result indicates that there is a positive but weak correlation between the age of the respondents and compliance with e-learning (R ¼ 0.351 a < 0.51 for 180 degrees of freedom). The significant of F-statistics (F ¼ 25.034, p ¼ 0.024 c ) indicates a linear relationship between the age and compliance to elearning. The regression model explains that 12.3% variation in elearning compliance was due to age (R 2 ¼ 0.123 b ) while 87.7% is due to the residual factors excluded from the model. A significant relationship was found between the age of the respondents (β ¼ 0.351 d ) and elearning compliance at p < 0.05 which is 35.1%. Therefore, age is a determinant of compliance with e-learning in the Nigerian Private Tertiary Institutions. The implication is that younger instructors should be the target of e-learning training and skills acquisition because they are easy to train and have a high tendency to comply with e-learning. Figure 2 displays respondents' educational attainment, 68.9% have spent less than 4 years to obtain a masters' degree while the remaining spent more than 5 years to get masters and Doctoral degrees.The result of the regression in Table 3 indicates a strong correlation between the educational qualification of the respondents and compliance with e-learning (R ¼ 0.853 a > 0.51 for 180 degrees of freedom). The Fstatistics (F ¼ 475.356, p ¼ 0.000 c ) is high and significant which indicates a strong influence of education on compliance with e-learning. The coefficient of R 2 (0.728 b ) shows that 72.8% variation in e-learning compliance is caused by the educational attainment while the remaining 27.2% is attributed to the residual factors excluded from the regression model. Educational attainment (β ¼ 0.843 d ) is positively significant at p < 0.05, that is, it has 84.3% influence on e-learning compliance. Hence, the educational attainment of the respondents is a strong predictor of elearning compliance in Nigerian Private Tertiary Institutions. This implies that the educational attainment of the respondents could be harnessed and properly channeled towards e-learning compliance and sustainability.From the chart in Figure 3 , the average teaching experience of the instructors was 7.8 years; 85% have joined the institutions since 6-10 years ago while only a few (3.1%) more than 10 years of experience in teaching.A positive and weak correlation was revealed for years of experience in teaching and compliance with e-learning as shown in Table 4 (R ¼ 0.169 a < 0.51 for 180 degrees of freedom). The F-statistics (F ¼ 5.211, p ¼ 0.024 c ) is significant but very low which further affirms that the relationship between years of experience in teaching and compliance to e-learning is weak. The coefficient of R 2 (0.028 b ) shows that teaching experience is responsible for a 2.8% variation in e-learning compliance while the remaining 97.2% is attributed to the residual factors excluded from the regression model. There is a significant and positive relationship between teaching experience (β ¼ 0.169 d ) and e-learning compliance at p < 0.05, this means that a 1% increase in the teaching experience would result in 16.9% compliance with e-learning. Hence, the teaching experience of the respondents influences e-learning compliance in Nigerian Private Tertiary Institutions. The implication for this study is that the instructors' experience would be advantageous for capacity building and training on e-learning as little effort and lesser cost would be required to transmit the pedagogy and contents of e-learning to the instructors. instructors in the private universities (67.3%), followed by the polytechnics (59.1%) and Colleges of Education (52.8%). Results of ANOVA in Table 5 confirmed variation in the level of compliance with e-learning by the instructors in the private tertiary institutions (F ¼ 15.36, p ¼ 0.00). Results of Scheffe's post hoc test further showed that level of compliance with e-learning in the private Universities (X ¼ 23.56), private Polytechnics (X ¼ 22.05) and Colleges of Education (X ¼ 21.97) were significantly different at p < 0.05. It reveals that Universities have the highest level of compliance, followed by Polytechnics and Colleges of Education. Universities have a comparative advantage in ICT gadgets than the Polytechnic and Colleges of Education in Nigeria. Nigerian private universities are at the forefront of e-learning implementation due to their innovative and flexible operations. Private universities have also embraced the e-learning platform to continue and sustain the academic calendar, and increase revenue generation to the school pulse. The implication is that Nigerian private universities would soon completely shift to digital education and able to offer courses beyond the shore of the country as it is being practiced in advanced countries. This will go a long way to improve the nation's education quality and standard, and ranking among the countries of the world.The linear regression in Table 6 has a coefficient of R 2 of 0.73 indicating a 73% variation in the dependent is as a result of explanatory variables. Results in Table 6 indicated that challenges are strong determinants of compliance with e-learning. Significant relationships are found for poor power supply (β ¼ -0.65), high cost and poor quality of elearning facilities (β ¼ -0.43), and poor technical know-how of e-learning (β ¼ -0.62) at p < 0.05 level of significance. This is an indication that the power supply, e-learning facilities, and technical know-how of the instructors affected compliance by 65%, 43%, and 62% respectively. Also, there are significant but inverse relationships for poor internet connectivity (β ¼ -0.78), lack of telecommunication infrastructure (β ¼ -0.74), and lack of training support by the government (β ¼ -0.83). It can be inferred that the limitations caused 71-83% non-compliance to the elearning in the selected private tertiary institutions. So also, the significance of the F-value (F ¼ 8.92) is a pointer to the fact that the relationship existed between the constraints and compliance to e-learning. It could be inferred that constraints retard e-learning development in the country and no tangible progress could be achieved in the education sector until these problems are addressed.Socio-economic variables influence compliance with e-learning. The age of the respondents has a significant relationship with e-learning , which indicates the respondents are within the working-age population according to Hannah and Max (2019) . Nigeria currently has 53.57% of her population in this bracket (Plecher, 2020) and they can learn new technology very fast, and adjust to electronic teaching. At this tender age, people are innovative and have a keen interest to learn new skills compared to people at old age. According to the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), younger teachers use technology more frequently in the classroom (Schleicher and Reimers, 2020) . Plecher (2020) reported that the bracket would have an important impact on Nigeria's Educational Development. Also, experience counts in adaptation to new techniques of teachings. The correlation of teaching experience with e-learning compliance was positive and significant at p < 0.05. From the three selected socio-economic variables, the test of significance revealed that the educational attainment of the respondents has the greatest influence, a strong correlation and significantly predicts compliance to e-learning. Advanced education and ICT skills are particularly important given the radical shift towards online teaching during the COVID-19 lockdown (Andreas, 2020) . Compliance with the e-learning is high in the Nigerian universities when it compares to the situation in Polytechnics and Colleges, that is, compliance in the universities is encouraging. For the last two decades, private universities have outnumbered the private polytechnics and Colleges of Education. Both individuals and religious organizations invested much in private universities particularly in the southwest, Nigeria. Though the school fees at these universities are exorbitant they have good facilities for e-learning and a stable academic calendar. The Universities take into cognizance the importance of e-learning so, they are more proactive than the Polytechnics and Colleges. Eze et al. (2018), Mahmood (2020) and Ali (2020) opined that new inventions and technology give better ways of communication and interactions and it has tremendously increased knowledge. However, there exist limitations in the e-learning in the selected tertiary institutions. The problems have resulted in partial compliance to e-learning in the Polytechnics and Colleges of Education; the structural buildings and facilities in the Colleges and Polytechnics are very scanty to that of Universities -Libraries, Laboratories are ICT centers are well equipped. The shortage of electricity supply is persistent in Nigerian tertiary institutions and it usually distorts researches and studies. In a report of Thisday (2016) , investment in power supply does not commensurate with the megawatt generated for use and it cannot go round. Likewise, Oyediran and Dick (2018) explained that the power supply to the public is diminishing and getting worst. Instructors that are Computer incline are very limited in many of these schools. Eze et al. (2018) argued that a lack of experts in ICT affects its use in Nigeria. In this technology age, e-learning is an essential mechanism of transferring knowledge and to fast-track academics transformation from traditional teaching to modern teaching in the Nigerian educational system.This study established that socio-economic variables are significantly correlated with e-learning compliance with educational attainment as a major determinant. It was also found that variation existed in e-learning compliance across the selected private tertiary institutions, a pointer to the fact that e-learning has not been effectively incorporated into tertiary education in Nigeria; the private universities have the highest level of compliance with e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The limitations obstruct compliance to e-learning particularly in the private Polytechnics and Colleges of Education in the southwest, Nigeria and it would have multiply effect on the academic progress of the institutions and could further create a socio-economic skills gap for the nation. Regression analysis affirmed the significance and negative influence of constraints on the instructors' compliance to e-learning in the selected private tertiary institutions at p < 0.05. The implication for this study is that instructors' SEV and limitations could undermine e-learning compliance during and after the pandemic in Nigeria. Globally, e-learning has been identified as an indispensable intervention to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and as well for rapid growth and development in the education sector of any nation. The advantages of e-learning include wide coverage, cost-effectiveness, uniformity, fast teaching and learning process, and rapid economic development through e-commerce. It is hereby recommended that compliance to e-learning in the tertiary institutions should go beyond the COVID-19 lockdown period while staff training and capacity building on e-learning should be put in place by the institutions' authority. The government should address challenges limiting e-learning in the tertiary institutions through the provision of stable power supply, and local industries should be encouraged to manufacture some ICT accessories to lessen the cost of acquisition arising from a high tariff. These recommendations become very important going by the rapidly changing world of basic education through digitization.Author contribution statement W. O.

The country implemented efforts to improve routine vaccination coverage with the first dose measles vaccine (MCV1) and has been conducting intensified laboratorysupported surveillance for measles. To reach unvaccinated children and close the immunity gaps among young children, Ethiopia has been conducting periodic preventive mass vaccination campaigns (also referred to as ""Supplemental Immunization Activities"") [2] [3] [4] . In addition, Ethiopia introduced the second dose measles vaccine (MCV2) in the routine immunization program in February 2019.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 th March 2020 [5] . By 30 th June 2020, all 47 countries in the African Region of the WHO were affected with a cumulative total of 303,986 COVID-19 cases and 6,155 deaths; Ethiopia had 5,846 confirmed COVID cases and 103 deaths [6] . Public fear of catching COVID-19 caused a decline of demand, while the mobilization of response measures including the decisions to limit movement that was imposed in many countries resulted in declines in the utilization of regular preventive and curative health services. Many countries reported variable degrees of disruption of routine immunization services and there was also a postponement of previously scheduled mass vaccination campaigns against measles, yellow fever and polio in a few countries [7] [8] [9] . Countries in the African region with weak immunization systems had a significant decline in the number of vaccination doses provided in the first three months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . Models show the impact on maternal and child health, with increased mortality as a result of the disruption to multiple essential interventions [11] . One of the programmatic areas where reductions in vaccination coverage can cause significant mortality is measles immunization [12] . There is a significant risk of losing the disease control gains made in the last two decades if these disruptions continue for a long period of time. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015 significantly affected measles vaccination coverage rates, particularly in Guinea and Liberia, where more than 25% decline in routine immunization coverage was documented in both years, as compared to the pre-Ebola years. This led to high measles incidence that persisted for at least two years after the end of the Ebola outbreak in both countries [13] . An outbreak of circulating vaccine derived polio virus (cVDPV) type-2 was also documented in Guinea following the Ebola outbreak [14] .With these lessons in mind, WHO developed technical guidelines in March 2020 to assist countries with maintaining essential health interventions including immunization, by integrating specific measures to protect the health workers and clients, assure the safety of service and prevent COVID transmission in health care settings [15, 16] . In May 2020, WHO issued a decision making framework to guide countries as they consider mounting mass vaccination activities [17] .Justification for the periodic measles follow-up supplemental immunization activities: according to the WHO-UNICEF coverage estimates, Ethiopia´s MCV1 coverage ranged between 68% in 2011 (the year of the adoption of the Regional measles elimination goal) and 58% in 2019 [18] . According to the Ethiopia Demographic Health (DHS) Survey in 2016, MCV1 coverage was 59% at national level, with provincial level MCV1 coverage ranging from 30.1% in Afar Region to 93.1% in Addis Ababa [19] . The country conducted the last measles Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) in 2017, and attained administrative coverage of 96.5%, while the national coverage was 93.2% (95% Confidence Interval of 92.1%-94.0%) in the post-campaign survey [20, 21] . With these coverage levels, it is estimated that there will be an accumulation of susceptible young children reaching the size of one birth cohort every 2-3 years, leading to the possibility of large outbreaks [22, 23] . Data from measles surveillance indicated that Ethiopia reported 1597 confirmed measles cases in 2018, and 3998 cases in 2019. In the months January to June of 2020, there were a total of 1846 confirmed measles cases reported from across all Regions, with an annualized incidence of 34 cases per million population. Seventy eight percent of these confirmed cases from the first half of 2020 were unvaccinated. Nearly half (47%) were in the age group less than 5 years of age and 22% were in the age group 5-9 years [24] .Ethiopia had planned to conduct nationwide measles SIAs in 2020, targeting children aged 9-59 months, for which partner funding was already secured in 2019. The country started preparations for the SIAs since July 2019 with a view to implement the SIAs in April 2020. The required bundled vaccines were in country by March 2020. This manuscript attempts to document the process taken by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) to implement the SIAs within the context of COVID-19, and the outcomes thereof. We reviewed the program data, the periodic programmatic updates on the preparations towards the campaign implementation, and the available official documentation on the nationwide measles SIAs.The decision making on the measles SIAs in the COVID context: the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Ethiopia on 13 th March 2020. By 8 th April 2020, there were a total of 52 confirmed cases and 1 death [25] . On 8 th April, the government imposed a State of Emergency which included a prohibition of public gatherings or meetings, and limited the amount of persons seated together in public spaces and public transportation [26] . This proclamation was followed by a postponement of all mass vaccination activities including the measles SIAs scheduled for April 2020. In May 2020, the Federal Ministry of Health undertook several consultations with the Secretariat of the National COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control Ministerial Coordination Committee, the Regional Health Bureaus, the immunisation technical partners, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), and other senior health authorities about the risks for measles outbreaks, the modelling of the impact of COVID-19 on child mortality, and the requirements to conduct measles SIAs safely.The NITAG helped to evaluate the risks against the benefits of conducting the SIAs. The evaluation of risks looked at the following local data-the estimated accumulation of children susceptible to measles, the seasonality of measles transmission in the country, the incidence of measles from the surveillance data, the COVID transmission patterns and trends, information from modelling of measles incidence in the COVID context. On 15 th May 2020, the NITAG recommended to conduct nationwide measles SIAs in order to avoid outbreaks, considering the already large number of unprotected children, which will further increase with the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the control measures in place. Regarding the timing of the SIAs, the NITAG recommended that the SIAs should be implemented as soon as possible before the country reached a phase of high-intensity and widespread COVID-19 transmission which would make it impossible to implement any mass vaccination interventions. In addition, the advisory group emphasized the need to ensure that COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures are put in place as a prerequisite before conducting SIAs. Operational preparations for the nationwide measles SIAs: as per WHO recommendations, the following key elements were put in place while considering to conduct mass vaccination in the context of COVID-19 [15] . i) Evaluation of the country's capacity to implement a mass vaccination campaign safely and effectively under the strain of COVID-19 (including the adequacy of human resources, logistical and transport barriers, flow of material and financial needs); ii) listing of actions to be taken to conduct high-quality and safe vaccination campaigns without undue harm to health workers and the community; iii) understanding the demand of the community in the midst COVID-19 and the need to engage community leaders in the planning and implementation; iv) coordinating with COVID-19 task force to reflect on the strategies that need to be applied to infection prevention and control measures; v) ensuring the availability of adequate infection prevention and control supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) for mitigation of COVID-19 transmission; vi) training of health workers and volunteers to strictly adhere to infection, prevention and control recommendations while organizing vaccination sites and during vaccination; vii) confirming strong and effective supervision and monitoring mechanism is in place at all levels. The preparatory activities took these points into consideration, and the necessary modifications were accommodated into micro-planning, the training of health workers, communication and social mobilization, as well as logistics preparations. The national immunization program and partners worked to amend the SIAs plan and budget to include the costs for the additional human resources, additional days of service delivery, as well as the IPC supplies required.Revision of micro-plans: as part of the initial preparation for the SIAs, district microplanning had been completed before the onset of COVID-19. However, considering the changes needed at the operational level, micro-planning templates were revised to include the human resources and supplies required for COVID-19 infection prevention and control. The composition of the vaccination team was revised to include a total of six persons (three health workers and three volunteers). One health worker was added to the team to handle COVID-19 screening and awareness raising, while one volunteer was added to monitor physical distancing and hand washing or sanitization at the vaccination site. The revision of the micro-plan template also included an extension of the duration of SIAs implementation from the initial 7 days to 10 days, as well as a proposed reduction of the expected number of children to be reached by each team from 350 to 245 per day in densely populated areas, and a reduction from 250 to 175 children per team per day in sparsely populated areas. Woredas (the equivalent of districts) were supported to revise their micro-plans accordingly, following which the plans were validated at national level. The finalized woreda level micro-plans increased the total number of vaccination teams nationwide from 6,106 in the initial set of microplans to 6,332 in the final version, and the number of required health workers from the initial number of 12,212 to a total of 18,996.Resource mobilization: additional financial resources totaling USD 7,427,000 were mobilized from partners to cover expenses required for the safe implementation of the mass vaccination activity. The GAVI Alliance approved reprogramming of funds from the Health Systems Strengthening envelope for COVID-19 prevention and control. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) contributed funds to cover the needs for the additional human resources, as well as training and procurement of IPC supplies, while the Irish government contributed funds for the procurement of facemasks. All immunization partners provided technical support throughout the preparation and implementation of the SIAs. Besides, partners working at sub-national level and government sector offices provided additional human resource and means of transportation during the SIAs.Training of health workers and volunteers: the measles SIA implementation field guide was revised to include the necessary changes as well as elements of risk communication in the context of COVID-19. The guideline was used for a series of virtual training sessions for trainers and supervisors from the national and sub-national levels. The cascaded training of health workers and vaccination teams at woreda and health facility levels was conducted face-to-face, in small size sessions of 10-20 participants, taking the necessary precautions including face masks, hand sanitising and physical distancing. The training in these face-to-face sessions were practical in nature, and emphasized the various measures put in place to prevent COVID-19 transmission at the service delivery site in addition to the standard topics including the roles of team members, safe handling of vaccines and vaccination, recognition and management of adverse events, use of monitoring tools. Volunteers were similarly trained at woreda level, with an emphasis on the organization of the service delivery site, the roles of volunteers within the teams, and actions to take to prevent COVID-19 transmission.Advocacy, communication and social mobilization: the political and technical leadership at national level provided guidance for the implementation of measles SIAs according to the COVID-19 prevention measures specified in the State of emergency declaration. In addition, the Regional COVID-19 Pandemic Response Emergency Operation Centers coordinated the measles SIAs at the regional level. This facilitated the coordination, decision making and overall political and operational support by the administrative authorities at Zonal and Woreda levels. Social mobilization was done through briefings from local health authorities and health workers, as well as messages from religious and community leaders, and spot announcements which were broadcast via major television, FM radio, as well as community radio channels. These were aired starting 5 days before the start of the SIAs and throughout the duration of the SIAs. Media briefings were provided on the need to maintain essential services by the leadership from the FMOH. The concerned FMOH Director and the immunization program manager appeared on national radio and television channels and provided messages on the SIAs. All of the Regions used local media extensively to provide similar messages. Broadcasted massages included announcements on the nature, the dates and target age for the campaign, as well as precautionary measures to be taken by clients at the vaccination site. In addition, the national level developed posters and brochures in four local languages and distributed them to the Regions. Once the campaign started, town criers mobilized communities moving across towns and villages using megaphones. Community and religious leaders, as well as members of the health development team and volunteer youth supported grass roots social mobilization, transporting of bundled vaccines, maintaining physical distancing at service delivery posts, and preparing hand-washing setup and encouraging clients to wash hands. Very good turnout was reported in many places starting from the first day of the SIAs. There was no major challenge reported with regards to hesitancy against the SIAs.Logistics: the shipment of bundled measles vaccine into the country was already done in March 2020 and was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, infection prevention and control supplies and adrenaline ampoules (as part of the kit for the management of adverse events following immunization) were procured and delivered through an expedited order. Based on the micro-plans, the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Agency (EPSA) and all 17 EPSA hubs prepared detailed logistics plans and managed to distribute 16,316,942 doses of vaccines and other supplies to all woredas. In most cases, bundled vaccines, monitoring tools, facemasks and hand sanitizers, as well as printed mobilization materials (posters and brochures) were distributed as a package based on the micro-plans. The distribution took place in the last half of June 2020, and started from remote woredas to facilitate logistics and avoid possible disruptions with the rainy season. During this nationwide measles SIAs, among other inputs, the national government procured and distributed Adrenaline to the woreda and health facility level. A few woredas reported delayed supply of adrenaline and facemasks in the initial days of the SIAs. The Woredas organized to borrow these supplies from existing health facility stocks where possible or from private clinics. Various government sector offices and non-governmental organisations provided additional vehicles to assist in the last mile distribution of vaccines, the movement of vaccinators and supervisors. While the recommended microplanning standards were clear with regards to the team composition and daily targets per team, the actual microplans and field operations considered the density of local settlements, geographic access, the local pattern of COVID-19 transmission, the security situation in the area and other local factors.Readiness assessment: the SIAs readiness assessment tool was adapted from the WHO field guide for SIA planning and implementation [27] . The assessment includes the preparedness status with regards to planning and coordination, vaccine cold chain, logistics, communication and social mobilization, monitoring and evaluation, with indicators for the national and woreda levels. The adaptation of the tool also included elements related to the logistics of COVID prevention. The readiness for the measles SIAs was assessed at national level, and in 204 woredas (20% of all woredas) across 9 Regions. Woredas were selected in each Region based on their routine immunization performance, surveillance performance, previous SIAs performance and the presence of refugee or displaced populations. Assessments were conducted at four different points in time by the Regional health bureau teams and local partners. The results of readiness assessment were used to drive the preparations, and also to decide on the start of the SIAs in each Region.was done in such a way as to allow measures for COVID-19 infection prevention and control. Fixed and temporary static vaccination sites were set up in well-ventilated open areas to enable proper physical distancing as much as possible, while queuing for the services. The number of family members accompanying a child to the vaccination post was limited to one. The flow of clients was organized to avoid crowding. In addition, a mobile fixed approach was utilized in many areas where, after the first few days of service at a fixed site, vaccination teams inform the community and move between clusters of villages to bring the services closer to the community. Awareness raising on COVID-19 prevention methods was conducted regularly in each vaccination site.A total of 394,831 facemasks and 341,102 bottles of hand sanitizers (sizes of 100ml each) were procured for the SIAs. The provision of masks and sanitisers was done in such a way to provide 1 mask for each vaccination team member per day for the 10 days; and five bottles of sanitizers were issued per team for the 10 days campaign duration. Face masks and sanitizers were distributed along with the bundled vaccines from the central stores and logistics hubs to the district and health facility level. In addition to sanitizers distributed through EPSA, some universities produced sanitisers and provided them to health facilities. Hand washing stations were available at some vaccination sites. In woredas where the supply of facemasks was delayed or inadequate, health authorities prioritized the SIAs and mobilized facemasks from available stocks. All health workers and volunteers were required to wear facemasks, while health workers conducting vaccination were instructed to sanitise their hands between clients. Caretakers in urban areas bringing children for vaccination were mostly wearing surgical facemasks, while in rural areas caretakers used standard surgical facemasks or improvised cloth masks. However, it was noted that in hot weather areas, clients were not strictly adhering to the proper use of facemasks.Volunteers encouraged clients to sanitise their hands or to wash hands at vaccination sites where hand washing facilities were available. In each vaccination site, a health worker was assigned to do screening of clients, by checking temperature using infrared thermometers. In vaccination sites where there was no infrared thermometer, health workers screened by asking for symptoms such as fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath.Monitoring and supervision of the SIAs: prior to the start of the campaign, trained supervisors and technical assistants from the national and provincial level, as well as partner agencies were deployed to support the SIAs implementation. Supervisors from various levels visited the service delivery sites during the campaign. With the exception of a few vaccination sites, where disruption of supplies was addressed locally, no major shortage of vaccines was reported. Supervisors checked cold chain equipment, the vaccine vial monitors (VVM), as well as the vaccine handling practices, recording of doses in the monitoring tools provided, and measures in place to minimize the risks for transmission of COVID-19. In most woredas, supervisors were tasked to conduct rapid convenience monitoring (RCM) of the SIAs in the last days of the exercise, specifically targeting geographic areas with high likelihood of coverage gaps. If there were more than 5% of children missed in any area, logistical and operational arrangements were done locally to identify and vaccinate missed children before the end of the SIAs. In some areas, this data was used to organize mop-up vaccination.The outcome of the SIAs: five Regions (Amhara, Afar, Benshangul Gumuz, Tigray and Gambella) launched the campaign as per schedule on 30 th June 2020. The rest of the Regions delayed their starting date from 3-7 days, as a result of the security instability at the time, but also the delays in delivering the inputs (mostly supplies of adrenaline ampoules, facemasks and other dry goods). A few woredas that started late completed the mass vaccination campaign by 21 th July 2020. As dates of campaigns were extended, mop-up activities were completed in areas where coverage gaps were noted from the administrative coverage and monitoring visits. The administrative coverage at national level was 102.8%. Coverage ranged from 95.2% of the target in Harari region to 126% in Addis Ababa (Table 1) . Out of all the vaccinated children, it is noted that 1,367,014 (9.4%) children were aged 9-11 months while 13,210,245 (90.6%) were between 12 and 59 months of age. Out of the 1123 woredas, special woredas and special towns in the country, 882 (78.5%) have attained at least 95% administrative coverage in the SIAs. The SIAs reached 645,294 children (4.4% of the total vaccinated) who had not received any dose of measles vaccine before (also referred to as ""zero-dose children""), as well as 92,392 eligible children among the refugee community in Somali, Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella Regions. This proportion of zero-dose children is consistent with the findings from the Rapid Convenience Monitoring. However, considering the levels of routine immunization coverage in the country, it is expected that many Regions would reach a larger proportion of zero dose children than reported in the SIAs, raising the need to ensure more strict monitoring of the proportion of zero-dose children in future SIAs.Six Regions (Addis Ababa, Amhara, Benishangul Gumuz, Gambella, Sidama, Tigray) compiled and shared the results of the RCM to the national level. The monitoring exercise was conducted in 1,298 Kebeles (the lowest administrative unit) in 243 woredas across these 6 Regions. The vaccination status of 27,353 eligible children was checked and only 880 children (3.2%) were found not to have been vaccinated during the SIAs in these areas. The measles SIAs has helped to put the routine immunization system high on the agenda at all levels, and to revitalize task forces. The SIAs mobilized a considerable number of health workers and community volunteers who were not actively engaged due to COVID-19 related state of emergency. The bottom-up micro-planning helped to map all villages and demarcate catchment areas, for later use in the routine immunization system. The SIAs training was an opportunity to improve knowledge, skill and practice of health workers. in addition, most woredas conducted cold chain inventory in their catchment areas and maintained refrigerators which will continue to be used in the routine immunization program. The SIAs reached a considerable number of children who were not vaccinated before. The SIAs was used to mobilize the target children for MCV2 vaccination and other missed vaccination doses.during the SIAs, 22 cases of adverse events following immunization were reported, of which 4 were severe cases. There were 2 reported deaths in Gambella Region and 2 deaths in Amhara region among these reported AEFI cases. The teams investigating these deaths have taken the necessary clinical and programmatic information at the time, and the National AEFI Committee has also launched its own investigation. The causality assessment results have not been officially released as of mid-October 2020. The country had set up a COVID surveillance system to identify imported and local transmission of the virus, including among health workers. There was no specific system in place to track the occurrence of COVID cases among vaccination teams or among persons who visited vaccination sites. However, the COVID surveillance system did not indicate any increase in COVID cases among the general population nor among health workers in the 3 weeks following the conclusion of the SIAs.On 7 th August 2020, Ethiopia launched a onemonth period of intensive COVID testing campaign, with a view to better understand the extent of local transmission, and use the opportunity for awareness raising [28] . The COVID testing campaign increased the number of daily COVID tests in the country more than 3-fold to an average of 21,000 tests per day as compared to the situation at the end of July 2020. The widespread testing brought the 7-day rolling average of COVID-positive cases from 612 per day across the country on 6 th August to 1566 COVID positive cases by 27 th August 2020. These numbers came down to a 7-day rolling average of 593 COVID positive cases per day by 18 th September 2020 [29] .Challenges: some of the challenges faced during this nationwide campaign include the following; i) Competing priorities as a result of the timing of the SIAs overlapping with the end of the fiscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the farming season in the central highlands; ii) A burst of political unrest mainly in Oromia and Addis Ababa that started on 30 th June 2020 was followed by challenges of cross-country travel around Addis Ababa and surrounding zones of Oromia Region for a few days; iii) The internet shutdown following the unrest occurred over the 10-day period of the SIAs, and interrupted the mass mobile messaging platforms (on Telegram group messaging App) that were set up for the coordination of the SIAs, as well as the real-time mobile supervisory data capture system (using One Data Kit software); iv) Delays in the disbursement of funds to the woreda level; v) Delays in the distribution of face masks and adrenaline ampoules to some Regions. Most of the challenges were overcome through regular communication and coordination between the different levels, as well as proactive leadership and coordination from the federal level. When SIAs operational funds were delayed, available funds were mobilized for operations and for the local purchase of AEFI medications to be later reimbursed. Facemasks from available stocks were mobilized when supplies were delayed. Areas experiencing political unrest started the campaign implementation after a few days delay and worked through 10 days in order to reach unreached children. In the absence of internet connection, the immunization program managers at all levels and the vaccination teams utilized short text messaging services (SMS) and telephone calls to coordinate and share administrative coverage data and other information on the conduct of the SIAs. Mobile fixed vaccination strategies helped to bring services closer to the community.Lessons learnt and way forward: the decision making, coordination and implementation of the nationwide measles SIAs was facilitated as a result of multiple factors: i) The risk-benefit analysis based on available evidence led to an informed decision;ii) Wider consultation among stakeholders including the secretariat of the National COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control Ministerial Coordination Committee, the NITAG and partner agencies helped to gain overall support; iii) Strong commitment of the political-administrative leadership as well as the public health leaders and health workers; iv) Assuring strong public demand through multi-channel communication, social mobilization and community engagement; v) Timely partner support to mobilise additional resources to cover the financial gaps helped address the COVID-19 prevention activities; vi) Assuring decongestion during the mass vaccination exercise by extending the duration of service delivery from 7 to 10 days, delivering services in open areas, implementing physical distancing and IPC guidelines, and adopting a mobile-fixed approach where vaccinators move their posts to get closer to settlements on different days; vii) The availability of digital communication means was very helpful to conduct technical consultations, trainings, coordination with partners and stakeholders, as well as coordination and communication with the teams in the field; viii) The availability of adequate PPE and IPC supplies. Following this successful SIAs, Ethiopia will validate the administrative coverage by doing a cluster survey. In the coming years, Ethiopia will have to continue monitoring routine immunization coverage and put efforts into improving MCV1 as well as MCV2 coverage, with a focus on areas with large number of unvaccinated children. The national immunization program will also work to implement efforts for the Periodic Intensification of Routine Immunization, and also identify innovative means to tailor services so as to reach unreached children. Expanding the age for the delivery of primary and booster doses beyond 24 months is critical so as to offer the opportunity for unvaccinated older children to be vaccinated whenever they come into contact with health services.Improving immunization coverage calls for strengthening the implementation of the fundamental approaches of reaching every district, minimizing missed opportunities, integrating service delivery so that all family visits to health facilities are optimized, and using measles coverage and surveillance data in order to map out and address immunity gaps. In the course of the last 15 years, measles surveillance has uncovered the extent of rubella transmission in Ethiopia, indicating the need to conduct a retrospective review or to set up a prospective system of surveillance of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the country. The available evidence on rubella transmission helps in the decision making to introduce rubella vaccine. The next measles preventive SIAs in Ethiopia is expected to use measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and will target a wide age range of children as per the WHO recommendations for the initial introduction of rubella vaccine.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-11-16","11"

The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to 213 countries and territories around the world. Up to 20 th September 2020, Ethiopia reported a total of 68,820 Healthcare providers who are in the healthcare settings to care for the COVID-19 patients are highly vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection [4] . Most healthcare workers are working in isolation units, critical care units, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency units, working in frontline positions, and having contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. During the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers was 7.3% and particularly, infections were most common among nurses [5] . In the south of the Netherlands, 96 (5%) of 1796 health care workers screened in three hospitals were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 just 10 days after the first reported COVID-19 case in the country [6] . More than 278 physicians from almost all medical specialties have died due to COVID-19 as of 15 April 2020 with the majority (44%) from Italy mainly because of lack understanding of the virus and its preventive measures [7] . Studies in China reported 3,387 COVID-19 cases among HCWs (4.4% of all cases), with 23 attributable deaths [8] . In some countries at the peak of their infection, such as Spain, they have reported that 13% to 14% of the country's cases were in healthcare workers [9] . Overall, as much as 10% of healthcare workers are infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some countries [4] and the WHO has developed infection prevention and control guidance to be implemented at the national and healthcare facility level in order to reduce coronavirus infection among healthcare workers [10] .Studies have identified major sources of worry and anxiety among healthcare professionals due to lack of appropriate PPE; being exposed to COVID-19 at work and taking the infection home to their family; not having rapid access to testing if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and concomitant fear of propagating infection at work; uncertainty that their organization will support/take care of their personal and family needs if they develop infection; access to childcare during increased work hours and school closures; and support for other personal and family needs as work hours and demands increase [11] . A recent qualitative study from China reported the challenges facing frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, including a high risk of infection, insufficient PPE, heavy workloads and manpower shortages, confusion, discrimination, isolation, separation from their families, and burnout [12] . Under these stressful conditions, healthcare professionals have been challenged to effectively engaged in the fight COVID-19.However, so far, no study has been undertaken in Ethiopia on risk perception and preventive practices of healthcare professionals during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, levels of confidence and feelings of healthcare workers about COVID-19 are unknown. It was therefore necessary to carry out this study to investigate the level of risk perception and preventive practice of healthcare professionals towards the COVID-19.This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9 th to 26 th June 2020 at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia in March 2020. Addis Ababa city is the most populated urban city in the country, and had a population of about 3.6 million in 2019 [14] . The city also had better health infrastructure and the highest number of qualified medical personnel compared with any city or region in the country. There were 12 hospitals and close to 100 health centers belonging to the public center, and about 25 private hospitals in Addis Ababa city. There were also over 17,000 healthcare professionals in the city, including 2,441 (14%) physicians and 8,172 (47%) nurses by the end of July 2019 (MOH 2011 EC Health Indicators). The hospitals selected for the current study provide outpatient and inpatient services for the city residents and patients coming from different parts of the country.A structured paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire is composed of parts on the demographic (gender, age) and occupational characteristics of the respondents (hospital, department/unit, professional category, and work experience), as well as their preparedness to combat COVID-19, potential risk of becoming infected with the virus, worries about the potential risk to their family and loved ones, feelings and fears about COVID-19. Questions related to measures taken to prevent infection from the virus included hand washing for at least 20 seconds, use of disinfectants, wearing facemask, physical distancing, covering mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and other preventive measures.The questionnaire was developed in English by the authors of the study based on the previously conducted studies and visiting the WHO websites for frequently asked questions on risk perception of healthcare professionals. Most of the questions were designed as 'yes/no', 'agree/disagree', and 'worried/not worried' using different rating scales.A total of 12 experienced data collectors with health backgrounds were involved in the data collection of this survey. A guideline was developed by the research team to guide the data collectors and supervisors for data collection, quality assurance of data and ethical conduct.Risk perception among the healthcare professionals in this study was measured using questions on perceived fears and worries, vulnerability and feelings, and behavioral responses regarding COVID-19 [15] [16] . Preventive practices of COVID-19 in this study include hygiene behaviors (such as hand washing; covering mouth and nose with a hand or tissue while coughing or sneezing; avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; using hand sanitizer; disinfecting surfaces); mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding crowds and public places [17] .The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Permission to undertake this study was obtained from every relevant authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each hospital to cooperate and participate in the survey. The purpose and significance of the study was introduced to the study participants, and all participants provided written or oral consent before participating in the study. Anonymity and data confidentiality were ensured, and no identifiable data from participants were collected. All study respondents were asked to only fill the questionnaire once to avoid duplication of data and that their participation in the study was entirely on voluntary basis. All personnel involved in the survey received orientation on COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures.A total of 1,134 (92%) healthcare professionals consented and completed the questionnaires, out of 1,228 possible participants from six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Among 1,134 healthcare personnel, nearly 40% of them were nurses, followed by physicians (22.4%) and interns (10.8%). specialists and sub-specialists accounted for the remaining 12.3%. About 17% of the respondents represented other professional categories such as anesthetist, pharmacist, health officer, radiographer and laboratory technologist. Majority (17.2%) of the respondents worked in Gny&Ob department, while 13.8% were in surgical department, 13.3% in pediatrics, 13.0% in medical and 10.5% in OPD departments. Most respondents worked as staff for less than 10 years in the hospital (73.2%), and nearly 10% worked for 10 or more years.Only about one-third (30.7%) of the study participated reported that they ever participated in direct clinical care to patients affected by infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS and cholera.Nearly three in 10 (28.9%, n=328) respondents reported that they ever provided direct clinical care to at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient, with 39.1% participants from SPHMMC, 34.5% from MH and 31.1% from TASH. Regarding the level of preparedness of healthcare professionals to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients, 33.6% (n=381) reported that they were prepared to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients. In contrast, about twothird (66.4%) of the healthcare workers reported that they were not prepared to manage COVID-19 patients.The study participants were asked 12 questions to quantify their fears and worries (risk perception) about COVID-19 crisis, on a 3-point scale, where 1=don't worry at all, 2=worry somehow and 3=worry a lot. Of the total 1134 study participants, 952 (84%) had complete responses on all the 12-items for computing the total score. About 66% of the respondents reported that they worried a lot about losing someone due to COVID-19, 66.7% worried a lot about the health of their loved ones, and 67.5% worried a lot about the health system being overloaded by the patients of COVID-19, followed by a lot of worries about the economic recession in the country (58%), and restricted access to food supplies (56.1%) ( Table 4 ). The study also revealed that there were respondents who were ambivalent or didn't worry at all about COVID-19 crisis.In the present study, the majority of the study participants recommended mask-wearing by all healthcare professionals, all healthy people to protect themselves from coronavirus infection, and people with close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Similarly, about 87% of the respondents suggested that N95 respirator should be used by all healthcare professionals as well as by people who are being in close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In Pakistan, 71% of the healthcare workers believed that wearing general medical masks was protective against COVID-19 [26] , and studies also suggested that surgical masks are similarly as effective as N95 respirators if used with hand wash and other infection prevention precautions [27] . However, a rapid systematic review on the efficacy of facemasks and respirators against coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses reported that continuous use of respirators is more protective compared to the medical masks, and medical masks are more protective than cloth masks among health workers in healthcare settings [28] .Despite these concerns, along with the shortage of PPE and inadequate training during the COVID-19, the healthcare workers continue to work with the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19, working in the hospital setting where COVID-19 patients were admitted, risking their lives to save their patients. However, this could highlight the risk of infection among healthcare workers and cross-contamination within hospitals and could lead to a higher rate of hospitalacquired infections. Therefore, our study provides considerable insights into the necessity of immediate and determined efforts focused on training programs and providing an adequate supply of PPE to ensure the safety of health personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic [30] .In the current study, the overall risk perception expressed in fear and worry score of the study participants regarding COVID-19 crisis was considerably higher, with a mean of 28, ranging from 12 to 36. Various studies have reported the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals [33] . A recent scoping review found that the frontline healthcare workers are at an increased risk of direct physical and mental consequences as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19 [34] . Studies demonstrated that more than 50% of healthcare professionals report symptoms of depression, insomnia, and anxiety due to COVID-19 [35] . A recent study carried out in Pakistan on fear and anxiety among healthcare professionals reported that about three-fourth of them had fear of getting infected during the management of COVID-19 patients, and another twothird reported severe anxiety, which was particularly more common among nurses [36] . Studies also reported excessive workload, isolation, mental stress and discrimination among frontline health professionals, thus, contributing to physical exhaustion, emotional disturbance, worry and fear [37] . A Cochrane review reported the suffering of healthcare workers from work-related or occupational stress, which can be reduced by cognitive-behavioral training as well as mental and physical relaxation [38] . A multicenter study conducted among frontline nurses in China showed poor mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly due to the fear of contracting the virus and high workload [39] . Moreover, the same study revealed that nurses who were confident in their infection control knowledge and skills had lower stress levels than those who felt less prepared.The authors are grateful to the participating hospitals and their healthcare staff for committing their time and voluntarily filling in the questionnaire. They are also thankful to all data collectors and logistics facilitators for their time and commitment.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University.

Reported cases of ""pneumonia of unknown origin"" originated from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where some animals like bats, snakes, and rabbits are raised in captivity for consumption by people and are illegally sold. A few days later, the Chinese government confirmed that this outbreak is caused by a novel Coronavirus which was named later by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 (Bai et al., 2020) .On March 11, 2020, and based on further assessments, WHO Director-General made an announcement that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . By March 16, 2020, the outbreak outside China increased drastically and the number of countries, states, or territories reporting infections to WHO had reached 143 .As the situation escalates day by day, there is a growing need for a visualization tool to guide better understanding on the disease pandemic nature (Yoo, 2020) . Reported data from the affected countries are important to understand the disease risk and guide different preventive measures. The reports include confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, total recoveries, severe cases, and recovered cases ratio. The data show how countries are promptly working to control the pandemic and trying to preserve the resources to fight the disease spread. They are also sharing practices and strategies needed to ensure that patients are best managed (Dey et al., 2020) .It is very important to consistently record and report epidemiological information for better understanding of disease transmission, geographic spread, risk factors for infection, and different routes of transmission. Also, to provide the baseline for various epidemiological modeling that can guide authorities for optimum planning to minimize the disease burden. This detailed and accurate information is very important to decide where surveillance should be prioritized .To capture more clear information effectively, statistical analyses along with data visualization are needed to serve as applications of the powerful models of data science. The role of data scientists now is more important than ever for identifying different trends, patterns, and outliers to help researchers and decision makers to act in a more effective manner towards medical researches and preventive public health measures (Valdiserri and Sullivan, 2018) .Healthcare professionals have acknowledged for so long the importance of conventional disease mapping and geographic information systems (GIS), as some of the most important tools against the fight of an outbreak. The very first disease map that was drawn to visualize the relationship between a disease and its origin was in 1964 on plague outbreak in Italy (Lipton, 2019) . Disease maps would be valued and used over the next 25 years aiming to understand and track most of the infectious diseases such as Yellow fever, Cholera, and Influenza (Lyseen et al., 2014) .There are many clinical outcomes reported from different countries affected with COVID-19, these outcomes are likely to have potential correlations with each other. Multivariate analysis is needed to explain interactions among variables present in the dataset, allowing data dimension reduction for better visualization, better hypothesis testing, and explanation between the dataset, so we can have a better understanding to the data reported from affected countries (Clark, 2013; Riley et al., 2017; Williams and Babbie, 1976) .The current study aims to initiatively utilize the widely applied multivariate statistical procedures, PCA and PAM algorithms, for efficient visualization and comparative inference of COVID-19 status in different countries. PCA is commonly used to reduce the number of variables that exist in many datasets, which indeed exhibit multicollinearity that alters the visualization and the application of many statistical techniques and algorithms. Of the featured advantages of PCA, it results into orthogonal components, i.e. uncorrelated/independent factors. On the other hand, PCA may result in illogical or noninterpretable factors when they are formed of non-homogenous set of variables, as it relies on analyzing the correlation matrix of the variables, the results may not make sense in some cases. Hence, a careful evidencebased naming and interpretation of the formed factors should be conducted. Finally, PCA may lead to losing some information since the resulted factors usually explains a percentage of the variability existing in the original dataset. But usually the cumulative percentage of total variance explained is also used as a criterion to judge on the quality of PCA since acceptable results that explains at least 70% of the total variability (Karamizadeh et al., 2013; Lloret et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2014) .We performed PCA algorithms on five originally reported variables (Total confirmed cases, Active cases, Total deaths, Critically ill cases, and Mortality recovery ratio). We further performed PAM clustering algorithms on the scores of different countries on the reduced dimensions (PC scores), thus we were able to better visualize, categorize and better describe the status of countries affected with COVID-19 pandemic.We captured the available data about Coronavirus statistics from Worldometer website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ for March 30, April 15, and April 25, 2020. Data were captured on the next day to these specified dates. Countries with COVID-19 total cases less than 500 or countries with missing data were omitted from the analysis to keep good representability of each variable. Number of countries included in the analysis was 56 countries on March 30, 82 countries on April 15, and 91 countries on April 25. Data manipulation and analysis were performed using R software (R Core Team, 2019).We used the following description for each of the variables included; in any given country, total cases refers to total cases confirmed with COVID-19; active cases refers to total number of open cases (mild, serious, or critical); total deaths refers to total deaths with COVID-19; critically ill cases refers to number of serious/critically ill cases; mortality recovery ratio refers to the ratio between total deaths to total recovered patients.Correlation matrices were visualized using performance analytics package (Peterson et al., 2014) . Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008) . Observations within each variable were converted to Z-scores and subjected to PCA at each time point. The main aim of PCA was to summarize patterns of a relatively large number of observed variables into a smaller number of latent factors that should be able to reflect the underlying processes that caused eventually the correlations among the variables. Mathematically, PCA develops linear combinations of observed variables; each of them is a factor, these factors summarize the pattern of correlations in the observed correlation matrix (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007) . Contributions and correlations of variables with the formed factors were determined at each time point.We performed cluster analysis using cluster and Factoextra R packages (Kassambara et al., 2017; Maechler et al., 2013) . Partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm was utilized to cluster the countries according to their PC-1 and PC-2 scores on the latest time point (April 25). PAM algorithm is a robust alternative to K-means clustering that is less sensitive to noise and outliers (Salgado et al., 2016) . Optimum number of clusters was determined according to the highest average silhouette width (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990) . We performed successive waves of removal of noise clusters then reassessed the contributions and correlations of variables with the formed dimensions.We made projection on March 30 model utilizing data of April 15 and April 25. Initial PC scores on March 30 and projected PC scores at the next time points were compared with Friedman ANOVA for the countries whose data were available at the specified three time points. The experimental methodology and design are summarized in a flow chart form (Supplementary material 1).Descriptive statistics of the original variables at each time point (30 March, 15 April, and 25 April 2020) are presented in (Table 1) . The univariate outlier analysis showed the presence of many outliers across all tested variables. However, removal of univariable outliers would have caused a large portion of data to be excluded; so, we made successive waves of noise removal after performing PCA and cluster analysis. Correlation matrices between variables at each time point are presented in (Figure 1 ). Total cases, total deaths, active cases, and critically ill cases were consistently strongly correlated. On the other hand, mortality recovery ratio had a unique pattern of variance through the tested time points.Upon performing multivariate PCA at each of the three time points, the variables (Total cases, total deaths, active cases, and critically ill cases) were formed into one principal component (PC-1), that we called ""Disease Magnitude"", as they had higher loading scores on this formed factor in the three models; while ""Mortality-Recovery Ratio"" was formed into another principal component (PC-2), as it had higher score on this formed factor. The percentage of contribution of original variables to the formed factors at each time point are presented in (Table 2 ). The correlation of the original variables with the formed factors are presented in (Figure 2 ), which presents prefect correlations of the original variables with their relevant formed factors (r > 0.8). The models retained about 87%, 95% and 95% of the total variance within the original variables at each time point, respectively. The loading scores on PC-1 suggested nearly equal contribution of each variable in forming the principal component. Communalities of PC-1 variables (Percentage of explained variance in each variable by the formed principal component) were consistently above 80%, while PC-2 was explaining about 100% of variance of mortality recovery ratio.The sign of the loading scores on PC-1 was positive in the three models, so the increment in PC-1 scores indicates higher total cases, total deaths, active cases, and critically ill cases. Sign of PC-2 loading score also indicates that increment in PC-2 refers to higher mortality recovery ratio.At each time point, each country had two scores for two dimensions, the first score (PC-1 or Disease Magnitude score) simultaneously representing the counts of total cases, total deaths, active cases and critically ill cases, and the other score (PC-2 or Mortality recovery ratio) representing the ratio between total deaths to total recoveries. The two formed variables of PC scores have efficiently stored the information within the original five variables at each time point. The descriptive statistics for both PC scores of countries in the three models are presented in (Table 3) . The PC-1 and PC-2 scores of 91 countries on April 25 were subjected to successive waves of cluster analysis utilizing PAM algorithm. Each cluster was represented with one country as a ""Medoid"". The medoid country had minimal average dissimilarity with the other members of the cluster and was considered as centroid for each cluster. The medoid was presented by the relevant country scores on PC-1 and PC-2. At the first wave of cluster analysis, the highest average silhouette width suggested that optimum number of clusters was four. Hence, the first wave resulted in four clusters, USA (16.263, -0.113) was solely representing cluster 1, Italy (3.416, 0.171) was the medoid of cluster 2 which contained Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and Brazil. Moldova (-0.452, -0.220) was the medoid of cluster 3 which contained 84 countries of 91 countries in total. Finally, Norway (-0.224, 8.546) was representing cluster 4 ( Figure 3 ).Our approach builds on the idea of decomposing the biggest cluster produced in former wave into an optimum number of clusters until we get a meaningful endpoint. To achieve that, first we have to perform a new PCA on the original dataset of this cluster in order to detect any new correlation pattern between the tested variables and the subsequent changes in loading scores on the principal component away from the influence of noise clusters. PCA was reperformed on the original dataset of countries in cluster 3 in the previous model and followed by PAM cluster analysis. The optimum number of clusters in the second clustering step was 2. Iran (7.801, -0.823) was the medoid of cluster 1 which contained Turkey, Iran, Russia, and Belgium; while Finland (-0.618, -0.346) was the medoid of the rest 80 countries.Upon performing the final PCA on the original dataset of the 80 countries in cluster 2 in the previous model, significant weak to moderate correlations between mortality recovery ratio and the rest of variables on PC-1 were observed (Figure 4 ). Changes were detected accordingly in the correlations between the original variables and the formed factors compared to the model performed initially on 91 countries ( Figure 5 ).The 80 countries were further optimally clustered into 2 groups. Romania (1.249, 0.165) was the medoid of the first group which contained 24 countries, and Cameroon (-1.015, -0.184) was the medoid of 56 countries ( Figure 6 ).We were also concerned with tracking changes in PC scores across the 3 time points. This was vital for detecting significant changes in the variables that contribute to each principal component. We made projection on March 30 model with the data of 15 and April 25. PC-1 and PC-2 scores of March 30's model, projected PC scores of 15 and April 25 were tested by Friedman ANOVA test. PC-1 scores were found to be significantly changed (P ¼ 0.000), while PC-2 scores were insignificantly changed (P ¼ 0.946).An overwhelming number of studies shed the light on COVID-19 from various dimensions: medical, biological, and epidemiological dimensions, its social correlates and its implication, its impact on economic status worldwide and even on micro-level. A few studies focused on tracking COVID-19 data, for the purpose of summarizing and organizing these data and to find solutions for how this huge amount of data should be visualized and presented into one or two representative graphs. Among the initial descriptive mathematical models for COVID-19 was that introduced by N. E. Huang and F. Qiao. They aimed at tracking the disease course with detecting the efficacy of the local interventions made for disease containment. Despite being robust, it did not provide realtime comment on the disease burden and progression across countries (Huang and Qiao, 2020) . Q. Lin et al. developed a conceptual model based on 1918 influenza pandemic modeling framework in London, UK, taking into consideration the governmental actions and individual reactions trying to to forecast the disease behavior patterns of COVID-19 under different scenarios. The model functioned well in forecasting COVID-19 behavior when applied to data from Wuhan, China, but it was built on a unidimensional dependent variable, total confirmed cases (Lin et al., 2020) . Dey and colleagues exerted valuable efforts to gather and analyze epidemiological data on COVID-19 outbreak from many open datasets. They utilized visual exploratory data analysis procedures on the available datasets for certain provinces of China and outside China, from 22 January to 16 February 2020. The datasets contained number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases. They draw heat-maps and heat-bar graphs for china and outside, this was done for each indicator separately and comparisons were done in a univariate manner of analysis (Dey et al., 2020) . Another research aimed to develop predictive model for predicting COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. The researchers utilize SEIR modelling to forecast COVID-19 outbreak inside and outside China based on the daily observations. According to the developed model, they assumed that the outbreak would reach its peak in late May 2020 and would start to drop around early July 2020. They also found that negative sentiments about the virus are more prevailed than positive ones. Positive sentiments were mainly reflected through articles about ""collaboration and strength of individuals in facing this epidemic', while negative articles were related to ""uncertainty and poor outcomes of the disease such as deaths"" (Binti Hamzah et al., 2020) . Another modelling study tried to identify individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries. The identification process was based on individual's age, sex, country-disease prevalence data, multimorbidity fractions, and infection-hospitalization ratios. This study concluded that men are at higher risk compared to women, elder people are at highest risk categories and at the macro-level, the share of the population at highest risk categories in countries with older populations, countries with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, Chronic kidney disease, Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, and Chronic respiratory disease (Clark et al., 2020). It is clearly noticeable that all of the previous studies analyzing COVID-19 data items were using univariate analysis techniques in order to forecast future outcomes or relate to any other individual features/variable in a one to one basis. In other words, none of those studies dealt with COVID-19 data items using multivariate analysis techniques.A real challenge has emerged, which is how to identify the proper time to escalate or deescalate the nationwide intervention measures along the course of the pandemic. A current need for a robust tool incorporating the at-hand variants based on the available data in a one multivariate analysis, our current work presented here is an example of how visual representation can be enhanced using multivariate analysis techniques. The available visual graphs on the websites tracking COVID-19 status utilize the univariate presentation of data, presenting the progression of confirmed cases or deaths as a function of time (CDC, 2020; Worldometer, 2020) . Despite being informative in a way, advanced inference for better decision making needs a more advanced methodology to reproduce high dimensional data into less dimensions, which should facilitate description and comparison of countries. Serving that purpose, we developed multivariate models aiming at studying and visualizing the current situation of every affected country by COVID-19 using PCA and cluster analysis. This was in terms of disease burden against mortality/recovery ratio at a certain time point. This will help further inference by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGO's) committed to respond to COVID-19 burden in their countries, to implement priority public health measures to support national plans and interventions.In the current study, the affected countries had two numerical variables, in which the information within the original five variables are efficiently stored. The PCA algorithms were performed on the calculated Z-scores of the original variables. That is why the averages of the PC scores on the formed dimensions were consistently equal to zero (Table 3) . Hence, countries with positive values of disease magnitude score (PC-1 score >0) had relatively higher confirmed cases, deaths, active cases and/or critically ill cases. Similarly, countries with positive values of mortality recovery ratio score had a relatively higher ratio of mortality to recovered cases, while negative values of disease magnitude or mortality recovery ratio scores indicated a relatively controlled status. This can be explained with the PC scores of USA at the first wave of cluster analysis (16.263, -0.113), despite being far in terms of disease magnitude (presented by PC-1 score, 16.263), the mortality recovery ratio was relatively controlled (presented by PC-2 score, -0.113). This is strongly indicating a well-established healthcare system that could absorb the relatively high disease magnitude without increasing the ratio of mortality compared to recovered cases.On 25 April, the first wave of cluster analysis detected a meaningful number of noise clusters. USA was solely representing cluster 1 with the maximum disease magnitude score, Italy (3.416, 0.171) was the medoid of cluster, having relatively higher disease magnitude score compared to the main cluster 3 (84 countries of 91 countries in total). Norway (-0.224, 8.546 ) was solely representing cluster 4 by far in terms of high score on mortality recovery ratio (presented on PC-2). Of note, the second cluster whose medoid is Italy represents a group of countries with shared borders between Italy, Germany, France, and Spain, which may partly account for the grouping in one cluster.Further PCA was performed on data of countries in cluster 3 in the previous model, followed by PAM cluster analysis. The detected changes in the correlations between the tested variables and the subsequent changes in loading scores on the principal component denoted that noise reduction was needed to extract more data overlapped by the noise clusters in the previous PCA. The number of clusters in this step was 2. Iran (7.801, -0.823) was medoid of cluster 1 which contained Turkey, Iran, Russia, and Belgium while Finland (-0.618, -0.346) was medoid of the rest of 80 countries. Again, geographical proximity does appear to contribute to data explanation by our model. The final multivariate analysis for data of the 80 countries in cluster 2 of the previous model showed significant weak to moderate correlations between mortality recovery ratio and rest of variables on PC-1, it also showed a subsequent changes in contributions to each PC; denoting changes compared to the model performed initially on 91 countries. The 80 countries were further optimally clustered into 2 groups. Romania (1.249, 0.165) was medoid of the first group which contained 24 countries, Cameroon (-1.015, -0.184) was medoid of 56 countries. The change in correlations between mortality recovery ratio and variables on PC-1 along with an encountered pattern of signal homogeneity in both PC-1 and PC-2 simultaneously and reciprocally in cluster 1 and cluster 2 in this wave of multivariate analysis revealed that our model has reached a logical outreach point. Each cluster finally represents a disease pattern where PC-1 representing disease magnitude is changing in the same direction of PC-2 representing mortality recovery ratio. This means that successive waves of PCA and cluster analysis were needed to properly group countries with similar disease patterns for better visualization and subsequent data extraction and projection. Moreover, results interpretation in this last step that showed significant weak to moderate correlations between mortality recovery ratio on PC-2 and rest of variables on PC-1. This may indicate that mortality recovery ratio is more influenced by the disease magnitude in the major 80 country cluster. Meaning that health care systems in these countries are beginning to be inadequately accomodative to the increase in disease magnitude, or may mean that these countries need augmentation of their capacity to regain independence of PC-2 from PC-1 and subsequently more disease control. The methodology of multivariate analysis utilized in this study represents a powerful tool to describe and visualize data at certain time points to study the disease burden in terms of disease magnitude and outcome in each country by terms of readily available data in the light of the dynamic disease attributes. The formed PCs are more convenient and informative upon proper utilization as dependent variables in further predictive regression models. Using this methodology will enable both the scientific and the policy making communities to better organize, analyze, and visualize these growing data.The presented multivariate data analysis approach was quite powerful for storing the information within the daily reported COVID-19 statistics in a lower number of dimensions/variables, resulting in better visualization and enhanced comparative inference. However, the variance pattern of the original variables is changing day to day. Hence, the quality and appropriateness of these multivariate procedures should be tested at single day level. The correlation between the original variables should be strong enough for performing dimension reduction procedures.Using multivariate analysis techniques, we were able to develop models and simple data visualization tools that can help in interpreting the status of a given country or cluster of countries. COVID-19 daily published statistics were summarized by two scores, disease magnitude score and mortality recovery ratio score, where these reduced dimensions were efficiently able to store the information within the original datasets. Significant correlations detected between both scores in some countries is a warning alarm for saturation of healthcare systems.Author contribution statement Ahmed Ramadan: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.Ahmed Kamel, Alaa Taha: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.Abdelhamid El-Shabrawy, Noura Anwar Abdel-Fatah: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","Egypt","first author","2020-11-24","11"

In Africa, South Africa ranks highest with 650,749 cases and 15,499 deaths while 56,388 cases and 1,083 deaths were recorded in Nigeria. Wearing face mask, social distancing and washing of hands are the only non-pharmaceutical means of prevention [1] .It has been documented that people who were asymptomatic can transmit the novel virus and this can only be reduced by wearing of face mask. Use of face masks are very vital tool for the prevention of COVID 19 even among children, especially when they go to school and get involved in social gatherings, like in churches [2] .Asymptomatic cases can also be seen in children, hence the urgent need for the use of face masks among them. A study among children with COVOD 19 revealed that 15.8% were asymptomatic [3] . There is thus evidence that asymptomatic children have the potential to transmit the infection.It is pertinent to note that even though the viral load associated with COVID 19 is unknown, it is not known if viral shedding increases with severity [4] .The use of face masks in families and children is imperative and indispensable because of the rapid spread of this novel virus in homes. For instance, in China, it was reported that seven in ten human-to-human transmissions of COVID 19 occurred in homes [5, 6] .The World health organization has noted that household transmission of this virus is the harbinger of community spread [5, 6] . In developing countries where the health service is overwhelmed, people now self-isolate at home and this even increases the risk of spread. A study in China showed that the risk of transmission is high if no measure such as face mask was introduced [6] [7] [8] . They suggested home-made masks as being very effective during severe epidemics in preventing infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the use of face masks alone will not protect against COVID-19, but opined that the general public should wear face masks, especially a three-layer-fabric mask; which is essentially a non -medical mask [9, 10] .The World Health Organization also stated that children under five years of age should not wear masks. This stemmed from a ""do no harm"" point of view, which stated that at five years, children usually achieve significant developmental milestones, especially the fine motor, such as, pincer grasp. This fine motor milestone is needed to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance [11] . However, some countries may contextualize the use of face masks for children to 2 or 3 years. Using the ""do no harm approach"", if the age of two or three years of age is to be used for recommending mask use for children, a well-knitted and coordinated supervision by the mother is needed to ensure the correct use of the mask and to prevent any potential harm associated with mask wearing to the child. Recommendations involving different age groups have been made by WHO with respect to the use of face masks in children, as information on COVID-19 continues to evolve.Most countries, utilize the global guidance from WHO but contextualize it. For instance, in Nigeria, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Federal Ministry of Health, NCDC and partner organizations have intensified programs on the use of face mask. This includes awareness campaigns in communities to sensitize the people on the need to wear face masks. Various slogans and hashtags such as #MaskOnNaija, #MaskingForAFriend and #TakeResponsibility were used [10, 11] .A knowledge gap exists on this issue under study, as few studies on the use of face masks failed to highlight the impact of age and parental factors on the wearing of face masks in children.The study aimed to ascertain the perception of mothers on masking in children as a preventive strategy for COVID-19.This study was carried out in two health institutions namely the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Enugu and Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi, Nigeria. Both hospitals are tertiary health institutions and designated as isolation centres in the fight against COVID-19. Mothers of child bearing age who gave consent were recruited in the study while those who refused to give consent were excluded from the study.This study was a prospective and cross-sectional study conducted among mothers who presented with their children to the children's outpatient clinics, paediatric wards, as well as the children emergency room in the period of study.Systematic sampling technique using facility register was used to select clients as they present on each day of data collection. An average of 1186 clients presented in the three Paediatric clinics in the health facility including the Children out-patient department, Children Emergency and Immunization clinics monthly within this COVID-19 period. This number, 1186 served as sampling frame. The sampling interval was determined by dividing the sampling frame (1186) by sample size (384), hence a sampling interval of 3 was used. Every third client was recruited for the study based on the order of registration of clients in each of the clinics, on each day of data collection. The clients who attended the various clinics on the five working days of the week were included in the study.The information given by the mother was supported by what was observed, as the mothers were present with the children during the study. We did not focus on mother-child dyad of wearing of face mask, though mothers were observed in the study, to be masked. However, the National COVID-19 protocol made it mandatory for adults to wear facemasks in public space, and this was strictly enforced by health facilities and financial institutions. Our observation of children wearing face masks necessitated this study. We did not focus on mother-child dyads while assessing maternal perception and the practice of wearing face masks. Even though adults were required to wear face masks, there was no such clear rule for the children.The minimum sample size used in this study was calculated using the formula.Where Z = 1.96 i.e. the level of significance P = proportion of mothers who have knowledge about children wearing face mask (taken as 50%; being a new study) D = Tolerable error (0.05) Using the above formula, the minimum sample size is 384 3.5% attrition rate was considered, this brought the final value to 398A pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire which was designed by the researchers was used for data collection. The questionnaire was administered to the respondents by trained research assistants. The outcome variables were the proportions of mothers with varying perceptions/knowledge on masking in children as a pandemic antidote. We used the mother's and child's age, marital status, educational level of both mother and father, parity, and occupation of father and mother as independent variables.Data entry and analysis were done using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) statistical software version 25. Frequency tables and cross-tabulation were generated. Chi-square test of statistical significance and multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression were used in the analysis and the level of statistical significance was determined by a p-value of <0.05. In determining the predictors of children wearing face masks, variables that had a pvalue of <0.2 on bivariate analysis were entered into the logistic regression model. The results were reported using adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence interval and the level of statistical significance was determined by a p-value of <0.05. The outcome variable was the wearing of a facemask by children. This was determined by a Yes answer to the question of whether the child wears a face mask. This was confirmed by observation of the wearing of a face mask by the child during the period of data collection. Seven variables were used to assess the perception of COVID-19 among the respondents. Each correct answer by any of the respondents was given a score of one while an incorrect answer attracted a score of zero.Respondents who scored �60% of the total score were designated as having a good perception of COVID-19 while those that scored less than 60% of the total score were regarded as having a poor perception of COVID-19.The approval of the Enugu State University of Science and technology Health Research and Ethics Committee was obtained before commencing the study (Reference number: ESUTP/ C-MAC/RA/034/Vol 1 /266).Verbal informed consent was obtained from the respondents in order to participate in this study. Written informed consent was not obtained because some of the participants are not educated. The ethics committees/IRB approved this consent procedure. Table 1 shows mothers' perception of masking in children. A minor proportion of the children, 43.5% wore face masks which were all home-made. The major reasons for the children not wearing face masks included perceived difficulty in breathing, 38.2% and child's readiness to pull it off, 29.3%. Table 2 shows the factors influencing the use of face masks by the children. A significantly higher proportion of the children whose mothers were 35 years and above, 64.2% wear face masks when compared with those whose mothers were <30 years of age, 31.7%. (χ 2 = 28.632, p<0.001). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of the children who were more than one year of age, 51.0% wear a face mask when compared with those who were aged 8 days to one year, 20.5%. (χ 2 = 19.441, p<0.001). A higher proportion of the children whose mothers who have attained secondary education and below, 48.7% wear a face mask when compared with those whose mothers attained tertiary education, 38.5% and the difference in proportions was found to be statistically significant, (χ 2 = 4.183, p = 0.041). Also, a higher proportion of the children whose fathers attained secondary education and less,50% wear face mask when compared with those whose fathers have attained tertiary education, 35.2% and the difference in proportions was found to be statistically significant, (χ 2 = 8.718, p = 0.003).Mothers' perception of COVID-19 has no significant influence on children wearing of face mask (χ 2 = 2.337, p = 0.127) Table 3 shows the predictors of a child's use of a face mask. The children whose mothers were <30 years were about four times less likely to wear face mask when compared with those whose mothers were aged 35 years and above. (AOR = 0.273; 95%CI: 0.155-0.478). Similarly, the children whose mothers were between 30-34 years were 2.3 times less likely to wear a face mask when compared with those whose mothers were 35 years and above. (AOR = 0.436; 95% CI: 0.252-0.755. The children who were aged 8 days to one year were about four times less likely to wear a mask when compared with those who were > 1-year old. (AOR = 0.274; 95% CI: 0.132-0.567). The children whose fathers have attained tertiary education were about twice less likely to wear face masks when compared with those whose fathers have attained secondary education and less. (AOR = 0.554; 95%CI: 0.334-0.919). This study has shown varying maternal perceptions/knowledge of masking in children. It is very tasking for children who have no COVID to put on face masks, and they are likely to take them off since they make them uncomfortable. Children less than 2 years may not benefit from wearing a face mask but may rather be at risk of suffocation. This is because they have small airways, which can make them struggle when breathing and this can cause asphyxiation and even death [12] . The American Academy of Paediatrics has advised the washing of hands and social distancing for these groups of children [13] . Several studies have noted the efficacy and potency of face mask, especially surgical masks and N95 in warding off the transmission of Corona virus. These masks are noted to have the efficacy of protection against the pandemic at 68% and 91%, respectively [14] . Home-made masks were noted to be worn by children who were on masks during the study. Some studies have ascertained the efficacy of home-made masks [15] . They noted that some household materials, vacuum cleaner filters, and tea towels were very effective in the prevention of COVID 19 transmission but stated that they can cause a pressure drop, which makes breathing difficult. They recommended the use of 100% cotton t-shirts and pillowcases which have a filtration efficiency of 51% and 57%, respectively [15] . Linen was also reported to have an effectiveness of 61% [15] . Furthermore, they noted Quilting fabric as the best household fabric, followed by 600-count pillowcases and flannel. Cotton and bandanas were seen to have good tolerability and wearability and associated increased compliance, but with a decreased efficacy [15] . Esposito et al [3] noted that a home-made mask is important in curbing the possibility of transmission of the infection by asymptomatic carriers. They opined that homemade or purchased cloth masks are suitable for a child who is above the age of two to wear, but the right fit must be guaranteed. It is gratifying to note that when a facemask is worn correctly, it alters and slows the propelling force of particles expelled from expectoration and prevents transmission [16, 17] .This study also showed that a good number of children did not wear face masks as a method of prevention of Corona virus infection. They hazarded reasons that these children have difficulty in breathing and readily pulled off the face masks.The benefits of using face masks in children should be weighed against possible harm associated with it. This includes feasibility and discomfort, as well as the effect on interactions and social communication. Besides, the age of the child, socio-cultural correlates and the presence of adult supervision should be considered when masking a child [18] .There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the pattern and clinical profile of COVID 19. For instance, recently, the World Health Organization stated that the number of asymptomatic carriers was very small and that they could not transmit infection [19] . Recently, data showed that 50-75% of subjects with positive throat swab were totally asymptomatic [20] . It is important to note that asymptomatic cases are commonly seen among the paediatric population.A study has shown that the use of a face mask is very effective in the prevention of COVID-19 in children. Though the effectiveness of homemade mask is not certain, it is documented that surgical masks prevent the inhalation of large droplets, but may not filter submicron-sized airborne particles [21] . It has been reported that asymptomatic people can transmit the new coronavirus 2019 and become important sources of COVID-19. The Universal use of face masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing is very useful in combating this novel virus. To reduce the role of asymptomatic people in COVID-19, it is expedient to prepare the child to use face masks. It is advisable to thoroughly educate the child on the need for compliance, without actually forcing it on him [3, [22] [23] [24] .Though a significant proportion of children who were more than one year of age would wear face masks when compared with those who were aged 8 days to one year, we noted that a good number of children less than two years still wore face masks.This practice is not in keeping with WHO recommendations for wearing face masks in children. The WHO recommended the ""do no harm"" phenomenon on children wearing face mask. They stated that there is no need for a mask in children less than 5 years of age [25] . However, some countries may contextualize the use of face masks for children to 2 or 3 years [25] . If the age of two or three years of age is to be used for recommending mask use for children, a well-knitted and coordinated supervision is needed to ensure the correct use of the mask and to prevent any potential harm associated with mask use in the child [3] . It is important to note that for children between six and eleven years of age, a risk-based approach should be applied. This includes the intensity of transmission in the locale and availability of data on the risk of infection and transmission in that age group [3, 26] . Other factors such as beliefs, behaviour, customs or social norms and the child's capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision should be considered [3, 24, 25] . For children and adolescents 12 years or older, WHO guidelines for mask use in adults should be used [26] .The misconception of children aged 8 days to 1 year would wear face masks as seen in this study, is an eye-opener that will help alert the government to strengthen the policy on the acceptable age of wearing a face mask as well as organize programs geared towards health education for all especially the mothers.Besides, the majority of children whose mothers have attained at least secondary education wear face masks when compared with those whose mothers attained tertiary education. This study also showed that a higher proportion of the children whose fathers attained secondary education and less would wear face masks when compared with those whose fathers have attained tertiary education. Health education and promotion on the need for children to wear a face mask, at least for those above two years of age, should be intensified.This study showed that mothers above 35 years of age, those who are married, whose husbands are employed and who had high educational status prefer that their children should wear a face mask as a preventive measure against Corona virus infection. Studies in Australia have shown that people aged 16-34 years are more reluctant to wear face masks [27] , while 68% of subjects aged 50-59 years perceived wearing face masks as very commendable. In keeping with our study, Tang [28] et al, also noted a higher level of compliance among married people when compared with their unmarried counterparts. Taylor [29] et al, also noted that people who never married had very low compliance levels as regards wearing face mask [3] . Nevertheless, getting married increases with age, it could be that age/duration of the marriage is a better predictor of wearing of face mask. Some studies have opined that higher education was strongly associated with wearing face masks. They noted that participants with at least a senior high school education certificate were found to be more likely to wear face masks [29, 30] .We noted a higher proportion of children whose fathers attained secondary education and less, wear a face mask when compared with those whose fathers have attained tertiary education. A study showed that men, in general, don't wear face mask especially when wearing a face covering is not mandatory [24] , but they tend to wear a mask when wearing a face covering is mandatory. In Nigeria, there is no penalty or any punitive measures for not wearing a face mask. These highly educated men and those in tertiary institutions know that there is no law and will not bother to wear face masks and they could extend the same apathy to their children. However, their counterparts with secondary education may be ignorant of the non-punitive measures and will prefer to wear a mask out of fear of breaking the law [31] .This study showed that mothers' perception of COVID-19 has does not influence children's use of face masks. This simply means that mothers' perception or knowledge of COVID 19 did not really affect their practice on their children wearing face masks. This gap in perception of COVID 19 and practice of prevention by use of masks in children could be closed by improving behaviour change through campaigns, to reach everyone with appropriate information and guidance. Communication and information dissemination should be intensified.Maternal perception of masking in children as an appropriate strategy for preventing COVID-19 is adjudged low in this study. Right perception is significantly enhanced by maternal educational status, employment status and marital status. Furthermore, there is a misconception with regards to mothers putting on face masks on children less than 1 year. Mothers' perception of COVID-19 had no influence on children's use of face masks.Children's use of face masks below the age of two years should be discouraged.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era.We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model.The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54. 7; 63.6] Bronchiolitis infection is included among the leading causes of hospitalization and death in pediatrics [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Bronchiolitis also represents a high economic burden on society and has generated a high hospital cost of around 72 million euros for children under the age of 2 in Portugal between 2000 and 2015 [3] . A study by Shi et al. found that lower respiratory infections due to Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV), which is the main agent of bronchiolitis, causes approximately 3.2 million hospitalizations and about 60 thousand deaths per year worldwide in children under the age of 5 [6] . Bronchiolitis is generally considered to be a viral illness, and the most common viruses include HRSV, Influenza virus, Rhinovirus (RV), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), Enterovirus (EV), Human Coronavirus (HCoV), Human Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV), Human Adenovirus (HAdV), and Human Bocavirus (HBoV).During the last two decades, the increase in use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of respiratory viruses has led to a reassessment of the role played by viruses such as RV in acute respiratory infections [7, 8] . These molecular detection assays have also revealed new respiratory viruses such as HMPV and HBoV, and some RV and HCOV species [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The role of respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis and more particularly the newly described agents has not been synthesized yet. The objective of this study was to report the detection rate of viral agents using PCR and the associated risk factors with bronchiolitis in children � 2 years in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. available in S2 Table in S1 File. The search strategy in Pubmed has been adjusted to the Global Index Medicus database. The databases have been consulted since their creation until 06 February 2019 and updated on 16 August 2020.The literature search was supplemented by a review of references of included articles and relevant reviews. We have gradually updated our search strategy iteratively by adding the specific keywords of the searches found manually. No language or geographical restrictions have been applied.Observational studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) published in peer-reviewed journals were used if they reported the detection of respiratory viruses using PCR assays in children < 2 years with bronchiolitis. A wide range of definition of bronchiolitis has been used by the authors of the included articles. Case reports, review, and duplicated studies were excluded.Two investigators (SK and AFM) independently preselected the identified articles on the basis of their titles and abstracts (if necessary). The relevance of eligible studies was assessed using predefined integration criteria.Data from the included studies were independently extracted by two authors (SK and FBSN) via a preconceived form. The information gathered included: the name of the author, the year of publication, the design of the study, the country, the WHO regions, the sampling method, the period of the study, the definition of bronchiolitis, the exclusion criteria, the sample type, the viral detection assay, age range, mean or median age, percentage of male gender, number of samples tested for each virus, number of positives for each virus, and the data of the evaluation of the study quality. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between two authors and an arbitration by a third author if need be.The risk of bias of the included studies was estimated as low (8) (9) (10) , moderate (5-7), and high (0-4) risk of bias using the Hoy et al. assessment tool (S3 Table in Forest plots, summary tables and a narrative summary were used to present the overall results. The calculation of the prevalence took into account the weight of each study. Each prevalence was estimated using a random-effect meta-analysis given the inseparable heterogeneity of observational studies. A dual arcsine transformation of Freeman-Turkey was used to stabilize the variances in the prevalence calculation. Subgroup analysis was performed to estimate prevalence variations by sample type used for viral detection, WHO region and some viral codetection status. The Cochran Q test and the I 2 statistic were used to measure heterogeneity between studies [17] . Analysis based on studies with a low risk of bias, children � 1 year, hospitalized children, and cross sectional were used for sensitivity analyses. Visual inspection of a funnel plot and the Egger test were used to estimate the risk of publication bias [18] . A prediction interval was provided for all meta-analyses to predict future study values. Values of p <0.05 were assimilated as statistically significant. The analyses were conducted using the meta package version 4.9-2 under the R version 3.5.1 software [19, 20]. The code ""metaprop"" was used for meta-analyses of prevalence.The literature search provided a total of 3777 articles and 154 duplicates were excluded. Selection based on titles and abstracts excluded 3370 irrelevant articles. We therefore examined 253 complete texts and excluded 203 for multiple reasons (Fig 1, S4 . We did not find any major change in our results when we conducted sensitivity analyses that included only children < 1 year, hospitalized children, studies with bronchiolitis case definition, cross sectional studies, and low risk of bias studies (S6 Table in S1 File). Substantial heterogeneity was detected in overall prevalence and sensitivity analyses for all viruses. Publication bias was detected for HMPV and Influenza meta-analyses (S6 Table in S1 File and S3-S11 Fig in S1 File).The subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the prevalence of HRSV (p < 0.001), RV (p < 0.001), HBoV (p < 0.001), HAdV (p < 0.001), HPIV (p < 0.001), mild HCoV (p < 0.001), and EV (p < 0.001) according to the WHO regions (S7 Table in S1 File). Lower prevalence was observed in Eastern Mediterranean for HRSV, HBoV, and EV; in America for RV and HAdV; and in Europe for HPIV. A significant increase in the prevalence was observed for continuous study period for HMPV (p = 0.005), HPIV (p = 0.005), and Influenza (p = 0.014). The subgroup analysis according to the type of sample revealed a significant increase in nasopharyngeal secretions for HRSV (p < 0.001).This systematic review asserts the strong predominance of HRSV in children < 2 years with bronchiolitis. We have shown that HRSV is present in almost two-thirds of bronchiolitis cases. RV and two recently described viruses by the advent of molecular assays (HBoV and HMPV) were among the most common viruses. The HRSV + RV and HRSV + HBoV co-detections were the most frequent.The predominance pattern of respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis reported in this study is consistent with that reported by several previous narrative reviews [71] [72] [73] . Regardless of multiple factors including detection assays, tested sample types, children's age, and infection severity most studies report that HRSV is the major agent in cases of bronchiolitis with rates ranging from 50 to 80% [72] . RV, that is the second most common virus in this study, has long been considered a cause of benign respiratory infection such as the common cold [74] . Early investigations of the prevalence of RV in bronchiolitis episodes were conducted using traditional assays including serological testing and culture [75, 76] . The development of serological assays has always been difficult for RV because of the high number of serotypes. It is also well known that RV is insensitive to most cell lines used in viral isolation [77, 78] . Therefore the recent widespread use of PCR could justify this hidden importance of RV in low respiratory tract infections [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Many other recent works have also highlighted the importance of RV in other respiratory infections such as asthma, wheezing, and long-term respiratory sequelae in pre-school children [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . HMPV and HBoV were first described in 2001 and 2005 respectively using molecular assays [9, 12] . As previously reported, our study further reinforces the role assigned to these relatively new agents in bronchiolitis [71] [72] [73] . Human Bocavirus is commonly reported in asymptomatic children and in co-detection with other viruses, which has long raised the question of its exclusive involvement in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] . On the other hand, reports have also highlighted HBoV involvement in life-threatening respiratory illness in children, but this still does not establish a role for bocavirus as an important pathogen [97] [98] [99] . The HBoV reported in this study as the third most common virus in children with bronchiolitis therefore deserves further investigation to explain its clinical relevance in bronchiolitis.This study has shown an increased codetection of either RV or HBoV in children infected with HRSV. This high prevalence of RV or HBoV in HRSV positive patients may indicate an overlap in the circulation period of these predominant viruses in bronchiolitis. It is known that HBoV and RV are recorded throughout the year, which obviously coincides with the circulation period of HRSV with peaks in winter and early spring [100, 101] .Respiratory viruses are characterized by their easy transmission through the contact of contaminated objects and through the airway [102] [103] [104] . These viruses are thus cosmopolitan and know no boundaries in their distribution across the different regions of the world. The frequencies of detection of respiratory viruses throughout the various regions of the world are governed by multiple climatic, sociodemographic and cultural factors. We are therefore unable to interpret the pattern of dominance observed in the prevalence of respiratory viruses according to the WHO regions observed during this work. The majority of interrupted time series studies included in this review were conducted in the HRSV peak circulation period [105] . Contrary to our expectations, the prevalence of HRSV in these interrupted time series studies was not significantly greater than studies conducted over a continuous period. On the other hand, the HMPV, the HPIV and Influenza presented a significant higher prevalence in studies performed in continuous period. This result suggests that the peaks of circulation of HMPV, HPIV and Influenza are different from that of HRSV. In fact the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses can vary from year to another. Some studies have shown an overlap of HRSV and HMPV circulation while others have not [106, 107] . This disagreement observed in the seasonal pattern of these respiratory viruses circulation compromises our ability to interpret our subgroup analysis according to the continuous or interrupted study period.It is generally recognized that bronchiolitis is a respiratory condition of children up to the age of 2 years [108] . Several reports have shown that only clinical symptoms are enough for the management of children with bronchiolitis, and viral testing is generally considered unnecessary [109, 110] . Data on the impact of multiple viral infections on the severity of bronchiolitis is controversial and does not justify recommendations of routinely virological examinations in most guidelines [111, 112] . Increase use of healthcare resources for virus detection and regularly recorded codetections do not warrant cohorting of infected children and is another reason that hinder the investigation of viral pathogens in bronchiolitis clinical practice [110] .However, virological tests are still used in children with severe bronchiolitis to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics and interventions such as chest X-rays [108, 113] . In children admitted to receive palivizumab, American Academy of Pediatrics recommends HRSV testing for cessation of treatment if the test is positive [114] .Assessing the respective contribution of respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis could also be of crucial importance in orienting priority actions such as the allocation of financial resources for research on the main contributors, HRSV, particularly with the imminent introduction of vaccines against HRSV [115] .It is important to mention that the small number of studies in some subgroups analyses restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions. A second limitation in our study is that we did not consider multiple other factors that could further explain the variability in the prevalence of viruses in bronchiolitis such as comorbidities, anti-HRSV prophylaxis and the number of virus types sought in studies for multi-species such as mild HCoV and HPIV. It is also known that bronchiolitis case definitions show great variability in terms of age limit and constellation of clinical symptoms according to geographic area and time that we did not consider in this study [71, 116] .Beyond these limitations, this systematic review and meta-analysis reports the prevalence recorded over two decades of a large panel of common respiratory viruses currently involved in bronchiolitis. We report the data obtained in almost all WHO regions from the PCR that currently represent the most commonly used assays in diagnosing respiratory viruses, which is another major asset of this work. We also have conducted multiple sensitivity analyses that further strengthen the robustness of our results on multiple important aspects such as children hospitalization, age range, and design and quality of studies.The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis further underline the strong HRSV predominance in children with bronchiolitis. This work also highlights the importance of RV and the newly described HMPV and HBoV in children with bronchiolitis. The HRSV + RV and HRSV + HBoV co-detections were the most frequent in children with bronchiolitis.The high costs of prophylaxis with palivizumab remain a major wall to its widespread use in reducing the burden of bronchiolitis in children. Therefore, to significantly reduce the heavy burden of bronchiolitis due to HRSV in children, the finalization and availability of HRSV vaccines is a high priority. Future studies should explore the involvement of multiple viral infections in the bronchiolitis severity and to clarify the clinical impact of HBoV in bronchiolitis cases. Social distancing measures undertaken for the SARS-CoV-2 response have shown a significant reduction in child hospitalizations due to acute bronchiolitis between the pre-pandemic and pandemic eras [117] . Although showing an association between the viral load and the severity of acute bronchiolitis, a recent study showed a relatively small contribution of the 4 HCoV species associated with mild diseases and most often associated with another coinfecting virus in a cohort of children with acute bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era [118] . To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported SARS-CoV-2 in a group of children with acute bronchiolitis to date. A few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 in children with acute bronchiolitis have been presented without exhaustive exploration of other common respiratory viruses [119, 120] . SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection in ferrets showed lung lesions consistent with acute bronchiolitis [121] . Collectively, these data suggest that involvement of SARS-CoV-2 solely in the development of acute bronchiolitis in children without comorbidities remains a matter of debate. More data on the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in children with acute bronchiolitis is needed. ","Cameroon","first author","2020-11-12","11"

The seasonal dependence of viral respiratory diseases has been attributed to several potential mechanisms, including virus longevity in the air and on surfaces [7, 8] , increased susceptibility of the human victim in cold and dry weather [9, 10] and changes in human social behavior between winter and summer [11] .The initial Covid-19 outbreak in December 2019 occurred in mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere countries during the boreal winter. It has since become clear that warm and humid weather has not substantially slowed down infection rates during the Northern Hemisphere summer [12] , presumably because of the effects of high susceptibility of the population in the pandemic phase of the disease overwhelming any potential climatic impacts on transmissibility [2] . The disease reached the Southern Hemisphere during the austral late summer to early autumn. In the developing Southern Hemisphere countries of South America and South Africa, socio-economic factors placed limitations on the extent and duration of non-pharmaceutical control measures. Consequently, large outbreaks occurred in the winter of 2020, but with little evidence that winter climate worsened these outbreaks [13] . It remains of considerable interest, however, to understand whether Covid-19 has a seasonality dependence. A seasonal effect is potentially an important contributor to the occurrence of a second wave of outbreaks. Moreover, will Covid-19 become an annual occurrence, like many other viral respiratory diseases?Several studies to date have attempted to identify and quantify climatic dependencies in Covid-19 infection rates, using data on reported cases [14, 15, 16, 17] , but have failed to conclusively prove or disprove the existence of such a link. These studies have been compromised by the fact that no single location on Earth has yet moved through a full annual cycle in the presence of Covid-19; thus the studies depend on 'space-for-time' substitution (in other words, using the difference in climate between different locations as a proxy for its evolution over time in one J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f location)but the assumptions necessary for this approach to work are confounded by the spatial dynamic of the disease spread. Moreover, various degrees of non-pharmaceutical control measures have been applied across different countries, and their intensity changed over time at a given location. This, in combination with differential socio-economic conditions and related differential abilities of individuals to apply social distancing, makes it hard to identify a relatively weak climatic signal in observed case data. Further noise is added by the heterogeneity in how the case data and mortality data are reported. As a consequence of all these complicating factors, by September 2020, no consensus has been reached on whether Covid-19 has a climatic dependence; and if so, which environmental factors are involved, and what their relative strengths are [13, 18] .Here we make use of a dynamic epidemiological model to identify the 'signature' of seasonality in the outbreak of a highly infectious disease such as Covid-19. This allows us to propose a new approach of how this signature may be detected in observed case data. We then analyse the conditions under which Covid-19 may resurge as a second wave of infections, and how this relates to seasonality.Idealised profiles of seasonality provide a standard approach in modelling infectious diseases with seasonal behavior [3, 19, 20] . Following this approach, we define a 'Theoretical Climate Correction Factor' (TCCF) that describes how seasonality may modify the basic reproduction number R 0 :Here ε ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the strength of seasonality, with transmissibility reaching a peak when . That is, in this paper the basic reproduction number R 0 is the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an average infectious case in an entirely susceptible population under climatological conditions optimal for transmission. Consistently, ( ) and , where R 0 ' is the modified reproduction number ( ).The TCCF can be explored over the full ranges of amplitude and timing, but here we are interested in the more limited expression of seasonality observed for the commonly circulating human coronaviruses (assuming similar behavior for SARS-CoV-2). Two recent epidemiological modelling studies have considered the degree to which seasonality may impact on the annual cycles of commonly circulating human coronaviruses. For four commonly circulating coronaviruses in Sweden, with seasonality described by an equation equivalent to (1), Neher et al. (2020) concluded that for local spread but for strong import of cases . Using climatic dependent inverse modelling applied to case data of the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses, Figure 1 of Baker et al. (2020) suggests for HCoV-HKU1 and for HCoV-OC43. Consistent with these estimates and restricted travel associated with the non-pharmaceutical control of Covid-19, we proceed to explore the impacts of seasonality of strength .We explore the signatures of seasonality in Covid-19 infection rates using a dynamic epidemiological model for the cases of mid-winter and mid-summer outbreak of the disease. In the paper, 'mid-winter' means 1 July (1 January) in the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere, and 'mid-summer' means 1 January (1 July) in the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere. For the case of (1), 'mid-winter' corresponds to the time during which the function attains its maximum value, and mid-summer to the time it reaches a minimum value. This is consistent with the main Covid-19 seasonality hypothesis, namely that transmissibility is favored by dry and cold winters, and reduced during warm and humid summers [21, 22] .Towards identifying the key signatures of seasonality in disease propagation dynamics, we purposefully select a simple Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model and apply it to a homogeneous population:;.Here S, I, R and D are the number of susceptible, infected, recovered and dead individuals, respectively, at a given moment in time, and they sum to the total population, N (which is assumed to be remain constant). α is the daily infection rate, γ the mortality rate and β the recovery rate. Note that ( ) ⁄and that the infection fatality rate (IFR) is given by . In the applications of the SIRD model described in this paper, α is modified to generate values of R 0 ranging between 2 and 3, in the plausible estimated range of R 0 for Covid-19 [23, 24] . The values of γ and β are fixed in all the simulations at and respectively, following [25] , and consistent with current estimates of the recovery rate and IFR [2, 24] . Seasonality and non-pharmaceutical control measures are both modelled to impact on R 0 through changes in α .The time it takes for an infectious disease to propagate through a population depends on its size. In the experiments performed here, . We seek to identify signatures of seasonality under the simplifying assumption of a homogeneous population, but note that in reality populations are heterogeneous and that factors such as differential population density as well as age and activity structures can impact on disease propagation dynamics [23] . The cases of non-pharmaceutical control we consider are simple and largely constant over time, but in reality such measures may be applied intermittently [26] , resulting in infection curves more complex than having single or bimodal peaks that result from the assumptions we apply. We further assume that the entire population is susceptible at the time of onset of the disease with the sole focus of exploring seasonality impacts, and not considering the potentially important role of cross-immunity that may exist in populations due to exposure to other coronaviruses [27] or potential cross-protection from for example BCG vaccination programmes [28] . Moreover, we do not distinguish between the symptomatic or asymptomatic infected and it is assumed that members from the population that recover from the disease have immunity for at least two years. The simulations do not take into account any pharmaceutical control measures that may become available in the future.The first case we explore is mid-winter onset of the disease in the presence of seasonality described by under (1). The susceptible-infected (SI) orbits (time trajectories in the SI phase-plane, shown as proportions of the total population, N) for different values of R 0 for the scenario of 'no control measures and no seasonality effects' are shown in black in Figure 1a , b and c. The orbits commence with effectively an entirely susceptible population ( ) and then follow a hump-shaped trajectory, with the peak infection also being the point where a sufficient number of people have been infected for herd immunity to set in. The point where the orbit returns to the S-axis represents the final epidemic size. The effect of seasonality, in the absence of control measures, is explored in Figure 1a for several values of R 0 (colored orbits), while the effect of non-pharmaceutical control [29] without seasonality effects is shown in Figure  1b (colored orbits). For the non-pharmaceutical control scenarios it is assumed that after a period of one month of the disease spreading in the population, a lockdown is implemented which reduces the infection rate by 40% (i.e.). The lockdown is maintained for 9 months, through spring, summer and into autumn, followed by light social distancing (i.e. a 10% reduction in infection rate). The final scenario considered applies the same non-pharmaceutical control measures whilst seasonality is also having an effect (Figure 1c , colored orbits). The corresponding time-evolution of the fraction of the population infected (I/N) is shown in Figure  2a to d for selected values of R 0 , for the scenarios of no control measures and no seasonality (black lines), no control measures in the presence of seasonality (green lines), lockdown followed by social distancing in the absence of seasonality (yellow lines) and finally, lockdown followed by social distancing, both in the presence of seasonality effects (red lines).In the initial stages of a mid-winter onset the disease with no control measures being applied, ( ). As winter progresses to spring, progressively warmer and more humid conditions reduce R 0 '. The telltale signature of such an effect is that the SI-orbits under seasonality (colored lines in Figure 1a ) cross the orbits for the scenario of no control and no seasonality. This effect can be seen in in Figure 1a , most prominently for the lower values of R 0 ( ), but also at higher values ( ) once about 50% of the population has been infected. At lower infection rates, the diseases takes relatively long to spread through the population, pushing it into spring and allowing seasonality to lower R 0 '. For example, for in the absence of seasonality the peak infection occurs in spring, 3.5 months into the outbreak (Figure 2d , black line). If seasonal effects are at work, the peak infection is reached about two weeks later -but most importantly, the peak of active cases, which is what determines the load on the health system, is almost halved (Figure 2d, green line) . The resulting behavior of the disease, in terms of the total fraction of the population eventually infected, resembles that of an infection with constant ( Figure 1a ). By the time that the disease has run its course and the final epidemic size is reached, less than 60% of the population has been infected, while over 80% of the population is infected if seasonality is not at work. In contrast, if the basic reproduction number is at the high end ( ), the peak infection in the absence of seasonality occurs less than 2 months after introduction of the first infected individual to the population (Figure 2a, black line) . Even if seasonality effects are considered, given that climatological effects are optimal for Non-pharmaceutical control slows down the spread of the disease, but if maintained consistently for a sufficiently long period, it should still be possible to discern signatures of seasonality from the SI-orbits. This is explored in Figure 1b and c. Note that the range of both the S-and I-axes have been reduced compared to Figure 1a and that only a subset of orbits are shown to avoid clutter. For the illustrated scenario, a strong lockdown was initiated one month after onset of the disease and maintained for 9 months, where after it was replaced by social distancing. The SI-orbits display two main types of behavior. For values of , although the infection rate is significantly damped, the disease still spreads through most of the population and peak infection occurs within six months of the outbreak (Figure 2 a to c, yellow lines). In these cases 50-75 % of the population become infected before the final epidemic size is reached (Figure 1b) . For lower basic reproduction numbers ( ) the dampening of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection rate by control measures is sufficiently strong that no significant outbreak occurs during the 9 month period of lockdown (see the blue line representing in Figure 1b and the yellow line up and until month 10 in Figure 2d ). However, since herd immunity is not reached, the disease continues to linger in the population, and breaks out in the months immediately following the relaxation of lockdown measures (Figure 1b blue orbit, Figure 2d , yellow line beyond month 10). In terms of the SI-orbits, the outbreak can be seen as a sudden increase in R 0 ' and the consequent crossing of the orbits of constant R 0 .The presence of seasonality implies further dampening of infection rates during the period of stringent lockdown. For the characteristic signature of seasonality, namely the crossing of the orbits of constant R 0 is apparent (compare the purple orbits in Figures 1b and c) , but despite the combined dampening effects of lockdown and seasonality the diseases still propagates through the population until herd immunity is reached in spring (Figure 2a , red line) with about 60% of the population infected during the course of the outbreak (purple orbit, Figure  1c ). The remaining cases ( ) displayed in Figure 1c reveal an entirely different type of behavior, induced by seasonality. For these lower infection rates the combined dampening effect of lockdown and seasonality is sufficiently strong that the peak infection is substantially reduced (Figures 2 b to d) and less than 25% of the population becomes infected during the period of stringent lockdown (Figure 1c ). High summer temperatures following the initial onset of the disease further damp the infection rate, but since herd immunity is not attained, once lockdown is replaced by less stringent social distancing, the return of lower temperatures and humidity as the next winter approaches systematically increases the infection rate. Without renewed lockdown, this results in a second wave of outbreak, with a significantly higher of peak infection than experienced in the first year of the disease (red lines in Figure 2 b to d) . This scenario may well be important for Northern Hemisphere countries, where initial onset of the disease occurred in approximately mid-winter, and where anti-body tests suggest that the portion of the population infected by mid-summer is significantly less than 20% [30] .The impacts of seasonality as described by (1) for are profoundly different for a midsummer onset compared to mid-winter onset of the disease, under the scenario of no control measures being applied. The SI-orbits for the case of a mid-summer outbreak are shown in Figure 3a to c under scenarios of non-pharmaceutical control and seasonality effects, with the corresponding I/N time-evolutions shown in Figure 4 . The summer season substantially dampens the infection rate ( ) and consequently delays the peak infection by about a month for (Figure 4a , green line) and two months for (Figure 4d , green line). For larger values of R 0 peak infection occurs before optimal seasonality forcing is reached in winter. By the time of peak infection (early autumn for to late autumn for ), R 0 ' has increased sufficiently for the orbits of constant R 0 to be crossed (see the colored orbits in Figure  3a ). The dampening of the peak infection by seasonality is substantial, even for these higher values of R 0 . For example, for the dampening of the peak infection is about 40% ( Figure  4a ) and 10% less of the population is infected by the time the final epidemic size is reached (Figure 3a) . For the damping is so significant that the outbreak only gains momentum in the following winter, reaching the same peak infection (Figure 4d , green line) and infecting the same portion of the population (Figure 3c ) as for the corresponding situation of no control measures and no seasonality (Figure 4d, black line) .We next explore a scenario of non-pharmaceutical control similar to that described for the midwinter onset, but with lockdown maintained from the end of month one to the end of month 12.For values of even under a stringent lockdown, the disease still runs its course through the population and herd immunity is reached during the first year of the infection (Figure 3b) . The same will thus be true for all weaker forms of lockdown and social distancing. Nonetheless, the amplitude of the peak infection is substantially reduced and its timing is delayed (Figure 4a to c, yellow lines). The lockdown orbits correspond to cases of constant R 0 given that the lockdown merely functions to reduce R 0 to a smaller but constant value of R 0 '. For values of the dampening of the infection rate is so strong that herd immunity is not reached during the first year of the infection (blue orbit, Figure 3b ). Once the measures of control are relaxed in the 13 th month of the infection, a second wave of infections occurs immediately (blue orbit, Figure 3b ; yellow line, Figure 4d ). For a mid-summer onset, seasonality combined with non-pharmaceutical controls dampen the infection rate during the initial months of the outbreak, but when winter arrives the transmissionreducing effect of seasonality disappears. Consequently, a peak infection of amplitude similar to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the case of lockdown without seasonality effects occurs for values of R 0 ; (Figure 4a and  b) . This is demonstrated best for the case of in Figure 3c (orange orbit), where R 0 ' first increases as winter is reached, where after it decreases as the disease runs its course in spring, with a clear crossing of the orbits of constant R 0 . For smaller values of R 0 , herd immunity is not reached during the first year of infection, thus once control measures are weakened second waves of infection follow (blue and yellow orbits in Figure 3c ; red lines in Figure 3c and d) . These do not occur immediately, as is the case in the absence of seasonality. Rather, the infection rate remains damped by seasonality in the summer and autumn of the second year of the disease, and peak infection only occurs in the winter or spring of the second year. For most of the population is still susceptible after the first year of the infection (blue orbit, Figure 3c ), and consequently the second wave of infections can be severe (in the absence of control measures being re-applied in the second year of the infection (red line, Figure 4d ).By late September 2020, eight months into the Covid-19 outbreak, it remains unclear whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is impacted by climatic effects [12, 18] . A key reason for this is that the majority of studies exploring climate effects focused on the initial outbreak of the disease before non-pharmaceutical control measures impacted on infection rates. These studies thus focused on relatively short periods and relied on a 'space-for-time' substitution to incorporate a greater variety of climate anomalies, but at the expense of introducing several confounding factors to the analysis. Here we propose an alternative methodology to test for Covid-19 seasonality. This methodology considers the evolution of Covid-19 over longer periods of time, including at least one winter/summer and one transition (spring/autumn) season, to explore the systematic impacts of seasonality rather than the instantaneous impacts of climate anomalies on infection rates. Moreover, unlike previous studies the methodology considers the full dynamics of the disease through considering its SI-orbits, rather than to focus on infection rates only. We've used a SIRD modelling approach to explore the signatures of seasonality of a highly infectious disease under the proposed methodology, also considering the confounding impacts of non-pharmaceutical control. We consider idealized cases of mid-summer and midwinter outbreaks, noting the current hypothesis that Covid-19 infection rates are optimal under cold and dry conditions. In such climates, the telltale signature of seasonality is the crossing of the SI-orbits of constant R 0 by the seasonality orbits on an SI-diagram, which can be detected even in the pandemic stage of the outbreak.In the case of mid-winter onset, without control measures, the detectability of even strong seasonality only becomes feasible for once about 50% of the population has been infected. For lower values of R 0 , the disease persist in the population for long enough for seasonality to be more clearly revealed. Control measures slow down the progression of the disease, but if applied consistently for many months the presence of seasonality can be clearly detected in the SI orbits. However, stringent lockdown measures prevent the development of herd immunity so that more than 70% of the population remain susceptible in the summer following the initial onset of the disease. Should control measures be relaxed in summer due to either a false sense of security that the disease has been contained, or under socio-economic pressure, severe seasonality-induced second waves can develop from autumn to spring of the following year. It may be noted that current serological testing in several Northern Hemisphere countries where Covid-19 had a winter onset is suggesting that significantly less than 20% of the population had been infected by the time of the onset of the boreal summer of 2020 [30] .When the disease onset occurs in mid-summer its evolution is markedly different. Despite the dampening effects of climate, the disease still moves through the population for values of and herd immunity is reached before winter arrives. The seasonality-affected orbits cross the orbits of constant R 0 only by the time that about half of the population has been infected. For lower values of R 0 the disease is still propagating through the population by the time winter arrives and it reaches its full transmission probability, thus peak infection is similar to that in the absence of seasonality effects, with the seasonal orbits tangential to those of constant R 0. For high values of R 0 ( ) stringent control measures, even in combination with seasonal dampening, merely function to slow down the propagation of the disease and herd immunity is reached in the first year of the outbreak. For lower values of R 0 , the effect of lockdown and seasonal dampening is so substantial that herd immunity is not achieved in the first year of outbreak, and in the presence second waves of high peak infection occur in the second year when winter sets in (and provided control measures have been relaxed). Given the timing of the Covid-19 outbreak, this risk applies to Southern Hemisphere countries such as Australia and New Zealand, where efficient non-pharmaceutical control measures are on track to prevent herd immunity from being reached in 2020.The telltale signature of seasonality is that the seasonal orbits cross those of a constant R 0 . The identification of this feature in real-world data, if it exists, will be confounded by inadequacies and differences in how infection rates are reported between countries. This problem may be reduced by using death-rate anomalies (excess deaths) as a proxy for Covid-19 mortality rates, from which inverse modelling may be applied to construct the SI-orbits. A further complicating factor is the temporally-varying application of non-pharmaceutical control measures. Nonetheless, we are of the view that the proposed test for seasonality can be successfully applied to a subset of countries, regions or cities, where non-pharmaceutical control measures have been applied consistently for several months. Still, about half of the population needs to become infected for the seasonality feature to clearly develop, further limiting the subset of populations within which a seasonality signature can likely be detected (as by September 2020). Given the limitations of operational Covid-19 statistics, the less than full annual cycle for which Covid-19 has been spreading on the planet and the fact that in most countries only a relatively small portion of the population has to date been infected, it is not surprising that no consensus has so far been reached in terms of seasonality impacts on Covid-19. The signal is obscured by both the noise of inconsistent data reporting, but also by the fundamental properties of the disease.By September 2020 the main immediate application of clearer knowledge of Covid-19 seasonality is preparation for, or prevention of, seasonality-induced second waves of infection (the ultimate signature of seasonality). This risk is particularly large in the absence of widespread deployment of a vaccine and in countries where successful non-pharmaceutical control have let a large portion of the population susceptible after the initial outbreak. Until the importance of seasonality in Covid-19 infection rates has been established, it remains prudent to design control measures as if high temperature and humidity will not significantly dampen the infection rate [12, 18] . At the same time, however, it is important to design control measures to cater for the possibility of severe, seasonality-induced second waves of infection.","South Africa","first author","2020-11-29","11"

This study provides Identification, Isolation and Propagation methodology that enable researchers in Egypt to propagate SARS-CoV2 in high-titer for vaccine development and anti-viral drug screening.Oropheringial swabs were taken from symptomatic patients with COVID-19 from military hospital. The samples transferred, under full biosafety measures, in transportation media (sterile DMEM purchased from sigma Aldrich cat no. with ampicillin100IU/ml, streptomycin 100μg/ml) at 4 °C in biosafety transporting device to main chemical laboratories at ALMAZA-Cairo.The RNA of all samples extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were handled under a biosafety cabinet(germfree biosafety cabinet, SEA-III, 316 ss ) according to laboratory biosafety guidelines main chemical laboratories in chemical warfare department,Egyptain army.Molecular Identification was done using SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR detection KIT high profile. (Cat # VS-NCO212H) according to the manufacture instructions. The master mix was rehydrated with 15µL of rehydration Buffer and 5 µL of RNA of thermally treated and untreated samples were added ( samples were run in triplicates) , positive and negative controls ( provided with the kit ) were included in each test to judge the quality of amplification. Real time RT-PCR was done using Ariamx thermal cycler (Agilent, Germany) with the following parameters, reverse transcription step at 45oC/15 minute, followed by initial denaturing and enzyme activation step at 95oC/2 minute, then 45 cycled of denaturing at 95°C/10 sec and annealing/extension 60 °C/50 seconds with florescence collected at the end of this step.All the positive samples were were diluted with viral transfer medium containing Oropheringial swabs and antibiotics (Nystadin, penicillin-streptomycin 1:1 dilution) at 1:4 ratio and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C, before being inoculated onto VeroE6. Inoculated VeroE6 cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Virus replication and isolation were confirmed through cytopathic effects and RT-PCR. Viral culture of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in a biosafety Level-3 facility according to laboratory biosafety guidelines (germfree biosafety cabinet, SEA-III, 316 ss) according to laboratory biosafety guidelines of main chemical laboratories in chemical warfare department, Egyptian army.The Infected VeroE6 cells were scraped from the flask then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minute. The cell pellet was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Pellet was fixed 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline at pH 7.4 for at least two hours at room temperature.Virus solution was added to Amicon Ultra 50,000 KDa NMWL (Cat No. UFC9003) and centrifuge at 4,000xg for 15 minutes to wash from excess glutaraldehyde. The sample was diluted with 1ml of PBS and centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4,000xg. The sample was diluted with 1ml of PBS and centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4,000xg. The concentrator was transferred to a clean tube and centrifuge at 1,000xg for 2 minutes to collect the concentrated sample.The sample was diluted in serum physiologic.Samples used in the current study were collected from clinically morbid patients with the classical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including hyperthermia (>38.5°C) dyspnea, dry cough, and atypical pneumonia as confirmed by chest X rays. Oropheringial swabs were taken and were confirmed positive for the presence of the virus using qRT-PCR. All Chart 1 Cq * value of orf1 gene before and after inoculation.Chart 1 Cq * value of N gene before and after inoculation. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the SARS-CoV2 on the cells was followed and observ from the day 1 to day 4 after inoculation .Increasing cytopathic effects were record (Fig no 1) . We wanted to identify the propagation of the virus as SARS-CoV-2 using PCR along with SARS-CoV-2 N gene and orf1 gene. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in propagated samples was proved in table 1 as we mention before. After a compl molecular identification of SARS-CoV2 with real time PCR (chart 1 &2), we sequence full genome of the virus for some sample and submitted into gene bank (access numbers MT776904, MT798592, MT897260 and MT897261). ore in method, we wanted to evaluate this inactivation process. Therefore, we inoculated the inactivated SARS-CoV2 again on VeroE6 cell line and did not observe any CPE.SARS-CoV2 are enveloped ssRNA viruses that were distributed among humans in all over the world in 2019 (Ahmadi, et al. 2020 ). This infection cause respiratory, enteric and neurological diseases (Fang, et al.2020 ).The emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses an important threat to human health and economy of countries. This emphasizes the urgent need to develop effective vaccines to prevent future outbreaks and therefore isolation and inactivation of the SARS-CoV2 viruses become important issues.In the process of specimen collection from patient and transfer to the laboratory, the process should be started and virus cultured immediately because lots of virus became inactivated. Therefore, we use transfer solutions, infection medium used in propagation process, to safe infectious SARS-CoV-2 during the transportation. We identified the SARS-CoV2 with real time PCR depending on orf1 and N genes detection according to RT-PCR kit. In addition, before inoculation the virus on the cells, we wash the cells with FBS free media to remove excess of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, to propagate virus, cells were suspended with a virus media including 2% FBS. Afterwards, we observed cytopathic effects from day 1 to day 5 after inoculation. Inactivation of SARS-CoV2 was done by the process we mentioned before to inactivate the virus for being used as inactivated vaccine but after complete consideration of inactivation vaccine production criteria.As a conclusion, this study can be referenced for researchers in Egypt who aimed to propagate and isolate SARS-CoV-2 to work in vaccine production, genomics, sequencing, proteomics, gene editing like CRISPR and anti-viral drug screening.Competing Interest","Egypt","abstract","2020-11-05","11"

COVID19 uses positive sense single stranded RNA as its genetic material.Novel coronavirus disease 2019 which took its root in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is caused by the corona virus that can spread between animals and humans. COVID-19 is a present crisis whose clinical and epidemiological characteristics are currently being documented (Wu et al 2019 , Guan et al 2020 .Hitherto, the primary source of infection remain pneumonia patients infected with COVID-19.Transmission of respiratory droplets is the main transmission route, which can also be transmitted by contact (General Office of National Health Committee, 2020). The most common symptoms of Coronavirus disease COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. It may be accompanied by aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea in some people. At the moment, effective treatments modalities that target the coronavirus remain elusive and largely unknown. The therapeutic regimens and treatment modalities may require a while to be realised. This gap in knowledge and the quest for immediate credible solution has compelled governments and scientists to search for anti-COVID-19 remedies. Panicky developing nations including Africa in the phase of this wide spread and the predicted humanity and economic disasters resorted to home treatment of contacts and COVID-19 cases.In Africa, the orientation has skewed towards exploring natural spices and natural compounds (Chen and Nakamura 2004) . It has been reported that traditional remedies may alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. This is a synoptic capture of acclaimed home remedies with proven efficacy employed in various countries of Africa within the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methodology: Information from google, newspapers, magazines, different social media namely: facebook, twitter, whatsapp, testimonies of survivors through radios and televisions were gathered from February-May 2020. Sources that emphasised hospital treatment with orthodox medicines were excluded. Claims without dates and verifiable locations and identities were also excluded. Suspected postings by herbalists and traditional medical practitioners TMPs which could be viewed as promotional adverts were excluded. Socioeconomic status (education, employment etc) of all claimants were also recorded. Table 1 Senegal mahogany, is a species of plant in the family Meliaceae. Opuntia dillenii, a well-known member of the Cactaceae family, is used as a medicinal plant in various countries and grows in the desert, semi-desert, tropical and sub-tropical areas. Bird pepper or Capsicum frutescens (also called Ata Ijosin in Yoruba) is a tropical solanaceous plant. Turmeric root is a bright yelloworange spice commonly used in curries and sauces. Ginger is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or ginger, is widely used as a spice. Garlic is a plant in the Allium (onion) family.The lemon is citrus like and a specie of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae. Paw-paw, Asimina triloba, is a small deciduous tree. Other remedies include unripe pineapple and blackseed oil, black pepper, mango and guava leaves. The aqueous decoctions of these remedies especially the leaves were either taken orally or by steam inhalation. Since most of the home remedies are classified as 'generally regarded as safe' GRAS and in fact already used as food, dosing was not problematic. Generally, one teaspoonful of the powdered spices in 240-250 ml of warm water to be taken three times a day constituted daily routine throughout the period of treatment.About three months after it was officially recognised as a pandemic, the spread of the COVID-19 virus has continued, that urgent strong remedy is required, notwithstanding the paucity of have also supported the use of these home remedies as anti-COVID agents. In Madagascar a combination of artemisia, neem leaves, paw paw leaves, garlic, ginger, lime and oranges has been adopted as a notable anti-COVID agent. This combination is boiled for 30 minutes and steam-inhaled. Expectedly the steam inhalation clears the lungs of the virus. In fact, the Madagascar Institute of Applied Research has branded this decoction which can be also be taken orally as Covid-19 Organics CVO. Similar decoctions have been used in Nigeria and even by Nigerians who live in the diaspora. At inception COVID-19 was thought to be a lung disease but later evidence from autopsy reports tended to implicate Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC, Thrombosis). Regardless of the pathology, the African home remedies with their inherent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may explain at least in part, the acclaimed protection, remission in symptoms, seroconversion and cure of COVID-19 in many parts of Africa.

Newly diagnosed COVID-19 patient blood samples were collected, and the blood analysis reported here was done on treatment-naïve patients. The parameters were all done on admission (thus, symptomatic patients at different grades of severity) and at several points during admission. In our experience, hypercoagulability (as shown with thromboelastography (TEG ® ) and PFA200) could certainly predict the patients with the highest risk of developing the severe disease. Of the 37 patients, 15 were classified as having the mild disease and 22 as moderate-to-severe symptoms (based on CT scans); the latter group of patients were in the ICU. Please see raw data link for the spreadsheet of the patient data. Table 1 . Sample demographics and biomarker levels (bold indicates significance). We age-matched COVID-19 (mean age: 53.1 y) and healthy individuals (mean age: 55.6 y) (p = 0.6; data normally distributed and analysis done using unpaired t-test). Oxygen saturation was low in COVID-19 patients 94.6% (91-96%). Oxygen saturation of healthy individuals are usually between 97% and 100%. COVID-19 patients also have significantly raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum ferritin levels (see Table 1 ). Figure 1A -F show the representative fluorescent microscope micrographs of healthy and COVID-19 samples stained with PAC-1 (green fluorescence-activated GPIIb/IIIa) and CD62P-PE (purple fluorescence-platelet surface P-selectin). Control platelets are typically small, round cellular entities with only a few pseudopodia extending from their surfaces. Platelets from COVID-19 patients showed extensive platelet hyperactivation; in some instances, severe aggregation and spreading were seen ( Figure 1B -F).Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, and *** = p < 0.001). Data is represented as either mean ± standard deviation or median (Q1-Q3). CRP: C-reactive protein, COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019, R: reaction time, α: alpha, MA: maximal amplitude, MRTG: maximum rate of thrombus generation, TMRTG: time to maximum rate of thrombus generation, and TTG: total thrombus generation.We age-matched COVID-19 (mean age: 53.1 y) and healthy individuals (mean age: 55.6 y) (p = 0.6; data normally distributed and analysis done using unpaired t-test).

Figure 1A -F show the representative fluorescent microscope micrographs of healthy and COVID-19 samples stained with PAC-1 (green fluorescence-activated GPIIb/IIIa) and CD62P-PE (purple fluorescence-platelet surface P-selectin).

Platelets from COVID-19 patients showed extensive platelet hyperactivation; in some instances, severe aggregation and spreading were seen ( Figure 1B Figure 2A ,B shows scanning electron micrographs from healthy erythrocytes ( Figure 2A ) and platelets ( Figure 2B ), while Figure 3A -H show platelets from COVID-19 patients. Results from SEM analysis support the fluorescence microscopy results seen in Figure 1 , where severe platelet pathologies (spreading and clumping) were visualized with PAC-1 and CD62P-PE. Extensive hyperactivation and clumping were noted in the platelet ultrastructure ( Figure 3A ,B), with platelet membrane damage, where the membranes are fragmented and granular, were also seen ( Figure 3C -H: yellow arrows). We propose that the significant platelet pathophysiology seen in both Figures 1 and 3 suggest that the sP-selectin, which we would expect to be in circulation, may either be bound to receptors on platelets (and other blood cells, including possibly also endothelial cells) or P-selectin may still be present on the platelet membrane where it acts as a binding receptor, facilitating binding between adjacent platelets, red blood cells (RBCs), and also, endothelial cells. This explains the significantly lower sP-selectin values that we report here in Table 1 and confirms the results from Goshua and coworkers in 2020 [16] . Figures 4 and 5 show the erythrocyte and platelet interactions in COVID-19-positive whole-blood (WB) samples. Figure 5A ,C,E shows low magnification micrographs of the platelet-erythrocyte interactions, while the corresponding micrographs in the right column ( Figure 5B ,D,F) are higher magnification micrographs of the same erythrocyte and platelet to show the ultrastructure of the interactions. In control WB smears, healthy erythrocytes have a typical discoid shape, and platelets are small, round cellular elements that will show slight pseudopodia formations due to contact activation in the glass coverslip on which the WB samples are placed, as seen in Figure 2A ,B. In WB samples from COVID-19 patients, minimal erythrocytes show slight eryptotic changes, where the cells do not have the typical discoid shape ( Figure 4A ,B,D). Hyperactivated platelet and erythrocyte interactions frequently occur in WB smears, where both the erythrocyte and the platelet membranes are fused with each other. Such fusions between membranes can be facilitated by P-selectin when present on the platelet membrane. When on the platelet membrane, P-selectin is known to act as adhesion receptor, where it promotes platelet-platelet, platelet-endothelial cells, or platelet-erythrocyte adhesions [14, 39] . Figure 2A ,B shows scanning electron micrographs from healthy erythrocytes ( Figure 2A ) and platelets ( Figure 2B ), while Figure 3A -H show platelets from COVID-19 patients.

We propose that the significant platelet pathophysiology seen in both Figures 1  and 3 suggest that the sP-selectin, which we would expect to be in circulation, may either be bound to receptors on platelets (and other blood cells, including possibly also endothelial cells) or P-selectin may still be present on the platelet membrane where it acts as a binding receptor, facilitating binding between adjacent platelets, red blood cells (RBCs), and also, endothelial cells. This explains the significantly lower sP-selectin values that we report here in Table 1 and confirms the results from Goshua and coworkers in 2020 [16] . Figures 4 and 5 show the erythrocyte and platelet interactions in COVID-19-positive wholeblood (WB) samples. Figure 5A ,C,E shows low magnification micrographs of the platelet-erythrocyte interactions, while the corresponding micrographs in the right column ( Figure 5B ,D,F) are higher magnification micrographs of the same erythrocyte and platelet to show the ultrastructure of the interactions. In control WB smears, healthy erythrocytes have a typical discoid shape, and platelets are small, round cellular elements that will show slight pseudopodia formations due to contact activation in the glass coverslip on which the WB samples are placed, as seen in Figure 2A ,B. In WB samples from COVID-19 patients, minimal erythrocytes show slight eryptotic changes, where the cells do not have the typical discoid shape ( Figure 4A ,B,D). Hyperactivated platelet and erythrocyte interactions frequently occur in WB smears, where both the erythrocyte and the platelet membranes are fused with each other. Such fusions between membranes can be facilitated by P-selectin when present on the platelet membrane. When on the platelet membrane, P-selectin is known to act as adhesion receptor, where it promotes platelet-platelet, platelet-endothelial cells, or plateleterythrocyte adhesions [14, 39] . Figure 6A ,D indicates representative WB smears from COVID-19 patients that show the extent of the spontaneously formed fibrin(ogen) deposits. Figure 6E -H are micrographs to show how, in some instances, the fibrin(ogen) deposits aggregate to erythrocytes. We previously reported that spontaneous clotlets are present in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) of COVID-19 patients and that these clotlets have an amyloid structure, as shown using the fluorescent stain ThT [14] . Here, we show these deposits with SEM micrographs, where we find these amyloid deposits in a WB smear (without the addition of thrombin). In healthy individuals, only erythrocytes and platelets will be present in such a smear. However, in COVID-19 patients, clotlets are visible as both fiber-like and, in some instances, granular deposits (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6A ,D indicates representative WB smears from COVID-19 patients that show the extent of the spontaneously formed fibrin(ogen) deposits. Figure 6E -H are micrographs to show how, in some instances, the fibrin(ogen) deposits aggregate to erythrocytes. We previously reported that spontaneous clotlets are present in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) of COVID-19 patients and that these clotlets have an amyloid structure, as shown using the fluorescent stain ThT [14] . Here, we show these deposits with SEM micrographs, where we find these amyloid deposits in a WB smear (without the addition of thrombin). In healthy individuals, only erythrocytes and platelets will be present in such a smear. However, in COVID-19 patients, clotlets are visible as both fiber-like and, in some instances, granular deposits (see Figure 6 ).Viscoelasticity and viscometry were also done on PPP samples to determine if the fibrin(ogen) deposits noted in the scanning electron micrographs may indeed affect the clotting parameters, as well as the viscosity of the blood. These results are shown in Table 1 . Plasma from COVID-19 patients were significantly more viscous than that of healthy individuals (p = 0.02) when measured with the viscometer. Similarly, the TEG ® results indicated that the plasma from COVID-19 patients were significantly hypercoagulable compared to healthy plasma. Three TEG ® parameters that were significantly increased confirmed the clotting pathology. The parameters include the maximal amplitude (MA), which reflects the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot, as well as the overall stability of the clot. The larger the MA, the more hypercoagulable/stronger the clot. The total thrombus generation (TTG) parameter, indicative of clot strength, and the amount of total resistance (to movements of the cup and pin) generated during clot formation were also significantly increased. In addition, the time parameter, the maximum rate of thrombus generation (MRTG), was also significantly decreased in COVID-19 plasma. MRTG is an indication of the maximum rate of the clot growth. These parameters point to a hypercoagulable clot pathology in COVID-19 patients and confirm our previous results, as well as underscore the ultrastructural changes noted in WB smears [17] . Viscoelasticity and viscometry were also done on PPP samples to determine if the fibrin(ogen) deposits noted in the scanning electron micrographs may indeed affect the clotting parameters, as well as the viscosity of the blood. These results are shown in Table 1 . Plasma from COVID-19 patients were significantly more viscous than that of healthy individuals (p = 0.02) when measured with the viscometer. Similarly, the TEG ® results indicated that the plasma from COVID-19 patients were significantly hypercoagulable compared to healthy plasma.

These parameters point to a hypercoagulable clot pathology in COVID-19 patients and confirm our previous results, as well as underscore the ultrastructural changes noted in WB smears [17] . In this current COVID-19 pandemic, the race for answers of how this virus interacts with the body is one of the crucial research questions that need to be answered to obtain a clearer image of how the virus works, as well as make it possible to find treatment regimens that can assist in a COVID-19 patient's survival. In our current research, it comes as no surprise that serum ferritin levels are increased in COVID-19 blood samples, as it is known as a marker of damaged cells [31] . Its presence in the circulation may cause pathology to platelet erythrocytes, as well as the plasma protein fibrinogen [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Iron can also leak into the circulation due to cellular damage to not only erythrocytes but, also, endothelial and other cells. Both iron and serum ferritin may result in the Fenton reaction that may drive oxidative stress in circulation [29, 31, 40] . Central to COVID-19 pathology is a decreased oxygen saturation, and this was also noted in our COVID-19 sample, and oxidative stress may be a fundamental driver of this clinical parameter. The increase in the CRP levels further confirms the increased inflammatory conditions (hypercoagulability and activated platelets) in COVID-19 patients, as CRP is an acute marker of inflammation but, also, plays a role in the acute-phase immune response in the body [41] .An interesting observation was that the COVID-19 individuals have a decreased P-selectin concentration compared to our control sample (see Table 1 ). Our COVID-19 concentrations are broadly comparable to those found by [16] (our median concentration was 17.4 ng·mL −1 vs. results from two COVID-19 patient groups of the Goshua et al. paper, which were 15.9 ng·mL −1 and 11.2 ng·mL −1 , respectively). However, our sP-selectin concentrations in controls were much higher: 26.7 ng·mL −1 and, rather, compared well to that of the results of the ELISA assay kit insert (Goshua et al. paper) that reported a control mean of detectable concentrations (ng·mL −1 ) of 25.8 ng·mL −1 for citrate plasma analysis [42] . Our ELISA assay kit control ranges are considered to be 15 ng·mL −1 to 55 ng·mL −1 (personal communication FineTest Technical Department). Our sample of COVID-19 patients showed extensive platelet pathophysiology, as seen with fluorescent microscopy, as well as SEM analysis. P-selectin may be present in various parts of the blood fraction, either inside platelets and endothelial cells, as a binding receptor on platelet membranes, or as sP-selectin in circulation, where it may act as a biomarker that can activate receptors on either platelets or other cells (including the endothelial cells). We report extensive P-selectin signals on platelets from COVID-19 patients and, therefore, suggest that one reason might be because P-selectin is still present as an adhesion receptor attached to the platelet membrane, where it assists in platelet aggregation. Another reason may be that P-selectin was shed as sP-selectin but that it is now bound to receptors on activated platelets (and other cells where it has receptors, e.g., endothelial cells). This will result in a decrease of sP-selectin but explains the significant signal present on large platelet aggregates and, also, on microparticles, which are visible both with the SEM, as well as the fluorescent microscope. Manne and coworkers suggested that COVID-19 is associated with platelet hyper-reactivity, which may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology [28] , and our results support their findings. SEM also revealed a noteworthy presence of spontaneous fiber-like clotlet deposits in the WB smears, with the occasional granular deposits on the erythrocyte membranes. Previously, we reported that platelet-poor plasma of COVID-19 patients had a significantly increased amount of amyloid clotlets [17] . Our TEG ® and viscometry results also showed that our COVID-19 samples were significantly hypercoagulable and more viscous than that of healthy PPP. The various plasma proteins and their effects on blood clotting and viscosity, together with the presence of the noteworthy activated and aggregated platelets-that is, the cause of platelets and erythrocytes to form aggregates in WB may be the direct cause of vascular pathologies noted in the lungs of COVID-19 patients [14, 17] .Prior to sample collection, consent was obtained from all participants. The Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of Stellenbosch University approved the study (reference number: 9521). This laboratory study was carried out in strict adherence to the International Declaration of Helsinki, South African Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), Ethical Guidelines for Research.Thirty-seven COVID-19-positive samples (18 males and 19 females) were obtained, and blood samples collected before treatment was embarked upon. Sample analyses that were included in this paper were on treatment-naïve COVID-19 patients. Whole-blood (WB) samples were collected from newly diagnosed patients before treatment, and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were also prepared by centrifuging samples at 3000× g for 15 min. Platelet-poor plasma was stored at −80 • C until necessary for analysis (ELISA, thromboelastography, and viscometry); then, the PPP was allowed to thaw until it reached room temperature. The WB samples were prepared on the same day for fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy analyses.Our healthy PPP samples were 13 age-matched controls (5 males and 8 females) previously collected and stored in our plasma repository. They were nonsmokers, with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels within normal ranges, and none were on any anti-inflammatory medication.Two fluorescent antibodies, CD62P (platelet surface P-selectin) and PAC-1 (activated GP IIb/IIIa), were added to WB to study platelet activation [43] . CD62P is found on the membrane of platelets and the move to the surface of the platelet membrane. This translocation happens after platelet P-selectin is released from the cellular granules during platelet activation. The antibody PAC-1 detects the neoepitope of active GPIIb/IIIa. PAC-1 antibody binding is correlated with platelet activation.We added 4 µL of PAC-1 (FITC-conjugated) (340507, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 4 µL CD62P (PE-conjugated) (IM1759U, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) to 20-µL WB and incubated the samples for 30 min (protected from light) at room temperature. A 10-µL drop of blood was then placed on a microscope slide, and a coverslip was then placed on the drop of blood. Following preparation, the samples were viewed using a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 fluorescent microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Munich, Germany). For the PAC-1 marker, the excitation wavelength was set at 450 to 488 nm and the emission at 499 to 529 nm, while the excitation for the CD62P was 540 to 570 nm and the emission 577 to 607 nm. Unstained samples were also prepared with COVID-19 WB to assess any interference from autofluorescence.Whole-blood samples were also prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis to assess ultrastructural changes of the erythrocytes and platelets. Ten-microliter WB was placed on a 10-mm round glass coverslip and exposed to 0.075-M sodium potassium phosphate buffer (PBS). Standard SEM preparation steps were followed, including fixing in 4% formaldehyde and a secondary fixation of the sample in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ). Dehydration steps in an increasing series of ethanol was followed, with the final step, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The samples were coated with carbon and viewed with a Zeiss MERLIN field emission-SEM with the InLens detector using 1 kV (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Munich, Germany).We analyzed soluble P-selectin concentrations in PPP samples of 10 control and 30 COVID-19 samples using the EH3818 Human sSELP (soluble P-Selectin) ELISA Kit (FineTest, Wuhan, China).Serum ferritin and CRP concentrations were measured at the PathCare pathology laboratory in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa. CRP was measured on the AU480 Beckman Coulter machine (Brea, CA, USA) and serum ferritin on the DXI Beckman Coulter machine (Brea, CA, USA). CRP data was cross-checked using a VPLEX multiplex assay (Vascular Injury Panel (V-plex) 2 (human) kits, catalogue number: K15198D, Meso Scale Discover (MSD), Rockville, MD, USA).TEG ® was performed to assess the clot kinetics and viscoelastic properties of PPP samples from COVID-19 patients (n = 7) and healthy control subjects (n = 10). Samples were prepared by the addition of 20-µL 0.2-M calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) (7003, Haemonetics ® , Niles, IL, USA) to a disposable TEG ® cup (HAEM 6211, Haemonetics ® , Niles, IL, USA), followed by the addition of 340 µL of citrated PPP. CaCl 2 was added to reverse the anticoagulant action of sodium citrate (recalcification of blood) and, consequently, activate the coagulation cascade. Samples were loaded in the measuring channels of the TEG ® 5000 Hemostasis Analyzer System (07-033, Haemonetics ® , Niles, IL, USA), and analyses were performed at 37 • C. TEG ® parameters measured included the reaction time (R, minutes), alpha-angle (α, degrees), maximum amplitude (MA, mm), maximum rate of thrombus generation (MRTG, dynes/cm 2 /s), time to maximum rate of thrombus generation (TMRTG, minutes), and total thrombus generation (TTG, dynes/cm 2 ) (see Table 2 for the various parameters of this method). The maximum velocity of clot growth observed or maximum rate of thrombus generation using G, where G is the elastic modulus strength of the thrombus in dynes per cm −2 .Time to maximum rate of thrombus generation (TMRTG) measured in minutesThe time interval observed before the maximum speed of the clot growth.Total thrombus generation (TTG) measured in Dyn·cm −2The clot strength: the amount of total resistance (to movement of the cup and pin) generated during clot formation. This is the total area under the velocity curve during clot growth, representing the amount of clot strength generated during clot growth.Plasma viscosity was measured with the RheoSense microVISC™ (RheoSense Inc., San Ramon, CA, USA) viscometer, which uses viscometer/rheometer On-a-Chip (VROC ® ) microfluidic sensor technology. Prior to analysis, stored PPP aliquots from SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 7) and healthy control subjects (n = 10) were thawed form −80 • C to room temperature (~19 • C). Between each measurement, the microviscometer was cleaned with 1% Scienceware ® Aquet ® liquid detergent solution (Z273260, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in order to maintain stable viscosity measurements. Plasma viscosity was calculated according to Newton's law of viscosity:where µ = viscosity, τ = shear stress, and γapp = apparent shear rate.Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 8 (version 8.4.3, San Diego, CA, USA). The Shapiro-Wilks normality test was done on all data. Parametric datasets were analyzed using an unpaired t-test, and the data expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Nonparametric data sets were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and the unpaired nonparametric data (all two-tailed) were expressed as medians (Q1-Q3). Raw data of the results can be viewed at the following link: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgoCOmY3bkKHisVGQ63lwdCsZBlimA?e=4lWhlw.Although progressive respiratory failure is seen as a primary cause of death in COVID-19 patients, respiratory failure may be significantly linked to microclots in the circulation and, specifically, in the lungs. Relevant molecular players, particularly P-selectin, may be important early markers of severe vascular disease risk, particularly if soluble P-selectin levels are decreased, as we noted in our results. In addition, the observation of structural changes in the plasma, where microclots and large platelet aggregates are visible, may also lead to important point-of-care analyses that may assist clinicians to plan clinical interventions relating to anticoagulation therapies. Although a high-end fluorescence microscope was used in this research, less expensive fluorescence microscopes may be used as a quick-point point-of-care method. Consequently, fluorescence microscopy, together with thromboelastrography and viscometry, might provide clinicians with critical information in real time about the functioning of platelets and plasma-clotting proteins. COVID-19 is, therefore, a true vascular disease, and treating it as such should form an essential part of a clinical therapeutic regime.

Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) remain one of the most efficacious vector control measure available against malaria [5, 6] and its use has highly increased in sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal coverage in the populations at risk through mass distribution campaigns (with one net for every two people) [7] . The big challenge to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCPs) is to reach and sustain this high coverage rate.The NMCP of Benin has adopted a policy of mass distribution since 2011, on a triennial basis, considering the lifespan of ITNs, as previously evaluated in the country [8] , and as recommended by the WHO [9] [10] [11] [12] . The 4th mass distribution campaign took place in 2020 and has been digitized. The purpose of using digital tools for theMalaria Journal *Correspondence: rockypremier@yahoo.fr 1 Programme Nationale de Lutte Contre Le Paludisme (PNLP), Cotonou, Benin Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 2020 ITN campaign was to collect more accurate data on the size of the population, and evaluate the speed in data collection during the campaign, as far as household enumeration and ITNs distribution phases are concerned.In addition, during the campaign process, between the enumeration phase and that of the distribution itself, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and Benin also recorded its first cases. Recognizing the heavy toll that malaria exacts on vulnerable populations in Africa region, the WHO recommended continuing with the implementation of malaria control interventions, such as ITNs and indoor residual spraying campaign. On this basis, the Government of Benin, through the Ministry of Health and the NMCP, decided to continue with the implementation of the distribution campaign. For this, it was necessary to revise the initial distribution protocol and take precautionary measures in order to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during distribution.This report describes the implementation process of the 2020 ITN mass distribution campaign in Benin. The specific objectives are: (i) to describe the planning process; (ii) to describe the changes and adaptations that occurred during the distribution, due to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic; (iii) to share outcome, challenges and lessons learned from the mass distribution campaign.Benin's population is estimated at 12,114,193 inhabitants in 2020 [13] . The country is divided into 77 communes grouped into 34 health zones and 12 departments (Fig. 1 ). Malaria is endemic in all parts of country with seasonal variations. All of Benin's population is at risk of malaria infection, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of the disease in 2018 was 18.5% in the general population with 1,755,597 confirmed cases of malaria in public health facilities and almost 2,251 deaths due to malaria, most of which are in children under 5 years [14] .As far as the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic is concerned, Benin recorded its first official case on March 19, 2020 after the enumeration phase. On the eve of the distribution phase, there were 26 official cases with one death. Just after the distribution phase, 64 cases and one death were officially reported. As of November 05, 2020, there are a total of 2781 cases and 43 deaths.Catholic Relief Services (CRS) gave support to the Government of Benin and the NMCP in digitizing the 2020 ITNs mass campaign. CRS commenced its work with planning and capacity building sessions with NMCP staff.There was training of campaign staff on the use of digital tools and over 27,000 participants at these sessions were digitally-tracked using their biometrics as a mean of validating their attendance to each training session. The digital platform is the Cash-and-Asset Transfer Platform (CAT). A total of 3,382 smartphones and 350 solar chargers were used to perform a household enumeration to register households within the country to obtain a robust population database. It consists during the enumeration phase to collect using smartphones, household information (size, name, gender and age of household members), and then a coupon was assigned to the head of household with a unique Quick Response (QR) Code. The same digital platform was used to track distribution of ITNs and verify that all households registered received the correct number of ITNs allocated to them. The data collected on CAT was available through an online dashboard, updated in real time, allowing field supervisors to make important decisions effectively, and efficiently tracking household coverage rates as households missed were identified using sequencing and geospatial analytical dashboards easily accessible for field supervisors. Figure 2 shows the different sections and the implementation process of ITNs mass distribution campaign.Macro-planning consisted in quantifying the number of ITNs required to achieve universal coverage according to the 2020 population projection data. In addition, the strategies for the household enumeration as well as for the ITNs distribution were designed.After the macro, the protocol of the campaign was written in great detail. This protocol was then validated by all stakeholders and consisted henceforth the campaign roadmap.A comprehensive micro-plan for the 2020 mass distribution was developed, which contains a rigorous gap analysis and the procurement plans as well as all details on campaign processes and a roadmap. The roles and responsibilities of actors at different levels of the health pyramid (central, department, health zone (HZ), and commune) have been clearly described.A total of 8,609,873 ITNs were procured for this campaign for the whole country. All the ITNs used for the distribution campaign were manufactured in Asia (China At the department warehouses, quality assurance was conducted prior to distribution. Samples of ITNs from different batches were sent to Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou, for physical and chemical analyses, such as stress analysis, insecticide content, fabric weight, netting, mesh size. A total of 837 ITNs were tested. All the samples conformed to the WHO procurement and use of ITN for malaria control requirements. Two days before the distribution phase, net were convoyed to each village leader.In order to create equal understanding among actors at different levels of the health pyramid on the campaign implementation strategies, training was organized in a cascade manner at central, department and district levels [15] . In each department, separate micro-planning workshops and training of trainers (ToT) sessions on implementation took place to train the health zone and district coordination groups. Significant adaptations were required for the training of the distribution supervisors and teams in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgency to get ITNs into households through the revised distribution strategy. Therefore, the following precautions have been taken:-Training was adapted to take place over three hours with a maximum of 18 people per class. -Hygiene and safety measures were put in place (hand washing facilities, physical distancing, scanning of trainees' badges rather than fingerprinting, health check). -Rooms were cleaned thoroughly before and after every session. -Content for the shortened training sessions was revised to include door-to-door distribution techniques, with the use of smartphones, and hygiene measures emphasizing the importance of keeping at least one metre physical distance from any other person. -Audiovisual files and the electronic version of the distribution guide were shared with the distributors at the end of the training to enable them to review the content of the training once at home. -Whatsapp groups have been created between trainers and distributors to facilitate exchanges after training.Household enumeration was conducted by volunteers who had at least a grade 7 at secondary school. Each enumerator team was made up of two people. The first person was equipped with a smartphone to record the household's informations. The second person delivered to the household a voucher for ITNs in the form of coupon with a Quick Response (QR) code (Fig. 3) , which is the unique identifier of the household. The coupon is then later exchanged for the corresponding number of ITNs in the distribution phase during which, the coupon once scanned, generates all the household informations . The enumerator teams finally delivered key messages on malaria and the importance of sleeping under a ITN. The teams then progressed from house to house so as to cover all the households in the geographical area assigned to them, and had to register 60 households in rural areas against 70 in urban areas per day over a period of 16 days.The campaign was spread out in two phases. As it was the first time that Benin implemented a digital ITNs campaign, a pilot phase at the scale of a health zone was organized as a prelude to the national phase in order to understand the difficulties and constraints related to the use of digital tools.Pilot phase: fixed distribution strategy The initial approach was a fixed distribution strategy. During the pilot phase, which has implemented in one health zone (Abomey-Calavi/Sô-Ava) in the Atlantic department, ITNs distribution was done at fixed sites at the village level at a public place chosen for this purpose. Each household presented their coupon in exchange for ITNs. The number of ITNs to be allocated per household was displayed by the smartphone once the coupon has been scanned. The distribution teams involved in the distribution phase (planned for 4 continuous days, with 2 days extra) were composed of four fixed agents (Fig. 4) .National phase: door-to-door distribution During the nationwide phase, between the enumeration phase and the distribution phase, the COVID-19 outbreak occurred. Fixed distribution approach was not suited to this context. It became, therefore, necessary to revise the distribution approach. Thus, the distribution protocol was revised into a door-to-door distribution approach. By this approach, a distribution team directly delivered ITNs to recipients at their homes. The number of distribution team members remained the same, however their roles have been revised to adapt to the new distribution approach (Figs. 5, 6 ).External monitoring was carried out by an external firm during the household enumeration. A rapid monitoring was carried out using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS). All of 77 communes were monitored. Monitoring results were shared at time with the actors and supervisors, in order to return to complete enumeration in low coverage areas.At the national monitor and district supervisor levels, planned field-based activities were reduced in scale. A daily scrutiny of the distribution data uploaded from the smartphones and a virtual meeting each evening allowed supervisors and monitors to focus on problem areas and challenges that could then be addressed and resolved. At the local level, supervisors focused on ensuring that distribution teams adhered to the covid-19 safety measures, as well as ensuring planning and management of the daily team movement plans. Their responsibility included checking the health of distribution team members each day and not allowing them to continue if they showed any covid-19-like symptoms. As yet, results of the local supervision have not been thoroughly analyzed, although He gives a demonstration on how the net should be hung. anecdotally, it seems that it was quite a challenge for distribution teams to adhere closely to the distancing regulations. In addition, a whatsapp group has been created at the national level, which integrates the actors at different levels in order to resolve the difficulties and situations during the distribution.The plan for communication included radio and television slots, town announcers and advocacy at every level. Advocacy meetings were completed in advance of the household registration phase, engaging leaders for the entirety of the campaign process. In advance of implementation of the revised strategy, messages were modified slightly to inform about the change of strategy, the new dates and the measures being taken to prevent transmission of COVID-19. As well as radio, television and town announcers, mobile messaging and audio call messages (for the less literate) were used. Community leaders were involved in local mobilization and were asked to be alert to any miscommunication that they heard about ITNs or COVID-19, and to report these to the community supervisor. Following the distribution, communication reinforced the messages passed to households by the distribution teams, i.e. proper airing of new ITNs, use of ITNs, hanging techniques and measures to prevent COVID-19.A total of 3,175,773 households were registered (more 9.3% from projection) corresponding to a total of 14,423,998 persons (13.55% more from projection) ( Table 1 ). The real ITNs needs are, therefore, known after the enumeration. It was after the household enumeration that ITNs were conveyed to the villages.Of the 8,609,873 ITNs procured, 7,652,166 were distributed through mass distribution to the beneficiaries. The balance from the procurement was kept to be used for routine distribution. A total of 3,240,259 households were served in the whole country, which corresponds to 93.35% of enumerated households. Moreover, 94.16% (which corresponds to a total of 13,581,637 people) of enumerated population received ITNs during the distribution phase ( Table 2 ).The 2020, ITNs mass distribution campaign in Benin had interesting features. Not only was distribution digitized for first time in Benin, but also this distribution has to be implemented in the particular context of the COVID-19 pandemic.The benefit of digitizing the ITNs distribution campaign is obvious. It enabled accurate and efficient implementation phases of the campaign. It also improved the speed in data collection and monitoring as far as household enumeration and ITNs distribution are concerned. The use of the digital tools and dashboards enable field teams and supervisors to review the distribution data, reports and maps generated each day from any location in real time as prompt monitoring and supervision feedbacks were shared by overseeing supervisors via WhatsApp and other communication tools. The digital platform was also used to send key malaria messages in funder (Global Fund) and the NMCP for timely decision-making to avoid delays -Rapid problem-solving (for example, sourcing of COVID-19 protective materials for campaign workers) by the NMCP with support from the Ministry of Health and partners -Flexibility in modifying procurement procedures to minimize delays in the campaign implementation -Use of an electronic system for data collection that facilitated a ""no touch"" approach during the ITN distribution and payment of campaign workers.The results of this campaign showed that the enumerated population was greater than the projection (13.55% more). However, since net quantification had been made with a buffer (30% security stock), this increase did not have an impact on the quantity required to ensure universal access. The door-to-door distribution of ITNs to households provided an acceptable distribution coverage rate (94.16%) and offered an opportunity for demonstrating net-hanging and face-to-face health education on ITNs use and ways of reducing net wear and tear [16] . The door-to-door delivery approach was greatly appreciated by the population. Fixed point distribution was used during the pilot phase, but this approach was not suited in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of compliance with barrier measures. A multi-country comparison of ITN delivery strategies based on 14 surveys from five African countries did not find a significant association between delivery strategy and ownership of a net from the campaign [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .Despite the satisfactory results of the 2020 ITNs campaign, some key challenges deserve to be shared:-Change in distribution protocol: the first challenge was the need to change the distribution protocol (door-to-door approach instead of the fixed distribution previously planned) while campaign was already underway. The initial protocol was, therefore, quickly revised by a technical team. -Challenges with COVID-19 protection materials:given the spread of the pandemic, additional materials had to be ordered with short notice and delivery time. The biggest challenge was related to the avail- ability of personal protection equipment (PPE) in sufficient quantities on time, particularly masks. -Challenges with payment of the people involved in the distribution (the 'actors'). At the end of the each activity phase digital timesheets were generated from the system that was used to enable the efficient payment of staff for the number of days work as registered on the system using the unique QR code provided for each staff, to validate their presence in the field for each day's activities. However, as payment has be done through mobile money account, incorrect phone numbers and unreported team replacements affected the on-time payment of some of the actors. -Availably of supervision teams: the same supervision teams were sometimes involved in other response activities against COVID-19. -Budget implications: changes to the budget were made quickly in line with the new door-to-door strategy, taking into account Benin's specific geographic and logistical context and available human resources. Given the urgency of the COVID-19 situation and remaining funds in the country's grant, the Global Fund was able rapidly to approve the amendments. Important modifications included the necessary increase in days for community mobilization, briefings and training, supervision and distribution as well as for purchase of PPE.ITNs mass campaigns are a major intervention for malaria prevention and also for other arthropod-borne diseases, such as dengue, filariasis and viral infections [22, 23] . The burden imputable to malaria is heavily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa where cases associated with COVID-19 are increasing [24] . Although COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to response measures limiting usual programmatic activities, it is important to continue to prevent malaria by adapting control activities to the context of the pandemic. Recent modelling study showed that the interruption of planned ITNs campaigns due to COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria.Benin has implemented the digitalized mass distribution campaign of ITN in the particular context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the many challenges of its implementation, the campaign was successfully implemented and contributed to increasing household ownership and population access to ITNs and, therefore, contributes to the achievement of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 goals. High political commitment, engagement and support add to the financial and technical supports from partners were essential factors for this success.","Benin","abstract","2020-11-25","11"

The responsible causative agent for COVID-19 was identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] . As of now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) around 25 million laboratoryconfirmed cases have been reported worldwide and more than 800,000 of deaths resulting in a fatality rate of 3.2% [2] .European countries and the United States of America have become the epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [3] . In the majority of cases, COVID-19 is either asymptomatic or causing only minor clinical symptoms; however, in patients with medical preconditions, the fatality rates are alarming [4, 5] . As of now, no success is seen in the front of having a specific therapeutic drug or prophylactic vaccine. The current approach to treat COVID-19 relies on the the use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . To quickly address the unmet medical needs, in silico approaches can accelerate drug discovery and development, and can be a complementary method for the classical screening and identification of specific drugs against COVID-19 [12, 13] . Taking the advantage of the main protease (M pro ) structure that became available recently [14] , we carried out a virtual in silico screening of nearly 5000 ZINC compound database to identify new inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2.The M pro (PDB ID: 6LU7) structure of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from protein data bank (PDB) (https://www. rcsb.org/) [14] . The active site prediction was performed using Computed Atlas for Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) (https://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/index.html?201l).The ZINC database [15] was used, and a set of 5000 public-available compounds were downloaded in.mol2 format. The predicted active sites from CASTp were then used for molecular simulations, which were performed by using MtiOpenScreen [16] , a virtual screening online server-based on AutoDock Vina. The grid box was created based on predicted active site residues using MtiOpenScreen [16] option that allows selecting the docking grid based on specific residues.To explore more the interaction between our target and top-ranked ligands, we used Ligplot? [17] . This tool allows analyzing the ligand-receptor interactions by plotting hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (also known as ADME) evaluation has been applied to investigate the pharmacological activity of the compound. The characterization of ADME and Toxicity was performed based on the SWISS ADME server (https://www. swissadme.ch). The rules of Lipinski, Ghose, and Veber applied to predict drug-likeness following molecular weight, LogP, HBD, and number of HPA parameters.The M pro plays a pivotal role in the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 and thus becomes a apposite drug target [14] . It forms a homodimer of two chains A and B, which are complexed to a native ligand (Fig. 1a) . The active site pockets resulted from CASTp has shown that potential site to be localized between THR24, 26, PHE140, ASN142, GLY143, CYS145, HIS163, 164, 172, and GLU166 residues positions in the chain A of the SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b) .The 5000 compounds from the ZINC database were docked using Autodock Vina. Table 1 and supplementary  table 1 show the top 20 compounds with binding energies ranging from -7 to -6 kcal/mol of chain A active site of M pro (Supplementary figure 1) .The docking simulations showed, by a ranking of binding energies score, that compound 2-[2-(2- Fig. 1 Structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease M pro . a Schematic presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome organization. b The 3D of M pro structure. The strand structure is represented in blue and the helix is red. The predicted binding site is represented in green aminoacetyl)aminoacetyl]amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamide (ZINC000004762511) has the best predicted binding energy of -7 kcal/mol. The interaction between the top-ranked hits, according to its docking score and SARS-CoV-2 M pro , has been explored using ligplot? [16] . The data showed that ZINC000004762511 has Asn151, Thr111, Asp153, Gln110, and Ser158 residues interact with ligand through hydrogen bonding, and Ile106, Thr292, Phe294, and Val104 have a hydrophobic binding (Figs. 2a,  3a) . The ZINC000004762511 compound is known as glycylglycyl-L-tyrosinamide, and until to date has not yet been described to have antiviral efficacies.Moreover, we found that the 6 0 -fluoroaristeromycin (ZINC000001483267) has a score of -7 kcal/mol and ligand-interaction show that this compound has Asp289, Glu288, Lys5, Lys137, and Arg131 as hydrogen bonding residues and Thr198, Asp197, Thr199, and Glu290 residues forming hydrophobic binding) (Figs. 2b, 3a) . Important to note, it was reported that this compound is an inhibitor of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase [18] . Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the ZINC000005116916 compound has a lower binding energy of -6.1 kcal/mol (Figs. 2c, 3c) . It interacts through hydrophobic binding with Trp218, Leu220, Asn277, and Arg279 residues. In addition, hydrophobic binding interactions were formed by Leu271, Glu270, Asn274, and Phe219 residues. Furthermore, this compound is known as cyclo(L-histidyl-L-histidyl) and is a part of cyclic peptides that are reported to have a worthy biological function pertinent for the treatment of cardiovascular-related disease, cancer, and infectious diseases [19, 20] . In contrast, regarding other ranked compounds, no available data was published so far.Based on our computational strategy, the pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeness of the top 20 ranked scoring molecules that show the potential of M pro inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 are shown in supplementary table 1. As per the pharmacokinetic properties, most of the compounds showed low gastrointestinal absorption except six compounds that exhibit higher absorption. These Table 2 ), the results of our data recommend that majority of the compounds have no PAIN (pan-assay interference compounds) alerts; in other terms, none of the analyzed hits has reported having false-positive results in high-throughput screenings, and only three compounds have Brenk alerts, a filter determined based on a list of fragments to be putatively toxic [21] . In addition, most of the predicted compounds have shown no Lipinski's violations except five compounds (Supplementary Table 2 ). The prediction of pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties remain a powerful step in in silico drug design due to its capacity to orient and to help scientist to make a decision about which compound to test in vitro according to predicted models.In the absence of FDA-approved therapies, COVID-19 will continue to raise fatality rates. Several studies were initiated to discover new treatments or to repurpose know drugs quickly [9, 11, 22] . However, these treatments are now under clinical trial investigations [7, 23, [24] [25] [26] . We applied a computer-aided drug design to identify new SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors, and identified 20 new prospective inhibitors. Further in vitro and in vivo validations are required to show their efficacy as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. Residues colored in purple showing hydrogen bonding with residues.

Waffo Tchounga (Formal analysis) (Investigation) (Writing - original draft), P.Y. Sacre (Data curation) (Formal analysis) (Methodology) (Investigation) (Writing -review and editing) Composition analysis of falsified chloroquine phosphate samples seized during the COVID-19 pandemic","On 31 December 2019, a new coronavirus disease emerged from China and gradually spread, becoming a global pandemic. Thus, on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a state of public health emergency of international scope. Today, more than 45 million people have already been infected by this disease [1] [2] [3] [4] .The world is currently facing many challenges arising from this pandemic. Beyond the non-negligible economic consequences affecting governments and international trade in general, there are problems related to access and supply of high quality essential medicines and health products. Taking advantage of this opportunity, unscrupulous people are selling substandard and falsified medicines. According to some experts, this phenomenon constitutes a risk of a parallel pandemic to the COVID-19 pandemic [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .Substandard and falsified medicines have a negative impact not only in terms of public health, but also in socio-economic terms [5, 10, 11] . Aware of these risks, international organizations such as the WHO and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have drawn the attention of consumers, professionals and health authorities to the emergence of substandard or falsified vaccines, medicines, as well as falsified screening tests and laboratory reagents claiming to have COVID-19 disease prevention, detection and treatment properties [12, 13] .Falsifiers who are indeed criminal gangs are always on the lookout for such situations that could provide them large profit margins no matter the impact on human lives. They take advantage of the scarcity of medicines and health products to infiltrate both the formal and informal markets [11] .Thus, a few time after the very controversial announcement of the treatment of COVID-19 disease with chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate [14, 15] , WHO has brought to the public's attention cases of falsified chloroquine in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Niger, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and France, thanks to the effectiveness of its Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS). A previous publication, at the origin of the WHO alert, showed about five falsified tableted chloroquine samples collected in Cameroon and DRC using thin layer chromatography (GPHF Minilab) as a screening method [16] [17] [18] .After the alert launched by the WHO, the Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry laboratory of the University of Liege was contacted in the frame of its WHO prequalification to carry out tests on seized samples of chloroquine medicines suspected of being falsified.In the 1950s, resistance to this long-used molecule against malaria was observed in most areas of high malaria endemicity, leading to a change in treatment [19, 20] . Among the phenomena increasing this resistance, falsification plays a non-negligible role. Indeed, it has been observed in Cameroon a phenomenon of resistance that was supposedly linked to falsified chloroquine tablets [21] . Several studies have highlighted the presence of poor-quality chloroquine on the African pharmaceutical market [22] [23] [24] [25] .In recent years, special attention has been paid to vibrational spectroscopy methods (mainly Raman and near infrared spectroscopies) for the detection of falsified medicines. They have many advantages compared to conventional methods used to control the quality of medicines because of their non-destructive nature (no sample preparation is required), absence of consumable (no use of solvents) and speed [26, 27] . Time is indeed an important factor in the detection of falsified medicines to reduce its impact on the population [28] . However, once confirmed falsified, further laboratory analyses must be undertaken to measure the risk to which the population is exposed.Our study is focused on eight suspect samples: four from Yaoundé and Douala in Cameroon, one from Kinshasa in DRC, and three from Niamey in Niger. These suspect chloroquine samples were seized by local authorities as being part of the WHO alert list.For the analysis of these suspect samples, we have adopted an analysis strategy based on two types of methods: screening phase using handheld Raman spectrophotometer and a confirmatory analysis to obtain information on the qualitative composition of both organic and inorganic chemicals of the seized samples [29, 30] . HPLC-UV was used to obtain quantitative information of the identified active pharmaceutical ingredients and a screening LC-MS method was used to confirm the hyperspectral imaging results.The suspect chloroquine samples were all in tablets dosage form. They are described in Table I . Some samples were contained in blisters, some in boxes and some were unpackaged. The samples, once seized, were sent by courier service to the author's laboratory. Once received, they were stored at room temperature before analysis.Handheld Raman analyses were performed using a TruScan RM spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The acquisition parameters were automatically selected by the device. When available, ten tablets were analyzed per sample. Otherwise, all tablets were analyzed.The tablets were scanned directly either through the blister (when samples were inside a blister, samples F-G) or out of the blister (when samples were without blisters, samples A-E). Spectra were preprocessed by the Savitzky-Golay first derivative (window size: 15, polynomial order 2) before comparison with the database over the spectral range 463-1853 cm -1 using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The database used throughout the study for Raman spectra comparison (Truscan or Raman imaging spectra) is a homemade database containing 165 API and excipients.Before being analyzed by Raman imaging, tablets were glued on a microscope slide and their surface was milled using a Leica EM Rapid milling system equipped with a tungsten carbide miller (Leica Microsystems GmbH).Raman hyperspectral imaging experiments were performed on a Labram HR Evolution (Horiba scientific) equipped with an EMCCD detector (1600×200-pixel sensor) (Andor Technology Ltd.), a Leica 50x Fluotar LWD objective and a 785 nm laser with a power of 45mW at sample (XTRA II single frequency diode laser, Toptica Photonics AG).A mapping of 150 x 150 pixels per sample was performed and the spectra were then analyzed by Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Square (MCR-ALS) in order to find the pure spectra of the constituents as well as their spatial distribution. The Raman data were corrected by an Asymmetric Least Square baseline correction (p: 1×10 −5 , λ: 3×10 4 ). The pre-processed data were first compared to the laboratory database.Following the first comparison, the data were analyzed by MCR-ALS. Three MCR-ALS models were successively computed with 10, 30 and 50 components respectively. Non-negativity on concentration J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and spectra were used as constraints. The different resolved spectra were then preprocessed by the Savitzky-Golay first derivative (window size: 15, polynomial order 2) before comparison with the database over the spectral range 463-1853 cm -1 using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient of one corresponds to a perfect correlation. The identification of chloroquine phosphate was confirmed by a second comparison in the 810 -1160 cm-1 spectral range. Indeed, chloroquine phosphate presented very good discrimination towards chloroquine sulfate (correlation coefficient of 0.30) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (correlation coefficient of 0.17) in this spectral range (see Figure S9 ).The total analysis time was about 16 h per sample.Raman imaging was used to detect as much compounds as possible (both organic and inorganic) in order to obtain a composition of the sample as complete as possible.Assays were performed on a HPLC system comprising a Waters 2695 separation module coupled to a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector from Waters Corporation (Eschborn, Germany). The HPLC methods are detailed in tables S1, S2 and S3 in supplementary data. The double information of retention times and UV spectra of detected peaks allowed a formal identification of the active ingredients of the different samples compared to reference substances.A screening confirmatory LC-MS analysis of the samples was performed. The LC-MS equipment was composed of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific) with an MS detector Amazon Speed ETD (Bruker). The details of the LC-MS method are given in table S4.Samples A, B, C and D from Cameroon and samples F, G and H from Niger correspond to the WHO 04/2020 alert samples from these two countries. The samples came from both the informal sector (B, C, D, F, G, H) and the formal sector (A and E). See photos in supplementary data S1 -S8.Samples A, C and D have the same reported manufacturing laboratories and lot numbers as samples I, II, IV and V collected by Gnegel et al [18] . Sample D in particular has the same information (manufacturer's laboratory, lot number, date of manufacture and expiry date) as sample V from Gnegel et al [18] , but with differences in the declared active ingredient content (100 and 250mg respectively).Not all samples from Niger included information on the manufacturing laboratories. For sample H, the secondary packaging did not have a lot number but the inscription ""See on Blister"". On the blisters, this information was not readable, thus highlighting the product traceability problem in medicines falsification.As in the study by Gnegel et al [18] , these suspect samples came from both the formal and informal sectors.Considering the results in Table 2 , in samples A, B, C and D from Cameroon, metronidazole and starch were identified as the major constituents with correlation coefficient > 0.5 (See table S5 for detailed Truscan results). The spectra were overlaid with reference Raman spectra of chemicals from the database. As one can see, handheld Raman spectra have a rather low signal to noise (SNR) ratio due to the high fluorescence background (see Fig 1A) . This low SNR implies that the detection of the pharmaceutical ingredient is sometimes difficult or may be hindered by a stronger signal by a main constituent. This finding may be seen in Table S5 when looking at the results obtained for different tablets of a sample. Nevertheless, this first screening step enabled the confirmation of falsification of samples A -E because of the presence of a wrong API. Samples F -H were considered as suspicious since the signal of chloroquine phosphate was very small or undetectable.Raman imaging confirmed the presence of metronidazole in samples A -D together with excipients such as starch, magnesium stearate, calcium carbonate, talc, and calcium phosphate. In addition, sample B showed the presence of paracetamol and chloramphenicol and sample D contained paracetamol (see table 2 ). Paracetamol and chloramphenicol were present at trace amount since they are present in a very few number of pixels of the chemical images (see Figure 4A ) In sample E, handheld Raman spectroscopy identified paracetamol. Hyperspectral imaging confirmed this result with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. It also revealed the presence of excipients such as sodium benzoate and microcrystalline cellulose. HPLC assay confirmed these results with a paracetamol content of 255.72mg per tablet. LC-MS also identified the presence of chloroquine (in trace amounts), chloramphenicol and aspartame. These compounds were not detected by Raman imaging possibly because of the high fluorescence background and high Raman scattering character of paracetamol possibly masking the signal of trace level API's [31] . However, the probable heterogeneity among tablets may also explain the discrepancies between the LC-UV, LC-MS and Raman experiments.For samples F and G, the TruScan identified only starch. In sample H, the presence of calcium carbonate was detected. However, the presence of chloroquine may be confirmed when looking at the specific spectral range 1300 -1800 cm -1 with an average correlation coefficient of 0.84 (see Fig  3b and Table S5 ).Raman imaging results showed the presence of chloroquine phosphate in samples F, G and H with correlation coefficients of 0.95, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. The spectra were tested against chloroquine sulfate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the spectral range 810 -1160 cm -1 to ensure the identification of chloroquine phosphate salt.The fact that the handheld Raman spectrometer detected the presence of chloroquine only in sample H can be explained by the fact that in sample F and G, chloroquine phosphate was present only in small quantities with a content. Indeed, HPLC-UV estimated the contents at 2.4mg and 20.2 mg per tablet respectively.The presence of paracetamol in sample G was demonstrated by hyperspectral Raman imaging (see Fig 4B) , which was not the case by LC-UV or LC-MS. On the other hand, LC-UV results revealed the presence of paracetamol in sample H, which was not detected by handheld Raman spectroscopy, hyperspectral Raman imaging or LC-MS demonstrating the heterogeneity of falsified samples.Trace amounts of adulterating APIs in samples B, D, E G and H indicate contamination problems certainly resulting from the production of previous batches. This situation highlights the noncompliance with good manufacturing practices.Metronidazole and paracetamol have certainly been used as a substitute for chloroquine as stated by Gnegel et al to mimic its bitter taste [18] . Concerning sample E from DRC where chloroquine was substituted with paracetamol, the falsifiers certainly targeted its analgesic and antipyretic properties that could calm the pain and fever that are part of the symptoms of COVID-19 disease and malaria.Metronidazole levels are very low with amounts below 17 mg per tablet in samples A, B, C and D. Also in samples F and G, chloroquine levels are very low (2.4mg and 20.2mg per tablet respectively). These very low levels of active ingredients are prone to contribute to the emergence of antimalarial resistance problems [32] .Raman spectroscopy has been preferred to near-infrared spectroscopy because of the highly resolved spectra enabling a fast comparison with a pure compound spectral database [33] [34] [35] . In addition, Raman hyperspectral imaging has the advantage to give a deep insight in organic and inorganic compound composition of the tablets, making it possible to highlight the presence of substances likely to be toxic without a priori knowledge. However, this technique is long making it complicated to analyze several tablets per sample diminishing the representativity of the analysis. In addition, it suffers from the limitations of Raman spectroscopy such as fluorescence and low signal intensity possibly making difficult the analysis of some colored or degraded formulations.Falsified samples of chloroquine phosphate seized by Cameroon, DRC and Niger during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. In six samples, we noted the lack of chloroquine and its substitution by metronidazole (at sub-therapeutic levels) or paracetamol. In two samples, chloroquine phosphate was detected but at very low levels. In one sample, the chloroquine phosphate content was in conformity with the declared content. In addition to the major APIs present in the tablets, trace levels of paracetamol and chloramphenicol were detected in four and two samples respectively.Non-compliance with good manufacturing practices and low levels of active ingredients reflect the desire from the falsifiers to make a profit without worrying about the unfortunate consequences that may happen to those who have consumed their product. This also demonstrates the speed with which falsifiers adapt their production to actual demand such as the chloroquine phosphate in the COVID-19 context. It appears that rather than producing new products with the correct API, falsifiers prefer to print new labels for their old bad quality products increasing their profits.In the frame of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for specific products (allegedly treating the disease) may increase rapidly at a global scale. This constitute an opportunity for criminal groups and unscrupulous sellers to sell substandard and falsified medicines. In this context, the application of rapid, easy-to-use techniques such as Raman spectroscopy should make it possible to combat efficiently the resurgence of poor-quality medicines. However, handheld devices are not sensitive enough to detect trace level contaminants or low-dosed active ingredients.

The first reported case was in mainland China, City of Wuhan, Hubei on the 29th of December 2019 (Li et al., 2020) . Subsequently the disease spread at an exponential rate to countries in contact with China resulting to World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020 (WHO Africa, 2020). As of 31st May 2020 there were over six million infections globally, with the European region taking lead in these infections (WHO, 2020c) . In Africa, the first case was reported in Egypt then followed by Algeria J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 (WHO, 2020a). The first Kenyan case was reported on the 13th of March and by 31st May 2020 there were about 1,900 confirmed cases, with Nairobi and Mombasa taking the lead in these infections (MoH-Kenya, 2020) . There are mainly three kinds of infections; asymptomatic, pre-asymptomatic and symptomatic. The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between after exposure to the virus and symptoms onset, is on average 5-6 days, however it can be as high as 14 days. For COVID-19 symptomatic case, the disease manifests itself through symptoms such as fever, coughs, sneezes and headaches, whereas for asymptomatic case the infected individual does not develop symptoms (WHO, 2020b) . The basic reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infectious individual in a population where everyone is susceptible (Li et al., 2020) , is affected by the rate of contacts in the host population, the probability of transmission during contact and the duration of infectiousness. It can also vary for different age bands since the attack rates are age-dependent. The basic reproduction number for COVID-19 in Kenya ranges from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44-2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17) (Brand et al., 2020) . Reduction of the reproduction number can definitely be achieved by instituting appropriate Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) or use of a vaccine.In the absence of a vaccine, social/physical distancing strategies have globally become the most appropriate Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) (Ferguson et al., 2020) These mitigations can be implemented by reducing social contacts in workplaces, schools, markets and other public areas. Social contacts are influenced by age structure of the population and the frequency of contacts across population (Prem et al., 2017) . Mathematical models that describe the impact of the NPIs in reducing morbidity, infection peak sizes, and excess mortality are vital in public-health planning (Singh & Adhikari, 2020) . In their first step towards developing a credible model for COVID-19 dynamics in Kenya, the authors of this paper studied the impact of social distancing and contaminated environment in the article (Mwalili et al., 2020) . The current study presents an improved model with the aim of predicting the possible trajectory of COVID-19 infections in Kenya.Similar to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Kenyan government has imposed travel restrictions across counties, dusk-to-dawn curfew and school closure to ensure social distancing in the population and consequently slowed transmission of COVID-19. Although it is not clear for how long these measures should be in place to eradicate the epidemic in Kenya, we state that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could potentially lead to a new peak of infections. However, intermittent application of the interventions can flatten the infections curve (Prem et al., 2020) . Previous study of COVID-19 in Kenya also predicted the risk of epidemic rebound after the social distancing measures are lifted (Brand et al., 2020) .In this study, an age-structured SEIR mathematical model that examines the impact of NPIs in curbing COVID-19 severity and deaths in Kenya is developed, with the aim of achieving the following; (i) assessing the impact of reducing social contacts in different age-groups, (ii) examining the trend in infections during and after the NPIs, (iii) providing plausible period for lifting the NPIs. We postulate that this study can form a basis for policy formulation to enable Kenya delay the disease transmission and eventually flatten the epidemic curve.The Kenya population is split into the four broad age groups (KNBS, 2019): those below 15 years, 15-29 years, 30-59 years, and above 59 years. These are denoted by subscript 1, 2,3, 4 i = respectively. Each population of age group i is classified as either susceptible i S ,The sum of the compartments i N gives the size of the population in age group i .(1)The exposed i E compartment represents the individuals infected with coronavirus but are not yet infectious, since the virus is in incubation stage. The asymptomatic i A compartment has those individuals who are infectious, but do not exhibit the disease symptoms. The mild i M compartment has infectious individuals who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19, but their condition does not require hospitalization. The severe i H compartment has infected individuals who need to be hospitalized so as to manage their condition better. Finally, the critical i C compartment contains infected individuals whose situation is much worse as compared to a severe case; in that they are required to be in intensive care unit. The susceptible individuals are exposed/infected through contact with infectious individuals from any of the age-groups. After the disease incubation period, exposed individuals progress into either the asymptomatic or mild compartment. Infectious individuals who are asymptomatic, are assumed to recover over time whereas the mild cases either recover or progress to the severe compartment. Depending on the disease severity, the individuals in i H either recover or become critically ill. These critical cases, now in i C either die or their condition improves to a severe case, no longer requiring ventilation.The dynamics of the epidemic in our age-structured model is governed by the flow diagram in Figure 1 . The flow diagram yields the following model equations:Description of the age-dependent model parameters are presented in the Table 1 . Human-human transmission of coronavirus depends on whom one is in contact with and where. The place of contact could be at home, school, work, or within the community e.g. markets, restaurants etc. Therefore, we assume the susceptible individuals will acquire the virus when they come into contact with an infectious individual, and express the rate of infections and 2, ( ) i t β as follows:ij C denotes contact matrices and describe the interactions between the considered age-group i with other age-groups j . The constants 1 β and 2 β represent the likelihood of infection upon contact, and based on the basic reproduction number for COVID-19. The parameter denotes the proportion of mild (symptomatic) infectives who selfisolate to minimize their contacts, which is a control measure encouraged by the health experts during the coronavirus pandemic.Contact matrix ij C comprises of contacts at home ( ) H , workplace ( ) W , school ( ) S and other (0) contact which is not happening at home, work or in school. Therefore, we express ij C as follows:matrix for 1, 2,3, 4 i = is expressed as where for instance the home contact follows:(6) such that the matrix elements range between 0 and 1; with value 0 implying no contact and value 1 implying maximum contact. During the coronavirus epidemic the contact patterns are definitely not the same as compared to the no epidemic times (Prem et al., 2020) .The mixing of different age-group populations has been incorporated in our model equations through contact matrices, ( ) ij C which are used in (4). The goal of social distancing measures is to reduce individuals' contacts in schools, workplaces, and the general community. These measures are imposed at different times and remain in place for a given duration. In order to implement the control measures adequately by specifying when the measure was started and for how long it will be in place, as well as its effectiveness in reducing contacts, we introduce J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the following time-dependent control, a similar approach is found in (Singh & Adhikari, 2020) : (7) where on t and off t are respectively the day of imposing and lifting the control measure. w t is a shape parameter whereas the constant e is chosen such that the desired reduction in contact is achieved. When ( ) 0 u t = it implies zero contacts, as is the case with closure of schools, and when ( ) 1 u t = it means no mitigation measure is in place. We apply this function to the non-household contact matrices as follows: (8) where the constant 1 H u ≤ captures the fact that in the absence of ""stay at home"" measures, adults and school-going children will spend less time at home, hence less interactions in homes. In this study, we assume 0.75 H u = for the unmitigated scenario so as to reflect the less interactions at home and let 1 H u = for restricted movement, in which people are advised to stay at home.Using (8) in (4) enables us to implement the interventions of school closure, dusk-to-dawn curfew, and movement restriction independently and at the precise time they were instituted. The dusk-to-dawn curfew is whereby the Kenyan government imposed a national wide curfew requiring the citizens to be at home by 7:00 p.m. and should only leave their homes after 5:00 a.m. The term movement restriction implies the partial lock down of travel in/out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties that the government imposed on 7th April, 2020. Closure of schools yields a 100% reduction in the school contacts, as such ( ) S S ij u t C will be a matrix of zeros since ( ) 0 S u t = . We assume that imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew and restricting movement in and out of hotspots reduces the social mixing in workplaces and in other places (besides home, school, and work) by 35% and 45% respectively. Then we choose e such that 0 ( ( )) ( ( )) 0.65 W min u t min u t = = for the curfew, and 0 ( ( )) ( ( )) 0.55 W min u t min u t = = for the restricted movement. Using these minimum values to scale down the non-household contact matrices, we obtain the contact patterns depicted in Figure 2 . The actual contact matrices for Kenya were unavailable to the authors, so we produced synthetic contact matrices guided by (Prem et al., 2017) and (Prem et al., 2020) by approximating the mean number of contact per day from the matrices in (Prem et al., 2017) , normalizing and adjusting accordingly to best reflect the Kenyan situation. Panels (A), (B), and (C) depicts the contacts at workplaces between working ageJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 groups. Panel (B) show a 35% reduction in contacts at work due to the time constraints brought about by the dusk-to-dawn curfew, in which the working hours are reduced to allow individuals get home before dusk.When the movement restriction is instituted for non-essential services, whereby people are not allowed to travel in and out of certain regions, we see much less contacts at work in panel (C). Panels (D), (E), and (F) show contacts which are dominant along the diagonal and in age groups less than 50 years. These contacts are happening in places that are not work, school or home. Therefore, they constitute contacts in marketplaces, entertainment places, or other social gatherings such as weddings. Hence the mixing is highly assortative and is likely to bring into contact individuals of same age groups but from distant regions. Therefore, it is imperative to control interactions in this category of contacts, otherwise the epidemic would spread very fast in the communities. As shown in panels (E) and (F), the social distancing measures imposed on 0 ij C through (7) are effective in minimizing these contacts by 35% and 45% respectively. In Africa, majority of the population is generally less than 35 years, and often in contact with children and their (grand)parents as indicated by the main diagonal and off-diagonals in panels (G), (H), and (I). Noting that ministry of health is advising people to stay at home, we postulate that imposing the curfew and movement restriction increases home contacts by 12.5% and 25% respectively, as shown in panels (H) and (I).To show the impact of the highlighted measures in Kenya, we present results for daily and cumulative infections, severe and critical cases, deaths, as well as peak demand for hospital and ICU beds. The simulation was done for a one year starting from 13th March, 2020, but we present results for up to December, 2020 since the evolution of the epidemic after this period is subject to uncertainties. To initialize the simulation, we assumed 1 (0) 1 A = , 3 N , and 4 N are respectively obtained as 39% , 28% , 28% , and 5% of 6 4.76 10 × , Kenya's total population. The parameter values used are presented in Table 1 . For the unmitigated scenario we assumed 0 2.5 R = , which is within the range in the study (Brand et al., 2020) , of COVID-19 in Kenya. The transmissions of infection were obtained from (3) and ( We assumed the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals to be 33% while the symptomatic individuals to be 67%. Finally, we assume that 30% of confirmed symptomatic individuals will self-isolate to reduce their contact with susceptible population i.e. 30% α = . This control measure is uniform across all the agegroups and assumed part of Kenya's mitigation efforts alongside the school closure, curfew and travel restrictions. .The simulation results are depicted in Figure 3 and Table 2. In Figure 3 , the duration of school closure is indicated by cyan shaded region and is overlapped by the duration of implementing the dusk-to-dawn curfew indicated by yellow shaded region. The gray shaded region indicate duration of implementing travel restriction across counties. The interventions begin at different days but they all end at the same day, as shown by the light-gray region for the 60-days mitigation and darker-gray for the 190-day mitigation. The social distancing measure lasting for 60 days resulted to a delay of the epidemic peak for about 2 months compared to the unmitigated situation which peaked within 52-55 days. The 45% reduction in contacts for 60 days resulted to between 11.5-13% reduction of cumulative infections. When the social distancing measures were in place for 190 days the epidemic peak was delayed for about 5 months compared to the unmitigated scenario. Also, the 45% reduction in contacts for the 190 days resulted to between 18.8-22.7% reduction of cumulative infections.The peak of infections in the 60-days mitigation is higher and happens about 2 months after the mitigation is relaxed as compared to that of the 190-days mitigation, which happens a month after mitigation is relaxed. This is due to insufficient herd-immunity since the infections are quite suppressed during the 60 days as compared to significant presence of infections for the 190-days mitigation before the measures are relaxed, as shown in Figure 3 . Also shown is a notable rise in infections after the interventions are lifted. However, due to herd-immunity and the depletion of susceptible in the population the rise in infections is not sustained.From Table 2 we show the age dependence in the simulated cases and peaks. In all the cases presented in the table, the numbers for those under 15 years are low. This is the age group with a high number of asymptomatic infections, which are more likely to remain undetected. High number of cases are reported for the 15-29 years and 30-59 years age bands since majority of individuals in these age bands have wider interaction spheres (outside of schools and home), and they form a significant percentage of Kenya population. The considered mitigation periods yielded reductions in the key health outputs, although applying the mitigation for entire simulation time of 365 days would have resulted into more significant reductions. However, in reality the population might not withstand the long-term imposing of dusk-to-dawn curfew and travel restrictions. The high numbers of severe and critical cases translate to high demands for hospital and ICU beds, and also deaths. In the 190-day mitigation in Table 2 there is an increase in hospital and ICU beds peak demands which is likely due to the notable rise in infections after the measures have been relaxed, as shown in Figure 3 .The overall and symptomatic attack rates are presented in Table 2 and they exhibit agedependency. The younger population have lower attack rates (and lower epidemic peak sizes) as compared to the older population whereby those older than 59 years have the highest overall attack rate, as well as the highest symptomatic attack rate. This result shows the agedependency of exposed individuals progressing to symptomatic cases. The 190-days mitigation period reduces the attack rates and subsequently flattens the epidemic curve. However, imposing these stringent measures for a prolonged period has adverse effects on the socio-economics of the country. The dependency of the attack rates on age underscores the variability of 0 R across the age bands (van Zandvoort et al., 2020). Figure 2 : Effect of social distancing strategies on synthetic contact matrices for Kenya population. In the unmitigated scenario, there will be maximum contacts in workplaces and other locations (excluding home, schools and workplace). This results to less contacts at home. The dusk-to-dawn curfew results to a 35% reduction in contacts at workplaces and other locations, but assumed to increase the home contacts. The movement restriction yields a 45% reduction in contacts at workplaces and other locations, but presumed to increase the home contacts by 25%. The dependency of COVID-19 transmissions, severity and deaths on age is crucial to the design of social distancing measures and projection of the expected disease burden in the country. Indeed, the considered interventions do not completely avert the epidemic, but they significantly slow down the transmissions and reduce the infection peak sizes, and deaths. We note that if there is no self-isolation of symptomatic cases, the number of cases and deaths will increase, which will result to the peaks happening earlier in all cases. Prolonged implementation of social distancing measures will definitely resolve the epidemic; however, it will damage the country economically. It is not fully known how the epidemic would spread to various counties in Kenya, and how people in these counties will react to the NPIs. There is need for coordination and frequent exchange of information between modeling and surveillance groups in order to refine predictions of the epidemic trajectory.

The peak of infections, in days, and peaks of demands for hospital and ICU beds, and deaths are also shown. The table also shows age-specific overall (symptomatic) attack rates, which are calculated as the number of infections (symptomatic cases) over the total population of that age band ","Kenya","first author","2020-11-10","11"

Actually, in the beginning, 27 infections have been detected in China from Wuhan City (Ayittey et al., 2020) . On 30/01/2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic and alarmed about the public health emergency (World Health Organization et al., 2020) . This situation speeds up many countries to step into the research on how that virus can spread and be controlled. Experts also found that the virus could be transmitted person-to-person (Chan et al., 2020) . Consequently, face mask wearing and social distancing (Alice et al., n.d.) , home quarantine and confinement and sanitary cordon (Pan et al., 2020) , contact tracing (Hellewell et al., 2020) , travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) , and many other decisions have been set to decrease and control the spread of the pandemic.The spread of the first COVID-19 cases in the world has been imported from other countries Hellewell et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) . Besides, it has been found that human mobility can influence significantly the COVID-19 epidemic in China (Kraemer et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Especially, we think that the influence of means of transportation on the spread of COVID-19 in the world is quite possible. At the beginning of the pandemic, the airport of Wuhan did not stop any passenger flights (Bogoch et al., 2020b; Wilson and Chen, 2020) . Taking into account the global passenger air traffic network, it is easy to discover how unknown contagious diseases can be spread in the world (Wilson and Chen, 2020) . Actually, air transport contributed to the spread of many diseases in the world (Tatem et al., 2006; Colizza et al., 2006; MacFadden et al., 2015) . Moreover, some researchers also discovered that airline travel could influence the spread of viruses such as influenza (Grais et al., 2003; Brownstein et al., 2006; Hosseini et al., 2010) , Ebola , Zika (Bogoch et al., 2016) , and Dengue (Tian et al., 2017) . All those works support our hypothesis to think that the number of passengers from air traffic is related to the spread of the pandemic. Even while China was overcoming the peak, new infections were noted in other regions of the world with significant increases . Besides, there is also a recent similar work (Lau et al., 2020) that focused on the association between air traffic and the coronavirus outbreak,but the methods used were just about linear correlation. Many infected cases were imported from China to the other continents (Kim et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) . And we should recall that numerous countries did not strictly stop passenger air traffic while the virus was still infecting people.Considering the aforementioned points, we also notice that there is no scientific body of knowledge (with robust modeling process and crossvalidation) about the plausible influence of air transport on the spread of COVID-19. Besides, we also hypothesized in this study that passenger air traffic has a significant influence on the number of COVID-19 infections in the world. This results of this paper are going to be technical adding information with strong pieces of evidence to control the spread of the pandemic in the world. In this work, we used a data set of two variables such as aggregated global cases (GC) and worldwide recent data about passenger air traffic (PAT). The variables were accessed on 12/03/2020 and are from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and the latter has been downloaded from (World Bank, 2018) . GC is a count of the total confirmed cases in a country per day, and PAT count of the total passenger air traffic in 2018 (it is the very recent data set available) per country. The data cover the period from 23/01/2020 to 13/07/2020.The quality and accuracy of WHO data sets about COVID-19 are based on the developed technical guidance by topic (World Health Organization, 2020a) related to the virus. Every country is to respect all those processes, otherwise their data provided are not validated. Moreover, a confirmed case is a person that got laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, whatever the symptoms and clinical signs. The data sets about passenger air traffic are international and domestic aircraft passengers registered in countries and aggregated by the World Bank.The goal is to propose a model that uses predictors to approach the dependent variable and check whether there is significant influence or not. The variable of interest in this work is a counting variable (with zeros at some dates), that is, the total of confirmed cases GC, denoted by (y i ). Actually, to model counting variables, researchers use many approaches such as Poisson model (PM), quasi-Poisson model (QPM), Negative binomial model (NBM), zero-inflated models (ZIM) (Lambert, 1992) , and Hurdle models (HM) (Mullahy, 1986) . HM and ZIM both provide computation of a Bernoulli and Poisson probabilities and give flexibility to model a zero outcome. In addition, we are suspecting overdispersion because at the beginning of the pandemic there was great variability (disproportion among countries) in terms of total cases. Consequently, in the case of the current work, we will compute all the models without Hurdle ones because it is similar to the ZIM. In addition, in the context of COVID-19, we think that the zero case means the absence of the pandemic or the non detection in a given country. With Hurdle models, one of the hypotheses stipulates that zeros should be from only one point, and this does not fit our study.In Poisson regression model, the variance is assumed to be equal to the mean. Besides, in quasi-Poisson model, the variance is hypothesized to be the dispersion parameter times the mean (i.e., the variance is proportional to the mean). Be N i , X i , μ i that are, respectively, the number of total cases, the passenger air traffic, and the mean number of total cases in a given country i, we have:With that general modeling, we then have the following specificities:Such that θ is the dispersion parameter, α is the intercept, β is the influence of X on N, and b]ε i represents the error term. Let us note that PM is QPM with θ=1. When θ > 1, we state that there is over-dispersion relative to Poisson.We use the negative binomial regression model when we suspect overdispersion in the modeling. Actually, it is a generalization of PM that uses the assumption that the variance is a quadratic function of the mean. In other words, when the parameter λ of the PM follows the gamma distribution of parameter (r, ρ), we use NBM meaning a Poisson-gamma mixture. Thus, we have:PrSuch that Γ is the gamma function.In this work, we can notice that there is an excess of zeros cases in the beginning of the pandemic. It is a type of regression that researchers use to handle zero-inflated count data. ZIM use the mixing of a process (logistic regression in this study) that generates zeros and another one (PM, QPM, NBM) that models counts.With π i the probability to get zero in a country i, we have the following possible models:The checking of the influence of PAT on the spread of COVID-19 is a very crucial point that requires a very strong method before any final conclusion. Then, taking into account that we have daily case count per country and only a data of PAT representing the air traffic per country, we decided to check the significance influence of PAT on GC with every day of the data set. It means that we computed to check our findings 174 times for each model. In addition, to be sure about the goodness of fit of our models, we implemented cross-validation method. The summary of the process is on Fig. 1. The variable of interest is the number of cases per country in the world. The daily evolution of that pandemic is on Fig. 2 .The hypothesis in this work is that Air traffic has influenced the spread of COVID-19. Thus, we computed and illustrated the Pearson correlation between those two variables (daily cases and Passenger Air Traffic) on the study period (from 22/01/2020 to 13/07/2020). It is illustrated on Fig. 3 .The minimum value as Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.05 (from 01/ 03/2020 to 04/03/2020) and the maximum 0.94 (from 07/05/2020 to 25/ 05/2020) with a mean of 0.66. These results motivated us to deepen our analysis with the models for better understanding of the plausible daily influence of air traffic on COVID-19 spread.Let us recall that from 22/01/2020 to 09/04/2020 we have zeros cases in some countries. After that date, every country in our data set was with at least one case. These situations of many zeros (128 on 22/01/2020 and 1 on 09/04/2020) motivate us also to use zero-inflated models on the period with zeros. To interpret any model result, we did:• Firstly, after the initial computation of the models, we have noticed that PM, QPM, and NBM regressions converge (i.e. the algorithm gets the coefficient estimates such that the values become approximately the same with iteration), however, ZIP and ZINB did not (only a part of ZIP from 24/03/2020 to 09/04/2020 converged). According to our main objective, that is, to check the influence of air traffic on the spread of COVID-19, consequently, we cannot consider a model that does not converge because it does not allow to output the p-value to interpret the influence. • Secondly, we noticed that during the study period, all the four retained models (PM, QPM, and NBM about every day and ZIP only from 24/ 03/2020 to 09/04/2020) have p-values that are all smaller than 0.05 except QPM from 22/02/2020 to 17/03/2020. All the coefficients are near zero and consequently their exponential gives one. It means that our finding is robust whatever the model. When the air traffic increases of one unit, the number of cases in a country increases of one too.Though all the retained models (with significant p-value) give the same results, we can however have an idea on the variability among coefficients per model on Fig. 4 .Actually, we can notice that in the beginning, NBM tends to estimate higher coefficients and it is a result of higher influence when we use that model. After getting estimates with the train data sets, we computed the forecasts with the test data and with the root mean square error (RMSE), we output the best model. Moreover, in Table 1 , the column of best models considering p-values is the one taking into account the process to leave firstly models that did not converge before any choice. Meanwhile, the column of best models without considering p-values focuses on only best fitting without firstly checking any p-values but only the smallest RMSE in general after cross-validation. Especially, from Table 1 , we can notice that regardless of p-values, the best models when we have an excess of zero are the zero-inflated ones. And this is helpful because we were expecting the ZIM for the period with excess of zeros and due to convergence we did not choose them. In other words, if there was convergence, the best models for the period with zeros should be the ZIM. The principal target of this study is to check whether passenger air traffic had a significant influence on the number of COVID-19 infections with a robust process. In the results, we noticed that the higher passenger air traffic, the higher the number of infections. Our finding is quite similar to the one in the recent work (Lau et al., 2020) related to air traffic and the pandemic. Wuhan City is the town in which COVID-19 was firstly mentioned (Ayittey et al., 2020) and many other countries' first cases were imported. A recent study (Bogoch et al., 2020a) from Wuhan in China, found that commercial air travel can influence the international dissemination of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Even in the following work (Wilson and Chen, 2020) , the authors mentioned that travellers can give wings to COVID-19 too. In the beginning of the pandemic, all the countries did not rigorously stop passenger air traffic, and it explains the finding of this work because it allowed imported transmissions to trigger the local transmission. Many works (Grais et al., 2003; Brownstein et al., 2006; Hosseini et al., 2010; Bogoch et al., 2015 Bogoch et al., , 2016 Tian et al., 2017) have also mentioned that air traffic can facilitate a virus spread as in this study. When we also take into account spatial parameters with passenger mobility, we can understand that when a passenger traveled to a country, he is able to infect or to be infected. And once back to his country, the incidence of COVID-19 increases.In addition, the spatial concerns in this work are considered thanks to each country of the data set. Furthermore, the conclusion in this work is from the comparison and variability among all the countries affected by the pandemic. For instance, though Africa is predicted to be significantly affected by the pandemic (Lone and Ahmad, 2020) , according to our data, Africa is with the smallest passenger air traffic, and this also explains the small number of cases compared to other regions. Actually, this work outputs an explanation of how passenger air traffic contributes to the relative number of infections in each country. To control the pandemic, authorities should strictly stop Passenger Air Traffic to their countries, excepted emergencies. Once internal transmissions have been controlled, they can progressively open their air traffic and highly strengthen the screening tests for passengers. Passenger air traffic should be considered when there are contagious public health issues. Additionally, this work is the first one that computed 5 different models on 174 days with cross-validation to check how robust is the finding of Passenger Air Traffic on the spread of COVID-19 and proposed an appropriate model. This work is quite important for researchers in the domains of applied statistics, transportation, and public health.However, only QPM does not confirm the influence of air traffic on the number of cases of COVID-19 from 22/02/2020 to 17/03/2020. We can recall that WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11/03/2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). Consequently, the absence of influence in that period can be explained by the fact that countries were facing the pandemic crisis and might change significantly their daily air traffic. Even on Fig. 3 , we can notice that it is in the same period there are smaller correlation coefficients between the number of cases and air traffic passengers. This study has some limitations that are mostly related to the cross-sectional PAT data set. We think that daily time series data of PAT and COVID-19 cases will give stronger pieces of evidence. We also lack information about means of transportation of COVID-19 imported cases. Consequently, a research of those information (daily PAT time series and imported cases' means of transportation) will provide a deeper insight for the current work. None.

As of November 5, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports 44,012 deaths out of 1,838,867 diagnosed cases in the continent, for a case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.4%, compared to about 3% in the rest of the world 5 . However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics have been highly heterogeneous across different African countries in terms of timing and implemented interventions 6 .In sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia is second only to South Africa in terms of number of recorded cases and deaths, with an overall CFR of about 1.5% 5 . The first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 13, 2020 and, less than a month later, the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared a state of emergency in the country on April 8, 2020 7 . Since then, borders and school closure were implemented, public institutions and firms operated at minimum capacity or under complete closure, and people were advised to stay at home 8 . Despite these restrictions, several hundred cases have been reported in all the 12 regions of Ethiopia 9 . The possible spread of SARS-CoV-2 in rural areas of the country is especially dangerous because of the sparse presence of well-resourced health facilities implying long travel distances for remote populations, which is an important barrier to universal access to primary care 2 . Moreover, the healthcare workforce in Ethiopia is 5 times lower than the minimum threshold defined by the WHO for Sustainable Development Goals health targets 10 , and far below the African average 11 .Recent modeling studies investigated the impact of control measures, such as selfisolation and temporary lockdowns, in a number of sub-Saharan African countries, highlighting the difficulties in defining effective, feasible and sustainable strategies for suppression or mitigation of COVID-19 epidemics 12, 13, 14, 15 . In this work, we aim to assess how demographic factors and age-specific mixing patterns can influence COVID-19 burden in Ethiopia across different geographical contexts characterized by different levels of access to healthcare.Study design. Between November and December 2019, we conducted a survey based on individual interviews to estimate age-specific mixing patterns in four districts (woreda) of the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of the Oromia Region, Ethiopia. About 40% of the SWSZ population is below 15 years of age and about 68% lives in remote rural settlements, 18% in rural villages, and 14% in the largest town of the area (Woliso Town, 53,065 inhabitants). The districts targeted by our study encompass a population of 449,460 inhabitants and represent the main catchment area of the St. Luke Hospital located in Woliso Town, a well-resourced health facility acting as the referral hospital for the entire Zone 2 .The study consists in a cross-sectional survey with two-stage stratified random sampling by location and age group. The survey was conducted in eight different sites, choosing two neighborhoods (kebele) for each district under study, in such a way to capture contact patterns in areas characterized by different population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to the healthcare infrastructure. Three types of geographical contexts were considered: remote settlements (consisting of scattered subsistence farming settlements), rural villages (consisting of concentrated clusters of households served by a main road, and better access to main public services), and urban neighborhoods inside Woliso Town (significantly higher population density and full access to public services 16 ).For each site, a target sample size of 105 study participants was set on the basis of findings from previous contact surveys 17, 18 to provide the desired precision in the mean number of contacts (see Appendix S1). Households and study participants were randomly sampled using predefined quotas for each site, sex, and age group. A household was defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof and sharing the same kitchen on a daily basis. One individual per household was interviewed. If the study participant was a student, additional shorter interviews were performed to complement the data with information about close contacts occurring at school.Participants were asked to recall information on the frequency, location, type of social encounters from the day preceding their interview, providing the age (or age range when exact age was unknown) and their relationship for each listed contact. A contact was defined as an interaction between two individuals, either physical (when involving skin-to-skin contact), or non-physical (when involving a two-way conversation with five or more words in the physical presence of another person, but no skin-to-skin contact) 17, 18 . The participants' age, sex, education and occupational status were recorded along with details on their household composition. In the SWSZ, schools may host up to 100 students within a single class. To avoid inaccurate reporting of the number of school contacts, participants were only asked to count the total number of physical contacts they had at school in the previous day, without further details. Information on the age of students attending the targeted schools for different grades was also collected. Schools were regularly open during the survey period.Contact patterns and data analysis. For each type of geographical context, we computed the mean number of contacts reported by respondents after grouping by age (six 10-year age groups from 0 to 59 years and one age group for individuals aged 60 years or older) and by contact setting (households, schools, and the general community). Since for many study participants it was difficult to distinguish encounters occurred because of their job from other random contacts, all social interactions occurring outside family and schools were aggregated with contacts occurring in the general community. Age-specific contact matrices were computed considering both physical and non-physical contacts. Variability due to sampling of study participants was explored by computing 1,000 bootstrapped contact matrices, where each bootstrap consisted in sampling with replacement a number of interviews equal to the original sample size, choosing the age of the participant with probability proportional to the Ethiopian age distribution 19 . The proportions of the SWSZ population living in remote settlements, rural villages and in urban neighborhoods were used as sampling weights to compute an average contact matrix for the entire SWSZ. Full details about the study design, data collection and the analysis of contact patterns are provided in the Appendix S1.Transmission model. We simulated SARS-CoV-2 spread in the different geographical contexts of the SWSZ, using an age-structured SIR compartmental model with three consecutive stages of infectiousness, in such a way to reproduce a gamma-distributed generation time of mean 6.6 days 20 . The model was run separately for each geographical context, using estimates of the population age structure and of the age-specific contact matrix computed from survey data (see Appendix). Because school closure in all of Ethiopia was mandated much before the exponential growth of reported COVID-19 cases, we included only data on household and community contacts in the contact matrices. However, we included school contacts to estimate the theoretical SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential in the absence of a school closure mandate. We considered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection to vary with age. We adopted posterior distributions for the relative probability of developing infection upon effective exposure to an infectious case as previously estimated in Zhang et al. 19 , where the age-group 15-64 years is taken as a reference; an average relative susceptibility of 0.33 (95%CI: 0.24-0.47) was estimated for children under 15 years of age, and of 1.47 (95%CI: 1.16-2.06) for older adults (above 65 years) 19 . These estimates are aligned with other independent studies (reviewed in Viner et al. 21 ). We assumed the same infectiousness across individuals of different ages. Two separate sensitivity analyses were carried out assuming 1) homogeneous susceptibility by age; 2) a lower infectiousness of children (see Appendix).We estimated the SARS-CoV-2 net reproduction number from the curve of reported cases in Ethiopia during the phase of exponential growth 5, 22 (see Appendix). We then set a per-contact transmission rate in the model such that the reproduction number, calculated using the next-generation matrix approach 23 matches the obtained national estimate (see Appendix). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of a 20% increase or a 20% decrease of the reproduction number on COVID-19 burden.We computed projections of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, cases with respiratory symptoms or fever, and COVID-19 critical cases (either requiring mechanical ventilation or resulting in a fatal outcome), based on available estimates of the age-specific risks 24 .Social contact data. A total of 938 study participants were interviewed with 43% of them living in rural remote settlements, 35% in rural villages, and 22% from urban neighborhoods ( Table 1) . 227 participants were students, 22.9% of whom were between 5 and 9 years of age, 71.8% between 10 and 19 years, and 4.9% older. School attendance rates among the study participants aged 5-18 years was 67%, 80% and 77% in remote, rural and urban sites, respectively. The median class size ranged from 70 children per class in rural villages to 90 in remote settlements. Only 27% of our study participants reported travels outside their village in the last month; 87.3% reported they were never admitted to the local hospital (see Appendix S1). Table 1 . Characteristics of study participants.Age and sex were also recorded for all the 4,635 household members of the 938 study participants. The mean household size in remote settlements was 5.5 (95% CI: 5.3-5.7), significantly larger (Tukey test p<0.001) than in rural villages (4.6, 95% CI: 4.4-4.8) and in urban neighborhoods (4.4, 95%CI: 4.2-4.6), while no significant difference in the household size was found between the latter two settings (Tukey test p=0.48).Students reported 1,372 additional contacts in schools, resulting in a mean number of 6.07 (95%CI 4.98-7.16) daily physical contacts per child (median 3, range 0-50). There were limited differences in the mean number of school contacts across geographical contexts (6.31, 95%CI 4.13-8.50 in remote settlements; 5.70, 95%CI 4.19-7.21 in rural towns; 6.54, 95%CI 4.25-8.84 in urban neighborhoods). The analysis of contacts by age clearly shows that subjects below 30 years of age tend to interact mostly with individuals of similar age (assortative mixing). The highest contact rates were found between school aged children (10-19 years), young adults (20-39 years) and between children below 10 years and their parents ( Figure  1 , and Appendix). However, a marked intergenerational mixing both within households and in the community was found, especially in remote settlements.From the epidemic curve of reported cases, we estimated a net reproduction number R of 1.62 (95%CI 1.55-1.70) over approximately 6 weeks of exponential growth starting from May 1, 2020 when schools were closed in the entire country (see Appendix). We relied on this estimated of R to simulated COVID-19 epidemics in the SWSZ considering no school contacts. If school contacts are included, we estimate R to increase to 2.03 (95%CI 1.87-2.18, see Appendix), which is comparable, although slightly lower, than estimates of the basic reproduction number from other parts of the world 25,26,27,28 .Our simulation results show that, should schools remain closed for the entire duration of the epidemic and no other interventions enacted, between 10% and 15% of the overall population would have developed respiratory symptoms or fever because of COVID-19. The fraction of critical cases (requiring mechanical ventilation and/or resulting in a fatal outcome) is estimated to be between 0.29% and 0.41% of the overall population ( Figure 2 ). The highest prevalence of critical cases (between 4.2% and 5.4% on average) is expected within subjects aged 60 years or older. This age segment represents only about 5% of the total population in Ethiopia but is expected to represent 7 to 14% of symptomatic cases and 45% to 63% of all critical cases.Remote settlements are expected to suffer a higher overall burden of critical cases (0.40% of the total population, 95%CI: 0.37-0.41%) compared to rural villages (0.32%, 95%CI: 0.30-0.35%) and urban neighborhoods (0.31%, 95%CI 0.29-0.33%). This difference is explained by a higher proportion of the elderly in the population (Figure 3 ), but also by their higher number of daily contacts and the higher intergenerational mixing (Figure 1c ) compared to the other settings, which results in a higher attack rate of infections, symptomatic cases, and critical disease in this age group (Figure 2 ). Urban neighborhoods, where highest contact rates at younger ages were recorded, are expected to have the highest attack rate of infections (58.8%, 95%CI: 50.6-67.3) and symptomatic cases (13.4%, 95%CI: 11.8-15.0). However, since a large proportion of the overall number of infections (81.8%, 95%CI: 79.5-84.2) is concentrated on children and younger adults (up to 40 years of age), this does not result in a high overall proportion of critical disease. Finally, rural villages have lower attack rates among the elderly because of the significantly lower number of contacts reported by that age group in this geographical context (Figure 1f , Table  2 ).Our analysis explored the effect of demographics and social contact patterns on COVID-19 burden in the South West Shewa Zone of the Oromia region, Ethiopia. Data collected within an interview-based survey highlighted differences in demographic structure and in age-specific contacts between urban neighborhoods, rural villages, and remote settlements, and were used to inform an epidemic model simulating the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of the trajectory of COVID-19 cases observed in the country up to June 12, 2020, we estimated that between 3.1 and 4.0 patients per 1,000 inhabitants may experience critical disease (i.e., requiring mechanical ventilation and/or resulting in a fatal outcome) at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone. Considering the low availability and accessibility of healthcare, especially in remote and rural settlements, and the lack of intensive care units to treat critical patients 2,29 , it is possible that a large fraction of those cases would result in a fatal outcome, adding up to the already high background mortality rate in the region (estimated at about 6.4 per 1,000 per year 30 ).To properly interpret the results presented in our study, it is important to consider the following limitations. First, the target study population may be not representative of all Ethiopia, and in particular of epidemic patterns observed in highly urbanized areas such as the capital Addis Abeba. Second, the net reproduction number was estimated from national surveillance data 9 . This data reports cases aggregated at the country level and may suffer from a number of biases: it does not account for reporting delays; the growth over time in the number of cases may partly be ascribable to the increase in testing capacity; total cases represent the superimposition of different, asynchronous epidemics in multiple parts of the country, a majority of which coming from the highly urbanized Addis Abeba area 9 . However, we show that, assuming no restriction to school contacts, the reproduction number estimated by the model is in the range 1.87-2.18, just slightly lower than estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number from other countries 25,26,27,28 . Moreover, our conclusions remain robust when considering a 20% increase or a 20% decrease of the reproduction number. In this case, we estimated an attack rate of critical cases ranging from 0.24 to 0.37 for rural villages and from 0.34 to 0.42 for remote settlements (see Appendix). Third, the model lacks of spatial structure. The finding from the survey that about 97% of recorded contacts have occurred within the participant's neighborhood of residence (Table 2) suggests that local containment or confinement of COVID-19 outbreaks in rural regions of Ethiopia may be favored by low human mobility. On the other hand, the observation of a large number of cases in all regions of Ethiopia 9 may imply that a significant widespread diffusion of the epidemic, possibly sustained by a high fraction of asymptomatic infections (Figure 2 ), is already ongoing. Fourth, the role played by children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections is still poorly understood and highly debated 19, 35 . In the main analysis we assumed that the probability of transmission is homogeneous across all ages; however, an alternative assumption in which children are assumed half as infectious as adults would result in similar attack rates of critical cases (see Appendix S1). These results are also robust with respect to the assumption of a homogeneous susceptibility across age groups (see Appendix S1). Finally, in absence of direct data from sub-Saharan Africa, the age-specific susceptibility and proportions of infections resulting in symptomatic cases or critical disease were estimated from data from China or Europe 19, 24 . However, the high prevalence of comorbidities which are uncommon in higher income countries (e.g., malnutrition 36 , tuberculosis, and malaria) and inequalities in the access to primary care represent additional vulnerabilities for African settings 2 and may result in an underestimation of the expected disease burden. Further studies are warranted regarding the severity of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan populations, and especially in relation to its understudied potential interaction with specific comorbidities.The study was approved by the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. Written informed consent was sought for literate individuals aged 18 years or more, and from a parent or carer for younger individuals. In addition, assent was sought from all participants under 18 years of age, illiterate participants and participants who cannot read in the Oromyffa language. A written confirmation of verbal assent by a witness elected by the study participant was sought.Data analysed during this study will be included in this published article as supplementary information files.MA has received research funding from Seqirus.

As of 18 July 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 13.9 million confirmed cases globally and nearly 600 000 deaths due to the virus [3] . Although Asia, Europe and America remain the most affected continents, the disease has spread to 216 countries so far, including those in Africa [3] .In Africa, the first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported on 27 February 2020 [3] . Within 1 month, nearly 3000 cases and more than 400 deaths were registered [3] . As of mid-July 2020, the total number of cases had reached half a million with 20 000 deaths [3] . By then, among most affected African countries included South Africa (337 594 confirmed cases and 4804 deaths), Egypt (86 474 confirmed cases and 4188 deaths), Nigeria (35 454 confirmed cases and 772 deaths) and Ghana (26 572 confirmed cases and 144 deaths) [3] [4] [5] . In some African countries such as Burundi, however, the pandemic seemed to progress at a much slower pace as compared to the worldwide trends.Burundi, a country located astride Eastern and Central Africa, announced the first two COVID-19 confirmed cases on 31 March 2020. Following the announcement, there has been a slow but continuous upward trend in the number of new infections reported in the country [6] . Figure 1 shows that new COVID-19 confirmed cases increased from 2 to 191 individuals within a period of 3 months. However, until late July 2020, only one COVID-19-related death had been officially reported earlier on 13 April 2020 [7, 8] . In this country, uncertainty about the real COVID-19 situation remains.Our study sought to understand the place of COVID-19 on hospital-based deaths in Burundi as of May 2020. Specifically, the study aimed to detect the existence of a difference in crude hospital-based death rates by comparing two periods before and during the pandemic (January to May 2019 vs. January to May 2020). Furthermore, by comparing results between periods, the study sought to seize the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 symptoms or any of the underlying health conditions associated with COVID-19 mortality [9] [10] [11] .We employed a cross-sectional comparative study using two different time periods: January to May 2019 (period before the COVID-19 pandemic) and January to May 2020 (period during the COVID-19 pandemic). The study was conducted in Kamenge Medical Teaching Hospital which is a tertiary hospital of the University of Burundi. Based on the socio-demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 mortality worldwide, the study used data from internal medicine and intense care unit where the vast majority of COVID-19 patients are admitted [12, 13] . In total, 351 deaths of which 181 occurred between January and May 2019 and 170 between the same period in 2020 were included in the analysis.Data were collected using hospital records. We collected the crude numbers of hospital admissions and deaths monthly in each study period as summarised in Table 1 . For each registered death, we collected socio-demographic information including age, sex, weight, height, pregnancy, place of residence, profession, date of admission and date of death as well as clinical information on COVID-19 symptoms including fever or chills, dry cough, tiredness, muscle or body aches and pains, sore throat, headache, new loss of taste or smell, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure and loss of speech or movement. Additionally, information on underlying health conditions including hypertension, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis which are associated with the increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality was collected [9] [10] [11] .Data analysis was done in three steps. In the first step, monthly death rates were plotted on a line graph to observe mortality trends between the study periods. A test of proportion was then used to test statistical differences between mortality rates for each month in 2019 vs. 2020. A 95% P-value was used to ascertain significance of the differences. In the second step, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve was fitted to observe the graphical trend and determine the difference in mean time from the date of hospital admission to the date of death between the study periods. The final step involved fitting two separate logistic regression models for the two time periods. For each time period, we created a binary outcome 'COVID-19 symptom' taking value 0 if patient i (who died) presented one or more symptom(s) of COVID-19 and value 1, otherwise. A logistic model was then constructed as below:The outcome variable is the log odds that patient i died from alterative j relative to alternative 0, where 0 means presenting one or more COVID-19 symptom(s); and 1 implies dying without a COVID-19 symptom. Predictors are represented by a standard vector of covariates X. They include the patient's age, sex, body mass index (BMI), residence, profession and underlying health conditions associated with COVID-19 mortality. The model includes β 0 which captures fixed effects and β 1 which detects random effects on the probabilities of dying from one or more COVID-19 symptom(s). A 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to ascertain significance of predictors; which the literature claims to be more reliable for discrete models [14, 15] .Overall, majority of deaths occurred among older people, those with higher body mass indices and among individuals without a profession. As shown in Table 2 , there was no evidence of Hospital-based mortality ratesWe found a wide variation in mortality rates between January and May in 2019 and in 2020. Overall, although death rates continuously decreased over time in 2019, there was a considerable variation in death rates in 2020 with peaks observed in March and again in May. Figure 2 shows that mortality rates dropped from 20.9% in January to 16.8% in March and further declined to 13.6 in May 2019. Conversely, mortality rates sharply increased from 11.0% to 22.9% from January to March of 2020; halved in April (12.9%) before doubling in May (21.9%).Statistical differences in mortality rates between 2019 and 2020 are summarised in Table 3 . We found significant evidence of a higher death rate registered in January of 2019 than January of 2020 (20.9% vs. 11.0%; P-value = 0.005). Contrary to this, a higher death rate was observed in May of 2020 than in May of the previous year (21.9% vs. 13.6%; P-value = 0.028). There was no significant difference between death rates in 2019 and 2020 for the months of February, March and April.Kaplan-Meier curves indicate that death was quicker in 2020 than in 2019 (Fig. 3) . In fact, deaths occurred in 6.7 days (S.D. = 8.9, median = 3) in 2020 against 7.8 days (S.D. = 10.9, median = 4) in 2019.Results from the logistic model are summarised in Table 4 . In 2019, we did not detect significant predictors of death with one or more COVID-19 symptom(s). Contrarily to 2019, being a male was significantly associated with a much lower likelihood of dying with one or more COVID-19 symptom(s) in 2020 (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.87). Equally, deaths with one or more COVID-19 symptoms in 2020 were about 66% less likely among those with employment compared to those without employment. Similar to 2019, age, BMI, underlying health conditions and residence were not significant predictors of death with COVID-19 symptoms in 2020.The aim of this study was to understand the implications of COVID-19 on deaths occurring in a tertiary hospital located in Bujumbura, Burundi. The study used aggregated hospital data to determine whether COVID-19 was associated with an increase in hospital-based mortality rates. Furthermore, the study used individual clinical data to investigate the place of COVID-19 symptoms and underlying health conditions in hospital-based deaths occurring during the pandemic.With respect to hospital-based mortality rates, we did not find evidence that the disease caused mortality rates to increase compared to the previous year. There was a wide variation in death rates, very difficult to attribute to the pandemic. Unlike in most countries around the world, hospital-based mortality rates under COVID-19 circumstances did not increase rapidly in Burundi. However, from the time Burundi confirmed new , there seemed to be an interesting trend. With a hospital death rate of nearly 13% in April, the figure sharply rose to about 22% in the following month. Most importantly, our findings suggested that mortality rate became significantly higher in May 2020 which could be considered as an onset of the pandemic in Burundi. Additionally, the study found evidence that time-to-death was much shorter in 2020 with patients dying in 6.7 days on average. Therefore, a combination of the above evidence i.e. date of appearance of COVID-19 new cases, sharp increase in mortality rate in the following month (May 2020), and the shorter time-to-death observed in the same period could serve as an initial warning of COVID-19 impact in the country. Similar warning signs have been reported in many COVID-19-affected countries around the world [16] [17] [18] . Results from the logistic regression showed a much lower likelihood of dying with one or more COVID-19 symptom(s) among males and patients with a profession. Despite convincing results from a recent study on 26 countries by the World Bank in which the author found that a greater share of reported COVID-19 deaths occurred at younger ages in low-and middle-income countries [19] , our study showed neutral stand with that regard. However, it is important to note that the above evidence seems to contradict a wealth of literature on the vulnerability of older people to COVID-19. For instance, in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Verity et al. found the death rate from COVID-19 to be 7.8 among people aged over 80 years and declined with age to 0.0016% in children aged 9 years and below [20] . Also, it has been found that the incidence of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospital care increases with age [17] . In our study, we also found significant evidence that the likelihood of dying from one or more COVID-19 symptoms decreased with male sex and profession. This finding contradicts that of the World Bank in their study conducted on data from 26 countries which found a male vulnerability [19] . Male vulnerability was also found in China [21] . Similarly, in Italy and in the USA, the COVID-19 fatality rate was equally higher in men. In the April 2020 report from the Italian National Institute of Health, of 23 188 deaths from COVID-19 infection, approximately 70% were males [22] . In the USA, death counts for COVID-19 between February and April 2020 indicated a similar male vulnerability (59% male deaths of 37 308 deaths) [22] [23] [24] .Altogether, our study yielded some evidence for a possible COVID-19-related hospital-based mortality trend for May 2020. However, this evidence needs to be treated with caution as the study has some limitations. On the one hand, our study was conducted over a period of 5 months of which only 2 months were after the confirmation of new COVID-19 cases in Burundi. Therefore, we would acknowledge the time-constraint and recommend that similar studies be conducted using data collected on a longer period of time to detect a much clearer picture of COVID-19 trend. Equally important to mention is the use of a secondary data source which inevitably contains little information compared to needed data. On the other hand, our study controlled for time by comparing two time periods with and without COVID-19 contexts, which is an asset to highlight. Most importantly, by comparing exactly similar months of 2020 and 2019, the study aimed to control for potential confounders (i.e. seasonal causes of mortality, health policy, change in practice, innovative interventions, etc.) which could have a causal relationship with hospital-based deaths (other than the COVID-19 crisis). To further strengthen the evidence, the study modelled deaths to COVID-19 suggestive symptoms alongside known underlying health conditions that increase the risk of mortality from the disease.Although the country has reported one COVID-19-related death as of May 2020, there seemed to be evidence that COVID-19 made a potential contribution to deaths occurring in May 2020 in Kamenge Medical Teaching Hospital of Bujumbura, Burundi. Despite the evidence being partial, the study generated some evidence of the potential implication on hospital-based deaths.Owing to the study limitations such as time constraints which did not allow collection of longitudinal data, authors of this study recommend that similar studies be conducted for a longer period of time. As such, a clearer picture of hospital-based mortality as well as predictors associated with deaths would help to conclude on the subject matter.Author contributions.DH conceptualised the study design, conducted literature search, analysed data and interpreted findings, and drafted the whole manuscript.

As of August 27, 2020, 1236 new cases and a total of 40,407 cases as well as 745 deaths were reported. 3 The transmission of COVID-19 is thought to happen mostly through respiratory droplets. During individual coughs, sneezes, or talks the virus released within the respiratory secretions can infect another person if it makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Another mode of viral transmission is when a person touches a contaminated surface with the virus and then touches her or his nose, mouth, and eyes. 4 The time between exposure to COVID-19 and onset of the symptom for COVID-19 is supposed to be in 14 days, with most cases happening approximately five to six days after exposure. 5 COVID-19 is one of the top reasons for cardiovascular disease, which can cause myocarditis, heart failure, pericarditis, and cardiac conduction defects. 6 Furthermore, in patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19 can cause a change in the progress of the underlying disease and rising mortality. 7 Increase in blood glucose levels can lead to the destruction of immune systems of individuals and results in a decrease in the abilities to fight different types of infections, such as COVID-19; accordingly, the virus can cause more abnormalities to the body. 8 The study conducted in China revealed that patients with cardiovascular disease have a high risk of severe COVID-19 infection. A large observational report, which was conducted on 1099 patients with COVID-19 showed that out of 173 patients with severe disease were with comorbidities of hypertension (23.7%) and DM (16.2%). 9 Another study which recruited 52 severe COVID-19 patients indicated that out of 32 non-survived patients, 7 (22%) were DM patients. 10 Thus, to minimize the risk of transmission, communities are required to follow accepted infection control practices such as frequent hand washing using soap, hand rubbing with an alcohol-based sanitizer, social distancing, awareness of the symptom frequently, wearing the mask in the community, and practicing respiratory hygiene. 11 To confirm effective protective practice and reduce the risk of COVID-19 data on knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) are essential. This data would be important in providing the required approaches to be implemented to contain the spread of the virus. Additionally, the funding of the study would improve and assess the currently available programs to enhance attitudinal changes. Furthermore, behavioral changes and positive attitude mainly depend on the level of perceptions and knowledge towards preventive practices of COVID-19. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices of COVID-19 among patients of HTN and DM attending Public health facilities in Ambo town, West Shoa zone, Oromia, Ethiopia.The multi-center institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo town at AURH and AGH from June 2020 to September 2020. Ambo is 112 Km away to the west from the capital city Addis Ababa. All patients with HTN and/or DM who come consecutively to the chronic care clinics during the data collection period were enrolled in this study. All patients with HTN and/or DM greater than or equal to age 18 years on follow-up and newly diagnosed and gave consent to participate were included in the study and patients with a severe and uncorrectable cognitive, visual, or hearing impairment were excluded from the study.The sample size was calculated by a single population proportion formula Z α 2 2 � � � P 1À P ð Þ d 2 with the assumption, 95% confidence interval (Zα/2 = 1.96), 5% of marginal error (d), 10% non-response rate, 50% proportion (p) level since there is no published data during the initiation of this research that show the KAP toward COVID-19 among patients with HTN and/or DM in Ethiopia and then maximum sample size was considered for the current study.The calculated sample size of this study was 423 respondents and this was allocated to each hospital proportionally. Finally, a consecutive sampling technique was used to collect the data from study participants.The initial draft of the study tool was developed by reviewing previously published similar studies, 12,13 and finalized in two steps. Accordingly, the developed tool was reviewed by senior researcher and professional through invitation by Ambo University's research and community service vice president and followed by a pilot submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 4204 study conducted at another health facility having similar having demographic features. Then the necessary modifications were done based on the findings and incorporated to finalize the questionnaire. The initial questionnaire was prepared in English and converted into Afaan Oromo language by a professional expert and the data were conducted in the Afaan Oromo language. The questionnaire contains socio-demographic characteristics of study participants, 26 questions assessing knowledge answered as yes, no or ""I don't know"" option. An incorrect or I do not know the answer was given 0 points and the correct answer was assigned 1 point. Respondents' overall knowledge was classified as good, moderate, and poor if the score was between 80% and 100% (20.8-26 points), 60% and 79% (15.6-20.5 points) , and less than 60% (<15.6 points) respectively, using Bloom's cut-off point. In the attitudes part, 11 questions assessing attitude were used and the first negative questions were transformed into a positive question. Then, scores were scored based on the participants'' response to each statement as, 1 = certainly not, 2 = probably not, 3 = probably yes, and 4= Most certainly. Total scores ranged from 11 to 44, with high scores indicating positive attitudes. Likewise, 17 questions assessing preventive practice were responded as ""yes or no""; 1 point for the correct answer and 0 points for the incorrect answer was given. Respondents' overall practice was classified as good, moderate, and poor if the score was between 80% and 100% (13.6-17 points), 60% and 79% (10.2-13.6 points), and less than 60% (<10.2 points) respectively, using Bloom's cut-off point. The training was provided for data collectors ahead of data collection. Eight BSc health professionals collected the data by using appropriate personal protective materials like a surgical face mask, glove, and washing their hands with alcoholbased hand sanitizer, and standing around 2 meters away from the participant.Before entering into a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20 for analysis, data were cleaned and checked for completeness. Then, the data were analyzed descriptive statistics to summarize the knowledge, attitude, and prevention practice of the participants toward COVID-19 and presented by percentage (%) frequency and mean ± SD. Outlier and multi-collinearity were also checked. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify potential associated factors of poor knowledge and poor practice. The independent variables in bivariate analysis with p < 0.25 were considered and entered into multivariable logistic regression. The strength of the association of risk factors was established by calculating the crude odds ratio (COR) and the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Lastly, the results were presented in the graphical and tabular form. The significance level with P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant for this study purpose.The study was planned and accompanied following the ethical principles established by Ambo University. A letter of ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of Ambo University with Ref. No AU/937/2/18/12. Written informed consent was obtained from respondents who participated in the study. All the information was kept confidential and the study was done as per the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.In this study, a total of 423 people living with HTN and/or DM participated in a response rate of 100%. The mean (±SD) age of the study respondents was 44.6 years (± 9.84) of which the majority were male 235 (55.6%). The majority of the participant's religion was orthodox 199 (47.0%) followed by protestant 190 (44.9%) and most of them resided in urban. Among the total study respondents, around 338 (79.9%) were married. Concerning the educational level of the respondents, 112 (26.5%) was learned from grades 7-12. Regarding the types of disease of the study participants, 227 (53.7%) were hypertensive while 59 (13.9%) of the study participants were both diabetic and hypertensive. Additionally, chi-square test was used for each domain score of the study participants were categorized into 3 categories: good, fair and poor. The results of this categorization are shown (Table 1) .In this study, 266 (62.9) study respondents stated that COVID-19 have no specific effective treatment and vaccine. The majority of 416 (98.3) of the study respondents reported that Covid-19 is a contiguous disease. About 338 (79.9%) of the respondents indicated that they were conscious of the incubation period of the diseases as 2 to 14 days to observe the sign and symptoms of the person infected with the virus. About 268 (63.4%) of study respondents distinguished that as COVID-19 is caused by a virus and also having information of symptoms including cough, fever, headache, and sore throat by 380 (89.8%), 371 (87.7%), 247 (58.4%), 194 (45.9%) respondents, respectively. Moreover, the majority of participants 355 (83.9%) knew COVID-19 can be spread directly through cough from infected people, and reported potentially the disease is more dangerous in HTN and DM patients by 385 (91%) and 370 (87.5%), respectively. Besides, 268 (63.4%) of respondents knew that people with age group >50 years old are at a higher risk of severe disease and death as shown in ( Table 2 ).Analysis of the data collected showed that the prevalence of poor knowledge about COVID-19 among the study participants was 31.44% whereas the prevalence of good and moderate knowledge were 37.59% and 30.97%, respectively, together consisting about 68.66% of good knowledge of COVID-when compared to those with poor knowledge (Figure 1 ).The majority of participants 288 (68.1%) strongly agreed that COVID-19 is a cause for serious illness, while 87 (20.6%) agree that COVID-19 is a curable disease. Two hundred twenty-seven (53.7%) participants reported that the probability of getting COVID-19 is high. The majority of 306 (72.3%) of the study participants highly agreed early detection of COVID-19 can improve treatment outcomes. COVID-19 disease results in death in cases and COVID-19 disease can be transmitted through household pets to humans were considered not agreed by 201 (47.5%) and 195 (46.1%) respondents, respectively (Table 3) . Analysis of the data collected showed that the prevalence of poor COVID-19 preventive practice among the study participants was 45.39% whereas the prevalence of good practice was 10.40% ( Figure 1 ).For a disease like COVID-19, protecting self and others rely on obeying with the recommended protocols. However, study assessing KAP regarding COVID-19 in selective disease populations (risk groups), like the current The knowledge, attitude, and prevention practice toward COVID-19 is an important issue because studies reported as they have to have health impact on COVID-19. 14- 16 We had intentionally excluded children and adolescents less 17 The similarity could be due to the uniformity of the study population as both types of research focused on the patient with chronic diseases. The high proportion of correct answer to knowledge-related questions among the respondents may be due to the characteristics like they gained awareness and knowledge about the disease and its transmission, via social media, radios and television news, and educational level as more than 50% had got a formal education in different levels. The positive association found between knowledge, and educational background, and access to a source of information supports our claim. However, the funding was lower than the study conducted in China among health care workers in which the knowledge of HCW towards COVID-19 prevention was high (89%). 18 And in Pakistan in which the knowledge towards COVID-19 prevention was 92.3%. 19 This discrepancy could be due to the difference in the study population. These previous studies were conducted among health professionals to assess their knowledge level, but the current study is conducted among the general population with different educational levels. This is because health professional has more exposure to the information regarding the disease. Being a public servant, hearing COVID-19 information through social media, using the source of information (media) daily was reported to have a smaller risk of poor COVID-19 knowledge when compared with their counterparts. This might be because of getting information through different meetings and media for the former and DovePress widespread airing of COVID-19 information through media for the latter two factors. In contrast to this, the Web-based study done in India among DM patients has shown that being urban residence had a statistically significant association with better knowledge. 20 The present study has also shown indifference with the studies done in Vietnam and of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which have shown being male to have an association with lesser knowledge. 21, 22 This study has shown similarity as it has shown a significant decrease of knowledge with a 1-year increase in age as reported with the very similar study conducted among chronic patients in Addis Zeman hospital, North West part of Ethiopia, which has revealed age, illiteracy, rural resident and lower to have a significant association with poor knowledge too. 23 A study conducted in Pakistan among 242 patients with DM found that only 78.5% of the participants were aware of the modes of transmission of COVID-19. 24 In this study, it was found that 83.9% and 77.5% of the participants state that COVID-19 spreads via cough and sneeze, respectively. However, many participants (54.1%) were not aware of the fact that sore throat is a symptom of COVID-19. Similarly, as many as 68.3% of the respondents were not aware of the fact that body pain a symptom of COVID-19, even though, they are at an increased risk of severe disease and mortality from COVID-19. It is thus necessary that health education programs for people with HTN and DM need more emphasis on these aspects while imparting awareness about COVID-19.Concerning attitude, 79.2% of the participants strongly believed that DM and hypertensive patients were more at risk of death because of COVID-19, and 68.1% of the participants have strongly agreed with the idea, COVID-19 can cause serious illness and health education could help to prevent the disease as well. About 335 (79.2%) of the respondent believes that a patient with a chronic disease like HTN, DM, and others are more vulnerable to the effect of COVID-19 than other people. Approximately 306 (72.3%) mostly agree that that early diagnosis of COVID-19 can enhance treatment outcomes and 288 (68.1%) believed that health education can help in the prevention of COVID-19 spreading. Furthermore, 280 (66.2%) are agreed Ethiopian government should quarantine patients with COVID-19 in a special quarantine center. These Positive attitudes help control and COVID-19 spread, to safeguard citizens and ensure their well-being. Very few numbers of the participants strongly agreed with the statement, which says COVID-19 will result in death and being able to carry out prevention measures set by the authority with 2.1% and 0.2%, respectively. Similarly, only 10.4%, of participants had a good level of COVID-19 prevention practice measures.The number of participants with good knowledge, favorable attitude, and good COVID-19 prevention practices in this study is lower when compared with the results of the study done in Jeddah, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia, the main reasons of which were; those done in Jeddah and China was among medical students, 25, 26 and the one in Nigeria was among trained correctional officers, 27 who would have gotten better opportunity to access information's from both formal and informal sources and the first outbreak of the disease in Asian countries. 21, 27, 28 Similarly, the percentage of participants with good knowledge in the present study is lower when compared with even the study done in Ethiopia within which data were collected over Facebook with the probable reason for getting better access to online disseminated pieces of information for the participants. Unfortunately practicing prevention measures was very low as in this study too. 29 The problem might be negligence among our society, which might have developed because of the lesser report in the number of COVID-19 positive patients during the first four months.The prevalence of poor practice to prevent COVID-19 spread in this study was high. This finding is relatively consistent with that of the cross-sectional study conducted among patients with chronic medical conditions in Addis Ababa. 17 However, this finding is not consistent with that of the studies in Iran. 30 The possible reason for this difference might be due to a difference in sources of information, frequency of media exposure, knowledge, and concern related to the outbreak of the disease by study participants which lead to the variation in the implementation of recommended actions and behaviors to prevent COVID-19. In the present study, there is a direct relationship between the knowledge and preventive practice of the study participants. Similar to this finding, a study in Ethiopia showed that a higher level of education was associated with high practice scores. 17 This may be because as an individual gets more educated, it will create an opportunity to acquire more information about COVID-19 prevention methods in many ways and will practice accordingly. Additionally, when someone gets more educated there will be a better understanding of control measures and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, and the ability to implement practice methods to protect COVID-19 spread will increase. Furthermore, submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 education results in better information collection habit and lead to efficient use of health inputs for prevention of COVID-19. 17 Our study multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that those patients with no formal education, who have poor knowledge about COVID-19, who used sources of information less frequently (weekly) were more likely to have poor COVID-19 prevention practice. This portrayed a positive correlation between knowledge and practice as shown with the other study done in Ethiopia. 23 The present study used face to face data collection methods rather than online Google form questionnaires. This could help to address part of the population who do not use the internet and were excluded from previous studies mentioned in this paper. Besides, the current study was conducted in the two hospitals in Ambo town and it could show the real picture of HTN and DM patients in the town. The limitation of this study was the study did not include admitted patients with these diseases and other risky patients with a chronic illness like other cardiac disease and respiratory disease.Generally, in the present study, the individuals' knowledge on COVID-19 prevention was positively and significantly correlated with their practice. The findings showed that the improvement of people's knowledge on COVID-19 can increase their prevention for the disease and poor practices in this study might be primarily attributed to the lack of strict prevention and control measures implemented by government, such as enforcing peoples to wear a mask and prohibition public gatherings.The prevalence of poor knowledge about COVID-19 among the study participants was very low. Daily usage of information sources had a positive impact to have good knowledge. Only less than three fourth of the participants believe COVID-19 as a serious disease. A very little number of participants had a good level of COVID-19 prevention practice. Good knowledge had an association with a good level of prevention practice. Those patients with no formal education; who had poor knowledge about COVID-19; who used sources of information less frequently (weekly) had a greater risk for the poor level of prevention practice. So the government, university, and hospitals should work to make intensive accessibility of COVID-19 information I with a special focus for patients with no formal education and have a greater risk for COVID-19 mortality like DM and Hypertensive patients.HTN, hypertension; DM, diabetic Mellitus; KAP, knowledge attitude and practice; AU, Ambo University; AURH, Ambo University Referral Hospital; AGH, Ambo General Hospital; COR, crude odds ratio; AOR, adjusted odds ratio; SPSS, statistical package for social sciences.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-11-23","11"

Following the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, it has since been dispersed to more than 200 countries. As of 21 April 2020, over 2,5 million cases and 170,000 deaths have been confirmed, with the epicenter in temperate areas (Europe and North America). This global pandemic calls for immediate control but, in the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, the only possible actions rely on changes in human behavior to reduce contact rates between people (i.e. social distancing) andinfectiousness of those contacts (e.g. masks). According to current estimates of the R0 (around 3), the epidemic should cease to grow only when at least 66% of the population has acquired immunity against the virus 1 , although uncertainties around the value of R0 and populationlevel heterogeneities in disease transmission can modulate this threshold 2 . Given the severity of the disease, especially for older age populations and vulnerable groups, the potential death toll associated with the epidemic has prompted governments to take unprecedented social distancing measures 1, 3, 4 . As a result, a third of the world population were put under lockdown in the first 3 months of the epidemic, and macroeconomic policies are being put in place to try to contain a global recession that is now inevitable, with G20 countries committing about 5 trillion UDS earlier this year just to keep the economies afloat 5 .The timing and duration of social distancing measures is critical 6, 7 and several measures must be combined to achieve high effectiveness 8, 9 . Social distance measures have been implemented as part of two overall types of strategies 1 . First, suppression strategies aim to reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) to below 1, so that each new infection generates less than one other infection, progressively halting human-to-human transmission.The main challenge of this approach is that social distancing measures need to be effectively J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f implemented, at more than 60 % of efficiency 10 (i.e. 60% of contacts are avoided), and also maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population, or until a vaccine becomes available. Suppression strategies are particularly effective in the early stages of the outbreak or when it is still locally confined, and have been successfully applied in China, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore 11 . Eventually, intermediate levels of local activity can be maintained while avoiding a large outbreak, as demonstrated in China and Hong Kong 12 .Second, mitigation strategies aim to reduce and attenuate the health impact by building population immunity through the epidemic, leading to a more progressive increase and decline in transmission (i.e. flattening the epidemic curve), avoiding the saturation of the healthcare system 7 . Indeed, the sudden inflow of severe COVID-19 cases places an immense pressure on national health systems, with high demand for intensive care units (ICU) and mechanical ventilators rapidly outstripping capacity even in high-resource settings. It has been estimated that mitigation strategies implemented in March 2020 across 11 European countries, may have averted about 59,000 deaths (21,000-120,000 95% credible interval) in roughly three weeks 13 . Nevertheless, these interventions have strong economic and social impacts to also be considered.Mitigation measures in France in the first 3 months have been progressively implemented, beginning with a ban of mass gatherings, school and university closures (March 13 th -14 th ), social distancing encouraged and case isolation mandated (March 17 th ), leading to a full lockdown by March 18 th that has been in place until May 11 th , 2020. Mitigation strategies in France and elsewhere can be implemented with different degrees of social distancing and target different groups, and could be optimized to minimize the number of hospitalizations and deaths while reducing their societal and economic impact 10 . The aim of this study is to evaluate under which conditions a partial lockdown strategy -where social distancing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (quarantine) is targeted at specific age groups -could have been an alternative to the complete lockdown that has been implemented in France, without an excessive impact on the expected epidemic burden.We built a classic mathematical model in epidemiology based on a SEIR framework (Fig. 1 ).The population is divided into different age classes (characterized by the index i). Then, within each age class, the population is categorized according to their infectious status. First, individuals are in a Susceptible state (S i ), where they can get the infection according to the basal transmission rate (β), the contact rate between age classes (θ ij ) and the number of infectious individuals within each age class (I j ). If infected, people move to the category Exposed (E i ), where they are infected but not yet infectious. After an incubation period (1/ε, assumed here to be 3 days), individuals can become infectious and asymptomatic (A i ) with a probability p (assumed here to be 80%), recovering after an infectious period (1/σ, assumed here to be 5 days) and then remain recovered for the rest of the outbreak (U i ). We assume that asymptomatic individuals (because no symptom or a lack of detection) can transmit the virus like the symptomatic ones. Exposed individuals can also become infectious and symptomatic (I i ) with a probability (1-p) . In this case, they have a probability α i (dependent of the age class) to develop a severe form of the disease (M i ) and a probability π i (also dependent of the age class) to die from the virus (D i ). Otherwise, they recover and cannot be infected again (R i ). R i and U i are identical from an infectious status, but the R i will represent the cumulative incidence observed and reported in official sources. We calibrated the model using the age structure of the French population from the National Institute of Statistics 14 , and contact rates between age groups from a large meta-analysis 15 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Fig. 2) . The severity per age group in terms of % of cases requiring critical care α i , and π i the lethality of the considered age class (Infection Fatality Ratio) are detailed in Table 1 and are drawn from 16 .Simulations and model analysis:We start the simulations on March 3 rd , with 212 observed cases allocated uniformly within each age class. We assume that at this date, a ""trace and isolate"" strategy would not able to break down the local transmission, and that the nitial number of non-observed cases is equal to the number of observed cases divided by the proportion of observed cases. We run our model with a transmission rate allowing a R0 of 2.8 and a proportion of non-observed cases at 80%, parameters that are consistent with other estimates 1,2 . We also assumed that the efficiency of social distance measures implemented on March 18 th was 50% until April 20 th13 , i.e., reducing all the contacts between and within age classes by 50%.After this date, we analyze scenarios with alternative social distance strategies to a strict lockdown (assumed to reduce contact rates between all age groups by a given proportion) as it has been implemented in France, starting in April 20th With an estimation of the infectious status of the population at that time, we analyze three different strategies that would impose a partial lockdown targeted at particular age groups and their combinations, being, in total, seven sub-strategies (Fig. 3) . The ""Young age class"", assumed here to represent individuals between 0 and 30 years old, which could have decreased contact rates if both schools and universities are closed. The ""Middle age class"", assumed here to represent individuals between 30 and 60 years old, could have lower contact rates if workplace closures and teleworking (remote work from home) are enforced. Additionally, the closure of businesses and services targets primarily this age group, although it also affects contact rates for other age groups in a lesser extent. Finally, the ""Elderly age class"", assumed here to represent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f individuals older than 60 years, could have fewer contacts if this age group is forced to stay home and retirement homes and other targeted places for this age group are isolated. We analyzed each of these strategies separately and in combination (Fig. 3) . Each of the different partial lockdowns are evaluated according to their isolation efficiency (i.e. the efficiency to decrease contact rates of the targeted age group), which was varied between 0-100%. The different strategies are compared based on four outputs: 1) the duration of the epidemic (assuming here that the epidemic could end when there is less than one new case per day), 2) the cumulative number of deaths, 3) the number of severe cases at the epidemic peak and 4) the duration that the health system is over-capacity (assumed to be as 5,000 ICU beds).We estimated that depending on the intervention implemented and its efficiency at reducing contact rates, the time before a halt in local transmission could range from less than 3 months to nearly two years (Fig. 4) . The time estimated in the absence of interventions would be slightly under 1 year. In our models, a complete lockdown (i.e., targeting all age classes) and a partial strategy targeting young and middle age classes were the only interventions that could achieve suppression. This could be achieved at isolation efficiencies of at least 35% and 60% respectively, but their efficiency would have to be substantially higher in order to reduce the duration of the epidemic. Focusing only on elderlies did not dramatically change the epidemic duration regardless of the efficiency of this strategy in reducing contact rates. All other strategies flattened the curve, resulting on epidemic scenarios up to 200 days longer.Regarding the potential death toll, increases in efficiency for any strategy would consistently lead to reductions in the mortality burden, but these reductions were non-linear. A full lockdown was the most effective strategy at reducing mortality, resulting in about 9,000 additional deaths after April 20 th if efficiency is higher than 60%. Focusing on isolating the elderlies in addition to another age group (either young or middle age) was the next best strategy when the efficiency of interventions considered was lower than 50%, but the gap in mortality compared to a complete lockdown substantially increased after efficiencies over 20%. Targeting young and middle age groups could decrease indirectly the mortality in the elderly population and limit the total mortality burden to under 20,000 deaths when suppression was achieved promptly (efficiency higher than 75%).Similarly to mortality burdens, the ability of each strategy to limit over-capacity in the French health system improved at higher isolation efficiencies, but the effects were non-linear. In the absence of interventions, the health system would remain at over-capacity for 50 days, reaching over 20,000 severe cases at the peak. We found that a full lockdown remained the best strategy to limit this, avoiding over-capacity entirely at isolation efficiencies higher than 40% (Fig. 5) . Focusing on young and middle age classes is an interesting lockdown strategy, halving the magnitude of the peak of number of severe cases while increasing the period in over-capacity at efficiencies lower than 40%, due to the shift between attenuation and suppression regime for this strategy around this threshold. Strategies including the elderly were less optimal but also limited overcapacity of the health system, leading to reductions of 50% in the length at over-capacity and of two thirds in the number of severe cases at the peak at efficiencies higher than 75%. Targeting only one age group resulted in considerable worse outcomes, compared to combined strategies, regardless of the age group targeted.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has sparked worldwide a range of large-scale social distancing measures to a level not seen in over one hundred years 17 . The lessons learned from the 1918-19 Spanish flu epidemic highlighted the need to implement measures early and sustained over time to reduce overall mortality 17, 18 . Unless herd immunity is achieved, transmission is expected to rebound following the lift of social distancing measures. In fact, to minimize mortality and health system overload, it is estimated that some form of social distancing measures will need to be in place for up to 18 months 1,19 , resulting in huge substantial impacts on the world's society and economy 5, 20 . In this study, we use an agestructured mathematical mode to simulate the impact of partial lockdowns -social distancing interventions targeted at specific age groups -in France as an alternative to maintaining a full lockdown. We show that while a full lockdown that achieves 60% isolation in the whole population remains the most effective strategy for minimizing both the morbidity and mortality burden of the epidemic (leading to suppression), targeting one or several age groups with higher efficiency could achieve comparable reductions while allowing important societal and economic activities to still take place. Our aim is to find an optimal trade-off of costbenefits between the sanitary, the economic and the social impacts. Today, in France, we know that such level of isolation efficiency during a lockdown is achievable 21 .The only partial lockdown strategy that achieved suppression in our simulations was targeting young and middle ages at efficiencies higher than 60%. The impact of this strategy on the outcomes assessed (epidemic duration, death burden, days over capacity and peak of severe cases) was comparable to a complete lockdown at an efficiency higher than 40%, because these age groups (young and middle ages) contribute greatly to transmission. Recently, as case detection has been improved, it has been confirmed the important contribution of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f young and middle ages (20-39) has been confirmed recently 22 . However, at efficiencies around such thresholds, both these strategies could have important tradeoffs in the form of longer time to stop community transmission (up to nearly two years vs. one year with other strategies). This could involve substantial economic impacts, as the OECD estimates that each month of lockdown can lead to a loss of 2% in annual GDP growth 20 .Since, even in western societies, the majority of jobs and social interactions cannot be done remotely, a partial lockdown that avoids isolation of middle age groups would be preferable to reduce the economic impact of the epidemic. Among the strategies evaluated, we found that targeting the elderly and young age groups could lead to a large reduction in the number of deaths and minimize the impact on the health system when isolation efficiencies reach 80% or higher. Alternatively, targeting only the elderly population could theoretically decrease the death toll in similar proportions than if combined with another age group. Our results are consistent with other studies, where strategies involving isolation of the elderly showed the greatest potential to reduce mortality rates 1 . However, relying just on targeting the elderly would result in thousands more severe cases at the peak of the epidemic than for other strategies, and the health system could be over capacity for several weeks. The consequences of this could be offset if current efforts to discover effective treatments and to rapidly increase the country's bed capacity at intensive care units are successful. Yet, a health system over capacity for a sustained period could result in substantial all-cause excess mortality, something that has already been observed in several EU countries during the first months of the epidemic 7 .This study has several limitations that deserve discussion. First, we used a deterministic model that does not consider the stochasticity in epidemic dynamics. Stochasticity is particularly relevant for predicting the tails of the epidemic curve, but its impact decreases as the number J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of cases increase (i.e. the bell of the curve). Thus, while it is unlikely to affect our conclusions, it may have resulted in an underestimation of the total epidemic time under different scenarios. Second, there is still uncertainty in the precise value of several parameters used in our model, and reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases and associated deaths are highly sensitive to testing rates and official case definitions but are being highly improved. As a result, our assumptions may not hold true if there is a significant deviation in parameter values or between the real and reported burden of the epidemic. Third, we made multiple simplifying assumptions about age-specific contact rates, we did not include differences in age-specific transmission capacity (susceptibility and transmissibility are only dependent on contact rates between age groups), and we did not include transmission from pre-symptomatic cases.Although there is still little evidence of the susceptibility of children to SARS-COV-2 and their capacity to transmit to others, recent studies from South Korea 23 and the United States 24 suggests that children may be as susceptible and transmissible as other age groups 25 . Fourth, we used broad groups to roughly represent dynamics of populations whose primary activity is education, work or retirement so that we could envision age-specific measures for these groups, but in reality, these categories are fluid (e.g. individuals who start working at 18 years old, or who retire at 50). Moreover, we assumed that reducing contact rates within an age group (e.g. closing a school) would not impact contact rates with other groups (e.g. increased contact at home). This could have resulted in an overestimation of the impact of age-targeted interventions. Given the lack of information and substantial uncertainties around these crosseffects, addressing this was beyond of the scope of our analysis, as it would be too speculative.Finally, there are many unknowns about the type and duration of the protective immunity for individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection 26 .The use of mathematical models has proved crucial for assessing the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to limit its consequences. As a result, an increasing number of modeling studies are arising, with a similar structure but varying degrees of complexity to allow a range of insights. At one side of the spectrum, Ferguson and collaborators adapted a formidable dataset and complex models their group had developed over decades to understand influenza dynamics 27 . This allowed them to accurately estimate parameters for age groups, a variety of activities and locations, and explore in detail alternative measures to contain the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK and the US 1 . Yet, some of their main conclusions can be obtained from much simpler models, similar datasets are hard to obtain for other countries in a timely manner, and further complexity typically implies increased sensitivity to model structure and parameters. On the ""simpler"" side, models can accurately predict epidemic progression and provide several key insights with a minimal number of parameters and assumptions, but these are more limited in the range of questions that can be explored. Here, we leaned towards a simple model structure while keeping explicit consideration of age-specific compartments and their contact rates. Such information has now been estimated for over 150 countries from both developed and developing countries 15 . Therefore, while our model does not aim to forecast precisely the epidemiological dynamics at an accurate scale, it can be easily adapted to other settings and allow exploration of a wide range of scenarios and potential intervention measures.Transmission models as the one presented here should be adapted to the particular context of developing countries and vulnerable populations to help understand potential epidemic impact and guide control efforts. Though the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in developing countries remain low so far, there is still substantial uncertainty about how the epidemic will affect regions such as sub-Saharan Africa 24 . On one hand, a younger population J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f structure in combination with lower connectivity due to poor road infrastructure could slow or limit the epidemic burden, especially in rural areas. On the other hand, high rates of malnutrition, respiratory infections due to indoor air pollution together with other comorbidities (e.g. infectious and parasitic diseases) could increase the severity of COVID-19 in younger ages due to impaired immunity or lung function. In addition, mortality rates of severe cases could be significantly higher than observed elsewhere due to lower rates of healthcare access and the limited capacity of health systems in the developing world (e.g. hospital bed capacity, availability of respirators, etc.). A full lockdown in these settings will be hard to sustain over time due to the dire economic conditions of populations and the limited resources of national governments to compensate households for the loss of revenue. Therefore, insights from such models could help find optimal alternatives adapted to the context of low-resource settings.In conclusion, as social distancing measures are predicted to continue for several months, identifying the set of strategies that minimize the epidemic's health burden with the least social disruption is essential in order to limit their collateral economic impact, both in developed and developing countries. Using the example of France, our results suggest that a full lockdown could be relaxed there without a substantial increase in the epidemic's mortality burden if efficient age-targeted interventions are implemented. If a full lockdown is maintained in order to achieve suppression, it is critical that implementation of such measures achieve reductions over 50% in contact rates to avoid significant health and economic tradeoffs. Similar studies could be adapted to other settings to allow countries make informed decisions about the best way to fight the epidemic but also reducing the economic and social impacts.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ","Madagascar","abstract","2020-11-24","11"

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 has created panic around the world, because of its higher rate of infection and comorbidity combined with the unavailability of standard therapies and/or vaccines [2] . CoVs are single-stranded positive-sense encapsulated RNA viruses that have membrane augmented with glycoprotein spikes. These viruses attack the lower respiratory system of the host and affect the lungs leading to acute respiratory distress causing pneumonia and later leading to failure of multiple organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system [2] [3] [4] .SARS-CoV2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor for entry into the host cell through binding of its spike (S) protein followed by S protein priming using the serine protease TMPRSS2 [5] . SARS-CoV 2 contains four structural proteins viz. spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelop (E) that may act as antigens. These antigens may induce neutralizing antibodies in the human body and increase CD 4+ / CD 8+ T-cell responses. These mechanisms of action serve as the basis for the treatment regimens used for this disease. At present, no specific or clinically proved therapies/ vaccines are available, and therefore the outbreak requires an urgent response from the scientific community for new developments in this area. According to WHO, the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 might take more than 18 months, because of the multiple steps required to ensure its effectiveness and safety. A study conducted by Gordon et al., [6] identified 67 druggable host proteins targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs [6] . However, at present only a few 4 potential therapies viz. favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir, and hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) are reported to be at the final stage of human testing [7] .The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, diabetes, kidney and liver diseases, obesity, immunocompromised people (cancer, immune deficiencies), and smokers are at high risk [8] . The use of immune-boosting nutraceuticals has the potential to help to combat and control coronavirus infections through the activation of immune response and alleviating the oxidative stress [9] [10] [11] [12] . To date, many types of nutraceuticals, which are derived from natural resources such as animals, plants, marine organisms, and microorganisms, have been reported and are in use. Algae comprising prokaryotic cyanobacteria and other eukaryotic forms are rich bioresource of bioactive compounds of nutraceutical and therapeutic importance [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The use of cyanobacterium Spirulina based nutraceuticals is well explored in in-vitro and clinical studies and is commercially available. Spirulina-based nutraceuticals have been reported to boost innate and adaptive immunity [18] [19] [20] , and possess antiviral properties against different enveloped viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [21] [22] [23] [24] . This review discusses the potential therapeutic role of algae-based, Spirulina nutraceuticals in addressing the SARS-CoV and related viral infections.Compounds that induce the innate and adaptive immune responses are generally used to prevent and fight against various pathogenic infections. Algae derived bioactive compounds are well reported for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory, and immunomodulatory properties that can be potentially used as immune boosters and/or 5 therapeutic agents for controlling pathogen attack and disease prevention in humans [15, 19, 25] . Cyanobacterium Spirulina is commercially produced for human consumption and is typically used as a health food supplement due to its high protein content, lipids, vitamins, essential amino acids, minerals, photosynthetic pigments, and biologically active substances including phycocyanin, chlorophyll, and β-carotene.The use of Spirulina spp. has been found to improve the immune function and disease resistance in animals and humans [20, 26] . A study on human subjects by Selmi et al. [26] demonstrated the use of Spirulina supplements in ameliorating anemia and immunosenescence in senior citizens diagnosed with anemia (˂13 g dl -1 and ˂12 g dl -1 of hemoglobin in male and female individuals respectively for previous 12 months) [26] . Both and eye tissues in healthy animal models [27] . Tested algae Spirulina platensis and Botryococcus braunii were isolates from India, while microalga Haematococcus pluvialis was an isolate from Germany. Algal biomass grown under controlled conditions in standard growth media was suspended in olive oil for 15 days and administered to the rats with equal carotenoid concentration [27] . The administration of microalgal biomass helped to restore 6 enzyme activity and prevent lipid peroxidation through scavenging free radicals and hydroxy radicals in living cells in the rat model. A significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes viz. catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase in plasma and liver was reported after the repeated dose of algae biomass in rats, indicating their potential role in food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical applications [27] .Spirulina supplements and/or extracts are believed to potentiate the immune system, which may help to fight and suppress different viral infections [20] . Soluble extracts of Spirulina have been found to enhance natural killer (NK) cell function, macrophage phagocytic activity, and red blood cells antibody response in in-vitro studies and trials on different animals and humans [20] . Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) cytokine plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity in humans and is a primary activator of macrophages as well as a stimulator of natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils [28] . Administration of Spirulina could enhance the non-specific preventive measures, such as activation of CD 4+ cells which further enhance the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in humans, for the prevention of viral infection [29] . Hirahashi et al. [20] evaluated the potential of condensed soluble extracts of S. platensis grown under outdoor open tanks in alkaline conditions as immune potentiator in human subjects. Hot water extracts of S. platensis were prepared by autoclaving (1 h, 120 °C) biomass, and pH was adjusted to 4.0 using citric acid. The water-soluble fraction was separated via centrifugation and condensed soluble extracts were orally administered to healthy male volunteers aged 40-65 [20] . They demonstrated the immune potentiating ability of S. platensis and its mechanism through the analysis of blood cells with pre-and post oral consumption of hot water extracts in the selected human subjects [20] . The administration of S. platensis extracts increased the production of (IFN-γ) (representative of NK function) in more than 50% of tested individuals in IL-12/IL-18 dependent manner. They suggested that the oral administration of Spirulina in humans could aid signaling responses via Toll-like 7 receptors (TLR) and NK-mediated IFN-γ production. Bacille Calmette-Guerin-cell wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) is a strong immune adjuvant for various immune therapies and acts as a ligand for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 to raise the maturation stage of monocytes/macrophages [30] . In-vitro study on the addition of BCG-CWS to the fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC or monocytes (expressing TLR2/4) augmented the potent production of IL-12p40 in immune-competent cells taken postadministration of S. platensis extracts as compared to pre-administration [20] . Therefore, oral uptake of S. platensis could be involved in the signaling responses through TLR in blood cells in humans and improve immunity [20] .Inflammation plays an imperative role in innate immunity and depending upon the amount of inflammation caused, it may lead to various chronic disorders. Betacoronavirus infection results in the activation of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells followed by secretion of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines [1] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe cases of coronavirus infections is generally a result of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [1, 31] . CRS and cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) driven elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) are common with COVID-19 patients. This has led to urgent clinical research on the use of therapies for suppressing CRS [1, 32] . The host immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns through pattern recognition receptors. The recognition of coronavirus-associated molecular patterns by the host immune system is mainly mediated by the use of various pattern recognition factors such as toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), etc. [33] . The NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays an important role in the innate immune response to pathogenic infections in macrophages including COVID-19 [34, 35] . Spirulina extracts (SE) are found to prevent the 8 activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling [18] . Chei patients is also highly essential due to side effects related to the drug toxicity. Spirulina and its extracts have been proved to play multiple roles as immune boosters, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immune stimulatory agents. In this scenario, the application of Spirulina biomass and/or its active ingredients may provide promising protection against drugs induced hepatotoxicity and immunosuppression. Khafaga and Sayed studied the effect of oral feeding of Spirulina platensis powder (DXN Company, Kedah, Malaysia) at 500 mg kg -1 bwt in adult male Wistar albino rats against the effect of the cytotoxic drug, methotrexate [36] . Methotrexate (MTX) caused a reduction in leukocyte counts, hepatic antioxidant enzymes, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase; serum 9 immunoglobulins, IgA, IgM, and IgM level. Spirulina intake helped in ameliorating the methotrexate toxicity through the restoration of liver enzymes, and a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation products. In summary, Spirulina has the potential to enhance the immune components and reduce the physio-biochemical stress and therefore could be used as a supplement along with the treatments, or for prevention of COVID-19 infection and related symptoms.In addition to immune-boosting agents, algae are potential resources for biologically active compounds having anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, and have been said to enhance the immune system and treat immune disorders related to coronavirus and other viral infections [15, 16, 19] . There has been much research done on the antiviral properties of algal extracts in-vitro, however, studies on practical implications are still underway and need to be explored at demonstration scale.The mechanism of infection by SARS-CoV2 includes attachment of the viral glycosylated spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein of the host human cells followed by the use of serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. [2] Severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections generally lead to the down-regulation of ACE2 and more severe lung injury [37, 38] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) enhances the generation of angiotensin II (AngII) from angiotensin I (AngI), which induces acute lung injury via stimulating the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), whereas ACE2 and AngII type 2 10 receptor (AT2R) negatively regulate this pathway and are protective [37, 39] . Upon SARS-CoV2 infection, once the defensive immune system is impaired, propagation of virus leads to tissue damage in organs with ACE2 receptors and induces innate inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes. At this stage, greater effort is required in suppressing inflammation and managing life-threatening symptoms.Generally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), which inhibit the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), are used as protective gear for the treatment of severe coronavirus infections [38, 40, 41] . ACE-Is help to treat lung/organ injury via enhancing ACE2 activity. However, the use of ACE-Is for the treatment of COVID-19 is still under critical debate especially in cases with medical conditions such as hypertension, heart diseases, and diabetes [42] . In general, the medication for the treatment of these conditions increases the expression of ACE2. It was suspected that increased expression of ACE2 receptors would lead to an increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection since the virus uses ACE2 receptors for entry into the host; however, this concept is not yet clinically proven. Moreover, the use of ACE-Is is clinically proven for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV infections.According to Kuster et al., [38] there is no current data available to show the relationship between ACE2 activity and mortality related to SARS-CoV2 [38] . The most common lethality in coronavirus infections and COVID-19 is associated with the underlying lung injury due to the downregulation of ACE2 [38, 43] . Therefore, the use of ACE-Is is continued for the treatment of multiple organ injury in severe cases of coronavirus infections [38, [44] [45] [46] .Spirulina is a natural bioresource of ACE inhibitory peptides of therapeutic value that could be explored for their potential in the treatment of severe symptoms (lung injury) and inflammation related to the betacoronavirus infections including COVID-19. Spirulina 11 extracts have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties and its potential use in humans and mechanism as an anti-inflammatory agent has been demonstrated successfully [18] . Moreover, Spirulina nutraceuticals and derived ACE inhibitory peptides have been well demonstrated for boosting immune response, reduction in cytokine related inflammation, and enhancing ACE2 activity in in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico studies on model animal organisms and humans in different diseases [18, [47] [48] [49] [50] . Heo et al., [49] investigated the potential of ACE inhibitory peptide from hydrolyzed Spirulina sp. protein in inhibiting ACE activity in human endothelial cells. In their study, Spirulina sp. biomass was hydrolyzed using gastrointestinal enzymes to obtain hydrolysate. Different sizes of peptides were obtained by molecular weight fractionation of the hydrolysates. ACE inhibitory peptides were purified using ion-exchange chromatography followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography [49] . MD simulation revealed the formation of 5.76 ± 1.50 and 2.58 ± 0.83 pairs of H-bonds by purified peptides with ACE and Ang II respectively, indicating their potential to make dead-end complex through the formation of enzyme-inhibitor and enzymesubstrate-inhibitor complexes and inhibiting ACE catalytic activity [49] . They also revealed that application of ACE inhibitory peptide (at 250 μM concentration) decreased the Ang IIinduced production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and downregulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) and blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) in EA.hy926 endothelial cells. McCarty and DiNicolantonio, [9] postulated the possible use of nutraceuticals capable of inhibiting NOX2 production, promoting clearance of hydrogen peroxide, or aiding the restoration of the native structure of Cys98 in TLR7, might help in boosting the TLR7-mediated induction of type 1 interferon (innate immunity response) and antiviral antibodies. Thus, in this perspective, the use of algae-derived ACE inhibitory peptides seems to be a potential option 12 that might play multiple roles as ACE inhibitors, immune boosters, and treating vascular dysfunction in human viral diseases including COVID-19.He et al. found that the ACE inhibitory peptides viz. Ile-Gln-Pro (IQP) and Val-Glu-Pro (VEP) derived from Spirulina platensis (synthesized by SP Biomart Ltd., Beijing, China) could be absorbed intact via. Caco-2 cell monolayers and expected to have high bioavailability [51] . The transport of both peptides was energy-dependent and involved an apical-to-basolateral flux mediated by P-glycoprotein for the transport of VEP. Zheng et al. [50] also reported that oral administration (10 mg -1 kg -1 day -1 for 6 weeks) of Spirulina platensis derived bioactive peptides IQP, VEP, as well as biomass hydrolysates, exhibit ACE inhibiting activity, and could improve blood pressure in hypertensive rats [50] . They found that there was a significant reduction (p˂0.05) in the ACE mRNA levels by 76.8, 68.6, and 87.7% in IQP, VEP, and biomass hydrolysates supplemented groups as compared to the control respectively. This was achieved by modulating the expression of local kidney renin angiotensin system (RAS) components via downregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT 1), while upregulating ACE2, Ang (1-7), Mas and AT 2.Additionally, peptic (SP) and tryptic (ST) protein hydrolysates of Spirulina platensis were also reported to inhibit the activity of peptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) (IC 50 -3.4 and 0.1 mg mL -1 ) and ACE (IC 50 -3.0 and 0.28 mg mL -1 ) in an in-vitro study and cellular assays in Caco-2 cells respectively [47] . Aiello et al. found that S. platensis peptic and tryptic hydrolysates were able to decrease the ACE activity in-vitro (measuring the formation of HA from HHL, a mimic substrate for Ang I) in a dose-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 0.1 ± 0.04 mg 13 mL -1 and 0.28 ± 0.03 mg mL -1 respectively. Similarly, both the hydrolysates were able to inhibit ACE activity in cellular assays in Caco-2 cells with IC 50 values of 2.7 ± 0.3 mg mL -1 and 2.8 ± 0.9 mg mL -1 respectively. Anekthanakul et al. [48] developed a -SpirPep‖ platform to assist in silico-based bioactive peptides discovery of bioactive compounds from Spirulina.They showed that peptides derived from Spirulina were mainly involved in the ACE inhibitory activity. They reported two new ACE substrate binding sites (R124 and S219) along with binding sites residues (D121, E123, S516, and S517) from natural ACE inhibitory peptides (angiotensin II and bradykinin-potentiating peptides) through which -SpirPep1‖ indirectly bound to ACE. Natural ACE inhibitory peptides from Spirulina have great potential in ACE inhibition and enhancing ACE2 activity [48] .ACE-Is are generally used for enhancing ACE2 activity for the treatment of tissue injury in various organs in severe cases of coronavirus infection. Since, different studies have shown potential applications of Spirulina derived ACE inhibitory peptides as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agent via enhancing ACE2 activity and reducing cytokine related inflammation [18, [47] [48] [49] [50] . Therefore, based on these studies, it can be postulated that supplementation of Spirulina derived ACE inhibitory peptides may play a potential therapeutic or subsidiary role in the alleviation and treatment of oxidative stress, cytokine release syndrome, and tissue injury in SARS-CoV2 and other coronavirus infections through the regulation of ACE2 activity (Fig. 1) . However, it is too early to assess the potentiality of these Spirulina derived compounds in SARS-CoV2 infection, which needs to be reconnoitered with basic and clinical research. 14 Novel sulfated polysaccharides from different algal resources are reported to exhibit antiviral properties and are of therapeutic use against different viral infections [23] . Novel sulfated polysaccharide derived from different species of Spirulina designated as calcium-spirulan (Ca-SP) was found to possess distinct antiviral activity against different enveloped viruses including Herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, measles virus, mumps virus, influenza A virus, and HIV-1 in different human cell lines [21, 22, 52] . Hayashi et al. [21] revealed the main mechanism of antiviral activity of Ca-SP derived from Spirulina platensis is found to be involved in the inhibition of viral replication, via selective inhibition of penetration of the virus into the host cell. The main components of Ca-SP were calcium, sulfate, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, xylose, galactose, fructose, mannose, ribose, and rhamnose. They suggested that the main antiviral activity of the Ca-SP might be exhibited due to the molecular conformation through the chelation of Ca-ion with sulfate groups. In another study conducted by Hayashi et al. [52] evaluated the antiviral potential of Ca-SP derived from Spirulina platensis against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as compared to standard dextran sulfate (DS).Mice treated intravenously with Ca-SP isolated from S. platensis showed increased serum concentration of 1000 µg mL -1 after 30 min of administration, which gradually decreased.Serum samples from Ca-SP administrated mice showed long-lasting antiviral activity against HIV-1 and HSV-1 even after 24 h of administration. This was significantly higher as compared to the representative sulfated polysaccharide DS [52] .Phycobiliproteins are a group of water-soluble proteins that possess antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial properties [53] . Water-soluble extracts of Spirulina are generally rich in phycobiliproteins, which also exhibit antiviral properties. A study conducted by Chen et al. [29] reported that cold water extract of Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis, Far II, which further binds to AT1R receptors and induces acute tissue injury. While, ACE2 hydrolyses Ang II to Ang (1-7) peptide that acts on the Mas receptor (MasR) and protect from tissue injury. It can be postulated that supplementation of Spirulina nutraceuticals in SARS-CoV2 infection may help to upregulate the ACE2 activity and downregulate ACE activity that may further assist to overcome CRS and aid in tissue protection and repair.

However, it possess higher potential of infectivity and transmission than other SARS family members Zhu et al., 2020) .Although ATP antagonists such as Remdesivir has been theoretically effective against the viral replication via RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibition (Gordon et al., 2020) , the concomitant general inhibition of other ATP-dependent enzymes like protein kinases and ATPases may result in numerous side effects. Therefore, the effective treatment of corona virus requires selective inhibition of certain host enzyme that is important for the viral replication with minimal effect on other enzymes which may affect the normal physiology of the host.Fortunately, kinase PAK1 is a selective enzyme which is important for malarial and viral infection (Maruta, 2014) . Activation of PAK1 is responsible for viral infection, malarial infection, aging and even cancer (Maruta, 2014) .Propolis or bee glue, a resinous material produced by bees to protect their hives, is rich in wide range of compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenolics, amino acids, resins and oils (Simone-Finstrom and Spivak, 2010) . Propolis is well-known for its antibacterial (Kujumgiev et al., 1999) , antiviral (Kujumgiev et al., 1999; Kumazawa et al., 2004) , anti-inflammatory (Banskota et al., 2001) and immunomodulatory effect (Marcucci, 1995) . Rutin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, Quercetin, p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, galangin, pinocembrin, chrysin, and Pinobankasin are among the active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of propolis (El Hady and Hegazi, 2002; Tolba et al., 2013; Lan et al., 2016; Badria et al., 2018) .Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), the major constituent of the Egyptian propolis, is one of PAK1 inhibitors which acts via the down regulation of RAC (a signaling protein in human cells) (Maruta and He, 2020) . In other words, CAPE is capable of blocking viral infection including corona virus and preventing coronavirus-induced lung fibrosis (Maruta, 2014; Maruta and He, 2020) .Another mechanism that may be implicated in the anti-viral effect of propolis against COVID-19 is the improved inhibition potential of propolis components, rutin, myricetin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester , on ACE II receptors (Güler et al., 2020) . ACE II has been proven to be strongly recognized by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS CoV (Wan et al., 2020) , hence increasing the opportunity to be transmitted from person to person. Therefore, blocking ACE receptors has an essential role in treatment of SARS-CoV-2.Collecting all those together, essentiates the need for a good delivery system for this promising natural product for the treatment of that pandemic disease. The efficient delivery of propolis may be hindered by the sticky and the resinous nature of the extract. Moreover, a special dosage form is required to deliver both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic contents of propolis extract. Therefore, this study aimed at optimizing a liposomal formulation for the efficient delivery of propolis components. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to formulate a nanocarrier dosage form to make the best use of propolis in treatment of COVID-19.Lipoid S75 (70 % phosphatidylcholine-containing fat free soybean phospholipids) was kindly given by lipoid company (Germany). Alcoholic extract of Propolis (PE) was purchased from VACSERA-EGYPT (Cell Culture Department). Cholesterol was obtained from Fluka chemical co. (India). Ethanol (absolute) was obtained from El-Nasr Pharmaceuticals, (Egypt).All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from (Sigma Aldrich).In this study, some compounds detected in the ethanolic propolis extracts were used as ligands for COVID-19 3CL-protease (main protease) (PDB ID: 6LU7) (Jin et al., 2020) ; COVID-19 S1 spike protein subunit (PDB ID: 7BZ5) (Wu et al., 2020) ; as viral targets in order to evaluate their binding affinities and identify their inhibition activities and binding modes at the active site of each target. The crystal structure of them was downloaded from protein data bank web site. All bound water molecules, ligands and cofactors were removed from the protein. All components were constructed on ChemDraw 3D structures using ChemDraw 3D ultra 9.0 software then they were energetically minimized by using MM2, JopType with 100 iterations and minimum RMS gradient of 0.01 and saved as MDL MolFile.Docking studies were performed using Molsoft Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) 3.4-8Cprogram as reported (https://www.rcsb.org/).PP-Lip were prepared by spraying technique reported by Refaat et al (Refaat et al., 2019) , nevertheless we aimed to modify the formulation parameters to increase the entrapment efficiency and release of the prepared liposomes with maintaining small particle size in the nanoscale. Briefly, propolis, cholesterol and lipoid S75 were dissolved in the minimal volume of absolute ethanol then sprayed (40 <ul>L per second stirred at 1500 rpm at 80ºC) on the surface of sucrose-containing distilled water (9% w/v). After evaporation of ethanol by stirring, the spontaneously formed liposomes were kept overnight at 4°C for optimum annealing of the formed lipid bilayer (Fueldner, 1981) . Manual removal of the cooled aggregated free unencapsulated propolis at the surface of the liposomal suspension was carried out.The percentage of entrapped content of flavonoids was measured exactly as reported byRefaat et al (Refaat et al., 2019) . First, free drug was removed by centrifugation of liposomal suspension at 15000 rpm at 4º C for 2h. Separated liposomes were washed twice in distilled water to confirm the complete removal of free propolis. Liposomes were decomposed by sonication in absolute alcohol then vortexed to form homogenous suspension which was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 minutes. The entrapped amount of flavonoids was calculated in 100µl of the separated supernatant by addition of 100µl of 10% alcoholic aluminum chloride.The volume was completed to 2 ml using absolute alcohol; then, the absorbance was dignified In vitro release of propolis from the prepared PP-Lip was studied using the semipermeable membrane which was immersed in 0.9 % sodium chloride solution one hour before use. Then the membrane was fitted on modified Franz cell with a reservoir compartment containing 20 ml phosphate citrate buffer containing 1 % tween 80 (pH 7.4) as a receptor media. Aliquots of PP-Lip formulations with equivalent drug content (1 mg) were added to the sample compartment.The system was shaken in a thermostatic shaker at 37 ± 0.5 °C at 50 ± 10 rpm. Samples of 1 ml of the release medium were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals over a period of 6 hours and replaced with the same volume of fresh media maintained at the same temperature.flavonoidal concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm according to woisky and salatino (Woisky and Salatino, 1998) . All these experiments were accomplished in a triplicate manner, the average values were reported, and cumulative percentage of released flavonoids was calculated.Lipid molar concentration, cholesterol % and flavonoidal loading were the three chosen factors to study their effect on the entrapment efficiency and release of the prepared PP-Lip.The factors were analyzed at three levels, Lipid molar concentration (LMC) (80, 60, 40 mM), cholesterol percentage (CH)% (66, 43, 20%), and drug loading (DL) (5, 3.25, 1.5 mg) ( Table   1 ). The 17 formulations were prepared according to box Behnken design and the response surface diagram was assembled using Design Expert software, version 11 (StatEase®, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and were used to optimize a liposomal formulation of propolis extract.To gain more insight into the effect of both propolis extract and the propolis liposomes on the inhibition of viral RNA 3CL-protease and consequently blocking viral replication, 3CL-Protease (SARS-CoV-2) Assay Kit was used . 3CL-protease inhibition was tested for propolis extract, propolis liposomes, solvent of the extract (alcohol) and Remdesivir as a positive control. 3CL-Protease in Assay buffer was diluted with 1 mM DTT at 3-5 ng/µl (90-150 ng per reaction). Thirty μl diluted 3CL-Protease enzyme solution was added to wells.Ten µl Remdesivir (500 µM) was added to the wells of the positive control. The inhibitor solution was prepared by dilution in 1% DMSO. Ten µl inhibitor solution was added to each well of ""Test Sample"". Five percentage was added to ""Blank"" and ""Positive Control"" wells.3CL-Protease enzyme was Pre-incubated with the inhibitor solution for 30 min at room temperature with slow shaking. Five mM 3CL-Protease substrate was diluted (1:20) in assay buffer with DTT, to make a 250 µM solution. Reaction was started by adding 10 µl of the substrate solution to each well. Plate was sealed and incubated overnight. fluorescence intensity was measured in a microtiter plate-reading fluorimeter (TECAN spark reader).To evaluate the antiviral potential of propolis extract and liposomal propolis against corona virus, real time PCR using classical cell culture was adopted (Günther et al., 2004) .Vero cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (4×104 /well). After twenty-four hours cells were infected with COVID-19 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. One hour later, the inoculum was replaced by fresh medium containing predetermined concentrations of test compound (extract solvent (alcohol), lipids, propolis extract, propolis liposomes, Remdesivir as positive control). Percentage of inhibition of COVID-19 replication was determined via estimation of viral RNA concentration using RT-PCR (Drosten et al., 2003) . Briefly, A 25-μl reaction was maintained using 5 μl of RNA, 12.5 μl of 2 X reaction buffer solution introduced with the Superscript III one step RT-PCR system accompanied with Platinum Taq To predict the antiviral activity of the components of the Egyptian propolis on a structural basis, automated docking studies were carried out using Molsoft ICM 3.4-8C program (https://www.rcsb.org/) the scoring functions and hydrogen bonds formed with the surrounding amino acids found in COVID-19 main protease and spike protein sequences are used to predict their binding modes, their binding affinities and orientation of these compounds at the active site of the single-crystal structures are available through the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB entries 6LU7, 7BZ5 respectively). The scoring functions of the compounds were calculated from minimized ligand-enzyme complexes.The 3CL-protease (main protease or M pro ) in COVID is essential for the proteolytic maturation of the virus and has been examined as a potential target protein to prevent the spread of infection by inhibiting the cleavage of the viral polyprotein (Abagyan and Totrov, 1994) .The discovery of the 3CL-protease structure in COVID-19 provides a great opportunity to identify potential drug candidates for treatment. Proteases represent potential targets for the inhibition of COVID replication. The 3CL-protease amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 (Verma et al., 2020) . N3, the native ligand binds to amino acid residues PHE140, ASN142, GLU166, HIS163, HIS172, HIS41, MET49, TYR54, MET165, ASP187. MET165, LEU167, PHE185, GLN192, GLN189, PRO168, THR190, ALA191, THR24 and THR25 at the active site of main protease (Liu and Wang, 2020; Wan et al., 2020) . Other amino acid residues as LYS102, GLN110, THR111, ASP295, ASN151, ILE152, ASP153, SER158, PHE294, THR292, are participating in the interaction at the binding pocket of 6LU7 to FDA approved antiviral compounds and active phytochemicals (Chandel et al., 2020; Dayer, 2020; Liu and Wang, 2020 (Figure 1, Table 2 ).The descending role of affinity to COVID-19 main protease is: Rutin > Caffeic acid phenethyl ester > Quercetin > Kaempferol > Pinobanksin > Galangin > Chrysin > p-cumaric acid > Benzoic acid. On comparison of these components of Egyptian propolis with Avigan, it is obviously observed that all propolis components have higher binding affinity than Avigan.Interestingly, Rutin has showed higher affinity than HQ. Moreover, Rutin showed a perspective binding affinity comparable to the potent antiviral drug, Remdesivir.The spike protein, S protein, is a class I fusion protein. Each S protomer consists of S1 and S2 domains with the receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the S1 domain (Narkhede et al., 2020) . S1 domain amino acid extended from 1 -745 where (RBD) located in it extended from 375 -604 (Han et al., 2017) . Amino acid residues of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD LYS417, GLY446, TYR449, TYR453, LEU455, PHE456, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, LYS489, GLN493, GLY496, GLN498, THR500, ASN501, GLY502 and LYS505 Are the residues in contact to ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020) . On the other hand, amino acid residues in Contact between COVID-19 virus RBD and both heavy and light chains of B38 are reported (Jin et al., 2020) . In this study, we docked certain components of Egyptian propolis, Avigan, hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir into the active site of S1 spike protein of COVID-19 (Figure 2, Table 3 ). The spraying technique has successfully produced a nanosized uniform PP-Lip, with the least aggregation of free unencapsulated propolis during preparation and with high propolis entrapment and release percentage mostly above 50% for both entrapped and release percentage ( Table 4 ).The effect of the three nominated factors was studied to optimize the formulation parameters for high entrapped and released flavonoidal content. The E.E% and released % were estimated for the 17 runs as the average of three replicates for each run and the results were provided in table 4.Design expert software was used to analyze the measured data and the equations of regression were produced as follows:Y F = X o + X 1 A + X 2 B + X 1 X 1 A 1 A 1 +X 2 X 2 B 2 B 2Where Y F represents the independent variable, X o is the response of the arithmetic mean of the seventeen runs, and X 1 is the assessed coefficient factor for A. The average produced by changing a dependent variable once is represented by A and B. Non-linearity is estimated using Table 5 shows that ANOVA of model of regression for the E.E% of PP-Lip was estimated by F-test and p-value. The highly significant p-value (P=0.0003) and the p-value of lack-of-fit which is greater than 0.05 (0.5248) indicate the capability of the fitted regression equation in justifying and expecting the results.Data obtained from the ANOVA was confirmed by studying the effect of each factor on the E.E % (Figure 4) . It is obvious that the results of individual effect of each factor confirmed the positive effect of LMC and DL on E.E%.The positive significant interaction between LMC and DL shown by ANOVA was confirmed by the interaction plot (Figure 5) . The interaction plot showed slight increase in E.E% on increasing the LMC at lower level of DL (1.5 mg/ml). On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the E.E % on increasing LMC at higher level of DL (5mg/ml). This observation was also evident in the 3D plot of E.E % and its relationship with LMC and DL ( Figure 6 ) where E.E % reached to higher values at maximum levels of LMC and DL. this is in consistence with Mostafa et al (Mostafa et al., 2018) who stated the increased E.E% of thymoquinone due to increased LMC. This could be attributed to increased width of lipid bilayer membrane. Interestingly, Arafa et al (Arafa et al., 2018) stated the increased E.E% of propolis with increased DL which could be attributed to the enhanced capacity of the prepared nanostructure. Unlikely, Results showed that CH% had no effect on E.E % of the prepared PP-Lip. This was in contrast with Mclntosh et al (McIntosh, 1978) who stated that increasing CH% leads to increased E.E % due to increased particle size and width of the prepared liposomes to entrap more drug. This discrepancy may be due the small particle size of the prepared PP-Lip prepared by modified spraying technique. Table 4 shows the results of the release study for the 17 formulations. The release % of (Figure 7) . This emphasizes the significance of the model and efficiency of the equation to predict the release % within the factors' levels used in the experiments. ANOVA of regression model for the release % of PP-Lip revealed a highly significant p-value, P= 0.0003 ( Table 5 ). The p-value of lack-of-fit was greater than 0.05 (0.6627) indicating that the equation of the fitted regression was good and capable of elucidating and expecting the results. Results show that CH% (B) has a dramatic significant negative effect on release unlike LMC (A) which has a slight positive effect on release % while DL has no effect on the release % (Table 4, Figure 8 ). The 3D plot (Figure 9 ) approves the effect of the LMC and CH% on release %. At LMC 40 mM, increasing the CH% from 20% to 66% decreases the release % significantly from 77.5±2.73 to 27.5±2.3, respectively. At CH% equals 20%, the release % shows the highest values with varying LMC. The slight positive effect of LMC a on release % may be attributed to the enhanced engagement of the lipid bilayer to the structurally similar cell membrane. Increasing Cholesterol % has resulted in lower release % which could be attributed increasing the rigidity and decreasing the fluidity of the lipid bilayer (Gier et al., 1969; Niven and Schreier, 1990) . Reduction of cholesterol concentration makes the liposomes more fluid enhancing the drug release and so drug pharmacological effects (A Ghaffar et al., 2017) .The preparation conditions were set in the box-behnken design to formulate PP-Lip with the highest E.E% and release %. The optimized formulation parameters were as follow: LMC of 60 m.mole, CH% of 20% and DL of 5 mg/ml. At those values the E.E% and released % were 70.112 % and 81.801%, respectively. Five verification experiments were carried out at these optimium conditions to ensure the model capablility to optimize the conditons as directed. The E.E% and released % were 68+2.4% and 76+3.2 %, respectively (Figure 10) . Release pattern follows the 1 st order kinetics with R 2 0.992. Furthermore, the Particle size of the optimized PP-Lip was 117+11nm (Figure 11) . These results indicate that the optimization process is successful in practical lab work .3CL protease has been an important target for the prevention of the replication of corona virus especially that it has not been found in hostcells (Akaji et al., 2011) . Results show that propolis extract possess a good inhibitory effect against covid-3CL-protease (IC50=2.452±0.11) (Figure 12) . That could be justified by binding of the studied propolisflavonoids to the active site of 3CL-protease. Competitive inhibition of the protease resulted from strong binding to such flavonoids could result in blocking the enzyme activity (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . Fortunately, that inhibitory effect was significantly enhanced via the encapsulation of the extract within the optimized liposomal formulation (IC50=1.183±0.06), P<0.001. We believe that the prepared liposomal system had the potential to flawlessly introduce both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic components of the extract via an enhanced surfaced surface area with avoiding the sticky nature of the extract.To gain more insight into the effect of the formulation of the propolis extract on the enhancement of the anti-viral effect on COVID-19 virus, viral replication was determined using RT-PCR. Results show the great impact of the optimized propolis liposomal formulation in enhancing the inihbitory effect of the encasulated propolis against covid viral replication compared to the unformulated propolis extract (87.9±1.2, 72.4±0.5, respectively) (P<0.0001).We suppose that encapsulation of propolis within an optimized liposomal system would enhance cell permeability of propolis components due to increased surface area available for endocytosis and the silmilarity of lipid structure of the liposomal membrane to cell membrane.Moreover, the liposomal system is capable of introducing both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic components of propolis for cellular uptake avoiding retaining of lipophilic components within the liposomal mebrane and/or poor cellular uptake of the hydrophilic components of propolis extract.Interestnigly, the optimized propolis liposomes has comparatively inhibited the replication of human corona virus such as remedsivir, antiviral drug with reported promising in vitro inhibitory effect on covoid-19 (Hashemian et al., 2020) (87.9±1.2, 91.2 ± 2.5, respectively), Figure 13 .The present study has revealed the anti-viral potential of flavonoidal components of Egyptian propolis. Molecular docking has shown that all propolis components have high binding affinity to COVID 3-CL protease and spike protein compared to Avigan, hydroxychloroquine (HQ) and Remdesivir. An optimized liposomal formulation could guarantee both the enhanced delivery to the target cells and the improved cellular uptake of encapsulated propolis. To the best of our knowledge, that has been the first study that estimates the effect of a nanocarrier dosage form on the enhancement of the anti-viral effect of Egyptian propolis extract against Covid-19. Further clinical studies are being carried out to estimate the effeciency of the optimized formulation against COVID-19.The authors declare no conflict of interest. 6.

[1] [2] [3] More than 200 countries and territories of the world have reported cases running into more than 30 million with a mortality of more than 945,000 by mid-September 2020. 4 The United States is the worst hit with more than six million cases, and several other countries like India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Mexico have reported more than 40,000 deaths each. 4 In Nigeria, about 60,000 cases have been reported with close to 1000 mortalities around the same period. All of these countries have instituted several measures to curtail the spread of the virus, although the number of cases is rising in some countries, flattening in others, while some are experiencing a decline.The WHO and several other stakeholders warned that the effect of the pandemic will be devastating in Africa because of weak health systems, inadequate health infrastructure, and the colossal poverty status of most countries on the continent. [5] [6] [7] However, the dynamics of the disease in Africa have not only surprised the world but also have defied all predictions from physicians, epidemiologists, and scientists globally. 8, 9 This is despite poor adherence to social distancing rule, overcrowded markets, and living homes. 10 Although the WHO suggested that the low cases were due to low testing rates across the continent, there has been no increase in clinical cases suggestive of the disease or reports of unexplainable deaths which could justify the WHO's stance. 11, 12 Several hypotheses were put forward to explain the peculiarity of the disease in Africa. These include a predominantly young population, high humidity, and protective cross-immunity from the myriads of endemic communicable diseases which may have primed the immune system. 10, 13 It is believed that most Africans have been exposed to the virus but did not come down with a severe illness because of these reasons. Many patients have presented to different hospitals for totally unrelated conditions and may have transmitted the infection to health workers without knowing. In fact, so many health workers, though asymptomatic, have tested positive for the virus suggesting that many more may have been through the completed life cycle of the virus incognito. To examine this claim, this study is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral IgG antibody in the serum of frontline healthcare workers at the University College Hospital, a tertiary hospital with 850 beds in Ibadan, Nigeria.Participants. This is a hospital-based cross-sectional study; healthcare workers who had not taken the COVID-19 test and had no COVID-19-related symptoms were randomly selected from different departments of the hospital. A structured questionnaire was administered to every participant to obtain information about sociodemographic, medical, and travel history. Some of the required information were age, gender, occupation, travel history between December 2019 and April 2020, comorbid condition, and involvement in the care for COVID-19 patients. Participants with recent febrile or respiratory illnesses were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Ibadan/ University College Hospital Research Ethics Committee.Sample collection and processing. About 2 mL of venous blood was obtained from the participants and stored in plain sample bottles; these were left to clot while standing for 2 hours at room temperature. The clotted samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 minutes, and the sera obtained were frozen and stored at −20°C until the time of analysis which lasted about 1 month. Samples were analyzed using the ELISA technique for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG according to the manufacturer's protocol (Elabscience Biotechnology Inc., Houston, TX). The manufacturer's declared intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variations were < 8% and < 10%, respectively, on low-, mid-, and highlevel samples, each being tested 20 times.Statistical analysis. Qualitative and quantitative variables including the proportion of seropositivity were reported in percentage. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between demographic and clinical variable and seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 IgG. A P-value of < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY).A total of 133 hospital workers were recruited for this study. They comprised 55 (41.4%) medical doctors, 33 nurses (24.8%), 19 (14.3%) health assistants, 18 (13.5%) laboratory scientists and technicians, and eight (6.0%) nonmedical staff working in various departments within the hospital (Table 1) . Overall, 63 (47.4%) of the participants were male, and the departments from where recruitment was carried out included surgery, medicine, emergency, private suite, obstetrics and gynecology (O&G), chemical pathology, hematology, microbiology, and accounts (Table 1 ). Close to half of the entire participants (49%) were between the age of 31 and 40 years.Sixty participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, indicating a seroprevalence of 45.1% in the study population (Table 1) . Among the seropositive participants were 27 (45.0%) doctors, 14 (23.3%) nurses, 10 (16.7%) health assistants, four (6.7%) laboratory scientists and technicians, and five (8.3%) nonmedical staff ( Table 2) . Grouping of study participants by department where they work showed that 90% of O&G staff, 60% of emergency staff, 59% of medicine staff, 33% of microbiology staff, 32% of chemical pathology staff, 23% of surgery staff, and 21% of private suite staff recruited for this study were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the study participants recruited from hematology was seropositive.Logistic regression analysis showed no association between seropositivity and participants' age, gender, or occupation (P > 0.05) but was associated with the participants' departments. The participants from emergency and O&G departments showed significantly higher odds of seropositivity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.151; P = 0.039 and OR = 19.286; P = 0.010, respectively; Table 2 ). History of travels within Nigeria during the pandemic (OR = 1.329; P = 0.428) and being in a gathering of more than 100 people (OR = 1.102; P = 0.790) were associated with increased risk of seropositivity, though not statistically significant (Table 3) .The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa did not reflect the devastating prediction from the WHO and other health agencies across the world. Although the magnitude of morbidity among healthcare workers was quite high in most countries with high disease prevalence, the same cannot be said for Africa, despite low precautionary measures. 14 In this study, 45% of healthcare workers were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, despite having no symptoms and providing routine services to patients presenting with a myriad of clinical conditions. Seropositivity was found across all cadres of healthcare workers, ranging from clinical personnel to nonmedical staff members. Workers within the age of 31-40 years were mostly affected, and those from the O&G and emergency departments recorded the highest odds of seropositivity.The prevalence of COVID-19 is believed to be grossly underreported across the globe 15 ; several countries have gone ahead to publish seroprevalence among the general population. [16] [17] [18] Disease burden in Africa was predicted to outrightly overwhelm the already weak health system with a high mortality rate far above the European and the American figures. 19, 20 However, only five African countries (South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Nigeria) are in the top 50 countries with the highest mortality rate worldwide. 21 There is no evidence to support that Africa did not have a good share of the pandemic, given the volume of trade and travel between the continent and Asia, Europe, and America. There is however a good reason to believe that Africa did not experience the same severity of disease found in the other continents. 22 Objectively, the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic healthcare workers in this study was 45%, indicating a latent exposure to the disease, and this is even higher than seroprevalence in the general population in France, Italy, and Spain where mortality was massive. 23 This high prevalence is not surprising because the hospitals were opened for most of the pandemic period, and healthcare workers continued to attend patients with minimal precautionary measures. Most of the patients presented with conditions mostly unrelated to COVID-19, whereas those with risk factors including travel history and contact with COVID-19 patients deliberately refused to disclose their status in the hospitals for fear of stigmatization. 24 This attitude is believed to have encouraged a covert transmission among the general population and, consequently, the healthcare workers. 24 Surprisingly, there have not been reported increases in cases of morbidity likely because of undiagnosed COVID-19 or mysterious deaths on the same scale as found in Asia, Europe, and America.Similarly, every cadre of healthcare workers in this study recorded seropositivity, indicating that the exposure was widespread within the hospital environment. This is not unexpected because the study site is a tertiary hospital within a metropolis and members of staff come from different parts of the city where chances of community transmission are very high. In other places where community transmission has been documented, they were accompanied by staggering morbidity and mortality rates; this however was not the case in the African continent. 25 The youthfulness of the African population, which has been identified as one of the protective factors against the disease severity, also comes to bear in this study because more than half of participants who were seropositive were between the age of 31-40 years. A review of the distribution of seropositivity within different cadres of healthcare workers suggested that the professionals who have more contact or spend more time with patients are more likely to be seropositive; this pattern has previously been described. 26 Doctors, nurses, and health assistants, in that order, recorded more seropositivity in this study than laboratory scientists/technicians and the nonmedical participants. This study also suggests that seropositivity within each department reflects the volume of patients attended to on a regular, basis with O&G, emergency, and medicine departments having higher seropositivity rates than microbiology, chemical pathology, and surgery departments. This also lends credence to a high possibility of community transmission; however, majority of them were asymptomatic and were silently infecting healthcare workers. 27 There were limitations to this study. A larger sample size involving every department from the hospital would have been more reflective of the seroprevalence; however, the major clinical departments with significant patient flow were included in this study. More so, a quantitative assay of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG would have been more informative and offered important basis for comparison; this study essentially describes prevalence, for which a qualitative assay was considered sufficient.In conclusion, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among the healthcare workers recruited for this study, although they were asymptomatic. It was not clear whether they got the infection from patients, colleagues, or the community where they reside, but chances of community spread appear to be considerably high, despite low disease severity, compared with the reports from European and American countries. This calls for more stringent precautionary measures among healthcare workers and provision of personal protective equipment, which has been reported to significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity. 28 These measures will hopefully help forestall further spread.

Coronaviruses in human beings cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases [2] . In December 2019, the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans was found in China (Wuhan city, Hubei Province) [3] and on 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the temporarily named nCoV-2019, now called SARS-CoV-2. The WHO declared the disease a global pandemic in March 2020 [4, 5] . Worldwide, 25.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 since it was first identified, with about 850,000 deaths as at September 1, 2020. Presently, there are 6.8 million active cases of the disease across the world, of which 99% are of mild conditions [6] . Ghana announced the presence of the disease in the country (through vertical transmission) by confirming the first two COVID-19 cases on March 12, 2020. As at September 1, 2020, Ghana has recorded 44,298 confirmed cases with 276 deaths [7] .Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been the most preferred method for diagnosis of COVID-19 infections worldwide. In some instances, computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging of the thorax have been employed for diagnosing COVID-19 patients who manifest conditions such as difficulty in breathing. Also the imaging modalities have been employed for some suspected COVID-19 cases due to regional preferences, lack of availability of PCR assays, and false-negative PCR assays, as well as for monitoring of disease progression, complications, and treatment response [8] .Knowledge and perception of healthcare professionals on transmission and control of SARS-COV-2 infection are essential to avert outbreak of the disease in healthcare settings. With these in mind, this survey was designed using the facts on COVID-19 as stated by the WHO [9] , to assess the levels of awareness of radiation medicine professionals about the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the means to prevent the outbreak in radiation medicine facilities. Specifically, the study determined the level of knowledge on the SARS-COV-2 infection prevention, transmission and symptoms of COVID-19 as well as perceptions regarding prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection in relation to the radiation medicine practices in radiological health facilities. Findings of the survey would confirm the need or otherwise for a tailored and specific educational and other interventions to reduce the risk of the transmission of SARS-COV-2 in radiation medicine facilities. Additionally, it will provide relevant information on the appropriate translation of the general knowledge on infection prevention to practice-related preventive activities in the practise of radiation medicine. Using the facts on COVID-19 as stated by the WHO provides standardized information that will be useful for global comparison and adoption.This cross-sectional descriptive survey was carried among radiation medicine professionals who were reached on online, using the professional groups' WhatsApp platforms. The WhatsApp platforms were purposively selected to include all the related professions that work in radiation medicine. Any professional member in active service who was on any of the professional WhatsApp platforms was included in the study.The survey tool was designed and developed de novo, using facts on COVID-19 as presented on the WHO's website as at 17 th April, 2020. Additionally, few relevant misconceptions and myths were used in the development of the survey tool. The tool consisted of nine symptoms considered to be either common, less common or serious. It also consisted of six facts on the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 infection. Furthermore, and of most importance was the inclusion of 12 facts related to the prevention/control of the infection at a radiation medicine facility. Lastly, five facts about the use of radiation medicine procedures and technologies in the fight against COVID-19 were included. The tool was a structured questionnaire which was self-administered.This minimal risk-survey was designed in line with ethical principles related to the protection of research participants. Given that the target population of the study were persons who have had higher than secondary education, a selfadministered information sheet (provided on the first page of the questionnaire) informed the participant of the purpose of the study, the risk of participation, what was required of a respondent, and the lack of direct benefit to respondents. Persons who were willing to participate in the survey were to indicate so by ticking a box on the form, which subsequently activated the next steps on the Google Form. Confidentiality of the data was ensured by not collecting information that will lead to identification of the respondent. Access to the data on the server was restricted by a two-way pass code.Given that a Google form was used for data collection, data was directly entered into Microsoft Excel, 2013 version (Microsoft Corp., USA). All responses on the Likert scale were coded (weighted) on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 and 2 (average of 1.0 to 2.5) indicated inappropriate level of the measure of interest, 3 (2.6 to 3.5) indicated limited level of the measure of interest (such as lack of knowledge) and 4 and 5 (3.6 to 4.5; 4.6 to 5.0) indicated adequate and appropriate level of the measure of interest. The Weighted Average Index (WAI) of the responses to each question was determined. Again, the WAI of the responses of each respondent to question related to each measure were determined as the composite level of each measure. The average of these represented the composite level of each measure for the survey; these were the primary outcomes. Additionally, the proportion of the respondents (distribution) on the scale was also determined and presented as a bar chart.The distribution of the characteristics of the 145 respondents showed that most of them were male (77.9%) and within the age groups of 30 -39 years (62.1%). The commonest highest attained educational level of the participants were Bachelor's (39.1%) and Master's degrees (42.1%). Given that the survey was targeted at a professional group, the distribution showed that diagnostic radiographers were the majority (65.5%); however, all the closely related professionals were represented (Table 1) . Again, the respondents were from all types of health facilities, but respondents from Tertiary healthcare public facilities were the majority (37.9%).The results as presented in Table 2 shows that overall, the extent of knowledge on the symptoms of COVID-19 among the respondents was adequate (WAI of 3.8). The symptoms of COVID-19 that was most known, and at the appropriate level among the respondents were; Shortness of breath as a serious symptom, and Fever is a common symptom, with WAI of 4.7 and 4.6 (on a scale of 1 to 5) respectively. Table 2 presents the WAIs of the remaining symptoms; three were at adequate level, and four were at limited level.Again, the overall or composite level of knowledge among the respondents, this time on the transmission of the causative virus of COVID-19, was adequate (WAI = 4.1; Table 3 ). Specifically, the extent of knowledge on the fact that ""SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) infection can be transmitted through small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person"" among the respondents was almost excellent, with a WAI of 4.9. Among the remaining five facts, as presented in Table 3 with their respective WAI, four were at an adequate level, while the fact ""The risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) through faeces is very high"" was limited (WAI = 3.5).The overall thinking regarding the 12 measures of control of the infection of SARS-COV-2 in a radiation medicine facility was determined to be adequate for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in such facilities (Table 4) . Specifically, the thinking that ""Hand washing and sanitizing facilities are required to be made available in a radiation medicine facility"" was almost perfectly shared among the respondents (WAI = 4.9). Table 4 shows that the extent of the perception on eight other control measures were appropriate, with WAI ranging between 4.6 and 4.8. The extent of the perception on the control measure ""After scanning or treatment of a suspected COVID-19 patient in a radiation medicine department, the equipment has to be completely avoided for up to 1 h "" was the least perceived procedure in the control of spread of COVID-19 (WAI = 2.9) on the control of infection at such radiation medicine facilities. A further analysis of the overall perception of the respondents regarding the use of radiation medicine procedures in management of COVID-19 was diverse (WAI 3.5; Table 5 ). The plurality of perception of the respondents on two of the five facts showed positive consensus (3.6 to 4.2) and the remaining three were diverse (WAI of 2.6 to 3.5). The most perceived fact about radiation medicine procedures (highest positive consensus) was that computed tomography (CT) is the most preferred imaging modality for screening patients for COVID-19 (WAI = 4.2).In order to contribute to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana, and provide insights that are useful for other regions of the world, in keeping with the ethical principle of solidarity, this survey worked at assessing the level of awareness of radiation medicine professionals to prevent the transmission of SARS-COV-2 in radiation medicine facilities.The effectiveness of the sampling approach employed (WhatsApp platform of professional groups) at ensuring appropriate internal and external validities of the survey was confirmed by having a similar distribution of the categories of the professions as is in the professional association's register (Table 1) . Specifically, the ratio of males to females was about 3:1. However, the category of professions were only limited to the five indicated in Table 1 and the proportions of the categories may not reflect the general distribution. The selected radiation medicine professionals (diagnostic radiographers, medical physicists, radiologic technicians, sonographers and therapy radiographers) who completed the survey are classified as allied health professionals, per the professional categorization in the health structure of Ghana. The professionals play a key role to ensure that spread of SARS-COV-2 within the radiation medicine centres is at the barest minimum. Together with other health professionals such as doctors and nurses, some of these professionals who work at the major health facilities and at the COVID-19 isolation and treatment centres were classified as frontline health workers. This meant that the level of knowledge of radiation medicine professionals on the symptoms of COVID-19 ought to be high. This is because good knowledge about the symptoms of COVID-19 has been identified as one of the key elements in winning the war against the pandemic [9] .The study has identified adequate level of knowledge amongst the allied radiation medicine professionals ( Table 2 ). The WAI of 3.8 implies that the professionals are adequately informed about the overall symptoms (common and less common as specified by the WHO) associated with COVID-19. This observation projects a high tendency of the identification of potential COVID-19 patients within the radiation medicine sector, where the professionals interact Both patients and staff are required to be screened (temperature check) before entry into a radiation medicine facility 4.8 Appropriate A good practice in radiation medicine facilities during COVID-19 pandemic is to place staff on shift system 4.7 Appropriate Radiation medicine professionals are required to undergo training on the safe use personal protective equipment (PPEs) 4.7 Appropriate Maintenance of air flow is important for infection control in a radiation medicine facility after imaging / treating suspected COVID-19 patientsWearing of face mask is effective against SARS-COV-2 infection 4.6 Appropriate Symptoms of COVID-19 in infected persons are observed mostly between 2 -14 days 4.6 Appropriate Ideal distance to be maintained from an infected person with COVID-19 is 1 m (3 feet) 4.0 Adequate It is advisable to disinfect radiation medicine equipment after each working day, only when such equipment was used on suspected COVID-19 patient(s)After scanning or treatment of a suspected COVID-19 patient in a radiation medicine department, the equipment has to be completely avoided for up to 1 hOverall / Composite Score 4.4 Adequate Ultrasound is a reliable imaging modality for screening patients for COVID-19 3.2 Diverse Planar X-ray is the most preferred imaging modality for screening patients for COVID -19 2.6 Diverse Overall / Composite score 3.5 Diverse among themselves, patients and sometimes patients' relatives. Such an environment could be a fertile ground for the spread of SARS-COV-2 if professionals are not at least adequately knowledgeable in identifying symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. When symptoms of the disease are picked up early in radiation medicine centres, such suspected COVID-19 patients can quickly be isolated and be given the needed attention and care while preventing any potential spread.The study also identified that the most known symptom was shortness of breath, a condition associated with severe to critical COVID-19 cases. A large proportion of COVID-19 patients in this state may experience breathing challenges and will likely be recommended for X-ray imaging or CT scan, modalities within the domain of medical imaging professionals. This observation could be a strong reason for the exhibition of very high knowledge levels on the shortness of breath by the radiation medicine professionals.Symptoms that were identified as less known and with limited knowledge level included loss of taste, headache and sore throat, while loss of speech and movement being serious symptoms of COVID-19 were the least known. It is undesirable that some professionals did not have adequate knowledge on the common symptoms (as specified by the WHO), implying that they may not be able to apply extra caution to a potential SARS-COV-2 infected person who is at the early stage of COVID-19 and visits a radiation medicine facility for a radiological procedure. More education is required in this direction to upscale the levels of knowledge associated with the observation above. Observation of the adequate knowledge about the common symptoms of SARS-COV-2 among the allied radiation medicine professionals in this study are similar to observations reported in studies such as Kotian et al. [1] and Nkansah et al. [4] , in which knowledge of health professionals on COVID-19 were assessed.Information on the transmission routes for SARS-COV-2 has been widely disseminated in digital, social and mainstream media during the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. These are anticipated to match with the levels of knowledge of the general public, more especially health professionals, whose line of duty can easily predispose them to infection by the virus. The study identified that radiation medicine professionals have adequate knowledge (Table 3 ) on the transmission of SARS-COV-2, which is a good step towards preventing spread of the disease. Specifically, almost all (99.3%) of the respondents indicated that SARS-COV-2 infection can be transmitted through small droplets from the nose and mouth of infected persons. As has been generally communicated by WHO and by several researchers [10, 16] transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur through direct or indirect routes, or by close contact with infected persons through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. Additionally, the study revealed that there were adequate levels of knowledge regarding the facts that SARS-COV-2 infection transmission could be through airborne processes, as well as through cleaning and draping of radiation emitting equipment. Also, the respondents demonstrated adequate knowledge that COVID-19 patients are most infectious when they manifest symptoms of the disease. Studies by the WHO and other agencies have suggested that respiratory secretions or droplets expelled by infected individuals can contaminate surfaces and objects, creating fomites (contaminated surfaces). SARS-COV-2 virus could be found on those surfaces for periods ranging from hours to days, depending on the ambient environment (including temperature and humidity) and the type of surface, in particular at high concentration in health care facilities where COVID-19 patients are treated [10, 17, 18] .Transmission of SARS-COV-2 through cooked food and through faeces, which are suggested by infectious disease experts to be less likely [9, 19] were adequately known by the respondents of this study. Other reported transmission modes could be bloodborne, mother-to-child, and animalto-human transmission [10] . More generalized educational interventions may be necessary for radiation medicine professionals on the transmission of SARS-COV-2.In controlling SARS-COV-2 infections in radiation medicine facilities, perception of the personnel about recommended control measures is key to achieving the desired compliance and by extension the needed results. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments, including that of Ghana (acting through their ministries of health and agencies), announced several control measures and directives to deal with the disease. In radiation medicine centres and health institutions in general, examples of such measures included wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPEs) by health personnel, provision of hand washing and sanitizing facilities, decontamination of the departments, reducing numbers of patients and staff at any given time to decongest the facilities and screening (temperature checking) of persons before admission into the facilities.The study identified that similar perceptions about the directives as given by the Ministry of Health towards safety practices for controlling SARS-COV-2 infections were almost perfectly shared among radiation medicine professionals (Table 4) .Other good infection control practices that were highly shared among the respondents included placement of radiation medicine staff on shift system, training of the personnel on the use of PPEs and maintenance of air flow in radiation medicine centres. Instituting these measures, among others, have been documented to produce a good environment that can adequately control infection of SARS-COV-2. Example of such study by Hasford et al. [20] assesses safety measures in radiation therapy departments in Africa. Further practices that ensure good infection control and which recorded at least adequate perception levels amongst the professionals were the effectiveness of face mask against SARS-COV-2 infection and keeping to a 1-m distance away from infected COVID-19 patients. These control measures are in conformity with recommendations of the WHO [10] which advises that ""at all times, practice frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing from others when possible, and respiratory etiquette; avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation; wear fabric masks when in closed, overcrowded spaces to protect others; and ensure good environmental ventilation in all closed settings and appropriate environmental cleaning and disinfection"".There have been varied opinions and practices among scientists and health professionals on the frequency with which medical equipment should be disinfected ever since the world was first hit with COVID-19. This is reflected in the responses of the study participants, where diverse perceptions are presented as to whether it is advisable to disinfect radiation medicine equipment after each working day, or only in cases where the equipment has been used on suspected COVID-19 patients. A ""school of thought"" is that specific medical equipment ought to have specific recommended periods (based on the usage, frequency, etc.) beyond which disinfection must necessarily take place so as to ensure that high level of hygiene is adhered to, and transmission of viruses and other pathogens are reduced. Most diverse of the perceptions is whether scanning or treatment equipment need to be avoided for up to 1 h upon usage for suspected COVID patients. Some clear guidelines should be given by the Ministry of Health to personnel in radiation medicine so as to influence their judgement whenever confronted with such situation.Radiation medicine procedures have played a critical role in management of the reported COVID-19 cases in hospitals. Results from this study indicate that levels of perception among radiation medicine professionals was a positive consensus (Table 5 : WAI 4.2) that CT scanning is the most preferred imaging modality for screening patients for COVID-19 while MRI is least likely to be used. Ordinarily, CT scan of the thorax region would be more preferred than the other imaging modalities for critical assessment of lung conditions that may lead to shortness of breath (as in the case of severe to critical COVID-19 cases) [21, 22] . Though planar X-ray imaging of the chest is also frequently used to assess lung conditions, it is comparatively limited in diagnostic information it can provide as compared to CT scans. Expectedly, most of the respondents agreed on the score that CT modality is the most preferred, while diverse perceptions were displayed about planar X-ray being the most preferred. Perception about the use of low dose X-rays for treating severe pneumonia arising from COVID-19 was also diverse. This is an evolving area, with not so much research data available, hence varied perceptions as observed in the study were expected. Some studies [20, 23, 24] have shown that lowdose, whole lung radiation in the form of X-rays can effectively treat severe pneumonia, with minimal side effects. However, it is necessary for more research work (clinical trials) to be done to confirm the findings. The findings of this study imply that much of the educational intervention and sharing of information among medical staff by the national COVID-19 management team need to be directed more intensely at improving the levels of knowledge on symptoms of COVID-19 and transmission of SARS-COV-2 among the radiation medicine professional in Ghana. Additionally, this study encourages radiation medicine professionals to consistently update themselves of the growing development on the use of imagining procedures for managing COVID-19 as new information becomes available globally to inform their perception.As part of the measures to reduce the risk of an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 infection in radiation medicine facilities, this study shows clearly that aspects of the awareness of radiation medicine professionals on the COVID-19 pandemic are only adequate, while others need critical improvement.","Ghana","first author","2020-11-27","11"

From China there was evident human to human transmission and the resultant importation of the virus internationally leading to a global pandemic. Countries had to implement quarantine measures for returning travelers from highly affected countries and contacts of confirmed cases in order to stop local transmissions [2] . The World Health Organization describes quarantine as separation of asymptomatic people exposed to an infectious disease from the community with the mandate of monitoring symptom development for early detection of cases and cutting down chains of transmissions [2] . It can be carried out either at homes or in facilities. During SARS 2003 outbreak, countries like Singapore and Taiwan successfully managed the disease through efficient home quarantines [3, 4] .From the 30 th of January 2020, Botswana instituted points of entry screening for COVID-19 at airports and land crossings. Travelers from highly affected countries were screened and asymptomatic ones were advised to go on 14 days home quarantine up until the 24 th of March 2020 when the country put in place facility quarantine. However, there was inadequate active follow up of clients on home quarantine. As of 31 st May 2020, Botswana had 38 confirmed cases, with only 11 local transmissions of which 8 were linked to one imported case (unpublished data). The number of local transmissions remained the same until cluster outbreaks were detected in July 2020. We seek to describe an imported case of COVID-19 that breached home quarantine regulations and the subsequent development of local transmissions in order to come up with recommendations to strengthen home quarantine strategy.A young male, XY, returned to Botswana from the United Kingdom on the 22 nd of March 2020. He was screened at Botswana's largest air point of entry, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, using a screening questionnaire and temperature check. He was found to be asymptomatic and advised to go under home quarantine. As he did not have his own transport from the airport he was picked up by a group of friends who then held a welcome home session for him at a residence in Gaborone. After 2 days XY travelled to a village 50km from Gaborone where he quarantined with his friend, XX, without reporting to the local health team. However, he then developed flu-like symptoms on the 28 th of March 2020 and called the local health team who upon learning that he arrived from a COVID-19 highly affected country, came prepared in full personal protective equipment and admitted him to the local isolation center. His friend was also put into isolation the following day. They both tested positive for SARS-COV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were Botswana's COVID-19 cases number 5 and 6 and his friend was the first local transmission case in Botswana. XY and XX contacts were all line listed and all close contacts were home quarantined and tested. 2 other XY's friends who worked at the same workplace of 105 employees became confirmed cases on the 8 th of April 2020. The employees and immediate families of the 2 friends were quarantined and tested where 5 more employees became confirmed cases. No further cases were discovered from their contacts.The breach in home quarantine regulations led to the initial 8 local transmissions in Botswana. The shortfalls identified from this case were that the index was given verbal instructions at the airport, had improper transport arrangement, mingled with many people and there was no active follow up in quarantine. It is our argument that this was a preventable situation had there been proper quarantine measures in place. As countries like Botswana are considering lifting travel bans and resuming international travel amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine of travelers from highly affected countries might still be necessary. It is not only returning travelers and close contacts of cases that are monitored at home but confirmed COVID-19 cases not requiring hospitalization can be placed under home isolation. Best practices should be in place so that these high risk groups monitored at home do not spread the COVID-19 infection defeating countries' efforts of epidemic control. Some factors associated with adherence to quarantine include perceived risk of disease, perceived benefit of quarantine, shortage of essential supplies and financial implications [5] . Therefore, whenever home quarantine is utilized it needs to be well organized and highly monitored to be effective [3, 4, 6] .Legally binding agreements signed by clients going under quarantine are one way of ensuring compliance. During the SARS outbreak in 2003 Singapore ensured compliance to home quarantine by serving clients with the Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) and fining those who breach it in addition to surveillance, enforcement, health education, transport, and financial support to those losing income by being in quarantine. Only 26 out of 7863 contacts of SARS cases served with an HQO breached the rules and were penalized [3] . Similarly, during the COVID-19 outbreak, Singapore instituted the Stay at Home Notice (SAH) for returning travelers that is as legally enforceable as the HQO to ensure compliance [7] . Taiwan has also previously achieved the high compliance rate to quarantine through registration, active monitoring, video monitoring and fines [4] . Through the Public Health Act, Botswana should legally bind those undergoing quarantine and rule breakers be fined as specified in the Act [8] . Additionally, all those who are caught breaking home quarantine rules should be moved to facility quarantine.Community structures can be mobilized to support home quarantine. An example is Shenzhen, China that controlled COVID-19 transmissions through effective management of home quarantine using the ""Three in One"" Task Force comprised of community work stations, community health centers and community police where community workers ordered and delivered necessities for those in quarantine and actively monitored them twice a day. This organized home quarantine had good results as only three out of 2,004 persons on home quarantine had confirmed COVID-19 infection [9] . African countries like Botswana can also use community structures such as village leadership, village development committees and community volunteers to monitor compliance of people on home quarantine. The neighborhood watch program (community policing) successfully used against crime can be extended to report neighbors breaking quarantine rules. High volumes of people on home quarantine require a lot of manpower to follow up clients daily. However, in the case of Singapore, they outsourced the service to a security agency and used auxiliary police officers instead of health officers in serving the HQO at homes. The officers made random checks by calling the clients twice daily to ensure that they stay home [3] . This is a stringent measure that can be adopted by countries to ensure compliance.Brooks et al. emphasized the need for psychosocial and other support services to minimize the stress of quarantine on individuals and ensure compliance [10] . The following is useful: information to help people understand why they need to quarantine and provision of food, general and medical supplies [5] . It is equally important that home assessments are carried out to ensure that conditions at home are favorable for home quarantine [2] . Technological advances can be adopted to instill compliance. In Shenzhen, there was use of a smartphone application called Ishenzhen which coded high risk and non-high risk groups and upon inspection only non-high risk people were allowed to go into the community [9] . Singapore tightened surveillance through camera installation at homes that mandated the client to present himself in front of the camera when called to prove that they are home [3] . Similarly, Taiwan also resorted to video surveillance of people who breached quarantine rules [4] . Ethical considerations should be taken not to step on the rights of individuals whenever technology is employed, for example in the use of electronic bracelets to track individuals on quarantine.Ethics and consent: this is work of the operational Botswana´s COVID-19 national contact tracing subcommittee that produces case reports as part of contact tracing. Permission to publish was sought and granted by the ethics body under Ministry of Health and Wellness Office of Health Research and Development. The case study uses existing contact tracing data reports and upheld confidentiality of patient´s information.Well organized home quarantines are a feasible alternative to facility quarantine for the control of communicable diseases like COVID-19. If not well managed, breaches in home quarantines can lead to the spread of local transmissions in the community. Home quarantine should be reinforced through legal binding quarantine orders, home assessments, health education, use of community structures, provision of support services in quarantines, use of technology for surveillance and taking legal action against those who break rules.(DHMT) contact tracing teams for their input in conducting contact tracing for the index case.","Botswana","abstract","2020-11-21","11"

(Labiatae)","The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has led to an unprecedented rate of mortality, with Italy, China, Spain and USA being the most hit (WHO., 2020) . It is caused by the novel b-coronavirus (enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus), SARS-CoV-2 which has a similar sequence identity to that of bat/human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SLCoV) Schoeman & Fielding, 2019; Tian et al., 2020) . Since its origin in Wuhan, China as a cluster of pneumonia cases in December 2019 which has spread globally (da Silva et al., 2020) , there have been search for effective antiviral remedies against the diseases. Lack of effective treatment coupled with no valid vaccines increases the number of infections and mortalities on a daily basis (Mehta et al., 2020; Onder et al., 2020) . The common symptoms of COVID-19 include sore throat, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, headache, conjunctivitis, diarrhea and fever (Pascarella et al., 2020) . The major cause of COVID-19 mortality is respiratory failure as present treatments are based on symptomatic management and respiratory sustenance (Pascarella et al., 2020) . Underlying ailments particularly diabetes mellitus and obesity have been implicated as high-risk factors of COVID-19 mortalities (Holman et al., 2020) . Boosting the immune system has also been reported as a preventive strategy against COVID-19, as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by exacerbated levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1-a, tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukins (IL)-2 and À7, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and granulocytecolony stimulating factor have been implicated in patients with severe conditions (Mehta et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . In vitro studies have reported the inhibitory effect of remdesivir and chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 activity , and have shown some therapeutic effects in clinical trials . However, studies have reported deaths in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine and its derivatives owing to severe arrhythmias . It has also been shown to suppress the immune system as well as inhibit autophagy and xenophagy . Interestingly, the dynamics of the said virus largely depends on the molecular interactions between spike protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Thus by implication, targeting these biomarkers have been reported as viable strategies for treating the disease (Gurwitz, 2020; Jiang et al., 2012) .The antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of medicinal plants have been reported Vijayan et al., 2004) . This has been attributed to their ability to modulate inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic activities of monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages Harun et al., 2015) , with their phytochemical constituents playing an influential role. Clerodendrum volubile is among medicinal plants reported for their immunomodulatory activities (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 2017; Erukainure, Zaruwa, et al., 2017; Erukainure et al., 2016) .Clerodendrum volubile is a leafy vegetable mostly utilized as food ingredients in Southern Nigeria (Erukainure, Sanni, et al., 2018; Erukainure et al., 2011) . Regarded as magic leaves, C. volubile is used in folk medicine for treating ulcers, arthritis, rheumatism, dropsy, and diabetes (Burkill, 1985) . Its antioxidant activities have been reported in diabetic rats, and cancerous cells which correlates with their antidiabetic and anticancer activities (Erukainure, Ashraf, et al., 2018; Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 2017; . The flowers as well as protocatechuic acid and pectolinarigenin isolated from the leaves have been reported for their ability to modulate phagocytic oxidative burst in isolated neutrophils and macrophages which demonstrates their immunomodulatory activities (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 2017; Erukainure et al., 2016) . The dichloromethane (DCM) fraction of the leaves have been reported for its cytotoxic effect on human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (Erukainure, Narainpersad, et al., 2018) . The leaves are rich in phenolics contents which has been correlated with its reported biological activities (Erukainure, Narainpersad, et al., 2018; Oboh et al., 2017) .To the best of our knowledge, this study reports for the isolation and characterization of a new iridoid glycoside, harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside from the leaves of C. volubile. Based on previous reports on the immunomodulatory properties of the leaf extract, it is hypothesized that the isolated compound may contribute to the modulation of the immune system in favor of suppressing CRS. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating the antioxidative burst potentials of the compound on polymorpho-nuclear neutrophils (PMNs), as well as its antiproliferative effect on T-cells. The ability of the compound to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated using combined in silico tools. This study also reports global epidemiology study of COVID-19 from January -August 2020.The 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded at temperature 300 K on Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer in MeOD. d (ppm) values were used for reporting chemical shifts. The 1 H-NMR spectrum was recorded for 128 scan using pulse sequence with an acquisition time 1.58 sec, relaxation delay of 1.5 sec, spectra width of 10,330 Hz and Intrinsic digital resolution of 0.3152 Hz with tetramethylsilane, TMS as internal standard. Hitachi UV-3200 spectrophotometer was used in obtaining UV spectra. A pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 plates (E. Merck, 0.25 mm) was used for thin layer chromatography (TLC), which was detected under UV light (254 nm) after spraying with ceric sulphate reagent. JEOL JMS-HX-110 mass spectrometer was used for recording EI-MS.Computational software used for this work includes ArcGIS 10.6 software, UCSF Chimera (v. 1.0.1), Discovery Studio 2017 R2 Client (v17.2.0.16349), Python prescription virtual screening software (PyRx, 8.0), ChemDraw Ultra v12.0.2, PatchDock server and other online computational tools available.We obtained freely available daily data of confirmed cases and deaths for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic across the world from the COVID-19 -Statistics and Research website from January 2020 to March 2020 (Roser et al., 2020; ECDC, 2020) . The COVID-19 -Statistics and Research team retrieves daily global and national statistics of COVID-19 from two credible sources, the World Health Organization (WHO) and, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We aggregated the daily confirmed data (cases and deaths) for each country into monthly data for January to March 2020, and subsequently performed the spatiotemporal distribution analysis of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using the ArcGIS 10.6 software (ESRI, Redland, CA, USA).Clerodendrum volubile leaves were obtained from local farmers at Ifon, Ondo State, Nigeria. The leaves were assigned a voucher number, UBH C284 after identification and authentication by Dr. Henry Akinbosun at the Herbarium, Department of Botany, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. The leaves were air-dried to minimize loss of volatiles and light-sensitive compounds (Thamkaew et al., 2020) before blending to fine powder and stored in a zip-lock bag at room temperature until further analysis (2 days).The blended sample was subjected to methanol (MeOH) extraction at room temperature. The solvent choice was based on the polarity of MeOH and reports as an optimal solvent for high content of phytochemical constituents (Truong et al., 2019) . The extract was concentrated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator. About 100 g of the extract was dissolved in MeOH/Distilled water (1:3), and thereafter subjected to gradient polarity based chemical fractionation using, n-hexane (Hex), n-dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and butanol (BuOH). All the fractions were collected, concentrated in vacuo and stored in glass vials at À20˚C. The EtOAc fraction was parked into a silica gelloaded column chromatography for further fractionation. The column was subjected to solvent elution starting with 100% hexane, and thereafter mixtures of Hex and EtOAc (9:1) in increasing order of polarity up to 100% EtOAc. Each elute was collected in glass vials and its purity was confirmed by subjection to thin-layer chromatography on pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 sheets. They were sprayed with ceric sulfate reagent, dried under hot-air (60 C), and viewed under UV light (254 nm). Elutes from Hex and EtOAc (8:2) showed a single spot. They were combined and concentrated in a fume compound, before subjection to NMR analysis for structural elucidation and identification. The compound was identified as harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside.The isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside) was fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with M06-2X functional with 6-31 þ G(d,p) basis. The frequency calculation was computed confirming no negative frequencies. The scaling factor of 0.964 was applied to evaluate vibrational frequencies (Johnson III, 1999) . The 1 H magnetic shielding constants, by chemical shifts, obtained on a d-scale relative to the TMS, used as reference was calculated on complex 1 and 2 using the Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method developed by Wolinski et al. (1990) . Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) through a single point (B3LYP/6-311 þ G(2d,p)) calculation was used for determining the 1 H NMR chemical shift (DMSO solvent: dielectric constant, e ¼ 46.826) (Cances et al., 1997; De Souza et al., 2017) .To determine the druglikeness properties of the selected compounds, a supercomputing facility for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SCFBio platform; scfbio-iitd.res.in) was used. 3 D structures of the compounds were submitted through the platform and the prediction carried out based on Lipinski's rule. Lipinski's rule considered five basic properties including molecular weight, hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, lipophilicity index (LogP) and molar refractivity of a compound (Jayaram et al., 2012; Lipinski, 2004) .The pharmacokinetics and oral lethal dose of the isolated compound was determined in silico via qualitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) vis-a-vis virtual molecular structure activity relationship studies (SARs) using the SwissADME Blood sample was collected from a consented apparently healthy volunteer, from which neutrophils were immediately isolated as previously described (Alyiu et al., 2014) . The isolated neutrophils were subjected to luminol-amplified chemiluminescence assay (Helfand et al., 1982) . Briefly, the isolated neutrophils (1 Â 10 6 /mL) were suspended in modified Hank's solution (MHS) and incubated with different concentrations (0.5, 5.00 and 50.00 mg/mL) of the isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside) for 30 min. Zymosan (1 mg/ mL) was thereafter added, followed by 25 mL of luminol (10 À5 M). A luminometer (Lab system Luminoskan RS, Helsinki, Finland) was used in recording the total chemiluminescence (CL). Control (þC) consisted of MHS containing cells only.Blood obtained from a consented apparently healthy volunteer was subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and proliferation to extract T-cells as described previously (Nielsen et al., 2003) . The cells were cultured in a 96-well round bottom tissue culture plate at a concentration of 5 Â 10 5 /mL. They were thereafter stimulated with 1.25 mg/mL of phytohaemagglutinin and incubated with the isolated compound (0.5, 5.00 and 50.00 mg/mL) at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 72 h. After incubation, the reaction was pulsed with titrated thymidine 0.5 mCi/well, and further incubated for 18 h. The cells were harvested with a cell harvester (SKATRON A.S. Flow Lab., Norway) into a glass fibre-filter (Cambridge Technology USA), and measured by counting with a liquid scintillation counter. After 120 s, the counts per minute (cpm) results were recorded . All studies were carried out under the ethical guidelines of the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA sequence SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA sequence was obtained from the PubMed database from the coronavirus whole genome (NC_045512.2). About 42 nucleotide sequence from both initiation and termination codons (Table 1) were converted into 3 D single mRNA strand and prepared for docking.The binding potentials of Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, Azithromycin, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir was studied by means of molecular docking. The 3 D crystal structures of 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) were downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB) with PDB ID; 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020) with resolution 2.45 Å. The suitable grid box was determined using AutoDock tools 1.5.4 (Sanner, 1999) . The ligands (CID_2719, 121304016 and DB00207) were obtained from PUBMED, while the isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside) was drawn using ChemDraw Ultra v12.0.2 and the file converted to pdb format. Initial optimization was done using Gaussian 09 (Frisch et al., 2009) , to obtain minimized conformations. The determined dimension was X ¼ 26 Y ¼ 26 Z ¼ 26 with 1.00 Å as the grid spacing. The optimum binding site for the ligand (Erukainure et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2013) was determined using Lamarckian genetic algorithm method. Gasteiger charges were computed using the AutoDock Tools graphical user interface supplied by MGL Tools (Morris et al., 2009 ).To address biological variability, wet experiments were repeated at least thrice. Where appropriate, results were presented as mean ± SD and subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey's HSD-multiple range post-hoc test was used in obtaining significant differences between means at p < 0.05. IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the analyses.The spatiotemporal distribution of confirmed monthly COVID-19 cases and deaths from January to March 2020 is shown in Figure 1 . The maps suggest the impacts of the disease (cases and deaths) were initially felt in China in January 2020 before it spread to other countries where noticeable spikes in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported in subsequent months. This suggests the epicentre of COVID-19 shifted from China to Europe (affecting mainly Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Turkey and Austria) at the end of March 2020. Other countries that reported high confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in March 2020 were the USA, Iran, Canada, South Korea, Brazil and Chile. However, African countries reported fewer cases and deaths of COVID-19 compared to countries in other continents from January to March 2020. While low confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 are continuously reported across Africa, US and Europe (especially Spain, France and UK) are still characterized by high confirmed COVID-19 cases and death. Other countries currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths are Russia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Iran, Iraq and most South American Countries (especially Brazil, Columbia, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Chile). This suggests, South America is currently the new epicentre of COVID-19 (Roser et al., 2020; ECDC, 2020).As shown in Figure 2 , harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside was isolated for the first time from the leaves of C. volubile. Its structure was elucidated using the combination of NMR, infrared and mass spectra data:Harpagide 5 Table 2 . Major hydrogen atoms are designated in the calculated 1 H-NMR spectrum.Drug likeness properties of the selected compounds were determined using criteria put forward by Lipinski. The result present in Table 3 and presents shown shows the parameter assessed, the scores and the reference value for each parameter, respectively. Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside showed strong compliance with respect to number of hydrogen bond donors, LogP and molar refractivity, except for hydrogen bond acceptors.In silico prediction analysis predicted harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside to be absorbed poorly in the gastrointestinal tract and not permeable across the blood brain barrier (BBB) as shown in Table 4 . Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside was also predicted as a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. The compound was predicted not to be an inhibitor of cytochromes As depicted in Figure 4A , incubation of harpagide 5-O-b-Dglucopyranoside with neutrophils significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited ROS production stimulated by zymosan in PMNs with an IC 50 value of 0.33 þ 0.01 mg/mL. The activity was dose dependent with increasing concentration. The compound also significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed the proliferation of T-cell proliferation, with a 26% inhibitory activity compared to the control as shown in Figure 4B .The binding potentials of Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside and standard FDA approved drugs (Azithromycin, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir) were studied by means of molecular docking. Ligand-protein interactions between viral protein (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), the host receptor target (ACE2) and Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside are presented in Figures 5-7 . Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside displayed a good binding in complex with the host receptor target, initiation and termination sequence of the viral spike protein messenger RNA compared to all studied standard drugs with binding affinities of À7.5, À6.4 and 6.3 kcal mol À1 respectively (Table 5) . Interestingly, it showed comparable binding affinity with Remdesivir, when in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a slight difference of 0.2 kcal mol À1 but better binding compared to Azithromycin and Chloroquine (Figures S2 and S3; and Table 5 ).As COVID-19 pandemic feasts, scientists and policy makers are currently making tireless efforts to reduce transmission components of medicinal plants against COVID-19 is receiving a little or no attention at this time. This is without taking cognizance of the facts that even the so-called drugs (Chloroquine, Remdesivir, Azithromycin etc.) that are being repurposed against COVID-19 had traceable origin to medicinal plants. Boosting the host immune system has also been reported to be beneficial in ameliorating the effect of the virus and the severe progression of the disease (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the potentials of harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, a new iridoid glycoside isolated from C. volubile leaves as a potential candidate for the inhibition of the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. The notable initial incidence and spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across China (Figures 1A and 1B) can be attributed to its novelty (Guan et al., 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020) . This resulted in the disease being transmitted through hospitals and infected medical staff unknowingly. In addition, vulnerable cases, 60 years and above with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma and other respiratory diseases contributed to the majority of the cases and deaths in China (Zhang, 2020) . However, the downward trend of the disease in China (Figures 1C -1F) can be related to her timely amendment of governmental policies which included enforcing restricted personnel movements in the epicentre of the disease (Wuhan city) and other areas of China Kraemer et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) , sharing vital prevention and control information (including wearing of masks, adequate washing and sanitizing of hands, symptoms and means of seek medical assistance), enhanced public health resources, providing improved and functional infectious disease surveillance, early detection systems and multi-sectoral rapid response systems to assist curtail the disease (Zhang, 2020) . China's overall initiative and strategies in response to COVID-19 can be attributed to the lessons and experiences of the SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 (Zhang, 2020) . Contrarily, limited medical resources and the delayed response in implementing policies restricting movements of people may have resulted in the surge of cases and deaths across Europe and other countries with high confirmed cases and deaths ( Figures 1E and 1F) . In other words, countries reacted slowly in implementing measures and policies to reduce the chance of contact between infected and vulnerable people. While the low recorded COVID-19 cases and related deaths across Africa can be linked with few vulnerable populations because Africa's life expectancy at birth is 61 years (World Health Organisation, 2018). Thus, a global health emergency that involves continuous collaborative surveillance, information sharing, researching and implementing evidence-based public health and clinical practices and formulating effective control strategies cannot be overemphasised. Furthermore, in-depth studies aimed at assessing the vulnerability of young people with underlying medical conditions and amongst different blood groups is important. These measures would be instrumental in the implementation of targeted intervention policies and resources.The 1 H NMR spectral of the isolated compound was compared to that of harpagide and allobentonicoside, compounds of close structural similarity as obtained in literatures (Jensen et al., 1989; Manguro et al., 2011; Venditti et al., 2017) . While harpagide has only one glucose unit attached at C-1 to the iridoid aglycone unit, the allobentonicoside has two glucose units attached at C-1 and C-5 as in harpagide 5- O-b-D-glucopyranoside. However, allobentonicoside has the hydroxyl converted to a carbonyl at C-6 with an unsaturation at C-7. The isolated compound has very similar 1 H and 13 C NMR data compared to the allobentonicoside ( Figure S1 ). However, the absence of carbonyl stretching vibration in the infrared spectrum confirms that the compound is not allobentonicoside. The molecular ion peak at m/z 549 obtained from FAB-MS for the isolated compound which corresponds to C 21 H 34 O 15 [M þ Na] further strengthens the claim of two attached glucose units as in allobentonicoside. The de-glucosidated aglycone was presented at m/z 387 calculated for C 15 H 26 O 10 in the FAB-MS spectrum. The isolated compound was thus presented as harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside as depicted in Figure 2 . The DFT calculated result for the 1 H-NMR and the calculated vibrational frequencies obtained showed good agreement with experimental ( Figure 3) . The 1 H-NMR chemical shifts, with a small deviation of 0.01 and 0.11 ppm for H-4 and H-9 (Table 2) , respectively. Others displayed slightly increased deviations from the experimental values, though these deviations are in accordance with previously calculated DFT 1 H-NMR calculations (De Souza et al., 2017; Olanrewaju et al., 2020) .Druglikeness properties of compounds screen-out promising ligands that are likely to be used as drugs based on some identified properties (Dong et al., 2018) . The properties comprise those considered crucial for both kinetic and dynamic interactions inside the biological system. Essentially, harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside displayed a potential druggable character, with the exception of a very few properties (Table 3) . Molecular weight indicates the mass as well as the size of a ligand and plays a greater role in determining the solubility, absorption and distribution of a given drug candidate (Doak et al., 2014) . Basically, the molecular weight of the new ligands reported in this work appears to fit within the acceptable range of this parameter. Hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in drug structures play an important role in water solubility, membrane transport, distribution, and drug-receptor interactions (Cheng et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2010) . Five hydrogen bond donors and ten hydrogen bond acceptors are required for a ligand to possess a satisfactory bioavailability and the optimum number of drug-target interactions via hydrogen bonds (Dong et al., 2018) . LogP indicates a relative concentration of the solute in octanol and water (octanol-water partition coefficient). It determines the degree of hydrophobicity of a ligand and plays a role in predicting drug absorption via the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane (Kumar et al., 2010) . Generally, a more polar compound typically encounters difficulties when passing through phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane (Yusof & Segall, 2013) . Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside demonstrated approvingly a very good partition coefficient (Table 3 ). This suggests that it can be efficiently transported across cell membranes, as passive diffusion through a cell membrane is a key element of transcellular absorption (Doak et al., 2014; Yusof et al., 2014) .The isolated compound was subjected to in silico pharmacokinetics and lethal toxicity analysis in order to predict its possible drug-drug interactions and toxicity when swallowed ( Table 4 ). The low GI absorption value insinuates harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside may not be easily absorbed by the intestine. The small intestine is known for its important role in drug metabolism as the large surfaces areas of villi and microvilli determine the rate of drug absorption via the oral route (Pang, 2003) . The low absorption of the compound may be attributed to its inability to permeate the phospholipid bilayers of the intestinal membrane owing to the lipophobic properties of most glycosides (Chao et al., 2006) . This may also be responsible for the predicted impermeability of the compound across the BBB. The prediction of the compound as a substrate of P-gp, suggests it is translocated from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment via transmembrane efflux mediated by P-gp (Kim, 2002) . This may be responsible for the low GI absorption of the compound as P-gp has been implicated in reduced bioavailability of its substrate (Constantinides & Wasan, 2007) . The predicted inability of the compound to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 insinuates that there will be little or no drugdrug interactions when co-administered with other drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes (Obach et al., 2006) . The predicted LD 50 value of 2000 mg/kg and toxicity class of 4 suggest the compound is safe for administration .Phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst has been implicated in innate immunity and inflammatory processes which are the major pathogenesis of COVID-19. Boosting the immune system particularly during the incubation and non-severe stages of the disease, has been recognized as a strategy to eliminate the virus and to suppress the progression to severe stages . Phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst involves the generation of ROS from increased nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption arising from dehydrogenation of glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (Allen, 1994; Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 2017) . Continuous phagocytic-induced ROS production will lead to an imbalance in the innate antioxidant system, thereby resulting in oxidative stress and provocation of inflammatory cytokines (Ciz et al., 2012) . Exacerbated inflammatory cytokine production often regarded as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been implicated in the onset and progression of COVID-19 stages (Mehta et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . Thus, arresting phagocytic respiratory oxidative bursts may be a therapeutic strategy in treating and managing the disease and its progression. In the present study, harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside suppressed the production of ROS in PMNs as shown in Figure 4A . Thus, indicating a suppressive activity on phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst and may be a good drug candidate in the treatment and management of COVID-19 and its complications. This activity correlates with our previous reports on the ability of extracts and isolated compounds from C. voluble leaves and flower to modulate phagocytic oxidative burst in whole blood, PMNs and macrophages (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 2017; Erukainure et al., 2016) .The suppressive activity on respiratory oxidative burst by harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside is further corroborated by its ability to suppress T-cell proliferation ( Figure 4B ). Proliferation of T-cell has been implicated in the activation of CRS, and studies have suggested that targeting T-cell proliferation may suppress the severe progression of COVID-19 .At molecular level, the viral envelope spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor within the host are central to COVID-19 pathogenesis and response to therapeutic interventions among other biological factors . Basically, it has been reported that envelope spike (S) protein is important for coronavirus pathogenesis as it mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion implicated in host tropism and transmission capability . Mostly, the S protein is functionally divided into the S1 domain, responsible for receptor binding, and S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. Structure analysis suggests that the receptor-binding domain is composed of a core and an external subdomain. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been reported to act as a cell receptor for the S protein (Kuster et al., 2020) . Therefore, targeting S protein and ACE2 at transcriptomic and proteomic levels could be a novel strategy for treatment and management of COVID-19. The docking simulations revealed that harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside binds better with the evidence of hydrogen bonding interactions with amino acid residues around the binding pocket of the host receptor target as well as the nitrogenous base and ribose sugar of the mRNA sequence of initiation and termination sequence of the viral spike protein m RNA (Figures 5-7) . Remdesivir in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displayed stronger molecular interactions when compared with CQ and AM ( Figure S3 ). However, it is comparable with harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside. This can be as a result of the four hydrogen bonding interactions with four amino acid residues in the bind pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to three of hydrogen bonding interactions found in harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside ( Figure S2 ). Remdesivir have been reported the recently to inhibit novel SARS-COV-2 in vitro, which invariably corroborated our findings (Table 5) . The good binding potential of Harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside can prevent or impair the recruitment of initiating and termination factors around mRNA sequence, thus affecting the ultimate translation of S protein mRNA. Equally, the strong and robust interactions were visible between the compound and S protein as well as ACE2 receptor (Figures 6  and 7) . Thus, qualifying it as a potential inhibitor of S protein mRNA translation vis-a-vis barriers that affect S protein and ACE2 receptor interactions implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis (Kuster et al., 2020) . However, further studies are needed to evaluate the actual efficacy of HG against SARS-COV-2 at in vitro and in vivo levels while targeting spike protein and its receptor at transcriptomic and proteomic levels.Taken together, these results suggest the immunomodulatory properties of harpagide 5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside isolated from C. volubile leaves which may be explored in the treatment and management of COVID-19. This is further corroborated by its strong molecular interaction and binding with the translation initiation and termination sequence sites of S protein mRNA and S protein of SARS-COV-2 and its host receptor protein (ACE2 receptor). In addition, there is a need for implementation of targeted intervention policies and resources which should include a global health emergency involving continuous collaborative surveillance, information sharing, research and implementation of evidence-based public health and clinical practices.","South Africa","first author","2020-11-03","11"

We found that age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p<0.001), symptoms onset between 3 and 14 days (aOR:1.35, 95%CI:1.09)1.68, p=0.006), fever or history of fever (aOR:1.75, 95%CI:1.42-2.14, p<0.001), cough (aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.31-2.04), sore throat (aOR:0.65, 95%CI:0.49-0.85, p=0.002), ageusia (aOR:2.24, 95%CI:1.42-3.54, p=0.001), anosmia (aOR:6.04, p<0 .001), chest pain (aOR:0.63, 95%CI:0.47-0.85, p=0.003), myalgia and/or arthralgia (aOR:1.64, 95%CI:1.31-2.04, p<0.001), household cluster (aOR:1.49, 95%CI:1.17-1.91, p=0.001) and evidence of confirmed cases in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neighbourhood (aOR:1.92, 95%CI:1.56-2.37, p<0.001) could help discriminate COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative. A screening score derived from multivariate logistic regression was developed to assess the probability of COVID-19 in patients. We suggest that a patient with a score ≥ 14 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A patient with a score ≥ 30 should be considered at high risk of COVID-19 and should undergo testing but also need prompt isolation and contact tracing.COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; clinical findings; screening; score; prediction Prompt detection, contact tracing and quarantine of cases are estimated to be highly effective in controlling the transmission and reducing mortality from COVID-19 (Kretzschmar et al. 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020) . Therefore, screening based on clinical features is critical at community level especially in a context of local transmission of the virus. We aimed to assess whether some symptoms and combination of several of them could help discriminate COVID-19 among patients attending 2 screening centres.We included in this analysis routinely collected data on patients attending the screening centre at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Joseph Raseta Befelatanana J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (CHUJRB), Antananarivo from May, 6 to July, 1 and from July, 4 to August, 14 for those attending the screening centre at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Tambohobe (CHUT), Fianarantsoa. We excluded patients with unknown or inconclusive PCR results. We have also investigated whether the patient lives in a neighbourhood or an area where COVID-19 patients were previously confirmed (neighbourhood) and whether other people living in the same dwelling are symptomatic (household cluster).We compared clinical and epidemiological features of confirmed cases with those with negative test for SARS-CoV-2 by univariate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression model. We used β-coefficient multiplied by 10 and rounded to the nearest multiple of 2 derived from the logistic regression model to generate a screening score to ascertain the probability of COVID-19 in patients aged≥15 years considering a combination of clinical signs and epidemiological features. The performance of the model was assessed by ROC curve. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were estimated for each cutoff. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, LP). We collected data on 3154 patients. Overall characteristics and comparison between patients with negative and positive PCR results among those symptomatic were detailed in can be obtained with a cut-off point of 30 but with a Se of 34.4%. A cut-off of 34 will provide a LR+ of at least 5 which can be considered red flags according to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f commonly arbitrary definition (Struyf et al. 2020) . The area under the ROC curve was 0.7723 (95%CI: 0.75-0.79). The internal validation using 1000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset found a ROC curve area of 0.7614.We suggest that a patient with a score ≥ 14 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A patient with a score ≥ 30 should be considered at high risk of COVID-19 and should undergo testing but also need prompt isolation and contact tracing.Previous study has shown that prediction models that include routine blood tests in addition to clinical findings are efficient to assess the probability for COVID-19 (Sun et al. 2020 ). However, availability, access and affordability of blood tests limit their use in resource-limited settings. A trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is challenging when considering screening tool for suspect cases. Nevertheless, more sensitive tool is often needed and preferred in an ongoing outbreak. A recent systematic review of signs and symptoms in COVID-19 showed low sensitivity of these signs when taken separately (Struyf et al. 2020) . A recent study in Somalia showed that the current WHO case definition for COVID-19 had only 32.7% (95%CI: 20-48) sensitivity that could be slightly improved when integrating anosmia in the case definition (Ahmed et al. 2020) . Anosmia and ageusia are highly specific of COVID-19 and have the highest scores in the model even if they were present in only 27.3% and 16.2% of patients (La Torre et al., 2020; Liou et al., 2020) . Surprisingly, dyspnoea was not associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 test and was associated with negative test in univariate analysis. Similarly, self-reported contact with confirmed case did not help discriminate SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.Patients may have exaggerated when reporting symptoms like dyspnoea and other subjective signs or contact with confirmed cases because of panic and fear. The same situation has been observed in previous outbreak in Madagascar (Salam et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020). In addition, epidemiological link is difficult to identify when community transmission occurs. More objective signs like respiratory rate or measure of Sp02 by simple pulse oximetry that may be helpful in detecting silent hypoxia in COVID-19 were more reliable (Dhont et al. 2020; Jouffroy et al. 2020) .It is also anticipated that considering neighbourhood as a criterion for screening will be less relevant as the epidemic progresses in the community.This study had several limitations. We could not assess other type of cluster that may be relevant like occupational clusters. Using level of transmission for each neighbourhood or area by considering attack rate would have been more accurate.Finally, a prospective external validation of the score is needed.A screening score based on combination of clinical and epidemiological features could help front-line healthcare workers to classify patients according to their probability of COVID-19.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa322.

It is also the third country in term of deaths with a number of 1,465 after South Africa (13,308) and Egypt (5, 298) [2] [5] .In this work data were recorded from different sources.Epidemiologic characteristics regarding COVID-19 cases and deaths and demographic characteristics of patients were directly obtained from the Algerian Ministry of health websites dedicated for COVID-19 informations [5] [6] and from the daily reports of the Bulletin épidémiologique published by the Institut National de la Santé Publique (INSP) [7] . Some informations concerning laboratory testing and preventive actions not available in the national sources or scientific publications were extracted from some media reports and news. CI = the total number of cases / the total population at the beginning of the epidemic [8] (here we take data of the total population of Algeria in 1 January 2020 which was estimated at 43216714 inhabitants) [9] -Epidemic Growth Rate (r) r(t2−t1) = In(CI2) − In(CI1) [8] -Doubling Time (Td) Td = In (2)/ [In(CI2)−In(CI1)] = In (2)/r [10] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f R 0 = 1+ r Tg where Tg represents the mean generation time/serial interval [8] Here we used the median serial interval reported by Nishiura et al. (2020) [11] which was estimated at 4.6 days.-Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT)We used the formula of Kwok to [12] calculate the HIT which represents the minimum proportion of a population that needs to be immune by vaccination or natural infection in order to halt the spread of an infection in that community.Since the first case reported in the department of Ouargla (South of Algeria), the epidemic curve has shown multiple facets. It has had to wait 5 days to see the true beginning of a new outbreak in the department of Blida on March 1 st 2020 becoming the epicenter of the epidemic [1] . This department has recorded the highest numbers until July16 th where the department of Algiers took the first place [6] . Also, after the clusters reported in early May in Since last May, the number of cases seemed to highly increase reporting the highest number (675 cases) on July 24 th , 2020 which is associated not only with the lightening of the prevention measures but also to the increasing in screening capacities ( Figure 2 ).These numbers have traduced a significant increasing in Cumulative Incidence (CI) as shown in table 1.With a current number of 42519 cases, the morbidity rate is estimated at about 969 cases/million [6] .As shown in figure 3 , the growth rate has shown an increasing in the first three weeks ofMarch reaching a peak of 1.3. Since then, this rate has shown a net decrease until the last weak of June (0.1) where a slow increasing was observed in the first three weeks of July toshow another slow decreasing for three weeks. Regarding case fatality, the national rate is about 3.5 %. This rate has shown a remarkable decline since April 15 th where Algeria reported the highest rate in the world of 15.8% ( Table   1 ).The highest rate is observed in Sidi Belabbas (9.3%), Bordj Bou Areridj (7.3), Tizi Ouzou (6%), Algiers (5.7%) and Tamenrasset (5.7) [8] . It is to note that this high rates are especially related to the low number of realized tests (see below).At last, it is to note that 29,886 persons recovered from this disease representing a rate of recovery of 70.1%.In Algeria, data showed that, the most affected categories by COVID-19 diseases in Algeria are those aged between 25 and 49 (42.1%) and older person of more than 60 years (34.3%).Patients of less tan 25 years old represents 5.3% while those aged between 50 and 59 years represent 18.3%. Also, men (54.2%) seem to be more affected than women (45.8%) ( Figure   4 ).Regarding severe cases and deaths in Algeria, even not precisely established, the available data reported that 75% of the total died persons in the country were older than 60 years [6] .Since This manuscript describes the evolution, characteristics and implemented measures to fight against COVID-19 in Algeria.Results showed that Algeria still be infected by the COVID-19 epidemic. However, despite some weakness regarding laboratory screening and health system, the urgent implemented measures have avoided the surpassing of health system capacities.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ","Algeria","abstract","2020-11-24","11"

Hand hygiene is considered an important preventive measure in response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Hand decontamination by handwashing with soap and water or the use of hand sanitizers is necessary for reducing the transmission of the disease. 2, 3 When access to handwashing facilities is limited or water sources are insufficient, alcohol-based handrubs (ABHRs) offer a convenient, effective, and relatively low-cost alternative worldwide, especially for developing countries. [4] [5] [6] Use of hand sanitizers as preventive measures is advocated by governments and health officials in the globe to combat the disease. 7 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings. 8 Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are regulated as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others. 9, 10 Hand sanitizers have become an essential product in hospitals and the community in day-to-day life. They have gained much popularity and have become a highly accepted form of personal hygiene because of their effectiveness and ease of use. 11 A shortage of hand sanitizers in the global market has been observed due to a sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 12 World Health Organization (WHO) suggested local production of ABHRs by using either of the two formulations, one based on ethyl alcohol and the other is isopropyl alcohol-based to ensure the availability of the hand sanitizers. 11 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the drug regulatory authorities in some countries have relaxed legislation and provided temporary licenses for local companies to produce hand sanitizers rapidly to meet the increasing demand. [13] [14] [15] Consequently, there has been a surge in the production of large quantities of ABHR products by various companies and attempting to respond to the unprecedented demand which may also be associated with some potential risks. 6 Assuring the quality of these products will enhance compliance of healthcare providers and other individuals to these products and contributes in the containment of COVID-19 and other infections. Similarly, a rush in the production of sanitizers has been also observed in Ethiopia in the era of COVID-19 especially in the capital city, Addis Ababa. 16 Ethiopia reported the first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020, 17 two days after it was declared as a global pandemic by WHO. As of October 22, 2020, the country has reported a total of 91, 693 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1396 deaths. 18 Among this, more than half of the cases were from the capital, Addis Ababa (46,570).Before the sudden outbreak of this pandemic, the hand sanitizer market in Ethiopia was found to be dormant. However, the appearance of the first COVID-19 case in the country has resulted in an overwhelming, demand for hand sanitizers. The quest for hand sanitizers was intense in the capital city, Addis Ababa, as it was evidenced by long lines of customers in the city pharmacies especially in the first few weeks period. To address the demand for ABHRs during this pandemic, the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA) had prepared a guideline for the production of the sanitizers 19 and given temporary production licenses for more than 100 manufacturers in the country to produce ABHRs in which most are available for sale in Addis Ababa. 20 The authority had also advised these companies to join the market with products that meet the quality standards. 21 Despite this, there are such products for sale in the streets of Addis Ababa where the sources are not clearly known.The drug manufactures and small scale chemicals and cosmetics producers are the main sources of hand sanitizers for the city as well as the country at large. In addition, some beverage firms have reconfigured their operations to produce hand sanitizers. Small firms are also among the licensed ones to produce hand sanitizers for the local market. 20 Most of them are manufacturing hand sanitizers based on formulation 1 of the WHO guide in which ethyl alcohol is the main active ingredient. 22 The relaxed legislation attracted many institutions to involve in the manufacturing of ABHRs which may raise the issue of quality of the products since most did not have adequate experiences of production of similar products. The increasing number of such products in the Addis Ababa market may also make the follow-up and quality assessment challenging.Even though the hand sanitizers should be prepared under similar conditions routinely followed to compound other non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations, 23 lack of adherence to the good compounding practice principle has been observed from some manufacturers which were exhibited in inferior strength for alcohol content; lack of packaging integrity; incomplete labeling information; and decreased consumer acceptability. 16 Failure to adhere to such standard of ABHR production practice has negative consequences for users which includes failures in the effectiveness of the preparation in combating infections and posing the individuals at risk due to poor quality products.In April 2020, EFDA reported that 10 hand sanitizers were banned from the market as they exhibited quality defects and some of them were marketed without a manufacturing license from the authority. 16 Moreover, following the initial widespread availability of ABHRs in response to the first COVID-19 case report in the country, quality evaluation of 20 different ABHRs from the Addis Ababa market was done by the Ethiopian Standards Agency. The result revealed that 70% of submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 products were found to be below the WHO limit for alcohol strength (less than 75% v/v) and all products failed to meet the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) content limit (0.125% v/v). 24 Such failures of products to meet the specifications may lead to loss of activity and microbial contamination of the products that can be sourced from the excipients and packaging materials which ultimately jeopardize the purpose of hand sanitizers. The people will not be benefited from the use of such substandard products that instead endanger users' safety.By considering the unprecedented public demand and use of hand sanitizers, peoples engaged in selling different goods in the streets of Addis Ababa city included this product as one item from the menu. They also believed that some people prefer such market places due to the relatively cheaper price than products obtained from legal sources (eg pharmacies and supermarkets). Currently, so many ABHRs are being sold in the streets of different corners of the city along with other goods. Such marketplaces do not meet the proper storage conditions recommended for the product. Moreover, the sources of these products are not known as most are sold without labels in contrast to the country's regulatory requirement. 25 Such lack of labeling information (eg name of the product and its composition, direction for use, handling and storage conditions, expiry date, and batch number) on the product packaging containers makes users not follow the appropriate ways of ABHRs use and make them difficult to take necessary precautions during use. In addition, it is difficult to recall the sanitizers from the market when defects are observed from these products. Furthermore, these products may contain unacceptable active ingredients (eg methanol) other than the recommended alcohols (ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) that can be toxic to consumers because of respiratory and dermal exposure and may cause even death if swallowed. 6, 9 The Food and Drug Administration had reported the presence of some methanol containing hand sanitizer products in the United States market. 26 Cases of methanol poisoning in the era of COVID-19 pandemic were indicated elsewhere 9,27-29 which created an additional burden for the health care system and caused people fatality. Even with the recommended formulations, the preparations may become toxic to human health when misused. 30 Though it is highly recommended to avoid ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, there may be unintentional swallowing that is life-threatening and the problem is worse for methanol containing products.WHO recommends incorporating glycerol in the ABHRs to protect skin from dryness and contact dermatitis with repeated use. 6, 22 Consumers are raising the issue of skin dryness after using ABHRs obtained from the streets of the city. Even though these products are claimed to be hand sanitizers, there are no guarantees on the incorporation of other functional ingredients, like glycerol and hydrogen peroxide, to the preparation other than the alcohol. As the wide use of hand sanitizers is expected to continue for prevention of COVID-19 and beyond, the repeated use of such substandard products for long periods will make the skin drier and prevent the adherence of consumers for hand hygiene using ABHRs.WHO advised not to incorporate other ingredients in the formulation which are not indicated in its guideline as the antimicrobial efficacy can be limited and the physicochemical properties of the product may be altered which otherwise their influence should be evaluated. 22 But, most sanitizers marketed in the streets were colored and had specific flavors in which their nature and concentrations are not known. Such incorporations of coloring and flavoring agents may not be comfortable for some consumers due to allergic conditions as suggested by WHO. 22 There are also many risks associated with low-quality hand sanitizers which include harm to healthcare providers, patients, and the general public. Unless these quality issues are addressed and managed appropriately, the risks may outweigh the benefits of these products. Since ABHRs are considered as non-prescription drugs, appropriate regulatory control should be in place over the distribution of these products in the city.Though the number of ABHRs in the streets seems less as compared with those available in the pharmacies, supermarkets, and other distinguished selling areas, a significant number of consumers are using sanitizers from the streets' source as they are relatively cheaper than other sources. Generally, hand sanitizers marketed in the streets of the city are against the country's regulatory requirement.Hence, EFDA should take appropriate measures on such streets' products in which their nature and sources are not clearly known. Besides, appropriate information should be disseminated to the general public through different media about the potential risks of using ABHRs available in such market places and advising them to avoid using such products. Although hand sanitizers quality issues had been aired in some occasional Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress programs by local media, short messages regarding the health hazard resulted from substandard hand sanitizers shall be aired continuously on mass media to get the users alerted and encourage them to prefer products obtained from the known sources. Furthermore, the authority should undertake a regular inspection of manufacturers and quality testing of sample hand sanitizers from the market as their kind and number are increasing rapidly. 20The current perspective can serve as an indicating study for researchers and other interested bodies to have a better outlook for understanding the problem. Besides, an overall quality assessment of hand sanitizers sourced from the streets of the city, using the current study as a baseline, can be conducted and forward the timely recommendations for the regulatory body of the country and other relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, the quality concern of such products pointed out by this study may call the attention of the regulatory body given for such products and take appropriate measures to safeguard the general public.The author declares no conflicts of interest.

Mathematical models are applicable in disciplines such as epidemiology, physics, biology, electrical engineering, economics, sociology, political science, and several other areas. Mathematical models can take several forms which include differential equations, dynamical systems, and game models. Studies related to mathematical models involving differential equations have also different forms based on whether ordinary derivatives or fractional derivatives are used in the models; even though the second is the generalization of the first. There are many publications of studies involving mathematical models with fractional derivatives namely Caputo fractional derivatives, Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives, Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivatives, and fractal-fractional derivatives. For detail concepts related to these studies involving fractional derivatives and their application, one can refer [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and the references therein.One of the central parts in the study of the epidemiology of infectious diseases is mathematical modeling and its analysis. Analysis of mathematical models designed for given infectious diseases or a pandemic like COVID-19 results in several important outputs including transmission trajectories, critical levels requiring intervention, the peak time of the infection, expected size of infection and recognizing best working intervention strategies. This helps governments or stakeholders to answer disease control policy questions.Coronavirus is an infectious disease declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by World Health Organization [12] . Since then it has claimed the life many thousands of peoples and posed a huge threat to public health all over the world [13, 14] .As a response to this risk, many scholars around the world tried to conduct research to understand the transmission dynamics and to analyze the effect of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in lessening the spread of coronavirus.Some of the researchers are mathematical modelers. Since January 2020 these scholars around the world have developed mathematical models to understand the transmission dynamics of [15] [16] [17] [18] Coronavirus. Mathematical models developed were mainly used to investigate the effects of different Non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies via simulation using different computing soft-wares [19] .Different mathematicians used different types of mathematical models in their analysis. For instance, an SEIR model was introduced by Wu et al. [14] for estimating the spread of the pandemic and approximated the basic reproductive number to 2.68 based on reported data. Tang et al. [16] used a deterministic model to estimate the basic reproductive number to be as high as 6.47 and they concluded that contact tracing followed by quarantining and then isolation can mitigate the spread of the pandemic via reducing the basic reproductive number. Kiesha et al. [19] used an SEIR mathematical model to simulate the outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan and indicated that restricting the Wuhan people's movement could help in delaying the peak time of the pandemic. Roda et al. [20] used the SIR model to predict the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan and predicted the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city.Pang et al. used SEIHR mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of quarantine measures applied in Wuhan city and factors affecting its effectiveness [21] .In this study, we used a mathematical model called SEIAHR, where the state variables S, E, I, A, H, and R represent susceptible, exposed, symptomatically infected, asymptomatically infected, isolated, or hospitalized, and Recovered/immune cases respectively. We have divided the infected cases into two groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Since most of the patients of COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or symptomatic, it seems reasonable to consider these two groups in developing a model and analysis.Moreover, some of the studies considered above didn't consider optimal control analysis of multiple intervention strategies. In this study, we designed three non-pharmaceutical control strategies named public health education, use of personal protective measures, and treatment of the patients. We have made both analytical analysis and numerical simulation of the effect of these strategies in mitigating the transmission of the pandemic.In general, the rest of this article is organized as follows: In the second part of the work, the mathematical model is formulated; equilibrium points and the basic reproductive number are calculated. The third part deals with the local and global stability analysis of both the equilibrium points followed by numerical simulations. In the fourth part sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number is conducted followed by numerical simulations. In the fifth part of the article, optimal control analysis is made analytically followed by numerical simulations. Lastly, discussions and conclusions are provided.A compartmental approach is used to develop the mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission dynamics. The total population N is divided into six compartments named S, E, I, A, H, andR as explained in the introduction part. The flow chart of the model is shown in Fig. 1 .In the mathematical model developed in this study, humans get into the suspected group S at the rate of α and infected with Coronavirus as a result of contact with individuals in the group of A or I.. The exposed group E gains population from infection induced by the Coronavirus.A proportion α 3 , (0 < α 3 < 1) of the members of the group E advance to the asymptomatic group A and the remaining proportion 1 − α 3 progresses to the symptomatic group I. People in the group I and A progress either to the Hospitalization group H or recovery group R at the rates indicated in the Fig. 1 and Table 1 . In the construction of the mathematical model, the exposed compartment E is included because people who are contracted with the virus don't get infectious immediately; there is an incubation period for the virus to get infectious. The groups I and A are included in the model, as people infected with Coronavirus are either symptomatic or asymptomatic. COVID-19 induced death rate α 11 is also considered in the model. As a result, the authors are convinced that the model considered in this study named SEIAHR model incorporates all essential components of COVID-19 to study its transmission dynamics, in agreement with the definition of a mathematical model in [1] . The parameters and their corresponding values used in the model are indicated in Table 1 .Corresponding to the aforementioned discussion and the flow chart in Fig. 1 the mathematical model used in this study called SEIAHR model is shown in (1),The parameters indicated in Table 1 , used in the model (1) are all assumed to be non-negative. The rate at which I cases are transferred to H cases α5 0.6000/day [24] The cure rate of I cases α6 0.05/day [25] The cure rate of A cases α7 0.0714/day [25] Natural mortality rate α8 0.00004563/ day [25] The rate at which H cases are transferred to R cases α9 0.04255/day [22] The rate at which A cases are transformed into H cases α10 0.03 assumed coronavirus induced death rate α11 0.0018 [25] Existence and uniqueness of solutionThe mathematical model (1) needs to be biologically valid in the sense that the solutions of the model must be positive and bounded for all time t. The proof is given in the following lemmas. Proof:. Since all the parameters in the model are assumed positive it is possible to set a lower bound for each of the equations in (1) as follows:Solving the above inequalities respectively leads to,Thus, for all t ∈ [0, t 0 ], S(t), E(t), I(t), A(t), H(t), and R(t) are positive in R 6 + . It then follows that dN dt ⩽0, for N⩾ α α8 . Thus, solving dN dt ⩽α − α 8 N by applying Gronwall's inequality leads to.Moreover, by the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem [26] and Lemma 1 and 2 proved above, there exists a unique, positive, and bounded solution for the system of the differential Eq. (1) in R 6 + .From model (1) two equilibria points are obtained:As a result, a positive endemic equilibrium point exists only for R 0 > 1 taking into account the assumption that α = α 8 N.In the next subsection, it will be made clear that R 0 is the basic reproductive number.The basic reproductive number, denoted by R 0 is obtained by establishing the next generation matrix [27] as a spectral radius of the matrix TV − 1 at N 0 . The matrices T and V − 1 are obtained by linearizing the mathematical model (1) about DFE, which results in the Jacobian matrix J DFE given in (2) .From the matrix, J EEP we construct a matrix M such that M= T+V, whereThe basic reproductive number is the spectral radius ρ(TV − 1 ) and is given by. R 0 can be written as..6 are as defined above.Local stability analysis of DFEis locally asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1.Proof: Three of the eigenvalues of (2) are given by λ 1 = λ 2 = − α 8 and λ 3 = − (α 11 + α 9 + α 8 ) which are all negative. The sign of the real part of the remaining three eigenvalues is determined by the Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria from the characteristic Eq. (4).whereFrom (4), we have a 2 > 0 andfor R 0 < 1 as R 1 and R 2 are positive and R 1 + R 2 = R 0 .Besides, a 0 = − l 1 l 3 l 4 +α 1 α 4 α 3 l 3 +α 1 α 2 l 2 l 4 = l 1 l 3 l 4 (R 0 − 1) > 0 for R 0 < 1, since l 1 l 3 l 4 < 0.All the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation ϕ(λ) = λ 3 +a 2 λ 2 +a 1 λ +a 0 = 0, have a negative real part by Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria as it can easily be shown that a 0 − a 2 a 1 < 0.That is,Thus, the diseases free equilibrium point N 0 is locally asymptotically for R 0 < 1 .Proof:. Suppose R 0 > 1 so that the EEP exists. Now the Jacobian matrix J EEP evaluated at the EEP is given byTwo of the eigenvalues of the matrix J EEP areremaining four eigenvalues are determined if they have a negative real part or not by the method of Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria from a characteristic Eq. (5) given below.whereThe coefficient b 3 can easily be shown to be positive and b 2 , b 1 , b 0 are also positive as shown below:one can be concluded that, all the eigenvalues of the characteristic Eq. (5) have a negative real part. Therefore, the EEP N * = (S * , E * , I * , A * , H * , R * ) is locally asymptotically stable for R 0 > 1.It must be noted that EEP exists if and only if R 0 > 1 as shown in section 2.2.Global stability of DFE Theorem 3:. The DFE is globally asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1. Note that, by the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we have⩽0.Thus, we have proved that F is a Lyapunov function and Ḟ ⩽0.Therefore, it follows that the largest invariant set inThus, by LaSalle's invariance principle, the DFE is globally asymptotically stable.The global stability of EEP is explored by proofing Theorem 4.Theorem 4:. If R 0 > 1, then the EEP given by N * = (S * , E * , I * , A * , H * , R * ) defined in section 2.1 is globally asymptotically stable in the region Ω.Proof:. Suppose the basic reproductive number R 0 > 1 so that the EEP exists. Consider a Lyapunov function candidate L defined by,Differentiating Φ in the direction of the solution of model (1) results in,Replacing Ṡ ,Ė,İ,Ȧ,Ḣ,Ṙ from (1) leads to, Since all the parameters used in the model (1) are non-negative we have dΦ dt ⩽0 for γ 1 ⩽γ 2 , and dL dt = 0 if and only if γ 1 = γ 2 which in turn implies that dΦ dt = 0 if and only if S = S * ,E = E * ,I = I * ,A = A * ,H = H * ,R = R * . Thus, by LaSalle's invariance principle the EEP is globally asymptotically stable.As a result of Theorem 4, the pandemic persists in society whenever R 0 > 1 irrespective of the initial size of cases in the different compartments of the model.In this section, numerical simulation as a verification of the analytical proofs for local and global stability of the DFE and EEP is given. Runge-Kutta method and MatLab R2018a were used for the simulations.Firstly, let us consider the cases where R 0 < 1 obtained from a parameter value α 1 = 0.025 for which the corresponding basic reproductive number R 0 = 0.2048 < 1. A constant number of the total population,α 5 = 2.0778 and the natural mortality rate is equal to the birth rate of susceptible cases (α = α 8 ) is assumed for the numerical simulation. The other required parameter values used are from Table 1 and the simulation result for the different initial sizes of cases in the compartments is shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from the Figure that the number of cases in the compartments E and I starts decreasing to zero from the onset of the pandemic whereas the number of cases in the compartments A and H upsurges for about the first five days and then decreases down to zero provided that the initial number of cases are in the region Ω. The simulation results verify that the pandemic dies out from society irrespective of the initial population for the basic reproductive number R 0 < 1. This is also agreement with the analytical proof made above.Secondly, consider the case where R 0 = 2.0479 > 1 obtained from α = 136.98, α 1 = 0.25 and all other required parameter values in Table 1 . A constant number of population N = 1 is considered. The corresponding EEP is calculated to be N * = (S * , E * , I * , A * , H * , R * ) = (712.1554, 0.4883, 42.1347, 1080, 1299, 22998800 ). The simulation result is shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen from the figures the number of cases in each of the compartments converges to their corresponding EEP as time increase. The simulation result verifies the fact that the pandemic persists in society when R 0 > 1 regardless of the initial size of The purpose of this section is to perform a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number can be used to design a mitigation strategy to slow the spread of the pandemic by reducing R 0 . Sensitivity analysis [28] for the basic reproductive number mainly helps to discover parameters that have a high impact on the values of R 0 and hence should be targeted for designing intervention strategy. Moreover, sensitivity analysis helps to determine the level of change necessary for input parameters to find the desired value of a predictor parameter (see 3rd column of Table 2 ).Definition1 is used to find the sensitivity index of each of the parameters involved in R 0 . Definition 1:. Normalized forward sensitivity index of R 0 which is differentiable with respect to a given parameter ω is defined as [29] .Using this definition, the sensitivity indices of the parameters of the basic reproductive number are given in Table 2 .As shown in Table 2 , the highly sensitive parameter of the basic In the next part of this section, the effect of the sensitivity of some of the relatively sensitive parameters on the spread of the pandemic is shown using numerical simulation. The parameters considered are α 1 ,α 3 , α 5 , α 10 .We intended to stimulate different values of the selected parameters that reduce the basic reproductive number by 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. Accordingly, Fig. 4 shows the effect of various values of the most sensitive parameter α 1 on the number of exposed cases at the peak.As it can be seen from Fig. 4 , the number of cases at the peak without reducing the basic reproductive number (R 0 = 2.0479) is 175,500 on 193.9th day, whereas after reducing R 0 by 10% using α 1 = 0.2250 the number of cases reduced to133,600 on 227.3th day and the graph gets flattened as the peak day changes from 193.9 to 227.3. This amounts to reducing the number of exposed cases by about 24%.It can be inferred from Fig. 5 that, the number of cases at the peak without reducing the basic reproductive number (R 0 = 2.0479) is 175,500 on 193.9th day, whereas after reducing R 0 by 10% using α 5 = 2.0778, the number of cases reduced to 162,500 on 203th day of the pandemic and the graph gets flattened as the peak day is moved from 193.9 to 203. This is equivalent to reducing the number of exposed cases by 7.4%.As it can be seen from Fig. 6 , the number of cases at the peak without reducing the basic reproductive number is (R 0 = 2.0479) is 175,500 on 193.9th day, whereas after reducing R 0 by 10% using α 3 = 0.7000 the number of cases reduces to 135,100 on 224.2th day and the graph gets flattened as the peak day moved from 193.9 to 224.2. This amounts to reducing the number of exposed cases by about 23%.From Fig. 7 , the number of cases at the peak without reducing the basic reproductive number is (R 0 = 2.0479) is 175,500 on 193.9th day, whereas after reducing R 0 by 10% using α 3 = 0.0410 the number of 5 . Total number of exposed cases for values of α 5 = 0.6000, 0.7478, 1.3389, 2.0778 that reduces R 0 by 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively. cases reduced to 145,300 on 212.1th day and the graph gets flattened as the peak day changes from 193.9 to 212.1. This amounts to reducing the number of exposed cases by about 17.2%.It can also be observed upon comparing the simulation results in Figs. 4 to 7 that, the effect of reducing the reproductive number by 1% is consistent with the sensitivity index shown in Table 2 . That is, reducing the most sensitive parameter by 1% is most effective in reducing the number of exposed cases, and the effect on reducing the number of cases goes in order of their sensitivity index in absolute value. The same can be said about the effect of the parameters in reducing the number of cases in all the remaining compartments not simulated in this section.In this section, an optimal control analysis of three proposed control strategies is conducted. They are denoted by c 1 (t), c 2 (t), c 3 (t) respectively representing public health education, personal protective measures (wearing facemask, regular hand washing, and social distancing), and treatment of COVID-19 patients in hospitals to minimize the suffering from the diseases. Consequently, the mathematical model (1) modified to incorporate the control variables is as shown in (6):The objective is to find an optimal control for the three control strategies while reducing their relative coasts. We used Pontryagin's maximum principle [30] to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal control. The objective function in the time interval [0, t f ] is defined as in (7): Fig. 6 . Total number of exposed cases for values of α 3 = 0.8000, 0.7900, 0.7500, 0.7000 that reduces by 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively. Fig. 7 . Total number of exposed cases for values of α 3 = 0.0300, 0.0311, 0.0353, 0.0410 that reduces by 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively. Table 2 .The forward-backward sweep scheme MatLab code used in simulating the optimality system of this work is adapted from Martcheva [31] .The following six scenarios were considered for numerical simulation.Case. s I: c 1 (t) = c 2 (t) = c 3 (t) = 0. In this case, model (6) is simulated without any of the control strategies being optimally practiced. The result of the simulation is depicted in Fig. 8 .It can be seen from Fig. 8 that, the peak is in the range of 194-215 days of the pandemic. There are about 252,600 hospitalized, 250,800 asymptotic, 10,390 symptomatic, and 176,000 exposed cases at the peak.Case. II: Optimal practice of the three control strategies. In this case (c 1 (t) ∕ = 0, c 2 (t) ∕ = 0, c 3 (t) ∕ = 0). The simulation results of this case are From Fig. 10 we can see that, the practice of personal protective measures(c 1 (t)), may not be required to be practiced at the maximum level from the onset of the pandemic but could be kept to more than 80% for the first few days before it begins to slowly minimize to the lower bound. Using Public health education about the pandemic (c 1 (t)) need to be maintained at the maximum level for about the first 5 days before it slowly gets down to the lower bound whereas treating COVID-19 patients must be continued up to the end of the pandemic with the maximum intensity as in Fig. 10 .According to the simulation result shown in Fig. 9 , if the intervention strategies are applied optimally as in Fig. 10 , from the onset of the pandemic, then their effect in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases would have been as indicated in Fig. 9 . Practicing the three control strategies together at the maximum level, from the onset of the pandemic reduced the number of cases in the compartments significantly to the extent that there are almost no cases as shown in Fig. 9 .Case. III: (c 1 (t) = 0, c 3 (t) ∕ = 0, c 2 (t)∕ =0). In this case, optimal personal protective measure and optimal treatment of hospitalized cases with the absence of public health education is considered. The effect of these two control strategies in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases is the same as in Fig. 10 . The optimal functions c 2 (t)andc 3 (t) are shown in Fig. 11 .Upon comparing Figures from cases II and III, we can say that, combining control strategies c 2 (t)andc 3 (t) leads to the same result as combining the three control strategies in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19, but for case III, the full intensity of using personal protective measures has to be prolonged as compared to case II, before it slowly gets reduced to the lower bound at the end of the pandemic.Note that, cases where(c 2 (t) = 0, c 1 (t) ∕ = 0, c 3 (t) ∕ = 0 )and(c 3 (t) = 0, c 1 (t) ∕ = 0, c 2 (t) ∕ = 0), have similar effects as cases III in reducing the number of cases in each of the compartments.Case. IV: c 1 (t) = 0, c 3 (t) ∕ = 0, c 2 (t)=0. In this case, only optimal treatment of hospitalized cases is considered. The simulation result is shown in Fig. 12 and the control function is the same asc 3 (t) Fig. 10 .From Fig. 12 , the optimal practice of treating hospitalized COVID-19 cases without the optimal practice of the other two strategies couldn't reduce the number of cases in the compartments E, A, andI, since the cumulative number of cases in Fig. 12 is the same as the cumulative Case. V: c 1 (t) ∕ = 0, c 3 (t) = c 2 (t) = 0. This is the case where the optimal practice of public health education alone is considered. The simulation result of the effect of optimally practicing this control strategy is shown in Fig. 13 for the optimal profile of c 1 (t) and Fig. 14 for the number of cases in different compartments.It can be inferred from Fig. 14 that, the optimal practice of public education alone from the onset of the pandemic is almost as effective as combining the three control strategies.Case. VI:c 1 (t) = c 3 (t) = 0,c 2 (t) ∕ = 0. In this case, the optimal practice of personal protective measures alone is considered. The simulation result of the control profile is shown in Fig. 15 . It is found that the simulation result of the effect of the optimal practice of this intervention strategy in reducing the number of cases in the compartments is the same as shown in Fig. 9 .It can be inferred from Fig. 15 that, the usage of personal protective measures need to be optimally practiced for about the first 42 days of the duration of the pandemic. Upon comparing cases II and VI we can say that both cases independently lead to the required result of mitigating the transmission of the pandemic. However, in case VI the practices of personal protective measures need to be applied optimally for a relatively prolonged time as compared to case II.In this study, a mathematical model for transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is developed and qualitative analysis including the existence and uniqueness of positive solutions, local and global stability analysis of the diseases-free, and endemic equilibrium points have been shown. Numerical simulation for verification of global stability analysis showed that the analytical proofs and the simulation results are in agreement.The result of the sensitivity analysis showed that the most sensitive parameter of the reproductive number is the rate of transmission from asymptotically infected cases to suspected individuals; α 1 . Numerical simulation of the parameters of the basic reproductive number showed that reducing the value of the most sensitive parameter reduced the number of exposed cases more than the relatively less sensitive parameters thereby the simulation is in perfect agreement with the sensitivity index of the parameters shown in Table 2 . Optimal control analysis of the model to assess the effect of public health education, the effect of personal protective measures and the effect of treating hospitalized cases in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 was conducted. The result showed that the optimal practice of the combination of all three intervention strategies significantly reduces the number of exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and hospitalized cases (see Fig. 9 ).Likewise, optimal usage of personal protective measures alone led to the required decreases in the number of cases in the compartments except that the optimal application of the control measure needs to be maintained relatively for a longer period (see Fig. 15 ). It is also found that combining control strategies; personal protective measures, and treatment of hospitalized cases (Case III) is as good as combining the three strategies (case II) in combating the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.In general, it can be concluded that the optimal combination of the three strategies or optimal combination of any two of the strategies or optimal practice of personal protective measures alone reduced the number of COVID-19 cases in the compartments as shown in the simulation results.The result of this study can be used as a policy input for different countries with COVID-19 pandemic. WHO and countries in the world need to put in place a policy that makes personal protective measures a mandatory practice throughout the pandemic period. Personal protective measures with the maximum effort possible can significantly decrease the disturbing effect of COVID-19 and safeguard the people of the world from the lethal coronavirus of our generation.Since mathematical models are approximations of reality, they are inherently inaccurate. The parameter values are obtained from observations and experimentations by using different numerical methods of computing software and hence are uncertain. We have used parameter values from different pieces of literature and made assumptions to some of them and hence, there is a possibility that the mathematical model used in the work overestimates or underestimates the pandemic at a later period. Therefore, readers of this manuscript need to take these limitations into account while interpreting the findings of this research.Ethical approval or individual consent do not apply to this study.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-11-28","11"

This unprecedented rapid transmission of the virus has already reached all countries and territories around the world and caused over 49 million confirmed cases and more than 1.2 million deaths worldwide as of 5 th November 2020 [2] . As of 5 th November, a total of 1,854,169 COVID-19 cases and 44,316 deaths were reported from 57 countries and territories in Africa. The rapid transmission of the virus from person to person coupled with lack of effective medications and vaccines has posed serious challenges to controlling the spread of the disease.The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia was reported on 13 th March 2020. As of 5 th November, a total of 98,391 confirmed COVID-19 cases with over 57,000 recoveries and 1,508 deaths were reported in the country [2] . This is the highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in East Africa and 4 th across Africa. Most (83%) of the cases during the first couple of months were either imported or close contacts of the imported cases [3] and later dominated by the community transmission [4] . As of 25 th October, contacts of the confirmed cases contributed for about 23% of the total COVID-19 cases reported in Ethiopia [5] . During our data collection period, the number of nationally confirmed cumulative COVID-19 cases increased from 2,156 on 8 th June to 4,070 on 19 th June 2020, with 89% increase in less than two weeks. Children under the age of five years and between the ages of 5-15 years were also tested positive for COVID- 19 . As to the current scenario, the overall positivity and case fatality rates of Ethiopia are about 6.5% and 1.5%, respectively [5] .Intense media coverage in Ethiopia about the COVID-19 outbreak began in early February 2020 and peaked in March after WHO declared its pandemic level [1] and the first confirmed case report in the country on 13 th March 2020. Since then, awareness creation and updates of the situation of the pandemic in the country have been daily given to the public by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) on mass media including radio and television. In These preventive messages generally emphasize frequently washing hands  with soap and water, mask wearing, and social distancing measures, including staying at home as   much as possible, avoiding close contact with people including shaking hands, and avoiding crowds and mass gatherings. However, the public uptake of such health protective behaviors during epidemics relies on the trust in media and government information [9] .Despite efforts to scale-up public health interventions to contain and mitigate the spread of coronavirus in Ethiopia, new cases have continued to emerge. The coronavirus has rapidly spread to every part of the country and local community transmission has been established. Gaps and negligence in applying the COVID-19 preventive measures among the public have been observed.The literature on the previous outbreaks of infectious disease suggests that more knowledgeable people during periods of disease outbreaks tend to worry more about being infected, suggesting a link between knowledge and risk perception [10] . Therefore, correct knowledge and positive perceptions and attitudes have paramount importance to prevent the transmission of the virus through enhancing the preventive practice of people. Studies of people's perspectives provide timely and relevant evidence to identify the best preventive intervention that may be required to correct misconceptions and misunderstandings about the virus [11] .This study was conducted between 08-19 June 2020 in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa city is administratively divided into 10 sub-cities and 116 districts. The projected population of the city was about 3.6 million in 2019, and was estimated to reach 4.5 million inhabitants by 2030 [16] .Addis Ababa city has the highest burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia. As of October 18, a total of 45,1724 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported from Addis Ababa, representing about 51% of the national cases. The responses to COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the national response strategy, focusing on physical distancing; hand washing; universal use of masks in public places; avoiding crowding and mass gatherings; tracing, testing, isolating and quarantining; closures of schools, places of worship, and sporting events; limiting mobility and stay at home approaches. However, there has been a lot of misconceptions in the city about the COVID-19 pandemic, how the virus itself spreads and the necessary precautions that should be taken to prevent infection. In addition, policy responses to COVID-19 have an impact on the socioeconomic functioning of the people and are likely to impact their daily livelihoods.This institution-based cross-sectional paper-based self-administered survey was conducted among government employees of 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa city administration. As it was not feasible to conduct a representative nationwide household or online survey during this period, the researchers opted to use self-administered survey. The study population for this study constituted all government employees, working in the selected government institution at the time of the survey and willing to participate in the study. A single cross-sectional study design sample size calculation was used based on a 50% prevalence estimate of the outcome variable at 95% confidence level, 4% precision, a design effect of 2 and 30% non-response rate. Accordingly, the minimum targeted total sample size for this survey was 1,560 respondents.The survey tools, self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), were developed by the research team.Some questions were adopted from the WHO tool for behavioral insights for COVID-19 [17] . The SAQ was initially prepared in English and the final version was then translated into Amharic and Afan Oromo by two experienced personnel in order to make the questions shorter, simpler and understandable for the respondents. The tools were again back translated into English by other independent personnel in order to ensure consistency. The questions in the SAQ were organized into five sections: (i) socio-demographics and other details; (ii) knowledge of COVID-19 signs and symptoms, (iii) knowledge of the mode of transmission, (iv) knowledge of treatment and vaccine; (iii) knowledge of prevention methods; and (iv) source of information.The final English questionnaire was translated independently into Amharic and Afan Oromo languages. Backward translation from Amharic and Afan Oromo to English was carried out by another two independent translators. A total of 20 data collectors were involved in the data collection of this survey, using standardized paper-based SAQ. After obtaining informed consent from all potential participants, the questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The respondents were also informed neither to consult a friend nor read an online or any other material before responding to the questions.Basic descriptive statistical methods such as frequencies, percentages and cross-tabulations were conducted to summarize the data and determine the differences between groups for selected demographic variables. Descriptive statistics by level of government were summarized using frequency distribution tables. Knowledge scores were compared according to demographic characteristics with independent samples t-test for two groups, or one-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests for three or more groups.Multivariable linear regression analysis was not performed to identify factors associated with knowledge of COVID-19 due to the violation of normality assumption. The statistical significance level was set at p<0.05.The majority (92.9%) of the study participants knew that COVID-19 was caused by a viral infection, and this was consistently higher (>91%) across the three government levels ( Table 2) .Meanwhile 89.2% of the respondents correctly identified the mode of SARS-COV-2 transmission via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. About 4% of the respondents stated that the coronavirus can be transmitted via airborne droplets or through eating uncooked food. The most commonly cited signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 included fever (96.9%), cough (95.2%), difficulty in breathing (95.2%), headache (90.3%), sore throat (83.9%) and myalgia (81%). The less commonly reported signs and symptoms comprised loss of taste and smell, runny nose, diarrhea and hemoptysis (coughing up of blood). About 62% of the respondents from Oromia reported runny nose as a symptom of COVID-19 as opposed to 43.6% and 40% of respondents from national or Addis Ababa, respectively. Nearly 93% of the respondents cited correctly that the maximum incubation period for the novel coronavirus was up to 14 days. About 95% of the respondents correctly stated the unavailability of specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Few respondents cited the availability of specific vaccine or treatment for COVID-Almost all respondents correctly stated that people with recent travel history abroad (86.8%) or people with contact with COVID-19 patients (93.5%) were the high-risk group most likely to be infected with the virus (Table 4 ). However, more than half (50.9%) of the study participants reported that people without travel history nor had contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases are also most likely to be infected with coronavirus. About 84% of the respondents perceived that older adults and elderly (above 60 years) were most at risk to die from COVID-19. Meanwhile, 62.8% of the study participants reported that both male and female have equal chance to die from the disease although 22 .2% perceived that males had more chance to die from COVID-19. With the group of adults more likely to die if contracted COVID-19, the majority of the respondents reported that adults with other underlying health problems (95.4%), adults who are cigarette smokers (88.1%) and adults who frequently use substances such as alcohol, khat and cannabis (87.5%) were more likely to die from COVID-19. In contrast, just over one-fifth (21.9%) of the respondents reported that adults without other underlying health problems are also most likely to die from COVID-19.The relative importance of various sources of information about COVID-19 was assessed in this study, and the electronic media such as television (85.5%), social media (74.1%), online materials (71.1%) and radio (60.8%) constituted the primary source of information, followed by health workers (66.6%), friends/family members (54.1%) and print materials (35.4%) ( Table 7) .This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among government employees selected from 46 public institutions in Addis Ababa city administration during June 08 to 19, 2020. At the time of this study, the spread of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa cumulatively increased by 84% from 1,625 on 8 th June to 2,988 on 19 th June, with an average of 114 per day.This study revealed higher perceived knowledge about COVID-19 and its preventive measures.The prevention and control of such pandemic is strongly influenced by people's ability to comply with the recommended preventive public health strategies, which are often associated with how people perceive their susceptibility to infection, whether they have the necessary knowledge, capacity, confidence and trust to adapt the strategies [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . [13, 15] .The current study shows that respondents were highly knowledgeable about the preventive measures of the COVID-19, with the most commonly cited measures constituting staying at home, physical distancing, avoiding close contact with people including hand shaking, use of facemask, frequently washing hands, avoiding mass gatherings, movement restriction, and use of sanitizers/disinfectants. A similar study conducted in Ethiopia in April 2020 also showed that about 90% of the participants had good prevention knowledge of maintaining physical distance and washing hands frequently [14] . Several studies conducted in other countries have also indicated high levels of COVID-19 knowledge among the general population [27] [28] [29] [30] . The study resulted that the overall knowledge about the causes and symptoms, the unavailability of vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, and the main preventive measures of COVID-19 was 'high'. This finding was not surprising since the study was conducted three months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia where massive awareness creation, intensive public health interventions and policy measures have been implemented. The seriousness of the COVID-19 and the overwhelming information about the disease has helped the population to know more about this pandemic. Similar studies in Africa such as Ghana [29] , Nigeria [31] , Tanzania [32] and beyond [28, 30] revealed high COVID-19 knowledge among their study participants.Our findings indicate that the majority of the study participants reported that both male and female have equal chance to die from COVID-19 although about one-fourth of the respondents perceived that males had more chance to die from COVID-19. Men and women generally seem to respond differently to the effects of COVID-19. Available evidence suggests that men are more likely to die of COVID-19 than women, owing presumably to the biological and lifestyle factors [37] [38] [39] .Biological factors lead to sex-differentiated susceptibility to illness. For example, men are more prone to acute health problems, partly explaining why women live a little longer than men [40] .There is also a sex difference in lifestyle or health behavior. Men smoke and consume alcoholic beverages more than women [41] . As far as the current evidence is concerned, men and women experience similar odds of COVID-19 infection, but men are disproportionately exposed to the severest of outcomes, including death [35] .During an emerging infectious disease like coronavirus, receiving timely and accurate information enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception.Despite generating highly valuable and timely findings, this study was not without some limitations. First, due to limited internet access and online information sources in the country, the study was based on paper-based self-administered survey that only included government employees in Addis Ababa, where vulnerable populations and illiterate people were not captured in the study. Ideally, a randomly selected sample of the public should be interviewed about COVID-19. Second, due to the threat of pandemic and the social distancing rule, it was not possible to conduct a face-to-face interview. Third, the data presented in this study are self-reported and partly dependent on the respondent's honesty and recall ability, thus they may be subject to recall and social desirability biases. They also could have been affected by selection bias. Nevertheless, this study provides valuable information about the knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among government employees, and the findings can be used to direct specific public health interventions or messages to the government employees.The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.The study was funded by Addis Ababa University (AAU) and partly supported by the School of Public Health.WD, AW, WAA and WA conceptualized and designed the study.

To date, over fifteen million persons have been infected worldwide (2) . Presenting symptoms of infection include, but are not limited to, fever, dry cough, tiredness, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, and loss of taste and smell [1, 3] . Some patients, however, are asymptomatic, and some present with atypical symptoms such as hiccups [4] . No definitive treatment or vaccine is yet available; therefore, prevention of spread is essential to reduce infection rates and consequently deaths [1] . Mass testing to detect asymptomatic patients and a high level of suspicion for atypical symptoms are therefore crucial in the management of this pandemic [1] .Hiccups are involuntary diaphragmatic muscle contractions with early glottis closure terminating inspiration [5] . They are classified into two types: acute (< 48 hours) and persistent (> 48 hours) [6] . Most identified potential causes of hiccups involve metabolic and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually sufficient to resolve hiccups in these cases. Nevertheless, idiopathic cases are also common with varying degrees of success in their treatments [6] . Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 infection presenting with persistent hiccups.A 48-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of persistent hiccups and sore throat. Seven days earlier, the patient had developed fever with no localizing symptoms followed by the onset of hiccups. He had no recent travel or sick contacts, no history of cigarette smoking, chest pain, or shortness of breath. His J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fever partially improved with over-the-counter symptomatic treatment; however, the hiccups persisted and increased in severity and frequency. The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound examination, which was unremarkable apart from gaseous colonic distension. He then developed a sore throat and presented to the ER for worsening hiccups and sore throat.On arrival at the ER, he was febrile to 39.3 °C with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Lung examination revealed clear bilateral breath sounds, and the remainder of the examination was also unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed bilateral subpleural areas of ground-glass attenuation and crazy paving pattern (Fig. 1) .Laboratory values were remarkable for elevated C-reactive protein (51 mg/L), ferritin (2600 ng/mL), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (856 U/L) levels. The patient was managed as a potential COVID-19 case, and a nasopharyngeal swab was performed.He was transferred to an isolation room in a specialized hospital for COVID-19 patients and received ceftriaxone 2 g and azithromycin 500 mg intravenously. When the swab test was returned as COVID-19 positive, the following medications were added: hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/12 h for one day, followed by 200 mg/12 h for 10 days; oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h for 10 days; prophylactic anticoagulation; ascorbic acid; zinc; and antipyretics.The hiccups were frustrating to the patient, especially while attempting deep breathing; therefore, proton pump inhibitors, domperidone, and baclofen were added to the treatment. The patient slowly improved after the baclofen dosage was increased to 15 mg three times daily. His nasopharyngeal swab ten days after admission was negative for COVID-19, and he was discharged from the hospital in stable condition.The COVID-19 pandemic is the defining health crisis of our generation, and as the number of infections continues to increase, more atypical presentations are revealed. Identifying patients with atypical presentations is imperative, as they can unpredictably spread the infection. We believe our case of a 48-year-old male patient with persistent hiccups could be a possible rare presentation of COVID-19.The first case of a COVID-19 infection presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al [4] . Their patient's condition improved after three days of symptomatic treatment and was discharged in stable condition. In our case, the hiccup attacks were more severe and prolonged (from one week before admission to one week afterward). The patient showed improvement after a baclofen dosage increase towards the end of his first week after admission, and he later proved to be COVID-19 negative. The exact correlation between COVID-19 and the hiccups is hard to explain. Whether it is a direct effect of the infection or a coincidence is to be further assessed if more cases arise. It should be noted that several infectious disorders (e.g. influenza, tuberculosis) have been implicated in hiccup attacks without clear explanation [7, 8] .Thus, the major limitation of this report is that a causal relationship between COVID-19 infection and hiccups cannot be confirmed.

Both were designated to diagnose and treat moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.All adult patients admitted through (June and July 2020) were included in the study.All participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Egyptian Ministry of Health guidance. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as 1-Cases with definite COVID-19 if patients came with clinical symptoms of infection and PCR of respiratory samples (eg, nasal or throat swab) was positive.consistent with COVID-19 plus one or 2 laboratory investigations were positive) (lymphopenia, high serum ferretin and D-Dimer Level) but PCR was negative or not done.After reviewing of records any patient less than 18 years or with missed clinical outcomes status was excluded from the study.• PCR diagnosis has been done as the following:Specimens collection: For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen. The following specimens were collected by a healthcare provider from cases with suspected novel coronavirus infection: A nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP).Swab specimens were collected using swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Swabs were placed immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. The samples were stored at 2-8°C up to 72 hours.1. RNA extraction of SARS-CoV-2 was done using (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit Catalog no. 52904 supplied by QIAGEN, Germany). Sample preparation using QIAcube instruments follows the same steps as the manual procedure (i.e., lyse, bind, wash and elute). Clinical records and laboratory data were reviewed by the investigators in each study site and the following data were extracted for analysis:1-Demographic and clinical data: age, gender, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, and outcomes.complete blood picture, liver function tests, kidney function tests, D-dimer, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP).Classification of the patients: According to the presence or absence of preexisiting comorbidities which determined based on patient's self-report on admission if diagnosed with any chronic illness on the last 10 years then comorbidities were classified based on the number (single, two and three or more); the patients were classified into a. Group I: COVID-19 patients with at least one of the comorbidities (diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, neurological disease, autoimmune disease, endocrinal disease and any other disease or risk factor).The research protocol was approved via the Ethical Review Committee of Assiut Faculty of Medicine before starting of the study (IRB no: 17300434). Patients identifying information were concealed and each patient assigned for a code to insure privacy and confidentiality of the data.Written informed consent was obtained from the each patient or from first degree relatives.For survival analysis, the outcome was tested related to time since the admission until death/end of the study period. For people who did not die, end of July 2020 was included as the final day of research; therefore, the study ended. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were performed and differences in survival rates were analyzed by log-rank test. Univariate Cox regression was conducted to detect the hazard ratio (HR) of different comorbidities and variables with statistically different HR were included in a multivariate Cox regression model and adjusted for age and sex. In all statistical tests p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Screening of 447 patients' records was conducted and 8 cases were excluded due to their age (< 18 years old) then analysis of 439 cases was performed. Patients with comorbidities represented 61.7% of all cases as demonstrated in figure 1.The mean age of studied patients was 51.2 ± 17.2 years old and it was higher in patients with comorbidities (p < 0.001). Fever, and lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms especially dry cough were the most frequent symptoms (74.3% and 74.7% respectively). GIT symptoms were present in 21.2% of patients, while neurological symptoms in 43.8%. When comparing symptoms of two groups, constitutional symptoms especially myalgia and LRT symptoms such as dyspnea were significantly higher in patients with comorbidities (P < 0.05). CT-chest showed bilateral GGO in most of cases (82.6%). (Table 1) The most frequent comorbidities in studied group were cardiovascular diseases (69%) of patients with comorbidities followed by DM (54.2%). (Table 2) Patients with comorbidities had significantly worse laboratory parameters. Detailed data were included in Table 3 .In univariate cox regression model, the older ages had higher risk of death than lower age groups as HR for 60 -79 age group was 3.9 (95% CI. 2 -7.8) and in cases > 80 years was 10 .1 (95% CI. 4-25.6). For different comorbidities, cases with CVDs and neurological diseases showed significant higher risk of death than others as HR in CVDs was 1.9 (95% CI. 1.2 -1.9) and in neurological diseases was 2.9 (95% CI. 1.5 -5.6). Also, number of comorbidities showed significant higher risk than those without any comorbidity as those with one comorbidity has a HR of 2 (95% CI. 1.1 -3.7) and with two comorbidities the HR as 2.6 (95% CI. 1.4 -4.7) while those with 3 or more comorbidities the HR as 2.9 (95% CI. 1.5 -5.6). After adjustment of significant factors in multivariate cox regression, only higher age groups and neurological diseases showed higher risk for death. (Table 5 )Multiple comorbidities are associated with COVID-19 disease and may contribute to its progression or poor outcome. The current study included 439 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients of them 61.7% had one or more comorbid diseases. The mean age of the studied population was 51.2 years with no gender predilection. Of them, 34.1% needed ICU admission and 21.4% were deceased with mean hospital stay 8.4 days.and Tumor necrosis factor α, that promote generalized resistance to insulin and destruction of β-cell (13) . C) Immunity depletion by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function which may make individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases and its complications(3). D) Upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genes expression in different parts of the body, such as heart and lungs, in patients with diabetes, or CVD, increasing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of disease aggravation as it has been identified as an important functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 invasion (4, 14) .In the current study, cases with severe disease requiring ICU admission (35.8% compared to 16.4%), increased need for oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, and almost triple times death rate were significantly associated with patients recording comorbidities. However, by using univariate cox regression model, only cases with CVDs (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 -2.8; P<0.003) and neurological diseases (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5 -5.6; P<0.002) showed significant higher risk of death than others. After adjustment of significant factors in multivariate cox regression, neurological diseases showed higher risk for death. Cardiovascular comorbid conditions are associated with a variety of the worse outcomes for COVID-19 in literatures (15) (16) (17) . Moreover, association between hypertension and coexisting other comorbidities such as HIV, kidney, or other cardiovascular diseases raises the hazard rate more than the other comorbidities (17) . In this study, 37.4% of patients with CVDs including hypertension admitted to ICU and 30.5% of them were deceased. M. Li et al. found that the levels of inflammation indicators like CRP, serum ferritin and ESR were increased in COVID-19 patients and associated with the severity of the disease, furthermore, the levels of these indicators in the patients with CVD were ominously higher than those without CVD which indicate that COVID-19 cases with CVD had additional potential to practice an inflammatory storm, which ultimately clues to prompt worsening of these patients' conditions. Through the course of contagion, inflammation of the lung tissue inhibits the exchange of oxygen in the alveoli, progressing to generalized tissue hypoxia, which triggers the fibrinolytic system.Unlike most of the published literatures, even a recent observational study carried out in the same geographical area which stated that ""pre-existing DM may predict unfortunate 30 days-in hospital outcome"" (18), diabetes mellitus was not found to be a risk factor for death in patients with COVID-19 (HR 1.3; 95% CI0.86 -1.9; p< 0.211) despite that 40.8% of patient with DM were admitted to ICU meanwhile, 29.3% were deceased. In a cohort study of 7337patients with COVID-19, it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes not only prerequisite augmented interferences for their stay in hospital versus those that were non-diabetic, but also had an increased mortality rate (19) . In the current study, in contrast with the above-mentioned ones, we considered DM as a comorbidity when it is self-reported by patient (previous diagnosis and regular treatment) not on the base line random blood glucose at admission. According to Yan Y. et al. non-survivors with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, Creactive protein, pro-calcitonin, ferritin, receptors of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, TNF-α, and lower lymphocytic count than survivors, which indicated diabetic non-survivors had more sever inflammatory response (20) .Despite the notable COVID-19 cases presentation with acute cerebrovascular accidents(23), pre-existing neurological conditions with their wide spectrum of diseases also related to COVID-19 infection and mortality. One survival analysis in 2070 Brazilian patients found that a risk of 3.9 times in people with neurologic disease (95% CI 1.9-7.8; P<0.001)(4).Among other comorbidities, chronic pulmonary diseases including obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderate to severe bronchial asthma are at higher risk of sever COVID-19 progression since this virus affects their respiratory tracts, leading to increased bronchospasm, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress (10) . However, in contrast to the above-mentioned data, another study found that asthma was a protective factor. Asthma may not be a risk factor because of reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) gene expression in airway cells of asthma patients that would be expected to decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection which uses ACE2 as its cellular receptor (22) . We suggest that the degree of asthma control, medications used for asthma control, difference in patient ages and the coexisting conditions may explain this disagreement. Besides, a high-quality cohort study with longer time frame and larger number of patients is needed to explain asthma COVID-19interaction.Unfortunately, a smaller number of patients with other comorbidities such as chronic kidney, liver, metabolic, endocrine, and autoimmune diseases as well as patients with malignancy were included in this study. However, the highest death rate among all the comorbid conditions in this study was (38.1%) of patients with kidney diseases. Cases with liver disorders also had relatively high mortality rate (33.3%). In literatures, the rate of mortality in COVID-19 patients with CKD and Liver diseases was found to be (53.33%) and (17,65%) respectively (23) . Chronic kidney diseases are associated with dysregulated inflammation, immune system, and levels of ACE2 receptors in kidneys which may explain the severity and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with CKD (23) . Worth notice that, in this study, patients with comorbidities had significantly higher renal function tests together with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.Coexistence of cardiovascular comorbid conditions including hypertension or neurological diseases together with COVID-19 infections carries higher risks of mortality.","Egypt","first author","2020-11-30","11"

Thus, everyone who can pay 60 to 70 $US as unitary molecular test cost, could get within a theoretical 48 hours a confirmation result.Finally, the decision n°80 on October 15 th , 2020 promoted the start of media campaign around Influenza vaccination for old persons more than 64 years old and children under 5yo, by invitation to take the vaccine from the private sector at 12 $US per unit and defined an objective to get a 60% of inductive immunity in a specific targeted population that the MoH will vaccine free of charge (all health professionals and health students in the public sector, all pregnant women at the last six months and all hemodialyzed persons followed in the public sector).The study aim is to share alternative COVID-19 case management based on the available scientific evidence to decrease deaths within a short time.This article methodology describes the use of qualitative content analysis to analyse official documents published about the COVID-19 case management in Morocco. The formal guideline and checklist of such research design are under development in EQUATOR Network database, as a new structure for quality improvement reports. The main steps cited are the brief description of context, key measures for improvement from one side (provider or government), what would constitute improvement from a different side (expert practices, patients or scientific evidence), analysis and interpretation, to reach a proposition of a strategy for change [3] .Then, the analysis method adopted is well known in social sciences and newly more used for health policy topics. We followed mainly the method described in Hall&Steiner 2020 article[4].Twenty articles from the review were selected as presenting valuable evidence that confronts the policy themes. This section summarises the main themes gathered from the coding tree:Morocco, with its 36 Million citizens, noticed the first imported case, on March 2 nd , 2020. Then, the spread of COVID-19 cases in all the twelve administrative Moroccan regions raised many individual and collective cases. The metropolitans four cities (Casablanca the biggest one, Marrakech, Tangier, and Fez) had almost 70% of the cases. Unfortunately, a considerable increase is reported during August with around 20 to 40 deaths per day (e.g., On August 31 there was 62590 confirmed cumulative cases and 1141 cumulative deaths). However, during September, only Casablanca and Marrakech sustained a high level of confirmed cases, but the overall deaths remained stable between 40 ± 07 per day (e.g., On September 30 there was 102715 confirmed cumulative cases and 2194 cumulative deaths; unfortunately on October 31 the confirmed cumulative cases were 219084 with 3695 cumulative deaths).The net lethality ratio is the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 divided by the overall confirmed COVID-19 cases. This ratio moves slowly around 1,7% and does not add any useful analysis (Figure2). Thus, COVID-19 lethality could be presented with standardisation to a minimal number of the general population. (The days' tests do no go further than 23000 tests per day for technical reasons, even by inviting all private laboratories to do SARS-CoV2 tests.In other studies, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is commonly calculated comparing the numbers of patients who were discharged well recovered versus those who died by a timing endpoint (e.g. during the 30 past days) [7] .The asymptomatic cases could be an essential source of contagion and need to be controlled biologically via virus nucleic acid testing [42] . Even if, the presence of RNA in RT-qPCR does not necessarily correlate with infectivity or transmission capacity, or at least is not yet easy to prove it scientifically [43] . However, studies published before July 2020 reported that the viral load detected was similar in both asymptomatic and the symptomatic patients, which prove the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients and minimally symptomatic ones [35, 42, 44] , Since August 01 st , in Morocco, due to more severe cases needing intensive emergency cares and hospital beds, the asymptomatic patients or those with few and minim symptoms are invited to take the adjuvant medication and stay in their homes (Figure1a). While, the evidence from China and USA show that households sites are the most favourable areas to spread the disease between 33% and 55% of the parents, partners, spouses and children were affected by their positive in-home person living with them. The odds ratio of the infectivity increases by seven to fifteen times if the residents in the household have some associated morbidities such diabetes or immunocompromised health conditions [45, 46] . Ignorance, small habitations, less favourable social conditions, and inappropriate houses living conditions are the common risk factors for more inhouse infectivity.Fourthly, the effectiveness and time to get an adequate worldwide immunisation by a specific future COVID-19 vaccination, and it could be mandatory for all citizens, or only international travels remain questionable [63] . Finally, the MoH could mess a better cost-effective way to control this virus by taking for this winter season the mandatory vaccination against influenza that will be beneficial to limit indirectly COVID-19 deaths in the targeted population. That recommendation was not formulated, due to the end of the yearly expressed anti-flu vaccine needs and the official declaration to acquire the anti-COVID-19 vaccine as the main priority.The datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.This paper does not contain any studies done by the authors involving human participants.

At that date, several countries in the Americas (North can never replace training within a club with a coach and teammates. Against this background, it has been well documented that this modified lifestyle can lead to serious deficits to the quality and quantity of training, with further distancing of the athlete from the reality of their daily training in the traditional preparation sites and uncertainties about the future [20] . The authors emphasize that it is important, during this home confinement, that athletes try to perform the technical movements of their sport, although this is limited in many cases (due to, e.g., dependence on the opponent, such as team sports, need for equipment, or practice location, such as swimming) [20] . In addition to these problems, following home confinement, the interactions and specific tactical behaviors of the players may have decreased the autonomous-stage learning with their teammates within their clubs [20, 21] . However, the real constraint is in team (e.g., football, basketball, handball) and dual sports (e.g., tennis, judo, boxing, taekwondo), as they require partners and practice is more effective in game situations. Regarding water sports (e.g., pool, open water, and synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, canoeing, kayaking, rowing, sailing) and ice and snow sports (e.g., skiing, ice hockey, ice climbing, curling, ice skating, speed skating), the situation is more complicated, given that these activities require heavy equipment and specific infrastructures. Therefore, training during home confinement will typically be limited to strength, power, and muscle endurance exercises, general physical preparation (e.g., aerobic training on a cycle ergometer), and stretching, amongst other isolation-limited activities. Acute responses to higher intensities and volumes of exercise can involve a greater risk of illness and impaired immune function [22, 23] . In this context, Toresdahl and Asif [11] advise athletes to follow a conservative approach, limiting training sessions to <60 min and to <80% of maximum ability during this time to prevent COVID-19. Herrera-Valenzuela et al. [24] recommended high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for Olympic combat sports athletes that can be performed at home, to maintain their physical fitness, and cardio-respiratory endurance, as well as their musculoskeletal health. In the same line, Jukic et al. [12] warn that detraining is one of the biggest negative consequences of the current ""stay at home"" confinement. Therefore, the authors recommend that the athlete's house should be equipped with cardiovascular and resistance training equipment (e.g., portable cycle or rowing ergometer). Athletes must incorporate some type of endurance exercise into their daily routine to avoid the effects of detraining during the forced quarantine. However, to avoid increased chances for upper respiratory tract infections [22, 23] , the athlete can train at relatively high intensities but should not fully exhaust themselves by the completion of the training session.The full spectrum of muscle fibers (types I and II: slow and fast-twitch fibers, respectively) should be activated when training [25] . While maximal and near-maximal resistance or maximal explosive actions are often considered necessary to activate the high threshold, type II (fast-twitch) fibers [25] , type II fibers can also be recruited when submaximal intensity loads are repeated until task failure or near task failure [26] . Thus, if access to resistance training equipment is limited, the use of body mass exercises such as push-ups [27] , chin-ups (pull-ups), lunges, unilateral squats [28] , and other exercises can ensure full activation when performed to task failure. Alizadeh et al. [27] performed correlations between push-up and bench press repetitions and found that with each female push-up, it was predicted that they would be able to perform 0.362 bench press repetitions. For each push-up repetition performed by males, it was predicted they could perform 0.973 bench press repetitions. Thus, if 10 standard push-ups (from the toes) are performed, it is predicted that approximately 3-4 and 9-10 bench press repetitions would be performed by women and men, respectively. These predictions would be helpful for athletes in tracking their progress and their eventual return to full equipment availability.Again, if heavy external resistance equipment (e.g., barbells, dumbbells, machines) is not available, research has shown that higher muscle activation can be achieved with exercises performed under unstable conditions with lower resistance loads or body mass [29, 30] . Hence, even without heavy loads, performing body mass squats (bilateral or unilateral), lunges, push-ups, and other exercises using unstable environments like wobble boards, Both Sides Up (BOSU) balls, and sandy surfaces can ensure recruitment of the full spectrum of muscle fibers while also improving balance [31] [32] [33] .Improving balance, especially in youth athletes, can improve strength, power, and speed performance [33] [34] [35] and enhance subsequent training adaptations [36, 37] . Balance training prior to power (plyometric) training can improve the degree of plyometric training adaptations compared to no prior balance training [37] . Since balance exercises can typically be performed without additional equipment, all athletes and especially young athletes confined during COVID-19 should emphasize balance training exercises at home. Neurodynamic exercises are based on neural mobilization in which force is applied to nerve structures through alterations in posture and multi-joint movement [38] (e.g., tai chi, yoga), which can be incorporated to maintain and improve flexibility and dynamic balance control [12, 39, 40] . These balance exercises should progress from eyes open to eyes closed, since achieving balance with eyes closed would emphasize additional training adaptations to the vestibular and proprioceptive systems [41] . Furthermore, in accord with the concept of training specificity [42] , dynamic (e.g., reverse lunges, unilateral squats, and deadlifts), rather than just static (e.g., standing on one leg) balance exercises, must be practiced. Athletes with greater balance can produce higher force and power outputs [29, 30] .Whereas almost all athletes attempt to prepare physically, and technically, do they implement appropriate mental training during this forced quarantine? Jukic et al. [12] reported that this current ""stay at home"" confinement is an opportunity for both a complete physiological and mental reset as well as for the athlete's integral development. Although physical activity has a positive effect on athletes' mental health [43] , the adopted home confinement measures and the fear of a second wave of COVID-19, which may delay the return to training and normality and may involve financial problems and depressing daily news, might compromise the athletes' mental wellbeing while increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression [20] . Indeed, athletes qualified for the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games must be supported by specialists in the field of mental preparation (i.e., mental imagery) to maintain progress during COVID-19 confinement.Hence, it is recommended that athletes:− Maintain their physical activity as effectively as possible [12, 20, 44, 45] ; − Take advantage of confinement-induced lack of competitions to emphasize and focus on their weaker physical and mental attributes [12, 20, 45] ; − Use available structures and equipment (e.g., stairs, furniture) to work on balance and resistance training (using body mass and implements to train for strength, power, and endurance). Multiple free videos are available online posted across several social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram [9] . For an example, see https://www.elevateyourself.org/free-workoutvideos.html [46] ; https://qz.com/1826582/how-coronavirus-is-making-olympic-athletes-trainunder-quarantine [47] ; − Train two sessions per day, maintaining three hours between the two sessions. Some athletes may increase the number of daily sessions to try to get around the stress of confinement [20] ; − Do not neglect the physical relaxation and stretching exercises after training in order to relax muscles and ensure adequate for super or overcompensation [12, 20, 45] ; − Meditate or use relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and enhance future performance [48] ; − Continue practicing motor simulation and using visualization and mental imagery techniques, which will improve concentration and self-confidence [12, 45] .In face of the deserted streets, social networks play a fundamental role during this crisis. Almost 4.57 billion people were active internet users as of July 2020, encompassing 59 percent of the global population [49] . Indeed, the power of social networking is such that the number of worldwide users have dramatically increased during COVID-19, with approximately 3.43 billion monthly active social media users and 3.91 billion monthly active mobile social media users [49] . In 2019, on average, global Internet users spend some 136 min per day surfing social networks. During COVID-19, this number has reached an average of 144 min per day [50] . As of July 2020, Facebook (2.6 billion active users), YouTube (2 billion active users), WhatsApp (2 billion active users), Instagram (1.08 billion active users), Twitter (326 million active users), and others actually play a central role more than ever in social ties [51] . Positive social contacts such as coaches, trainers, and other athletes can encourage athletes to beware of detraining and continue the home training [52, 53] . Athletes can virtually connect with their team staff, management, and technical staff, as well as psychologists, physiotherapists, doctors, and sport nutritionists, for online training sessions. Through video conferences, athletes can receive constructive feedback and get the needed support and ensure their progress during this critical period. Indeed, video analysis and feedback are particularly relevant for elite athletes to plan future competitive strategies. Visual and kinesthetic motor imagery, often under the head of ""visualization"", is widely used by professional athletes as an effective way to improve motor performance without an overt motor output [54] . Indeed, this cognitive ability allows an athlete to perform and experience motor actions in the mind without actually executing such actions through the activation of muscles [55] . It has been revealed that in some muscles, imagined contractions during visualization training appear to increase strength by inducing purely central nervous system adaptations [56] . Jeannerod [57] reported that the activation of the brain areas needed to perform an action during kinesthetic motor imagery is similar to the activation that occurs during the preparatory planning stages that eventually lead to the action. The author emphasized that kinesthetic motor imagery affects corticospinal excitability. On the other hand, home confinement athletes can use social media to interact with fans, followers, and fellow athletes, build a public image, and present both athletic and personal lives [53] . Finally, these different social media platforms allow athletes to keep in touch with their staff so that they get the necessary motivation and do not feel as isolated [9, 58] .Hence, we draw athletes' attention to the fact that they can:− Disseminate positive and relevant videos posted across several social media platforms, providing insights into their home workouts, skills training, and challenges against other athletes [9] ; − Exploit the power of social media to spread positive messaging and encourage appropriate behaviors [58] ; − Promote health messages related to physical activity in online social spaces [9] ; − Consult several social media campaigns specializing in COVID-19 confinement athletes training to take advantage of their media coverage [9] .As media continuously report and often disseminate information related to the numbers of sick and dead to keep everyone informed of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, athletes in total confinement are exposed to this overabundance of information, resulting in negative emotions, less perceived self-efficacy, poor sleep quality, and feelings of loneliness, all associated with higher distress of mental health [20, 58] . In this context, sleep deprivation may be a frequent source of stress for athletes during COVID-19 confinement [11, 58] . Against this background, it has been well documented that late-night internet addiction is associated with diverse health problems that have been related to delayed sleep onset, and sleep disturbances, that induce negative associations with daytime functioning, persistent fatigue, daytime sleepiness, poor appetite, anxiety, mood alterations, depression, behavioral issues, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, impaired concentration and performance, caffeine and illicit drug use, increased alcohol consumption, increased metabolic risk and body mass index, and family conflicts [20, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] .More research is necessary for psychologists, psychiatrists, and sport sociologists to study the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and the quality of life of athletes, examining levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress. Monitoring the individual and collective psychological state of athletes as part of targeted interventions is an absolute necessity during this adapted lifestyle.We advise athletes to:− Avoid being over-exposed to the media, which convey anxiety-provoking information. Watch TV once or twice a day only [58] ; − Keep in touch with loved ones, family friends, and coaches and scientific experts with the use of different networking and communication technologies available [64] ; − Be wary of browsing social media late at night so as not to alter their sleep cycle and circadian physiology [59] .Nutrition is a key determinant of health [65] . Sports nutrition improves athletic performance because it reduces fatigue and the risk of illness and injury [66] . It also allows athletes to optimize their training and recover faster [15, 66] . During confinement, it is essential to balance energy intake and expenditure to prevent an energy deficit or surplus. However, this period is a new situation when boredom and stress cause athletes to lose their usual daily rhythm and incorporate bad habits, such as overeating or snacking, especially of foods rich in sugars, ""comfort foods"", fats, and highly processed and readily available foods [67] . In view of the above considerations, Muscogiuri et al. [67] reported that these unhealthy nutritional habits could increase the risk of developing obesity, which is often complicated by heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, which have been demonstrated to increase the risk for more serious complications of COVID-19. Indeed, dieticians and nutrition experts are invited to educate and provide advice to athletes [12] . In this regard, the WHO [68] recommended the importance of drinking hot drinks and water on a regular basis, especially in this pandemic period. Plan a diet so that athletes can eat four small meals a day, breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner. Consume daily the essential foods for energy, like rice, pasta, bread, and roots, but in small quantities. Consume daily foods that contribute to physical growth and regeneration of the body: meat, fish, eggs (a good source of low-fat protein and vitamins), milk, and other dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, which are high in tryptophan and zinc. Plant-based protein sources, such as lentils and beans, have a long shelf life and are rich in vitamins and minerals [45] . The consumption of a healthy diet is predominantly vital for the maintenance of immune function, especially important during the COVID-19 confinement [69] . We also encourage the consumption of colored fruits and vegetables (green, yellow-orange, red, and purple) generally rich in vitamins and antioxidants. In this regard, Muscogiuri et al. [67] reported that the antioxidant-rich foods increased the number of T-cell subsets, enhanced lymphocyte response to mitogens, increased interleukin-2 production, potentiated natural killer cell activity, and increased response to the influenza virus vaccine [70] . In addition, canned, frozen, dried, or fermented fruits and vegetables remain an alternative source of vitamins and minerals, in case it becomes difficult to buy fresh products. Avoid foods rich in fats, sugar, and salt as they provide limited nutritional advantage. Finally yet importantly, never neglect vitamin D given its important role in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections [67, 71] . Appropriate levels of vitamin D can be produced endogenously with 10-30 min of midday exposure to the sun each day [72] . While athletes who focus on muscle hypertrophy will have different nutritional needs than, for example, an endurance athlete, the following recommendations emphasize general health recommendations rather than specialized sport-specific needs.We advise the following:− Balanced and healthy meals (i.e., appropriate combinations of carbohydrates (55-70% of total energy intake), protein (1.6-2.2 g/kg/day depending on the types of sports and the training phase), and fats (rapeseed oil, olive oil-at least 2 teaspoons per meal) to ensure sufficient energy, vitamins, minerals, and other essential ingredients) [45, 67] ; − Foods rich in vitamins A, C, E, B6, and B12, zinc, and iron such as citrus fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, and dairy products [69] ; − Avoid eating sugar-rich foods high in saturated fats and instead consume high amounts of fiber, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and antioxidants to boost immune function [73, 74] ;− Avoid smoking, alcohol, and drugs [69] ; − Sufficient hydration. Dehydration increases the risks: athletes should stay well hydrated throughout the day and make sure they are well hydrated before, during, and after the training sessions and do not wear additional clothes to augment the sweat response [45] . The WHO [68] recommends drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages; − Athletes should drink 2.5 to 3.5 L per day: 500 mL of water in the morning +500 mL between noon and 4 p.m. +500 mL between 4 p.m. and the evening meal +2 glasses of water at each meal +500 mL minimum during training (at least 500 mL but to be adapted according to perspiration). This volume should be increased when it is hot [45] ; − Athletes should try to find their rhythm: if they are not hungry, they must not eat. The athletes must attempt to distinguish between hunger and the desire to eat due to boredom or the difficulty of the current situation [45] ; − Athletes should limit the loss of their muscle mass and fat intake with resistance training at least twice per week [45] .As athletes encounter sleep deprivation induced by the COVID-19 confinement stress and related to digital overload, hyper-connection, and digital collaboration, they are challenged to protect their physical and mental health, but some of them may have trouble falling asleep in this major upheaval in life. These following recommendations aim to highlight the importance of the sleep-wake cycle in the field of sport and to clarify for athletes, coaches, and all sports scientists how sleep loss could indirectly compromise the performance of athletes via the indirect alteration of their physical, physiological and psychosomatic process.According to a recent study [75] , National Basketball Association professional athletes have scored fewer points and get fewer rebounds the day after late-night activity on Twitter. In this regard, numerous studies supported the conclusion that partial and/or total sleep deprivation impaired cognitive and physical performance among athletes [16, 75] . Indeed, recent findings revealed that one night of partial sleep deprivation decreased the evening resting level of monocytes and mean corpuscular hemoglobin [76] and increased the morning and evening resting levels of the biomarkers of cardiac damage responses (i.e., creatine phosphokinase, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein, and myoglobin) among taekwondo players [77, 78] . Furthermore, it has been well documented among trained athletes that a multitude of biochemical changes within the affected muscle areas such as increased inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species may aggravate muscle injuries and thus increase the cardiac injury risk in response to mainly acute exercise following one night of partial sleep deprivation [78, 79] . In addition, psychomotor and cognitive performances were the most affected by sleep deprivation among athletes [80, 81] . It has been reported that sleep deprivation can lead to disturbances in the person's psychological state (for example, increased anxiety, depressed mood, anger, tension, frustration, and irritability) [80] and that any deterioration of this psychological well-being is also likely to affect the performance of the athlete [16] . However, it has been revealed that adequate sleep, both in quantity and quality, is often viewed as a restorative process that influences the homeostatic regulation of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune systems and is generally associated with better physical performances [16] .The following guidelines are proposed to be taken into consideration by athletes during the COVID-19 confinement:− Adequate sleep is essential to help athletes maintain optimal health and well-being [16] ; − Sleep is an important factor in the athlete's health stress model [12, 44, 45] ; − Athletes must have a good sleep routine (the average sleep duration is between 7 and 8.5 h) by going to bed at the same time in a cool, dark, and quiet room and waking up at the same time [16, 59] ;− Avoid eating about 3-4 h before sleeping. Going to bed immediately after a large meal can disrupt sleep [59] ; − Avoid caffeine or other stimulating drinks about 4-5 h before sleep [16, 59] ; − Avoid the overuse of social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and electronic devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) in the late night [59] .As another suitable solution during the second wave of COVID-19, we propose that athletes (professional, elite, and student-athletes) would reside in a school or training camp, where the athletes' nutrition, rhythm of life, sleep, and training program would be rigorously monitored by the administrative and coaching staff [82] . Such a solution could allow coaches to make conscious efforts to maintain the load and intensity of training sessions at the optimum competitive level for these athletes [82] . It has been well established that exercise intensity is the key factor that influences the quality of effort and thus the overall efficacy of athletic training programs in this collective confinement model compared to athletes who are in self-confinement [83] . There appear to be good reasons to apply a similar model (e.g., collective confinement in school or training camp) in developing plans to avoid detraining associated with self-confinement of athletes during the second wave of COVID-19. Indeed, the physiological systems that underpin performance can be affected by many external factors, such as nutrition status [12, 65, 67] , sleep [12, 18, 19] , stress and anxiety of self-confinement, mood alterations, and depression [58] . Accordingly, any change in these patterns, such as occurs during COVID-19, has the potential to reduce the physical performance of self-confined athletes [12, 20, 44, 45] . However, such conditions (i.e., collective confinement in school or training camp) are clearly not always readily available to many teams and athletes.Athletes' lives are disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a major psychological impact of athletes' confinement due to this modified lifestyle because they have no reference to this new situation. It is evident that athletes must follow a balanced, healthy lifestyle, namel, exercise, nutrition, rhythm of life, and getting enough sleep. However, it is difficult to perform routine training within the context of the ongoing pandemic and confinement. Most athletes will find themselves confronted with the search for an optimal solution to maintain their physical, physiological, and psychological levels as close as possible to their original skills. Thus, this review serves as a general guideline mainly for athletes to optimally maintain being physically and mentally fit with respect to measures taken in the face of COVID-19 confinement period with recommended guidelines. If an athlete's situation changes, allowing for more intensive and extensive training, then they can hopefully return to more sport-specific recommendations for training, nutrition, and other training components. It is important to mention that this article does not concern athletes only, but it also raises a call for the sports team to act proactively and keep ties with their trainees and provide them with the needed guidance and motivation through the best use of social media platforms. Therefore, everyone will have to adapt to different situations. Obviously, everything is based and depends on the level of consciousness of the athlete himself.

There are four Corona virus subfamilies, these are alpha, beta, gamma and delta corona viruses, where beta corona viruses may cause severe disease and fatalities and alpha corona viruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. 2 They are transmitted from animals to humans. While alpha and beta corona viruses apparently originate from mammals, in particular from bats, gamma and delta viruses originate from pigs and birds. 1, 2 COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020 WHO declared that the current outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations when the virus causes a large burden of morbidity and mortality. 2 COVID-19 is highly transmitted and spread from a single town to the entire country in just 30 days. 15 Within that time the epidemic may double in the number of affected people every seven days and each patient spreads infection to 2.2 other individuals. 15 The outbreak estimates a mean range from 2.2 to 3.58. 16, 17 The reason for this transmission across the world might be both geographical expansion and the sudden increase in numbers of cases which surprised and quickly overwhelmed health and public health services. 12 has threatened the world with a public health crisis. Globally more than 10 million people are infected and nearly 500,000 fatalities have been reported after being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (June 26, 2020, 11:40 GMT). International borders have been locked down, travel restricted, economies slashed and billions of people are isolated at their own homes as a measure to contain the outbreak. 18 Studies done in Italy among undergraduate students and mass media have a significant influence both on the knowledge and attitudes of people as well as on their risk perception. 26 The attitude towards COVID-19 is significantly lower among male respondents, lower education and those living among more crowded households. 3, 4 Additionally, increasing the response rate of public awareness of the media reports can both significantly bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection, which is a result of creating a positive attitude among people. [5] [6] [7] Social and mass media could influence the risk perception because the information might refer to heuristics. 29 Studies showed a significant correlation between female gender, higher age, and higher education with practice. [1] [2] [3] [4] Ethiopia is one of the countries threatened by COVID-19; 5175 COVID-19 cases have been reported, among whom 81 died and 1544 recovered (June 26, 2020, 11:40 GMT). The country has not taken a nation-wide lockdown, but the country has declared a state of emergency. In Ethiopia, many organizations including the government sector have to implement different measurement plans to prevent the virus. In the community there is still a gap in using a prevention mechanism despite many media and organizations mobilizing the community and advocacy of a strategy to curb the pandemic. Most of the reason is perception of less susceptibility and lack of practice of prevention techniques. 20, 23 Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. 25 In several Asian countries, mask adoption seems to correlate with slowing down the pace of COVID-19 transmission. China, South Korea and Vietnam are all good examples. 28 This also includes social distancing for all ages and helps protect vulnerable older adults. 27 To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. 24, 26 There is a huge gap in preventing viruses because it is a new emerging phenomenon. Little is known about the perception of these diseases by the general public and everyday practices of adhesion to these rules by different social groups, psychological patterns of coping with restrictive measurements in different countries make a challenge in preventing the virus. Cultural determinants play an important role in controlling infection behavior. 27 This all shows the need for research in every aspect, but in the end, prevention is the only effective way to cut the virus, so to do this the community must know and implement the prevention mechanism. For intervention, you need to have evidence that shows the level of the intervention and to continue it. So, the aim of this study was to determine the level of attitude and practice and associated factors towards COVID-19 prevention in Dessie and Kombolcha town administrations. In our research, sex, educational status and information heard from mass media are the main determinants associated with poor attitude. Furthermore, marital status, residence, main occupation, family size, type of water and information heard from social media are associated with poor practice. This is a broader research compared to another study conducted in a single institution, and this view point provides potential reasons for these findings, which might be for programmers, policy makers and implementers in the region, Dessie and Kombolcha town administration, Health Department office and Water Supply and Sewerage submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comResearch and Reports in Tropical Medicine 2020:11Service offices for their evidence-based decisions in interventions towards COVID-19 prevention.A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from June 7 to 14, 2020, in Dessie and Kombolcha town administrations, Amhara National Regional State, northeast Ethiopia. Dessie is 401 km and Kombolcha is 376 km from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, respectively. Dessie town has 26 kebeles, 18 urban and 8 rural, and Kombolcha has 11 kebeles, 5 urban and 6 rural, a total of 37 kebeles in the two town administrations. Dessie and Kombolcha vital statistics office report showed that the total population of Dessie is 385,850 and Kombolcha 143,214. The two town administrations have 529,064 inhabitants, of whom 262,157 are male and 266,907 are female.The study population was residents found in the selected kebeles in Dessie and Kombolcha Town administrations who had the chance to be included in the sample. Participants critically and mentally ill during the study period were excluded from the study. The sample size for this study was calculated using a single population proportion formula, the estimation of the sample size was done by assuming a prevalence of 50%, 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error. The calculated sample size of this study was 768 participants with a design effect of two. By adding a tolerable non-response rate (10%), the total sample size was 845 participants.A two-stage sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. A total of 845 participants from their respective households were included in the study. A simple random sampling technique was applied to select kebeles to eliminate selection bias. In the first stage, nine kebeles were selected out of 37 kebeles using a lottery method by assuming the residents of the two towns are homogeneous. In the second stage, data were collected from households using a systematic sampling technique, where participants have the chance to be selected. Then, based on their population size, the sample size was proportionally allocated to each of the sampled kebeles and samples were drawn, and it was representative of the population characteristics for policy implications.The outcome variables were attitude and perceived practice. The determinant factors were; sociodemographic variables (sex, age, marital status, residence, religion, level of education, occupation, family size and income), availability of household materials/related variables (water source, amount of water, functional TV/ radio, functional cell phone) and source of information related variables (mass media, health care workers, family members, social media, religious leaders).About 32 attitudes of COVID-19-related questions were provided to respondents, and those who answered below 50% were assigned as having a poor attitude, whereas those who answered 50% and above were assigned as having a good attitude on COVID-19 prevention. About 14 practices of COVID-19 related questions were provided to respondents, and the respondents who answered below 50% were assigned as having a poor practice, whereas those who answered 50% and above were assigned as having a good practice on COVID-19 prevention.The questionnaire for this study was a structured interview-administered questionnaire which was adopted from the WHO COVID-19 guideline 5 and scientific studies, 6 prepared in English and translated to the Amharic local language then re-translated back to English used for conceptual equivalence by language experts. To check the validity of the tool, the adopted questionnaire was sent to a group of experts, chosen according to their experience and expertise in related fields (health promotion, environmental health and medical internist). The experts appraised the questions in terms of consistency, intelligibility and generalizability. Internal consistency of attitude measures was tested using a reliability test where the Cronbach alpha coefficient aided in determining the reliability of the variables. The results showed that the Cronbach alpha for attitude was 0.7. The result added credibility. According to Griethuijsen, a range of Cronbach alpha from 0.6 to 0.7 is considered adequate and reliable. 7 Pre-test was conducted on 5% of the total sample size in Kalu district, and the amendment was done according to the finding. The questionnaires used in the pre-test were not included in the analysis as part of the main study. Training on the objectives of the study was given to data collectors and supervisors before the day of the data collection. Regular supervision, control as well as support of data collectors by the supervisors were made daily, and each completed questionnaire was checked and the necessary feedback was offered to interviewers. The collected data were properly handled, reviewed and checked for Research and Reports in Tropical Medicine 2020:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress completeness and consistency by the supervisor and before the analysis began each day. The data were collected by 10 public health officers and eight nurses, and the data collection process was supervised by five masters of public health professionals. A day training was given to both the data collectors and the supervisors prior to the data collection process. It was used to check the goodness of the fit of the model.The collected data were coded, edited, entered into Epi Info version 7 and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Descriptive summary statistics such as mean ± SD, median ± IQR, frequencies and proportions were presented as appropriate. The Chi-square test was checked for count frequencies per cell in two by two data presentation. Binary logistic regression analysis was done and all independent variables at p-value <0.20 were taken to a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify associated factors with outcome variables. Statistical significance of variables in the final model was declared at p-value <0.05 and 95% confidence level for the adjusted odds ratio. The Hosmer and Lemeshow statistics and the deviance coefficient were used to check the goodness of the fit of the model.Ethical review (with ref. no.: CMHS/311/036/20) was obtained from institutional review board (IRB) of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University. Verbal informed consent was approved by the IRB. Permission was obtained from Dessie Health Science College. Informed consent was obtained from each study participants prior to data collection. Strict confidentiality of responses was maintained during the study and the data given by the participants were used only for research purposes. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Figure 1 showed that the level of attitude and practice towards the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha town administrations. Among the study participants, 243 (29.35%) had a poor attitude and, 585 (70.7%) had a good attitude towards COVID-19 prevention in both towns. The practice of the study participants were, 346(41.8%) had poor practice, 482(58.2%) had good practice in the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic. Variables associated with poor attitude towards COVID-19 prevention were sex, educational level and information from mass media.Those male participants were 1.02 times more likely to have a poor attitude towards COVID-19 prevention as compared to their counterparts (AOR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.10). Regarding educational level, those who were unable to read and write were 76% times more likely to have a poor attitude as compared to those who had attended a higher level of education towards COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.92). Participants who were not receiving information about COVID-19 from the mass media were 99% times more likely to have a poor attitude compared to those who received information from the mass media (AOR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.05) ( Table 1) .Variables associated with poor practice towards COVID-19 prevention were residence, marital status, main occupation, family size, type of water sources, and COVID-19 information heard from social media.Participants who were rural residents were 2.58 times more likely to have poor practice than urban residents (AOR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.65, 4.03). Participants who were widowed were 68% less likely to have poor practice than single (AOR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.76). Participants who were merchants were 57% less likely to have poor practice than housewives (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.66). Participants who were government employees were 36% less likely to have poor practice than housewives (AOR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.97). Participants who had family sizes of 4-6 members were 30% less likely to have poor practice towards COVID-19 prevention than those who had family sizes of 1-3 members (AOR = 0.70; 95%: 0.49,0.98). Participants who had piped water at their yard water source were 1.59 times more likely to have poor practice compared to those who had water at indwelling towards the prevention of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.44). Participants who had a spring water source (protected and unprotected) were 4.37 times more likely to have poor practice towards the prevention of COVID-19 than piped water sources in a dwelling (AOR = 4.37; 95% CI: 1.36, 14.04). Participants who did not get COVID-19 information from social media were 1.73 times more likely to have poor practice than their counter parts (AOR = 1.73: 95% CI: 1.08, 2.79) ( Table 2 ).The prevalence of poor attitude among participants was 29.35% (95% CI: 26.3, 32.5), which is consistent with a study in Bangladesh, Thailand and India, 8-10 but it shows a disparity with studies done in China, Nepal and USA, which had comparably high attitude toward prevention of COVID-19. [11] [12] [13] The possible explanation could be due to differences in the study participants, socioeconomic status and the study area.Male participants were 1.2 more likely to have a poor attitude toward COVID-19 prevention. This finding is supported by studies in Egypt, Iran and China. 11, 14, 15 The possible explanations may be that males have less perceived susceptibility to disease. Female gender has been linked to more worry and engagement in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors. A few other studies also reported that women were superior to men in terms of the positive attitude related to infectious diseases. 11, 16 Participants who were unable to read and write were 1.76 more likely to have a poor attitude toward COVID-19 prevention. This finding was supported by studies in Thailand, Iran, Bangladesh and China. 8, 9, 11, 14 The reasons may be that uneducated participants who lack retrieving basic information from a different source were related to awareness and perception of prevention mechanisms. 9 Those participants who did not have access to mass media were 1.99 times more likely to have a poor attitude towards COVID-19 prevention. The finding was supported by a study done in Iran, Vietnam and Tanzania. 14, 17, 29 The reasons might be that mass media had a wide range of coverage and the perceived trustworthiness of its source. 18, 19 The study showed that 41.79% (95% CI: 38.5, 45.3) had poor practice towards COVID-19. The proportion of participants with poor practice in this study was much higher than findings from similar studies conducted in Malaysia (25.87%), Nepal (2.9%), Iran (11%) and Paraguay (18.67%). 1, 7, 20, 21 This difference may be due to socio-economic and access to media differences in the study populations and the way the outcome variables were measured. However, the poor practice in our study Research was lower than in similar studies conducted in Jimma (73.11%) and Pakistan (63.5%). 22, 23 Possible reasons might be due to variation in the sampling techniques, data collection tool and/or the sample sizes. Participants who were residents of the rural areas were 2.58 times more likely to have poor practice than urban residents. This may be due to lack of awareness on COVID-19 prevention, lack of water and soap among rural residents. Participants who were widowed were 68% less likely to have poor practice than those who were single. This study is supported by a previous study that single women behaved in poor practice. 1, 21 This may mean that widowed women had previous experience of personal hygiene and family values than single women. In contrast to this study, a study done in Paraguay showed that married women have good practice. 21 This may be due to socio-demographic, sample size, and study participant differences among studies.Participants who were merchants were 57% less likely to have poor practice than the housewives. Participants who were government employees were 36% less likely to have poor practice than the housewives. Findings from Jimma supported this study that private business and government officers had less poor practice. 22 This could be due to them having high educational levels and practice COVID-19 prevention methods that are got from different information sources. Participants who had 4-6 member family sizes were 30% less likely to have poor practice of COVID-19 prevention than those who had 1-3 member family sizes. The possible explanation may be that participants who have a large family may fear the spread of the disease and the cost of the expense related to the infection. However, a finding from another study in Iran shows that the number of household members is not associated with poor practice. 1 This may be due to cultural, economic, and sample size differences between the two studies.Participants who had piped water sources at their yard were 1.59 times more likely to have poor practice in COVID-19 prevention than those who had piped water sources at the dwelling. The reason might be those who have water sources at their yard are far away from the dwelling and not easily accessible at any time. Participants who had a spring water sources were 4.37 times more likely to have poor practice on COVID-19 prevention than piped water sources in the dwelling. This could be because spring water sources are distant from the household and provide an inadequate amount of water, so they have poor practice in hand washing as recommended by the guidelines.Participants who had not received the COVID-19 information from social media were 1.73 times more likely to have poor practice than their counterparts. Evidence from Saudi Arabia showed that social media was the Notes: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Research and Reports in Tropical Medicine 2020:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress main source of information about Coronavirus prevention. 24 The possible explanation might be more cell phone usage by the participants. However, evidence from different studies showed that gender, age, knowledge, educational level, and health -related occupations 1, 6, 20, 21, 25 are associated with poor practice in contrast to this study.In this study, nearly one third of participants had a poor attitude and 42% of them had poor practice towards COVID-19 prevention among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha town administrations, north-east Ethiopia. Findings from this study showed that sex, educational level and information heard from mass media were associated with poor attitude of participants. Furthermore, residence, marital status, main occupation, family size, type of water sources and information heard from social media were associated with poor practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. These findings may have implications on the prevention campaign/program of the new corona virus epidemic, particularly in the study settings. As described above, the empowerment of female to formal education and employment shall be strengthened to increase their awareness and exposure to the latest information. Mass media have a tremendous role to provide information to the community, so focus should be on their rural residents to access and have appropriate information towards COVID-19 prevention. Mass media should have a program in analyzing information provided by social media and broadcasting appropriate evidences to the community and prepare attitude-booster programs for the male community in the prevention of COVID-19. In the meantime, the adequacy and accessibility of water for households should be provided to be effective in the prevention measures at this time. There is no previous research done on COVID-19 in Dessie and Kombolcha; therefore, this research would be a baseline for feature researchers for community-level studies.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-11-19","11"
