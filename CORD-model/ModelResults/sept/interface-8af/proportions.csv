On May 19th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases is 4, 956,733 with total deaths 323,095, with a fatality rate of 0.22 per million. All over the world, twenty-six of the 179 countries had unknown status regarding BCG vaccination, while 132 have current BCG vaccination programs and 21 have no national BCG program.As the BCG vaccine is already approved for human use, it is known to boost the immune system and modulate the exaggerated immunity response against tuberculosis [2] . It provides protection against a range of infections, not simply the mycobacterium for which the vaccine was originally developed [3] but also a range of conditions, including respiratory infections (bacterial and viral), neonatal sepsis, and fevers [4], and geriatric acute upper respiratory tract infections [5] .It is hypothesized that, until a specific vaccine is developed, SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable populations could be immunized with BCG vaccines. Such a strategy would also be suitable for frontline health personnel [6] .The aim of this perspective is to correlate between the COVID-19 case fatality rates, serious/critical case percentage, and percentage of national BCG vaccine coverage.In methodology, to evaluate the effect of BCG vaccine, we included the BCG coverage percentage in 183 countries (countries which have never included BCG vaccine in their national immunization program (NIP), countries which had included the vaccine in the past but do not do so currently, and countries who currently have BCG vaccine included in their NIP) and the COVID-19 infection rate, mortality levels, prevalence of serious/critical cases, and case fatality rates (Table 1) . Pearson correlation was done to test the association of these variables. We used Worldometer to collect national COVID-19 attributable data as of May 2, 2020, which includes ""cases per million"" and ""deaths per million"" attributes for the top 183 countries reporting highest case events [7] . We used the same source to collect information on COVID-19 testing data at country level. For BCG coverage, we used WHO-UNICEF estimates of BCG coverage (last update 15 July 2019) [8] (Figs. 1 and 2) .Ethical approval was not required for this report of existing peer reviewed literature.As for data published from the WHO first announcement of the disease to 18th May 2020, when we analyzed the available data on BCG coverage (10, supplement 1), WHO COVID-19 status reports [1] in 183 countries ( Fig. 1 ) and correlated the incidence and mortality patterns from COVID-19 among different countries (Table  1) ; the following data were noticed. There is a statistically significant negative moderate correlation between BCG coverage and death rates (P < 0.001) as well as negative correlation between BCG coverage and incidence rate of all cases as well as serious and critical cases of COVID-19 among the studied countries (P = 0.001).Since the beginning of the pandemic, it was noticed that countries with BCG vaccination program appear to have a lower incidence and death rate from COVID-19 as compared to countries without such a program [9] . Reports showed that morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 are associated with early adoption or universal coverage of BCG vaccination. They suggested that BCG might show long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 by reduction in the incidence of the respiratory tract infections in children, antiviral effects, and decrease viremia in experimental animals [3, 10] . The vaccine may slow down the spread and progression of symptoms and decrease the number of total cases and deaths per one million [11] . There is a significant difference in the Fig. 2 Map of the COVID-19 verified number of infected per capita as of 2nd May 2020. Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, new cases may not be immediately represented visually. Refer to the primary article 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic or the World Health Organization's situation reports for most recent reported case information. Every country bigger than 3 million km 2 has been split up into its first level administrative division for better visualization of the spread of the epidemic. > 5000 cases per million inhabitants. 2000-5000 cases per million inhabitants. 500-2000 cases per million inhabitants. 200-500 cases per million inhabitants. 50-200 cases per million inhabitants. > 0-50 cases per million inhabitants. No reported cases, no population, or no data available COVID-19-related fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high COVID-19 disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies [12] . The mortality and reported COVID-19-attributable mortality (COVID-19-related deaths) among BCG-using countries is 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .0] than in non-BCG-using countries [13] and in countries with mandated BCG vaccinations compared to countries that terminated BCG vaccination policies before 2000 [14] .However, many reports do not support the BCG hypothesis that all existing claims are based on crosscountry correlations [15, 16] . When comparing the same stage in the epidemic, a study does not find any significant difference in COVID-19 severity between countries with or without BCG policies [17] . A recent compares the incidence of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals and showed a similar rate of positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 compared with no vaccination [18] . However, this study compared the two groups in terms of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 by RT RNA PCR. But if we assume that BCG vaccinated individuals had more/less asymptomatic infections, the results of this study will be biased as many positive cases will be counted as negative in the analysis. This is called a misclassification error. A future study comparing the two groups with serology testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be more appropriate.BCG vaccine correlates with COVID-19 case fatality rates and probably offers protection against severe/critical cases of SARS-CoV-2. Recommended work through randomized controlled trials to determine how fast a BCG-induced protective immune response against COVID-19 develops is needed to validate its use as immune prophylaxis for more exposed population as healthcare workers.The findings of the current report should be viewed within the limitation that these data are rapidly changeable; the majority of the studies use publicly available data repositories such as Worldometer to source COVID-19-related data [4]. In the same time, most studies source country-wise BCG-related data using outlets such as BCG World Atlas (http://www.bcgatlas.org/) [8] and other sources, such as reports and datasets published by the World Health Organization, World Bank, and United Nations. Another limitation is that there may be several confounding issues such as limited testing and reporting in many countries. However, these data are derived from 183 countries out of 210 countries reported globally, as of 2:00 a.m. CEST, 4 May 2020. Other limitations include the populations are not stratified by age and comorbidities which may be confounders in case fatality rate from COVID-19. COVID-19 managing protocol is different in different countries. Recent mutations may have occurred in coronavirus, and subtypes caused SARS-CoV-2 disease with different virulence. Lastly, the acquired immunity from BCG lasts for different periods, and there is a strong recommendation to test its validity by tuberculin test or QuantiFeron gamma in COVID-19 patients.","Egypt","first author","2020-09-09",9

Endemic HCoV types are detected in a small but non-negligible proportion of respiratory tract infections; mild cases occur across a wide age-range and severe disease is predominant in young children and the elderly [5] [6] [7] [8] . A further three HCoVs have emerged in recent years and caused epidemics: SARS-CoV the agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China 9 , MERS-CoV the cause of Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle-East 10 and most recently SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 11 . To date, there are limited preventive options against HCoV infections and no effective anti-viral treatment 12 . Understanding the epidemiology of HCoVs can play a critical role in prediction, prevention and control of HCoV infection. In addition, data on endemic HCoVs may inform expectations for SARS-CoV-2 if it becomes endemic. Our study aims to describe the circulation patterns of three endemic HCoVs (OC43, 229E, and NL63) over time using data from a long-term surveillance programme in a rural coastal setting in Kenya, 3° south of the equator.A prospective study was established in 2007 for long-term continuous respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia admissions to Kilifi County Hospital (KCH) 6 in order to develop improved epidemiological understanding, estimate disease burden and provide suitable baseline data for future vaccine studies. KCH is the referral hospital within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS), in the northern coastal region of Kenya 13 . The location experiences two rainy seasons approximately from April to July and October to December, with median maximum temperature of 33°C (IQR: 31-36), median minimum temperature of 23°C (IQR: [22] [23] [24] , and median relative humidity of 78% (IQR: 71-87) (unpublished weather station data). Children aged 1 day to 59 months admitted to KCH with clinical symptoms of severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Written informed consent was sought from parents/guardians of the children prior to sample collection. In this paper we define severe pneumonia as history of cough or difficulty breathing and chest indrawing while very severe pneumonia is defined as history of cough or difficult breathing and at least one of inability to feed, prostration, unconsciousness, or oxygen saturation of <90% by fingertip pulse oximetry. We use the term pneumonia to refer to all cases of clinically severe or very severe pneumonia 14 . The variables extracted from the hospital surveillance database include; Demographic characteristics (sex, KHDSS residency status, age), presence/ absence of clinical features (history of cough, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, nasal flaring, chest indrawing, crackles, wheeze, inability to drink, vomits everything, fever defined as axillary temperature ≥37.5° C, oxygen saturation levels, conscious level: agitated, lethargic, prostration or unconscious, pneumonia status: severe or very severe), laboratory test results, and hospitalisation outcomes (admission to the high dependency unit, discharge outcomes: alive or dead)Specimens collected between January 2007 and December 2019 were processed and screened for three HCoVs (OC43, NL63 and 229E) and at least 12 other respiratory viral pathogens (RSV (A and B), rhinovirus, HCoVs (NL63, OC43, 229E), influenza (A, B and C), parainfluenza virus (1-4), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sample testing was initially performed in 2007 using the LightCycler Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS HybProbe kit (Roche) 6 , then multiplex RT-PCR using Qiagen Quantifast multiplex RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom) in triplex sets on an ABI 7500 system, from January 2007 until the present day 15, 16 ; additionally, a proportion of samples were tested using a 33-pathogen multiplex quantitative PCR (FTD Resp-33, Fast Track Diagnostics, Sliema, Malta) as part of the multi-country PERCH study 17 , between August 2011 and December 2013. A variety of collection methods was used: nasal wash (2007 to 2009), nasopharyngeal flocked swab (2010 to 2014), or combined nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab (2015 onwards).Data analysis was done using STATA version 13.0 (Stata Corp, College Station Texas, USA). Summary statistics (counts, proportions, measures of central tendency and variation) are presented for continuous and categorical data as appropriate. We estimated unadjusted odds ratios to measure the association between demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants and testing positive for HCoV. Three Poisson regression models, one for each HCoV type, were used to investigate the presence of seasonality. In the models a trend variable was included and residuals plotted against month. Identification of a strong pattern by visual inspection of the residual plots would suggest presence of seasonality. The chi-square test of proportional trends was used to test for a linear trend in the proportions of samples tested or not tested for HCoV over time. To check for an association between categorical variables the chi-square test of association or Fisher's exact test was used as appropriate. The analysis code is provided as Extended data 18 .This study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific Ethics Review Unit (Approval number: KEMRI/SERU/CGMR-C/027/3178).During the 13 years of surveillance, there were 49,409 paediatric admissions of children aged 0-59 months at KCH. A total of 11,445 (23.2%) admissions were due to severe (n= 7808, 68%) and very severe (n=3637, 32%) pneumonia. Out of the eligible cases, 69.5% (n=7957) were tested for the three HCoVs while the remainder were not tested due to refusal of consent (13.8%), discharge (13%) or death (3.7%) prior to sample collection. Cases untested did not differ from those tested in age distribution or sex ratio, but were more likely to be very severe (40.0% versus 28.3%, Fishers exact P-value <0.001).Of the 7957 children tested, 5312 (66.7%) were aged <1 year, 1454 (18.3%) were aged 12-23 months, 620 (7.8%) were aged 24-35 months and 571 (7.2%) were in the 36-59 months age band. The proportion of tested individuals with fever (axillary temperature ≥37.5°C), cough and difficulty breathing was 58.3%, 83.2%, 92.6%, respectively. A total of 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one of the three HCoV targets. Among the HCoV positives, 129 (41.1%) had OC43, 99 (31.5%) had 229E, 74 (23.6%) had NL63 and 12 (3.8%) had coinfections between the three HCoV types. Among all the samples tested, the overall prevalence of NL63 was 1% (n=80), 1.7% for OC43 (n=137) and 1.4% for 229E (n=109).The characteristics of the patients positive for any and for each HCoV type or infection combination are described in Table 1 . HCoV positive cases were predominantly children aged <1 year (66.2%) and those aged 12-23 months (18.2%). The burden of infection with at least one HCoV, among all pneumonia admissions, was highest in infants and decreased with increasing age (2.6% for those under 1 year and 0.7% for 12-23 months). The same pattern was seen for each individual HCoV type (not shown). However, the proportion of samples testing positive for HCoV (3.9%) did not vary with age group (Fisher's exact p-value = 0.753). Among all HCoV positive participants, mean age was 11 months (median 7 months), there were fewer females than males and fewer with very severe compared to severe pneumonia. At least half of the HCoV positives presented with fever (58%) and nasal flaring (53%).Clinical outcomes of HCoV-infected patients Over a quarter of those positive for at least one of the three endemic HCoVs investigated in this study were admitted to the high dependency unit and of those positive for OC43, 13.5% (n=10) died while 7.8% (n=10) and 7.1% (n=7) died of those positive for NL63 and 229E, respectively. A large proportion of these deaths were observed among those with underlying co-morbidities ( Figure 1 ). None of the HCoVs were statistically significantly associated with any of the specific clinical signs or outcomes investigated (p-values>0.05) except death among NL63 cases (Table 2 ); however, we had limited power to detect associations given the small number of HCoV positive cases.About 47% (n=147) of the 314 HCoV cases were co-infected with other viral respiratory pathogens; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) jointly accounted for >50% of all HCoV coinfections with other pathogens. A similar coinfection pattern was observed for each HCoV tested ( Figure 2 ). Throughout the surveillance period, there were three cases (one of NL63 and two of OC43) aged <1 year that were readmitted and tested positive for the same HCoV as the first admission. The NL63 readmission occurred 10 days after discharge from the first admission while the OC43 readmissions were at 3 and 21 days after discharge from the first admission. The NL63 case had a discharge diagnosis of neonatal sepsis for the first admission and gastroenteritis plus lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) for the readmission. One of the OC43 cases had a discharge diagnosis of LRTI for both admissions while the other had immunosuppression plus malnutrition in the first and immunosuppression plus septicaemia for the second admission.Temporal patterns of different HCoVs NL63 and OC43 were observed fairly consistently throughout the surveillance period while fewer cases of HCoV-229E were observed from the middle of 2011 and were not detected subsequent to 2016 ( Figure 3 ). The highest numbers of cases were observed in the periods April to June for NL63, June to September for OC43 and January to March for 229E. Pooling data for all HCoVs, there were more cases in the colder months (May to September) than the hotter months (October to April) ( Figure 4 ), as for OC43, but NL63 was more common in the first half of the year, and 229E in the second half of the year. However, time series models did not indicate a seasonal pattern for any of the HCoVs ( Figure 5 ) over the years. The proportion of samples tested for HCoV did not change over time among those with severe pneumonia ( 2 (1) 3.11; χ = p-value = 0.078) but changed among those with very severe pneumonia 2 (1) 149.11; χ = p-value < 0.001).De-identified raw data for this study are available as Underlying data 18 .We have described the circulation patterns of three endemic HCoVs (NL63, OC43 and 229E) in a long-term surveillance study of childhood pneumonia hospitalisations in coastal Kenya. We observed a small proportion of pneumonia admissions positive for one or more HCoVs (3.9%). While 65% of HCoV infections occurred in children in their first year of life (either cumulatively for all HCoVs or for each individual HCoV type), this reflected the age-distribution of pneumonia admissions to the ward. Hence, contrary to other reports 19 , HCoV did not differ by age and this might reflect no variation in age-specific community incidence of infection in children under five, together with lack of variation in disease severity (likelihood of hospitalisation) across ages, or (ii) variation in age-specific community incidence by age but with a disproportionate probability of hospitalisation. Our reported prevalence is equivalent to that from a long-term hospital surveillance of seasonal coronaviruses in Scotland (4%) 8 7 . This latter study included locations with a wide range of climate conditions that might influence prevalence; however, the study was not big enough to stratify by location.We did not observe seasonal variation of HCoVs compared to some other respiratory viral pathogens like RSV, as previously reported from our site 14 . In addition, neither peak months for pneumonia admissions nor the long rainy periods (April to July) in Kilifi were associated with HCoV peaks. This is in contrast to data from temperate settings where seasonality of HCoVs has been reported 8, [20] [21] [22] , with increased occurrence during the colder winter months. The HCoVs we have studied are known to continuously circulate among humans 1 , although in Kilifi we observed low numbers for all types. Of interest is that pneumonia associated with 229E admissions was not detected in the later years of the surveillance. We attempted to investigate if this was due to primers or probe mismatches. For all the three tested endemic CoVs we did not observe significant mismatches on the primer/probe pairs against data available from GenBank database although this investigation suffered a limitation of few sequences available globally in recent years (2015-2019) and none from East Africa. With the highest numbers and consistent presence compared to NL63 and 229E, our results suggest that OC43 is the predominant HCoV type in the coastal region of Kenya.The present study did not have a control group by which to assess an aetiological association between the HCoVs and pneumonia. In the PERCH multi-country case-control study 17 HCoVs contributed less than 1% of the etiological fraction. In our study the contribution to disease is not known (except for the relatively small set of samples from 2011-13 that were part of the PERCH study), but it is of note that around 50% co-occurred with another respiratory virus (most commonly with RSV), the risk was not age-dependent, there was no clear association between any of the viruses with the any of the specific clinical signs or outcomes investigated and in 26% of deaths with a HCoV detected there was a likely alternative diagnosis to pneumonia. This suggests the presence of incidental HCoV in Kilifi and other clinical groups (hence an under-estimation in this study), though causality of death outcomes was not differentially identified in this study. While we have been able to sequence the virus from a proportion of the positive specimens 23,24 , we cannot assume 100% specificity, and even a modest level of false positivity could account for many of the positive diagnoses and argues for caution in interpreting the prevalence estimates. Of relevance also is that few (~1%) of the 314 children positive for at least one HCoV were subsequently HCoV-positive readmissions. While this is a crude analysis which ignores censoring at the start and end of the surveillance, and alternative hospitals where patients may have been admitted, it might be an indicator of low probability of severe reinfection. Alternatively, these readmissions might be children with a prolonged infection having not fully recovered at their first discharge. In addition, HKU1 was only tested during the 24 month period that PERCH study was conducted hence samples tested for HKU1 were considered unrepresentative of the entire study period and therefore not included in this analysis.Over the surveillance period, we have changed our sample collection and testing methods. This is a limitation; we did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to compare the different PCR methods, and the addition of an OP swab increases the number of viruses found by NP alone (by 14% for HCoVs) 15 . Some of the observed patterns may have been influenced by these changes. It should be noted that fever, either on history or as measured at the time of admission, was not an inclusion criterion for eligibility, which might have influenced the prevalence of HCoV. If the endemic COVs are strongly associated with symptoms of fever, as is SARS CoV-2, then we might be under-estimating the prevalence due to a selection bias. However, interestingly, only 58% of the HCoV positive cases had axillary temperature of >=37.5°C. A further limitation is that only a fraction (70%) of pneumonia cases was tested for HCoV. We have previously shown that those untested tend to be more severely ill and less likely to be virus positive 14 . The proportion tested has not substantially changed over time among individuals with severe pneumonia but changed among those with very severe pneumonia. Similarly, we did not observe a difference in the ages of those tested and those untested for HCoV across time. We employed various collection methods and these are known to differ in the range of viruses detected. For example, the addition of an OP swab to an NP swab has been found to increase virus yield 15 .In conclusion, in this tropical setting we find the three endemic coronaviruses were observe at low prevalence, not dissimilar to influenza and metapneumovirus, but considerably lower that for RSV and human rhinovirus. There was no clear seasonal variation. As the pandemic of COVID-19 takes its course, it is of interest to speculate whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus will become endemic and continuously co-circulate in the human population with the existing HCoVs 7,25 . The epidemiology of endemic HCoVs can be used to inform our expectations of SARS-CoV-2 in childhood, its potential severity and inter-species interactions and competition. I am satisfied that the authors have sufficiently addressed all the concerns raised.One minor comment: reference #8 is available in peer reviewed published form if the authors wish to update their reference list: https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa185 1 .(since this can affect probabilty of virus detection and violates statistical assumptions of independent data points).Suggest authors add to Methods a brief outline of the changes in testing procedure over time (as mentioned in the Discussion) to aid interpretation of detection trends, as different specimens are likely associated with different probabilities of virus detection.It is unclear why the laboratory screen omitted HCoV-HKU1. Suggest the authors include a comment on the anticipated influence on the overall detection of HCoV.3.It is unclear whether exclusion of untested discharged patients (presumably milder cases) have led to an under-estimation of HCoV detection proportions. Suggest authors add a statement to describe any anticipated influence of this exclusion.The % of pneumonia cases with HCoV detected is clearly low. However, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss this result in the context of other common respiratory viruses detected among cases of pneumonia in this setting, such as influenza and RSV.Discussion page 6: ""...suggests age is not a risk factor for coronavirus associated pneumonia hospital admission"". The role of age as a risk factor for pneumonia cannot be determined here without a non-pneumonia control group. Suggest authors reword this statement and consider whether the lack of variation in age-specific proportions may potentially reflect (i) no variation in age-specific community incidence of infection in children under five, together with lack of variation in severity (likelihood of hospitalisation) across ages, or (ii) variation in age-specific community incidence by age but with a disproportionate probability of hospitalisation.6.Discussion page 9: ""...and in 26% of deaths with a HCoV detected there was a likely alternative diagnosis to pneumonia"". This seems to suggest the role of HCoV on overall hospital burden may be under-estimated by pneumonia cases. Although not an aim of the study, I suggest the authors consider adding a brief comment regarding the generalisability of their findings to other clinical groups to place the results into a wider context.Discussion page 9: Can the authors comment on the possibility that readmissions reflect prolonged virus shedding, rather than indicating reinfection? Longest duration between admissions of 21 days possibly bordering an anticipated peak detection within first few weeks (e.g. for SARS-CoV-2 1 ). Suggest authors consider adding a brief statement to include this possibility.8.Discussion page 10: "" fever... was not an inclusion criterion for eligibility, which might have influenced the prevalence of HCoV"". Suggest authors make clear the anticipated direction of effect on the prevalence -presumably underestimation?9.Discussion page 10: ""...there was a significant age difference for those tested and those untested for HCoV across time."" This statement seems to be at odds with Results page 3 ""..cases untested did not differ from those tested in age distribution.."" Suggest the authors reword as appropriate.10.Conclusions page 10: ""...little evidence of a substantial aetiological contribution..."": The aetiological role of HCoV cannot be established without a control group (as the authors do mention on page 9) i.e. it is not known whether the prevalence of HCoV is lower among cases of ARI without pneumonia. Suggest authors rephrase to put the low HCoV detections within the context of relative contribution of pathogens/other causes to disease aetiology i.e. most pneumonia cases are attributable to other causes.Although presumably outside the scope of this study to analyse, I suggest the authors consider commenting briefly on any potential role of coinfecting respiratory bacteria on HCoV-associated pneumonia in this population; bacterial coinfection may influence the chance of pneumonia/testing for viruses.12. Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Yes Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? Partly Discussion page 6: ""...suggests age is not a risk factor for coronavirus associated pneumonia 1.hospital admission"". The role of age as a risk factor for pneumonia cannot be determined here without a non-pneumonia control group. Suggest authors reword this statement and consider whether the lack of variation in age-specific proportions may potentially reflect (i) no variation in age-specific community incidence of infection in children under five, together with lack of variation in severity (likelihood of hospitalisation) across ages, or (ii) variation in age-specific community incidence by age but with a disproportionate probability of hospitalisation.We have made the change as suggested by the reviewer.Discussion page 9: ""...and in 26% of deaths with a HCoV detected there was a likely alternative diagnosis to pneumonia"".

Although not an aim of the study, I suggest the authors consider adding a brief comment regarding the generalisability of their findings to other clinical groups to place the results into a wider context.We have made the change as suggested by the reviewer.Discussion page 9: Can the authors comment on the possibility that readmissions reflect 1.prolonged virus shedding, rather than indicating reinfection? Longest duration between admissions of 21 days possibly bordering an anticipated peak detection within first few weeks (e.g. for SARS-CoV-21). Suggest authors consider adding a brief statement to include this possibility.Response: It is possible these are prolonged infections rather than reinfections and we have added the following to the text in the discussion: ""...probability of severe reinfection. Alternatively, these readmissions might be children with a prolonged infection having not fully recovered at their first discharge"" Discussion page 10: "" fever... was not an inclusion criterion for eligibility, which might have 1.influenced the prevalence of HCoV"". Suggest authors make clear the anticipated direction of effect on the prevalence -presumably underestimation?Response: This is possible, but we don't know that these endemic HCoVs behave like SRAS-CoV-2 ie are strongly associated with fever, hence again difficult to speculate as to which direction. We therefore added this statement to the limitations "" If the endemic COVs are strongly associated with symptoms of fever, as is SARS=CoV-2, then we might be underestimating the prevalence due to a selection bias"".Discussion page 10: ""...there was a significant age difference for those tested and those untested for HCoV across time."" This statement seems to be at odds with Results page 3 ""..cases untested did not differ from those tested in age distribution.."" Suggest the authors reword as appropriate.We have made the change as suggested by the reviewer.Conclusions page 10: ""...little evidence of a substantial aetiological contribution..."": The aetiological role of HCoV cannot be established without a control group (as the authors do mention on page 9) i.e. it is not known whether the prevalence of HCoV is lower among cases of ARI without pneumonia. Suggest authors rephrase to put the low HCoV detections within the context of relative contribution of pathogens/other causes to disease aetiology i.e. most pneumonia cases are attributable to other causes.We have made the change as suggested by the reviewer.Although presumably outside the scope of this study to analyse, I suggest the authors consider commenting briefly on any potential role of coinfecting respiratory bacteria on HCoV-associated pneumonia in this population; bacterial coinfection may influence the chance of pneumonia/testing for viruses.We had very low proportions of bacterial infections among the positive cases: NL63 (2/74=2.7%), OC43 (3/129=2.3%), 229E (2/99=2.02%). We feel there is too little coinfection to allow speculation on this.Right column, second line: ""… alive or dead)."" ○ There are two mentions of which viruses were tested for on page 3: suggest concatenate into one mention (probably best placed in the ""Laboratory methods"" paragraph).

It is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [18, 31] that belongs to the same family with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which are known to cause pneumonia in humans [18, 22, 2, 33] . The first outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has since spread to the rest of the world [2, 33, 26] which saw it being declared a world pandemic in 2020 [22, 27] Currently, there are over 21 million confirmed cases, over 750 thousand deaths and close to 14 million recoveries. Africa alone has over one million confirmed cases, about 24 thousand deaths and about 780 thousand recoveries. Nigeria currently is the third highest contributor to the African burden with about 48 thousand confirmed cases, close to a thousand deaths and over 34 thousand recoveries [35] . The COVID-19 primary source of transmission was firstly suspected to be from wild animals to humans but in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, the primary source was patients infected with COVID-19 travelling into the continent [18, 2, 31] In general, COVID-19 case fatality is low but people with co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and hypertension are at high risk of COVID-19 fatalities. The routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory droplets (generated via sneezing and coughing), close contact with an infected person, contact with environmental surfaces and aerosols. Successful infection by a virus occurs when adequate viral load enters the body, penetrates the target cells, replicates and gets released to infect more cells [18] . The symptoms of COVID-19 illness are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, headache, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, difficulty with breathing and muscular pain [2, 26, 25] . Severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory syndrome, acute cardiac failure, acute kidney failure, anaemia, stroke, multiple organ dysfunction, and secondary bacterial infection [36] . The current preventive methods, among others, are maintaining physical distancing, observing cough etiquette, quarantine, isolation and community lock downs [33, 34] .The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to range from 2 to 14 days [22] . Available evidence showed that COVID-19 human-to-human transmission occurs during the asymptomatic incubation period which is usually 2 to 10 days [27] . This suggests that for any systems to control the infection effectively, the asymptomatic individuals should be subjected to testing so that preventive measures such as self and mandatory isolation can be effected to reduce the spread of the infection. Community mass testing is one of the strategies that can be used to identify infected individuals. Isolation is the separation of persons with contagious disease from those not infected [7] . The infected individuals can be isolated in hospital settings for severe and critical diseases while sub-clinical infections can stay at home. For isolation to be effective in halting transmission, cases should be identified before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding [33, 14] . One of the effective testing instruments is the use of real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [18, 3] which was used effectively among sheltered people in Boston, USA and South Korea on the asymptomatic population to reduce the risk of community transmissions instead of focusing only on those with severe symptoms or high risk groups [3] . It has been argued that a populationwide mass testing would help identify individuals that are likely to transmit disease long before symptoms appear [28] . Thus, the fight against COVID-19 is a war against an invisible enemy which requires rapid detection of those that can transmit the infection and quickly isolate them before viral shedding commences.COVID-19 sufferers can be classified into three groups: sub-clinical (asymptomatic and mild symptomatic) infections, severe disease, and critical disease [22] . The first two groups accounts for approximately 81% of cases and usually resolve without any pharmacologic intervention [22] . They pose serious danger to containment because they can transmit the virus without being aware of their status. This group often refuses isolation from the community and even when isolated, may attempt to escape from the isolation centre and can recover without any intervention. Those with severe disease account for 14% and would require hospitalization, supportive and pharmacologic therapies while those with critical disease account for the remaining 5% requiring nursing in the intensive care unit with ventilator [22] . Treatment administration remains largely supportive therapy [22, 10] .Our study seeks to assess the potential impact of isolation and mass testing of the population on the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria using mathematical modelling approach. We present the background setting for Nigeria henceforth.Nigeria has a population of 205, 416, 152 persons as of 14 May 2020 [35] . The Nigeria COVID-19 cases started with an imported case of a 44-year-old Italian citizen who presented himself to the staff clinic on the 26 th of February 2020 and was later confirmed as the first official case of COVID-19 in Nigeria on the 27 th of February 2020. Contact tracing for the index case identified about 40 asymptomatic who were tested and produced one confirmed positive making it the second case of COVID-19 on the 8 th of March 2020. More imported cases were reported in March and since then the infection rose to current aforementioned pandemic levels in Nigeria [21, 12] .We formulate a mathematical model to study the dynamics COVID-19 incorporating mass testing and, self and mandatory isolation. We consider a homogeneously mixing population that comprises of the following compartments: the susceptible population S(t), the exposed population with the virus but not yet able to transmit it to other individuals E(t), infectious asymptomatic population not yet tested I A (t), infectious asymptotic population that has been tested and self isolating I AT (t), infectious symptomatic population I s (t), infectious symptomatic isolated population under health care enclosures and monitoring J(t) and the removed population R(t). We assume that mass testing mostly affects those in classes I A (t), I s (t) mainly because these are the only classes where individuals test positive. Individuals in S(t) and E(t) and R(t) will test negative and thus, will remain in the same class as the ones untested. Individuals in I s (t) as soon as they test positive are immediately transferred into isolation centres and hence, are assumed not to self isolate. The total human population N (t) isSince COVID-19 is a respiratory , we leave out the demographic parameters and concentrate on the infection and intervention dynamics due to differences in time scales of occurrence between demographic and infection dynamics. The force of infection for the model is assumed to be(1)The model (1) has initial conditions given byΩ = {(S(t), E(t), I A (t), I AT (t), I s (t), J(t), R(t)) ∈ R 7 + |0 < N (t) ≤ N 0 } 3 ResultsModel (1) describes dynamics of COVID-19 within the human population and therefore it is important and necessary to prove that all the variables used in the model (S(t), E(t), I A (t), I AT (t), I s (t), J(t), R(t)) are non-negative for all time and also that solutions for model system (1) with positive initial data will remain positive for all time and are bounded in Ω. (1) with nonnegative intial conditions are positive for all t ≥ 0.Proof Solving the first equation of model system (1) using the separation of variables method we haveIt is easy to follow a similar analysis to show that the other state variables E(t), I A (t), I AT (t), I s (t), J(t), R(t) are non-negative for all t > 0. Based on this we conclude that the solutions of model system (1) remain positive for all t ≥ 0 and this completes the proof. Proof Considering the total population for model system (1) N (t) we haveby the positivity of I s and J. The solution to the differential inequality using intial conditions N (0) = N 0 is given byHence, we conclude that N (t) is bounded above and all state variables are bounded.The disease free equilibrium point is given by (N 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) .Using the next generation matrix approach by [29] , our model satisfy the conditions A1 to A5 and the basic reproduction number R 0 is given byR S is a local reproduction number that measures the secondary infections that arise when the index case is a symptomatic infectious individual, R S is a local reproduction number that measures the secondary infections that arise when the index case is an asymptomatic infectious individual not tested, R AT is a local reproduction number that measures the secondary infections that arise when the index case is an asymptomatic infectious individual who has been tested and self isolating and R J , is a local reproduction number that measures the secondary infections that arise when the index case is an isolated infectious individual. It follows from the fact that the model satisfy conditions A1 to A5 of [29] that the disease free equilibrium is stable when R 0 < 1 and unstable when R 0 > 1. Hence, the stability theorem below holds Theorem 3 The disease free equilibrium point E 0 for model system (1) is locally asymptotically stable provided that R 0 < 1.To determine the peak of the epidemic we define a weighted infected sum y(t) aswhereThe infected compartments E(t), I A (t), I AT (t), I s (t) and J(t) are considered since they contribute to the infection. Now differentiating (2) with respect to t yieldsand substituting E (t), I A (t), I AT (t), I s (t) and J (t) from system (1) into (4) and simplifying yieldsHence, dividing y (t) by S (t) of model system (1) yieldswhere N = N 0 is a constant considering the limiting population of N. Integrating (5) with initial conditions y(0) = y 0 and S(0) = S 0 gives. The maximum value of y(t) at any time t is the number of infective when y (0) = 0, that is when. This is given byTo determine the final size relation of the basic reproduction number and the size of the epidemic, we take S 0 = N and S ∞ to be a non-negative smooth decreasing function that tends to a limit as t → ∞, i.e S ∞ > 0. Using the Kermack-Mckendrick model approach [4] , letAdding the first two equations and, also the first three equations of system of equations (1), we obtain (S + E) = −σE.Integrating equation (7) on [0, ∞), we obtainIntegrating equation three of system equation (1) we haveand alsoFrom the first equation of system (1) we have(13) and hence substituting (8)-(11) into (13) and simplifying yieldswhere. Therefore equation (14) gives the final size relation with initial terms I s0 , E 0 , I A0 , I AT 0 and J 0 . If the initial terms are assumed to be E(0) = I A (0) = I AT (0) = I s (0) = J(0) = 0, and if a small number of infectives are introduced into the population then we have S 0 ≈ N 0 such that the final size relation has the formEquation (15) can be simplified further to give 4 Global stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium Theorem 4 The disease free equilibrium for models system (1) is globally asymptotically stable provided that R 0 < 1.Proof In order to prove the above theorem we construct a Lyapunov function as followsTherefore expanding (16) and simplifying with the definition of A, B, C and D in equation (3) yieldsUsing the definition of R 0 this further simplifies totherefore is R 0 < 1, then it follows that L ≤ 0. It also follows that when E(t) = I A (t) = I AT (t) = I s (t) = J(t) = 0, L ≤ 0 and hence the largest compact invariant set is the singleton {E 0 }. Therefore by LaSalle's invariance principle it follows that E 0 is globally asymptotically stable in Ω. This completes the proof.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-03",9

COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV 2) and was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1] [2] [3] . This new virus has quickly spread globally afflicting 215 countries. As of June 13 th, 2020, over 7.8 million cases and 430,000 deaths have been reported globally [4] .In Cameroon, the first case confirmed on the 6 th of March 2020 was a French national who arrived Yaoundé. To control and avoid the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the country, several measures were adopted by the government. These measures include the limitation of the number of passengers of public transportation; the closing of all schools; quarantine and care for infected people or suspected cases; closure of borders and suspension of flights; suspension of issuance of entry visas to Cameroon; gatherings of more than 50 people prohibited; bars, restaurants, and public places closed from 6 pm; consumer flow regulations set up in markets and supermarkets; urban and inter-urban travel only undertaken in cases of extreme necessity; overloading in public transport vehicles prohibited; implementation of virtual meetings; avoiding close contact such as shaking hands or hugging and covering the mouth when sneezing.The number of those infected is still on the rise and after the government uplifted some of the COVID-19 restrictive measures on bars, taxis, restaurants. Several other cases were confirmed later amounting to 8681 cases, 4836 recovered and 212 deaths [4] . The infection rate and the resources needed to battle this disease can be expected to increase exponentially.Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 and no clinical trial data supporting any prophylactic treatment. In the absence of this approved treatment, available treatments are directed at relieving symptoms and the panic of no approved treatment can lead to embracing other non-standard options. Agents previously used to treat SARS and MERS are potential candidates to treat COVID-19 [5] as well as various agents with apparent in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, also used in the prevention and treatment of malaria and/or chronic inflammatory diseases. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug is being touted as a possible coronavirus treatment [6] .Responses to epidemics in Africa have been challenged by limited infrastructure and fragile healthcare systems. This includes the lack of adequate surveillance to assess the scope of the outbreak, and inadequate systems for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of a disease. Cases of COVID 19 as with other diseases are broadly classified as suspected, probable, and confirmed [7] . Assessing the symptoms of COVID 19 (suspected cases) is a preliminary step in the diagnosis and management of this disease.Person to person transmission (community spread) is currently ongoing in the country, making it necessary to control the disease to avoid its rapid spread throughout the country. To guarantee successful disease control, people's adherence to preventive and control measures are essential. This adherence is highly dependent on the population's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 following the KAP theory. A previous study indicates that the knowledge level and attitudes towards infectious diseases are associated with the level of panic among the population, which can further complicate attempts to prevent the spread of the disease, thus prompting alternative treatment sources [8] .Due to shortages in diagnostic kits in our setting during our study, a questionnaire to gauge the symptomatic trend was issued to Cameroonians to strategically define an approach to address the outbreak. In this study, according to guidelines for clinical and community management of COVID-19 by the Cameroon National Health Development Plan, our objective was to evaluate the factors influencing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Cameroonian respondents on COVID 19 and also evaluate the associations between the demographics, KAP and symptoms of COVID 19.The Ethical Committee of the Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies, Yaoundé, approved the study protocol and procedures before the formal survey.This cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 20 to May 20, two weeks after the partial confinement was implemented in the country. Because it was not feasible to do a communitybased national sampling survey during this period, data was collected online. Relying on the authors' networks with local people living in all the 10 regions of Cameroon (S1 Table) , a onepage recruitment sheet was posted to groups and individuals via ""WhatsApp"", email, websites accounts. This page (S1 Appendix) contained a brief introduction to the background, objective, procedures, voluntary nature of participation, declarations of anonymity and confidentiality, and notes for filling in the questionnaire, as well as the link of the online copy questionnaire. The associations between the demographics and KAP, symptoms and KAP, comorbidities, symptoms of COVID 19 with age, and gender were assessed.The independent variables were symptomatology, demographic characteristics (gender, age, profession, working environment, city of residence).The dependent variables were knowledge, attitudes, practice, and symptoms of/towards COVID 19. Questions on knowledge were about the mode of transmission, attitude towards health-seeking behaviors and practices like avoiding crowded areas, wearing masks, washing hands and using sanitizers, taking vitamin C, citrus fruits, traditional concoctions, and drugs (chloroquine, ibuprofen, paracetamol). Symptomatology was assessed by someone presenting with fever, headache, dry cough/catarrh, throat irritation, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, and muscle pain. The symptomatology section was accompanied by associated comorbidities and diseases with similar symptoms.Cameroonian residents, aged 18 years or more, employed or unemployed who understood the content of the recruitment page-and who agreed to participate in the study completed the questionnaire.The questionnaire consisted of four parts: demographics, knowledge, attitudes, practices, and symptomatology. A COVID-19 KAP and symptomatology questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire had 32 questions: 7 items on knowledge, 4 items on attitudes, 9 items on practices, 5 items on symptomatology (for suspected cases), 5 on demographics, and 2 others (source of information). Questions were answered on a Yes/No basis with an additional ""I don't know"" option. Some open-ended questions were asked.A score of 1 was attributed to a correct answer and 0 to a wrong answer for knowledge, attitude, and practice. The Knowledge range was 3-7, 1-4 for attitude, and 2-9 for practice. The overall scores of each individual were used to obtain mean scores for KAP. Blooms' cut-off was used. Frequencies of correct knowledge answers and various attitudes and practices were described. Multiple logistic regression analysis using all of the demographic variables as independent variables and knowledge/ practice score as the outcome variable was conducted to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice. Similarly, binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with practices. Factors were selected with a backward stepwise method. Unstandardized regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (ORs) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the associations between variables and KAP. Associations between demographic variables of gender and age were compared to comorbidities and symptoms (�3). Also, associations between demographics and KAP were studied. Data analyses were conducted with SPSS version 23.0. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05 (two-sided).A total of 1006 participants completed the survey. The average age of those who participated was 33±11.2. The demographic characteristics of all the participants are presented in Table 1 . Of all respondents, 53.1% were female and 26.6% were students in the university or high school. About the working environment, 26.9% of the participants interacted face to face with others (i.e customer services cashiers, hairdressers, traders, etc), 25.5% spent most of their time in the office, and 20.4% at home. Overall, 62.8% were residents of the capital city Yaoundé.For the source/period of information, 41.9% of the respondents knew when the disease began (December 2019) and 14.4% only knew in March 2020 when the first case was reported in Cameroon. Greater than half of the respondents (54.5%) got the information on COVID 19 for the first time via the television during the first and last 15 days of the study, the respondents got the information primarily through television followed by Whatsapp and websites ( Table 2) .For the mode of transmission, 94.3% knew that the disease could be transmitted by droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, 75.6% said through kissing infected person, 74.7% through a handshake, 88.3% through touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth ( Table 3 ). The results show that 84.19% (n = 847) respondents had high knowledge score of 4-7 on the transmission of the disease (Table 4 ).Attitude towards COVID 19 health-seeking behaviors was assessed. Of all respondents, 73.1% think they can be contaminated by health care workers, 28.6% refuse to go to the hospital even if they are suffering from another disease other than COVID 19. Out of the 28.6% of those who do not want to go to the hospital, 21.3% are afraid of being contaminated in the hospital with nosocomial infections like COVID19, 3.5% think the health personnel can misdiagnose their illness given that many other diseases have similar symptoms (Table 3) .Regarding people's willingness to do a COVID 19 test, 72.0% were willing to do a voluntary test among which 47% of them preferred the house over the hospital for their medical care if tested positive. People's preference for house medical care is because they are afraid of being contaminated in the hospital (38.6%), their families can take good care of them and they feel comfortable at home (58.1%) ( Table 3) . Overall, 69% of respondents had a high attitude score of 2-4 for health-seeking behavior (Table 4 ).All the respondents use masks (100%), 94.5% wash hands and use sanitizers, 83.8% practice social distancing, or don't go to crowded places, while 20% are confined at home. Looking at what people take as preventive measures, 74.6% eat citrus fruits and take vitamin C tablets. We also observed that 35.9% resort to traditional concoctions, auto medications like chloroquine (4.4%), (5.6%) paracetamol, and Ibuprofen (Table 3) .Also, 60.8% of respondents were taking precautions (good practice) like avoiding crowded areas, wearing masks, washing hands, and using sanitizers, taking vitamin C and citrus fruits. Statistical significant differences in knowledge of disease transmission were observed with gender, working environment, and city of residence (Table 5) .Age > 20 years was associated to high knowledge and attitude scores on COVID 19 (Table 6 ). Women had lower practice scores compared to men (OR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.56-0.92) and Douala respondents had had high practice scores (OR = 1.16; 95%CI 1.13-2.45) when compared to those from Yaoundé (Table 6 ).Out of all the respondents, 71.7% reported no symptoms of the disease, while 5.0% reported fever, 8.3% dry cough/catarrh, 6.5% throat irritation, 13.1% headache, 0.9% diarrhea, 2.5% difficulty breathing, 6.0% muscle pain and 2.2% don't smell odor or taste. Of all the respondents, 4.7% suffered from hypertension, 6.9% from a common cold, and 24.6% from malaria ( Table 7 ). Significant statistical differences were observed with respondents having hypertension > 30 years when compared to those <30 years (Table 7) . Forty-one respondents (4.1%) had more than 3 symptoms with only 9 (21.95%) who called 1510 while 32 (78.05%) did not call 1510. The association between the KAP and the symptomatology was assessed to see the influence of KAP on the risk of having the disease. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between those having symptoms and those without symptoms. Also, no significant difference was observed with those having <3 symptoms to those having >3 symptoms (Table 8) .Overall 23 respondents having �4 symptoms had underlying comorbidities and 10 of them had other diseases with symptoms similar to COVID 19 (Fig 1) . Also, 168 (18.1%) out of 262 of those with symptoms did not have them recurrently. Overall COVID 19 is spreading rapidly across the whole world and increasing exponentially in Cameroon [4] . This is one of the first studies that identify symptoms (suspected cases) of COVID 19 which is a thoughtful thing to do in a population experiencing a sudden outbreak. This method used to recruit participants is cost-effective and feasible given that the data was collected during a period of confinement and it can be employed as a rapid screening method in subsequent pandemic situations. In this study, predominantly women in an overall 84.19% had adequate knowledge about the mode of transmission of COVID 19. Akwa et al. [9] reported in his study that > 80% of respondents knew the disease is transmitted by a handshake, person to person, and contact with infectious droplets only. Our findings show that there is an increase in the knowledge perception of disease transmission since respondents now know it is transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose, or mouth. We found that 69% of respondents had a high attitude score towards hospital seeking behavior while 60.8% took the necessary precautions like avoiding crowded areas, wore masks, washing hands regularly as stipulated by the WHO and CDC guidelines [10] . The practice score was not as high as expected because 39.2% of people resorted to traditional concoctions and auto medications. These potentially risky behaviors were related to the female gender maybe because within Cameroon traditional context women are caregivers to the family. So communication initiatives, educational forums are needed to educate women on these risky practices.The strict adherence to preventive practices could primarily be attributed to the very strict prevention and control measures implemented by local governments to put on masks and washing hands at every public place. The big question remains as to whether the masks are appropriately used given the current increase in the number of cases in Cameroon. The efficiency of social distancing may be compromised given that 26.9% of respondents interacted face to face (like in customer service points, banks, markets, etc), and the government later uplifted restrictive measures on bars and other leisure places.The factors: gender, age, and city of residence which correlated positively with knowledge, practice for COVID 19 will be useful for public health policy-makers and health workers to recognize the target population for COVID-19 prevention and sensitization. The level of awareness on COVID-19 among Cameroonian residents was expected because 44.1% of the respondents knew that the disease outbreak was in December 2019 and 54.5% of the respondents got the information through the television before the first imported case in the country was recorded in March 2020. Sample characteristics such as; University students (BSc, Master, and Ph.D.) and private-sector workers, actively acquired knowledge of this infectious disease from various television channels, websites, and WhatsApp because of the alarming and global situation of the epidemic. So good sources of communication among Cameroonian residents in pandemic situations like this are the television, social media followed by mouth to mouth communication by those who don't have access to these technologies. Cases of COVID 19 as with other diseases are broadly classified as suspected, probable, and confirmed cases [7] . Also, clinical symptoms vary from mild to moderate other than severe in old people with comorbidities [11] . Assessing the symptoms of COVID 19 (suspected cases) is a preliminary step in the diagnosis and management of this disease. This study showed that 41/1006 respondents had � 3 symptoms (Fever, dry cough/catarrh, throat irritation, headache) linked to COVID 19. This estimate is hypothetical as some COVID 19 symptoms are equally clinical signs of other diseases like malaria and respiratory tract infections (bronchitis) [12] . Respondents experiencing � 3 symptoms must seek medical help since the differential diagnosis of malaria or respiratory infections and COVID 19 is slim. Also, there are no significant differences in KAP between those having symptoms and those without symptoms. This warrants further investigation to assess the effectiveness of the measures put in place to curb the spread of the disease given the continuous increase in the number of cases and the overall high KAP score. Also, hypertension was more prevalent in respondents > 30 years old with P-value <0.001. Arif et al [13] showed that hypertension is linked to old age with an overall prevalence of hypertension of 41.9% (95% CI: 37.2-46.6) in a total of 418 residents in Ethiopia � 50 years Knowledge, attitudes, practices of/towards COVID 19 and symptoms in Cameroon old. Overall 23 respondents having �4 symptoms had underlying comorbidities and 10 of them had other diseases with symptoms similar to COVID 19 in our study. This could be potentially dangerous for these patients given that, previous studies on coronavirus death rates have also been shockingly higher in pre-existing comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, Hypertension, Chronic respiratory disease, Cancer [14, 15] . Of all the respondents,168 (18.1%) out of 262 of those with symptoms did not frequently or habitually experience such symptoms. Among the 168 respondents, those presenting with � 3 symptoms were considered as suspected cases.The presence of � 3 symptoms in 4% (56% of them with co-morbidities) of the population surveyed supports the current trend in the number of confirmed cases (8681) in Cameroon. Thus widespread testing in the community is relevant because <22% of people with COVID 19 symptoms seek help. Given that 32(78.05%) of respondents who had more than 3 symptoms and did not call 1510, won't be able to manage their conditions appropriately without the counsel of medical personnel they will further contribute to the spread of the disease. The hesitance to call was attributed to fear of getting contaminated, stigmatization if they are COVID 19 positive and misdiagnosis. Having symptoms and also comorbidities is high risk and not seeking help at the hospital and resorting to traditional concoctions with no standard dosage and auto-medications is much riskier. This calls for more sensitization and discrete ways of managing cases.COVID 19 outbreak has put the whole world under panic and in our context stigma. People's attitudes and practices could stem from panic and stigma or the knowledge provided to them. One way to avoid this could be to create a confidential online system to share COVID 19 experiences and consult online which is one of the objectives of our study. A better approach would have been to use more sophisticated software technics like qualtrics (which we didn't have in our settings) to geolocalize suspected cases and circumscribe a particular neighborhood for rapid and prompt intervention. Also, telecommunication industries could engage in sending daily consultation messages to the population on COVID 19 symptoms which could serve as baseline data for health personnel. The effectiveness of the prevention measures of COVID 19 still needs to be well established (total confinement being the best option) reason being that there is an increase in the number of cases regardless of a high KAP score observed in our study. Our study opens more doors for scholars who could use the same research design to collect data in similar situations; and learning from what is happening in Cameroon could be useful for comparative studies on COVID 19 experiences of other African countries. Women should be the primary target audience for behavior change initiatives by program managers on the management and understanding of COVID 19 disease. This behavior change initiative is of paramount importance to preclude negative attitudes of not going to the hospital (or calling 1510) when sick and encourage positive preventive and therapeutic practices, for fear of a rapid rise in mortality rate due to auto medications and traditional concoctions.Due to limited access to the internet and online information resources, populations in remote areas were not interviewed since the disease is most prevalent in the cities.KAP studies for people at the grass-root level in Cameroon are needed to assess their preparedness towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The second limitation is the limited sample representativeness used to assess suspected cases, comorbidities, and the unstandardized assessment of attitudes towards health-seeking behavior, which should be developed via focus group discussion and in-depth interview accompanied by confirmatory tests. Thirdly, a KAP is a quantitative tool and that to focus on behavior change qualitative work would be necessary. Finally a poststratification analysis was not feasible in our study reason being that the latest census in Cameroon was carried out in 2005.Supporting information S1 Appendix. Survey questionnaire.

The viral infection is believed to have originated in China with the initial epicentre in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China [3, 4] . The actual date of origin of the infection and first patient is still unknown; however, it is believed that this virus may have crossed from wild animals to humans, a possible zoonotic virus that is originally from bats, akin to the African Ebola and the Lassa fever viruses [5] . Over the course of time the epicentre, the epicentre has moved from China to Italy and currently the epicentre in the USA. At the time of writing this article there is no known vaccine or treatment option available. Even though the death rate is lower than the historical coronavirus-associated SARS, the recovery rate seems to be relatively protracted. This has resulted in straining health care systems globally and sub-Saharan Africa may become the next epicentre if the infection is not controlled effectively. In most countries around the world, the only means of control is by instating a nationwide lockdown. Countries, such as South Africa, that took this initiative, however disastrous it was on the economy, have witnessed a slower infection rate, from 45% to less than 4% (between 27 th March 2020 and 10 th of April 2020).As viral disease outbreaks are not often foreseen, COVID-19 is a global emergency and there is a race against time to produce either a vaccine and/or effective drugs to curb the global plague of COVID-19 [6] . Several drug treatments have been proposed worldwide.Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved drug that was used to treat malaria has been proposed, in combination with zinc, to be effective in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 in patients [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . This is because chloroquine is an endocytosis blocker and acts as an ionophore that facilitates the entry of Zn 2+ into cells such as T-lymphocytes and Zn 2+ is known to inhibit coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase [13] . Other antiviral agents including remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon α, have also been proposed as possible treatment alternatives against COVID-19 [14, 15] . Currently, several countries have begun chloroquine and antiretroviral treatment trials; however, some of the clinical information emanating from these trials is still anecdotal and cannot be justified as the treatment of choice [16] . As the world continues to grapple with the outbreak of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, the most logical approach to treating this infection is by accelerated rational J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f drug discovery [17] using a combination of computational modelling and empirical studies [18, 19] , such as in autoimmune disease drug discovery [20] . However, this is only possible if there are empirically determined crystal structures of key druggable targets in the virus. In this instance, M pro , a viral protease, represents a prime target because it is critical for processing viral polyproteins and viral maturation inside infected host cells [21] . Of concern are unconfirmed reports in Asia of people who have recently recovered from COVID-19 infection and have tested positive for a second time. This may point to the fact that vaccines alone may not be the best strategy for dealing with this pandemic. This, therefore, underscores the need for a rational approach to the discovery of drugs to treat the current scourge of COVID-19.Proteases are attractive targets in a rational approach to COVID-19 drug discovery. This is because most retroviruses depend on key enzymes, such as proteases, for processing of their polyprotein precursors [22] [23] [24] . Zhang et al. [21] recently published a paper on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-Cov-2 M pro ) with accession code 6Y2G and deposited it in the Protein Data Bank in March 2020 [21] . A notable feature of this atomic structure is that a derivative of an α-ketoamide inhibitor is bound to the enzyme and this must, therefore, serve as the seeding point that drives the rational drug design approach towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery. This atomic structure, in addition to the other ~112 PDB-deposited structures related to COVID-19, can serve as a template to discover other potential inhibitors using computational/machine learning (artificial intelligence) studies. Currently, several databases are curating several million compounds, some of which are FDA-approved drugs as well as drugs that are at the final stages of clinical trials with published outcomes. Databases such as DrugBank [25, 26] and PubChem [27, 28] offer structural biologists the opportunity to X-ray millions of compounds that can be validated theoretically as having potential bioactivity towards SARS-CoV2 viral enzymes.Drug repurposing, which describes the identification and development of an existing drug for a new indication [29] [30] [31] , is rationalised by computer-aided drug design. Computer-aided drug design and discovery has become progressive in recent times, primarily due to state-ofthe-art advances in algorithms that simulate, to near-reality, the structure and function (behaviour) of biomolecules, especially regarding biomolecular interactions. This also has been aided with the development of supercomputing technologies with incredible capacities to perform these calculations at an astonishing speed. Several studies have described the success of computer-aided drug repurposing towards the discovery of a new generation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anti-cancer therapeutics [30] . In the event of an outbreak of disease at epidemic or pandemic scale, drug-repurposing is an answer to accelerated (""warp-speed"") discovery of drugs to mitigate the devastating effect of highly communicable disease, such as the Ebola virus outbreak and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Studies have also suggested that drug-repurposing will greatly enhance and enable the discovery of existing drugs that can treat the clinical stage of tSARS-CoV-2 infections [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . A recent study by Wan et al. [32] using analysis based on decade-long structural studies of the coronavirus suggested that remdesivir could be repurposed for the treatment of the virus, targeting the Main-protease. Hoffmann et al. [37] also recently suggested that a known protease inhibitor can be repurposed to block the entry the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an event that depends on ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) receptors. Most of these studies have suggested repurposing FDA-approved drugs; hence, empirical studies backed by computational studies may be ongoing to prove this concept.This study typifies the contribution of Computational Biology and Chemistry in the race towards successful rational drug design discovery. Our work showcases the value of biocomputational studies and that it may be used effectively and reliably as a tool to validate the results obtained using other biochemical and biophysical techniques. In light of this, our study validated the study by Zhang et al. [21] and other studies that proposed to repurposing [38] of currently available drugs such as such as remdesivir, a drug that was initially designed, although ineffective, against the Ebola virus [18, 19] . We could have screened the entire DrugBank and other publicly available small molecule databases using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), but we chose to begin with two classes of protease inhibitors (i) the ketoamide inhibitors and (ii) known antiretrovirals including remdesivir, saquinavir, atazanavir using computational modelling approaches. We used HTVS, induced-fit ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies to identify additional classes of plausible FDA-approved drugs as possible drug candidate to treat COVID-19. The conceptual framework of our study is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The α-ketoamide derivative (Lig13b) by Zhang et al. [21] and eleven FDS-approved antiretrovirals (Table S1 ) were submitted to the PubChem and DrugBank databases for analog search. Similar compounds were extracted in a structured data file (SDF) format and submitted to the LigPrep module implemented in Maestro v12 for ligand preparation, which involves energy minimisation using OPLS 2005 force field. The algorithm was set to generate possible states of the molecules at pH 7.0±2, while accurately predicting the pKa of these states at the set pH using the Epik module of the algorithm. The ligands were also desalted and possible tautomeric states (~32 tautomers/ligand) were further generated at pH 7.0±2. Additionally, specific chiral centres were retained (for molecules with multiple chiral centres), while other chiral centres were varied during the ligand preparation to return chemically sensible structures. These generated molecules were saved as a compressed Maestro file. The atomic coordinate for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID 6Y2G) was extracted from the RCSB-PDB database and submitted to the Protein Preparation Wizard module implemented in Maestro. The entire structure was energy-minimised by assignment of accurate protonation state at physiological pH and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structure using the default parameters. The stereochemistry of the side chains was checked to ensure that no major perturbations were induced while preparing the structure.A grid file of the receptor was prepared using Maestro for the HTVS. More than 33000 molecules were prepared using the LigPrep algorithm and were submitted to the highthroughput virtual screening (HTVS) module implemented in Maestro. Three steps of the virtual screening workflow were used, beginning with the HTVS, the standard protocol (SP) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and finally the extend protocol. The option for MM/GBSA was not applied at this step. The Lipinski ADME filtering was not applied, but the QikProp filtering was applied during the HTVS. The ligand docking step in the HTVS performed initial docking of the entire set of more than 33000 molecules and 10% of the HTVS-docked ligands were further subjected to SP-docking protocol. This rigorous and systematic process generated docked potential hits that were scored using Glide docking scores.Top scoring ligands in each class of drug were extracted and re-submitted to the induced-fit docking (IFD) module implemented in the Maestro v12 algorithm, which employs a mixed molecular docking and dynamic protocol. Briefly, the standard IFD protocol was applied to the selected (centroid) amino acid side chains (19-29, 38-54, 85, 114-119, 126, 136-147, 161-175, 181, 185-193) in an implicit solvent model using the OPLS_2005 force field. H-bond and metal ion constraints were applied to both the initial and re-docking stages. Ring conformational sampling with a 2.5 kcal/mol energy barrier, as well as a non-planar conformation penalty on amide bonds was applied to the IFD protocol. The scaling for both receptor and ligand was set at 0.5 with a maximum of 20 allowable poses per ligand.Residues within 5 Å of the docked ligand were further refined using Prime Refinement algorithm implemented in Maestro v12. Prime energy was used to rank the refined proteinligand complexes. The receptor structures within 30 kcal/mol of the minimum energy structure were submitted for a final round of Glide docking and scoring. Each ligand was redocked into every single refined low-energy receptor structure in the subsequent second docking step using the default Glide XP settings.Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out using GPU-enabled Desmond [39] [40] [41] engine implemented in Maestro v12. The complex corresponding to the top-scoring pose for each ligand or the un-complexed (Apo) protein was saved as a PDB file and submitted to the Linux (Ubuntu) computer for the Desmond high-performance molecular dynamics simulations studies. This study has two main phases; namely, system building (solvation and ionisation) and production. The System Builder module implemented in the Desmond algorithm was used to solvate the system using the TIP3P explicit solvent model with the OPLS_2005 force field. The model was placed in an orthorhombic water box (distance from the box face to the outermost protein/ligand atom = 10 Å, box angle α = β = γ = 90°). The box J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f volume was minimised, and counter ions added to neutralise the system, making sure the ions are placed at least 20 Å from each ligand. The system was physiologically conditioned by adding 0.15 M NaCl into the solvent box. After the solvation and ionisation phase in the explicit solvent model was completed, the system was submitted to the molecular dynamics production phase. This phase of MD simulation is divided into eight distinct stages with specified parameters. The first seven stages involve the equilibration phase and is composed of short simulation steps.Step 8 is a final, long simulation stage. A total of 50 ns production stage was carried out. In the first stage, the type and parameters of the solvated system were detected. In stage 2, a 100 ps simulation was carried out using Brownian Dynamics under NVT conditions at 10 K, while placing restraints on solute heavy atoms. Stage 3 involved a 12 ps simulation under NVT conditions at 10 K with restraints on heavy atoms. Stages 4, 6 and 7 (the pocket solvation at stage 5 was omitted) employed short simulation steps (12, 12 and 24 ps, respectively) under NPT conditions (at 10 K and restraints on heavy atoms for stages 4 and 6). No restraints were placed on heavy atoms at stage 7. The final production stage at constant temperature (300 K) was carried out at stage 8, for 50 ns.Binding free energy (ΔG bind ) calculations were carried out using the molecular mechanics/generalised Born solvent area (MM/GBSA) method [42] [43] [44] implemented in Amber 18 in order to gain more insight into the binding of the ligands to M pro . Briefly, the free energy of binding of Lig13b, α-KI, Pentagastrin and Isavuconazonium to M pro were calculated by averaging 2000 snapshots of the simulated complexes (from 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation). ΔG bind of ligands at the M pro active site was calculated using (1)where ΔG RL , ΔG R , and ΔG L represent the free energies of complex, receptor, and the ligand, respectively. The free energy (G) of each state was calculated using the following equations:The FF14SB force field terms were used to estimate the gas phase energy (E gas ), which is the sum of the internal energy (E int ); Coulomb energy (E ele ) and the van der Waals energies (E vdW ). The energy contribution from the polar states (G GB ) and non-polar states (G SA ) were employed to evaluate the solvation free energy (ΔG sol ). The solvent accessible surface area (SASA in Å 2 ) was also used to derive the non-polar solvation energy (G SA ) using a water probe radius of 1.4 Å, while the contribution from polar solvation (G GB ) was determined by solving the Generalised Born equation, where the total entropy of the solute and temperature is represented by S and T, respectively. To obtain the contribution of each residue to the total binding free energy profile between the peptidomimetics and M pro , per-residue free energy decomposition was carried out at the atomic level for imperative residues using the MM/GBSA method in Amber 18.In order to further study the effect of ligand binding on dynamics of the Cα atoms, we The rationale behind performing molecular docking is to make a systematic prediction of the ideal pose or conformation of a ligand in a protein's binding site, which could be taken Table S1 and Fig. S1 ). The Table 1 .We will focus mainly on the four peptidomimetics (indicated in Table 1 ) that were subsequently submitted for MD simulation studies. Fig. S4 shows the perresidue energy decomposition plots of the four ligands. Isavuconazonium appears to have more amino acid residues contributing towards its stability within the active site when compared to the other three ligands.Each of the complexes between M pro and the four peptidomimetic ligands, as well as the non- (Table S2) showed that the overall total energy, potential energy, temperature and volume were stable throughout the 50 ns simulation period (average slope ± 0.002-unit/ps). All the M pro -ligand complexes showed comparable Cα RMSD in comparison with the non-liganded system (Fig. 3A) . Overall, the system reached equilibrium around 10 ns with an average Cα RMSD of 1.66 Å (± 0.14 Å) after an initial rapid increase from 0 to 2.5 ns (Fig. S5) . The system converged and remained stable beyond 10 ns. This is further affirmed by the representative 3D structures of the complexes superimposed on the apo-M pro (Fig. 3B) . The shown the inhibitor (an α-ketoamide inhibitor derivative) to be effective against the virus.Using 6Y2G as a template, we aimed to generate theoretical extrapolations on plausible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro capable of being introduced as experimental drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. We have utilised accessible databases, including PubChem and DrugBank, to search for analogs of 11 antiretrovirals and ketoamide inhibitors that can serve as (i) a template for rational drug design and (ii) FDA-approved drugs that can be introduced immediately to treat the disease and (iii) a proof of a concept of using any known drug to treat this viral pandemic. Molecular modelling has, in the past, proved to be a viable option in accelerating drug discovery and complements experimental studies in drug discovery [47] [48] [49] .Our hypothesis is linked to the fact that a crystal structure of a protein provides a wealth of opportunity for a computational approach to drug design [50, 51] . In addition, a druggable target must also be critical for the biochemistry of the target pathogen-in this case, the SARS-CoV-2. We did not initially intend to specifically select protease and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We used prior conception on the fact that studies [52] seem have suggested that antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) may be capable of treating SARS-CoV-2 virus, itself being a retrovirus. Hence, we used 11 classes of PIs and NNRTI as search templates to identify candidate analogs in the molecules databases including Drug Bank and PubChem.To cast our net as wide as possible in searching for this best-fit molecule, we extracted over 5000 molecules, generated over 33000 conformers (isomers) and critically assed more that15 initial hits using induced-fit ligand docking. We tested the stability of the top-scoring (using Lig13b as the benchmark) molecules with a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation. We used the Glide Emodel parameter implemented in Maestro v12 to score and rank our ligands. Our HTVS protocol in the Maestro modelling algorithm is designed to rationalise and filter the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f number of ligands that were carried over to the second step, which is IFD followed by free binding energy calculation using MM/GBSA and MD simulation. We did not applyLipinski's Rule of Five [53] penalties because most of these molecules are peptidomimetics, which are often larger than 500 g/mol and may not pass the absorption parameter of this rule due to their molecular weights [54] . However, we excluded molecules with reactive functional groups and ensured that the molecules conformed with the physiological conditions in terms of the pKa at pH ~7.2. This is because ligands with reactive functional groups may form covalent bonds with M pro , therefore resulting in a false positive interaction [55] [56] [57] . The Although the coordinates of 6Y2G indicate that M pro is a homodimer with two active sites per subunit; for this study, we used a single subunit because we observed that it is only Ser 1 in subunit A that is within possible non-bonding interaction distance (3.9-4.1 Å) with the ligand in subunit B (and vice versa). There was no initial indication that Ser 1 makes any interaction with the active site, which largely depends on the nature of the ligand. From the architecture of the M pro active site, one is tempted to predict that several water molecules will be involved in binding of any ligand at this site. The structure of 6Y2G illustrates that two water molecules form either direct or indirect interactions with the Lig13b.Our IFD studies showed that some of the known antiretrovirals and their analogs may interact with M pro based on docking scores and Emodel energies. However, Remdesivir, which is proposed as a potential COVID-19 drug, had binding energy values more than -75.9kcal/mol, which is higher when compared with Pentagastrin, P2-P3 ketoamide derivative (α-KI), and Isavuconazonium. These drugs are FDA-approved and may be optional protease [21] . The presence of catalytic histidine residues in proteases is well-documented [58] [59] [60] [61] .One remarkable feature of the IFD algorithm is the ability to predict a realistic interaction that is comparable with experimental models [62] [63] [64] . A comparison of the modelled interaction between M pro and Lig13b with the experimental interaction with the experimental interaction (6Y2G) shows that the RMSD between the experimental pose and the theoretical pose is 0.27 Å. Therefore, we have strong reasons to accept the results generated in this study as ""close to reality"" as possible and allow rational inferences to be made from this study. All the top-scoring ligands bind within 4 Å of the catalytic Cys 145, which could be a target for covalent inhibition [65, 66] of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro .A large amount of useable and inferable information can be obtained from a MD simulation study. MD simulation gives us first-hand information on the stability of the ligand within the ligand-binding site and how the binding of these ligands impact on the conformational dynamics of the receptor, especially when compared with apo-M pro (unliganded M pro ). In order to validate our study, we used the Desmond molecular dynamics engine to generate trajectories of M pro in a complex with Lig13b, Pentagastrin, α-KI, and Isavuconazonium.Although it is advisable to test all the ligands listed in Table 1 contact with the catalytic His 41 and Cys 145 residues. Therefore, our top candidate drugs may be a competitive inhibitor of M pro . Our results further affirm that the binding of the ligand affects the dynamics between these two residues and each ligand exerted a specific landscape of dynamics between these two residues. Cys 145 and His 41 may both be involved in the binding and stabilisation of the ligands within the M pro catalytic site [21] because these two catalytic residues are within 4 Å of the ligands in the binding pocket. This substantial piece of information may be a molecular insight into the mode of inhibition of this enzyme.In conclusion, we have used a computational approach which includes HTVS, IFD, MM/GBSA free binding energy calculations and MD simulation to study potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We also used PCA to deconvolute the dynamics between the Cα atoms as a function of ligand binding. Zhang et al.

Due to its presentations, it has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020a ). An alarming response has been introduced across the globe due to its high infectiousness and case fatality rate (Zhong et al., 2020) . The identification of the risks and the prevention of infectivity regarding have been stated to depend on human perception (Zhong et al., 2020) . Especially in the submergence of an infectious disease such as COVID-19, different thoughts have shaped individuals' views on the illness.Currently, the Coronavirus disease has spread to 213 countries with nearly 24 million confirmed cases and close to 820,000 recorded deaths (WHO, 2020b (WHO, , 2020c . Publicly available reports from the Africa Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) states that confirmed cases of COVID-19 had risen to 1,203,769 and 28,289 deaths as of 25 August 2020 (ACDC, 2020). As of 25th August 2020, the West African subregion accounted for a significant proportion of cumulative COVID-19 records in Africa. In Nigeria, there are 52,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a total of 1,007 deaths as of 25 August 2020 (NCDC, 2020a; WHO, 2020b) . Oyo State presently holds the third spot on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) daily COVID-19 updates, with 3058 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 37 deaths (NCDC, 2020b) . Urban areas in Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo State frequently present with confirmed cases (Enwongo, 2020) .As a part of the emergency response activities across all States in Nigeria, health education campaigns have been directed at members of the public (NCDC, 2020a (NCDC, , 2020b . These campaigns have been aimed at knowledge improvement and the correction of certain misconceptions that have been widely circulated among community members (NCDC, 2020a) . Education on precautionary measures such as wearing of face masks, regular handwashing with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and social distancing have been done (NCDC, 2020a (NCDC, , 2020b Gbadamosi, 2020) .It is evident that perception shapes one's knowledge and the adoption of safety measures concerning the transmission of an infection. Data obtained from the perception of community members regarding COVID-19 could help target interventions needed to improve the knowledge of community members regarding Coronavirus. Superstitious beliefs have largely shaped the perception of most Nigerians regarding the source and cause of COVID-19 (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020) . At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria, infected persons belonged to either the political class or high socioeconomic cadre (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020) . The characteristic prevalence of COVID-19 infection among this group of persons accorded COVID-19 the name, 'a disease of the rich and mighty' (Nwaubani, 2020) . Few months into the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria, perceptions revolved around ""immunity"" to COVID-19 among the religious folks with a disregard of bans on religious gatherings (Lichtenstein, Ajayi & Egbunike, 2020) . Such perceptions could have been influenced by several factors. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter have been used to spread false news on COVID-19, resulting to panic disorder and anxiety among some persons and shunning of safety measures among others (Aluh & Onu, 2020; Olapegba et al., 2020) . Among many persons, physical distancing, social isolations, restriction of religious and social gatherings etc. have been opined as alien solutions in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and Africa at large .Literatures have reported the existence of knowledge relating to COVID-19 among Nigerians, and it is expected that this would influence precautionary behavior among them. However, inherent wrong perceptions may contribute to COVID-19 risk aversion measures . Perceptions of COVID-19 has been influenced by age and gender. Due to their increased vulnerability to illnesses, older persons have been predicted to increasingly adopt COVID-19 precautionary behavior compared to other population groups . Females have been identified as models in the adoption of precautionary health behavior. In the COVID-19 context, the practice of handwashing, hygiene, and use of face masks occur more frequently among females than males . Such an occurrence could be due to the perceived susceptibility to illnesses among females as well as their health-conscious nature.Given the importance of risk perception in behavior modification for disease control, it becomes pertinent to assess the perception and practices regarding COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, the perception and practices of community members in urban areas in Ibadan regarding COVID-19 is currently unknown. An assessment of the perception and practices of community members is important to reduce the risk for COVID-19 infection in Ibadan, a densely populated city in Nigeria. We hypothesized that there is no difference in the sociodemographic characteristics of the community members with the practices of COVID-19 mitigating factors. This study thus aimed at assessing the perception and practices of community members in urban areas in Ibadan regarding COVID-19.A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data collection took place from the 3rd to 6th June, 2020. The study was carried out in Ibadan, Oyo State Nigeria. Ibadan is the capital city of Oyo State. Oyo State is one of the states in the south western part of Nigeria. Between 15 June and 10 August, 2020, confirmed COVID-19 cases had risen from 764 to 2,887 in Oyo State, and the State ranks next to Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory on the NCDC reports for COVID-19 (NCDC, 2020b; Enwongo, 2020) . The official language in Nigeria is English, while the major informal language for communication in Ibadan is Yoruba, which has different dialects.The study population for the survey was one eligible member of the households in the selected urban communities in Ibadan, Oyo State. All consenting household members were included in the study. Household members that were less than 18 years were excluded. Verbal consent was obtained from participants.The sample size was calculated using sample size formula for descriptive cross-sectional study. The population of the selected LGA is >100,000. The sample size was calculated using the Leslie Kish formula for sample size determination for a single proportion as follows: n = Za 2 p(1 − p)/d 2 where: n = Minimum desired sample size Z = the standard normal deviate, usually set as 1.96 which corresponds to 5% level of significance. P = 50% was be used d = Degree of accuracy (precision) set at 5% (0.05) n = 1.96 2 × 0.5 × (1 − 0.5)/0.05 2 = 384 A sample of 360 (93.8%) were studied in the urban communities of Ibadan. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study Stage 1: Simple random sampling was used to select 3 out of the 6 urban local government area in Ibadan.Stage 2:In each of the selected LGA, a political ward was chosen for the study. Stage 3: A center location was chosen in the selected ward. A bottle was rotated to determine the direction of movement of the interviewers. From the direction of the bottle tip all consenting eligible adults from the households were included in the study until 120 persons were interviewed in each LGA.Sampling of 120 each in the three urban LGA gives a total sample size of 360.The questionnaire has two sections. Section A: sociodemographic characteristics The sociodemographic characteristics include age of respondents, sex, highest level of education, ethnicity and occupation.Section B: perception and practices regarding COVID-19. Close-ended questions were asked on perception of the respondents on COVID-19, their current practices, and what they would do if they were infected. Open-ended questions were asked on the effects of COVID-19 on and suggestions to the government to curb the pandemic.A six-point question was asked on the practice of handwashing. The respondents were asked to demonstrate how they usually practice handwashing. The interviewer correctly marked all the points demonstrated by respondents.The questionnaire was adapted from a tool used for a similar perception study on Ebola Virus Disease in 2014 (Gidado et al., 2015) . The tool was validated by an infectious disease epidemiologist. Pre-testing of the tool was done by administering 10 questionnaires in another Local Government Area not selected for the study. A few ambiguous questions were modified. Back-to-back translation of the questionnaire was done by experts who had sound understanding of the Yoruba language. The questionnaire was administered to most of the respondents in Yoruba Language. Data collection was done by trained research assistants with a minimum of first degree.Independent variables included: Sociodemographic characteristics like age, sex, level of education, and occupation.Outcome/dependent variables were the practice of handwashing and the use of other mitigating measures.Data were analyzed with SPSS version 23. Age was summarized using mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages were used for categorical variables. A total score of 6 was assigned to good practice of handwashing after the respondents were asked to demonstrate hand washing. One point each was assigned for the following: palm, back of the hand, spaces between the fingers, fingernails, wrist and thumbs. Only those who demonstrated the six points were categorized to have had a good practice of handwashing. Chi-square test was used for the assessment of associations between sociodemographic characteristics and practice of handwashing. Pearson correlation was conducted between the perception of the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and practices to prevent COVID-19. Multivariate analysis of the determinants of good handwashing practices was conducted using Logistic regression. P-values < 0.05 were accepted as significant.Ethical approval to carry out the study was obtained from the Oyo State Ministry of Health Ethical Review Committee, with reference number AD/13/479/1779 A . Permission for the study was sought from the respondents and the confidentiality of information was ensured. The respondents were informed of their right to decline or withdraw from the study at any time without any adverse consequences. No harm was inflicted on participants because of participation in this study.A total of 360 respondents were interviewed among urban residents in Ibadan. The mean age was 33.2 ± 10.6 years and 225 (62.5%) were females. Those with secondary education and above were 332 (92.2%), 314 (87.2%) were of the Yoruba ethnic group, and 171 (47.5%) engaged in business or trading (Table 1) . Among the 360 respondents 342 (95%) have heard of COVID-19.Most frequently reported practices among respondents following the development of COVID-19 symptoms were: Going to the hospital 171 (50%) and calling the COVID-19 help number 105 (30.7%). The other reported practices included: praying and staying at home each with 29 (8.5%) respondents as shown in Fig. 1 .Regarding COVID-19 risk perception, 89 (26%) knew they could contract COVID-19, while 41 (12%) perceived it as an exaggerated event. It was also perceived as an intention for corruption by 23 (6.7%), COVID-19 was an attack by the Western World was reported by 68 (19.9%) and 122 (35.7%) called COVID-19 a source of panic. The effects most frequently reported by respondents were hunger/low income among 167 (48.8%) and academic delay among 30 (8.8%). Regarding suggestions to the government, 108 (31.6%) suggested the provision of medical supplies/palliatives/seeking of cure, while 68 (19.9%) suggested free testing/free treatment. Other effects of COVID-19 and suggestions to the government are as shown in Table 2 .The most frequently reported practice for prevention of COVID-19 among respondents were the use of face masks by 224 (65.5%) and social distancing by 164 (48%). Others included: staying at home/following COVID-19 updates 8 (2.2%), taking Vitamin C/fruits/ warm water 4 (1.1%), and doing nothing 5 (1.4%) as shown in Fig. 2 . Figure 3 shows that only 80 (22%) of respondents demonstrated good handwashing practices. Among respondents aged less than 25 years, 16 (23.5%) had good handwashing practices compared to 14 (29.8%) aged above 45 years. Among females, 49 (22.8%) had good handwashing practices compared to 22 (17.3%) males although these differences are not statistically significant (Table 3) . Males have 27.5% less odds of having good hand washing practice compared to females, though not statistically significant (AOR 0.725, 95% CI [0.418-1.259], p = 0.253) ( Table 4 ).The perception of the likelihood to contract COVID-19 and practices to prevent COVID-19 had a weak positive correlation of 0.239 (p < 0.001).This study found that many individuals lived in denial of the existence of COVID-19. The perception of the illness as an avenue for politicians to enrich themselves indicates that there still exists inadequate knowledge of COVID-19 among community members in Ibadan. Denial, ignorance regarding COVID-19, and the existing lack of trust in the Nigerian government have been reported since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020) . From the present study, a high rating of the perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was observed among 26% of respondents, while it was minimally perceived as an attack by the Western World among nearly 20%.Findings obtained from this study revealed that the practices most often adopted following the development of COVID-19 symptoms were either to go to the hospital or call the COVID-19 help number. This indicates that the source of help for COVID-19 symptoms (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020 ). An Indian study similarly reported that hospital visitation was frequently opted for as a step to be taken following the development of COVID-19 in individuals in a close relationship (Dkhar et al., 2020) . We found that the use of face masks and practice of social distancing measures were more frequently embraced among respondents compared to other COVID-19 mitigation measures, although full adherence was low. A web-based study conducted in Nigeria mostly stated mouth-covering while sneezing, wearing of face masks and avoidance of crowded spaces as self-reported practices among respondents . Our findings revealed that myriads of perceptions were associated with COVID-19. These included COVID-19 as an exaggerated illness with intentions for corruption, its highly infectious and deadly nature, and a reason for panic disorders. Similarly, the likelihood of positive practices concerning COVID-19 was associated with a positive perception of the risk of infection (Zhong et al., 2020) . Findings from previous studies conducted in Nigeria also corroborate the key role of positive risk perception on imbibing COVID-19 protective practices and attitudes . The finding from the present study however contradicts the assumption of the Health Belief Model (HBM) that protective actions are more likely to succeed a high level of perceived susceptibility (Tarkang & Zotor, 2015) . The results obtained herein is higher than the knowledge concerning the practice of face masks in Saudi Arabia (Al-Hanawi et al., 2020) . Due to its deadly nature, COVID-19 has introduced fear which has compelled protective actions from individuals regarding the illness (Zhong et al., 2020) .Previous studies have shown that fear could motivate healthy behavior among individuals especially during epidemics, but such behavior may not be sustainable (Witte, 1998; Nabi, 1999; Ufuwa et al., 2020) . The adoption of these healthy behaviors in the present study is in tandem with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) on safety measures for COVID-19 (WHO, 2020c) . The insufficiency of fear as a propellant for adherence to recommended guidelines for COVID-19 has been reported to be an outplay of knowledge-attitude discrepancy . These findings imply that individual perception of infectious illnesses such as COVID-19 may not be sufficient to influence the adoption of protective practices. This explains the need for the regular sensitization of community members on COVID-19 safety measures regardless of their perception concerning the illness.We found that the practice of handwashing was commoner among individuals with a greater risk perception for COVID-19. Because these individuals perceive themselves as vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, they are more likely to engage in handwashing practice. Handwashing practice has been identified as one of the mitigation strategies for breaking the chain of COVID-19 transmission. An online-based Nigerian survey revealed a higher practice of handwashing compared to other COVID-19 preventive measures . A study conducted in Ibadan on hand hygiene practices post the Ebola virus disease outbreak revealed a high proportion of inadequate self-reported hand hygiene practice (Martins & Osiyemi, 2017) . Lassa fever studies conducted in Edo State reported inadequate handwashing practices, while a similar study in Kaduna State, Nigeria reported good handwashing practices among respondents (Tobin et al., 2013) . The similarities of most of these findings with ours imply the wide acceptance of the practice of handwashing in the management of infectious diseases. Findings from this study revealed a higher likelihood of good handwashing practices among females than males, although it was not significant. Our finding contradicts cultural notions which suggests that hygiene measures are more frequently practiced among females than males. However, a few other studies have reported no difference in the practice of hand hygiene among males and females in Nigeria (Ogunsola et al., 2013; Martins & Osiyemi, 2017) . The agreement of our findings with reference literatures could be due to the alienation of regular and proper handwashing practices in the Nigerian context. This could therefore have contributed to the observed level of handwashing practices among males and females as found in this study. The availability of water and sanitation access have been identified as major determinants of good handwashing practices (Ogunsola et al., 2013) . However, these basic amenities are not readily available in many Nigerian homes (Uchejeso & Obiora, 2020) . This therefore prompts overcrowding of persons at wells and boreholes, a condition which necessitates the use of water in We found that COVID-19 poses significant threat to local economy, resulting in low income and resultant hunger. This is likely due to the increased cost of purchasing goods or a result of the lockdown which has denied many individuals the opportunity to earn their income. Denial of opportunities to engage in money-making ventures was experienced and impacts such as hunger was greatly felt among many persons (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020) . This explains the need for the provision of palliatives to fight hunger and reduce susceptibility to other infections during the COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, decreased productivity and job losses and an unprecedented economic disaster have been reported (Atalan, 2020) . Contrary to the finding in this study, other studies have reported stress and anxiety as psychological reactions due to the Coronavirus pandemic (Atalan, 2020) . Other psychological reactions such as boredom, anger, and loneliness have been notably identified as resultant threats during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aluh & Onu, 2020) . This calls for the provision of psychosocial support for individuals during the COVID-19 lockdown. Interestingly, a recognition of the significance of essential staff has also resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak (Spowart, 2020) .Pertaining to suggestions to the government concerning COVID-19 containment, the provision of medical supplies and palliatives received highest recommendation among respondents. Most Nigerian households depend on daily earnings of breadwinners, and difficulty in survival was experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown which lasted for three months in Nigeria (Chukwuorji & Iorfa, 2020) . Also, health education, the enforcement of preventive measures, and free testing and treatment received much recognition. These imply two things. Firstly, health education campaigns concerning COVID-19 should be conducted by public health officials in simple, unambiguous languages which will facilitate the understanding of community members. Secondly, the availability of medical supplies and palliatives would enhance the adherence to safety measures for COVID-19, such as the use of face masks among community members. Similar suggestions have been made in previous studies (Kebede et al., 2020) .Up to date, most studies on perception and practices regarding COVID-19 have used electronic sources for data collection, and such results may have been biased. Our study is a community-based physical study that used a semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to study the perception and practices of adult population in urban communities in Nigeria. The study also made use of an adequate sample size (360 adults).As this study was limited to the perception and practices regarding COVID-19, the knowledge of community members on the illness was not addressed. The assessment of factors influencing COVID-19 practices among community members was obscure in this study.The adoption of preventive measures is critical to forestall onward transmission of COVID-19. However, adequate, and correct risk perception for COVID-19 is required to enable the adoption of COVID-19 safety measures. We hereby recommend enhanced sensitization and health education sessions for all community members about COVID-19 in Ibadan metropolis regardless of their sociodemographic characteristics. Also, health campaigns should be more focused on practices such as regular handwashing with soap and water and social distancing, which protect against transmission of COVID-19 among community members irrespective of their sex. In addition, access of individuals to portable source of water supply should be enabled by increased provision of water sources in residential apartments. The government should also install more infrastructures for water supply where dearth of water exists.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-23",9

Globally more than twenty million peoples were affected by this infection and 744,385were died as of August 13, 2020. 1 In Ethiopia the first case was detected on March 13, 2020. 2 The total number of cases and deaths as of August 14, 2020 were 26, 204 and 479 respectively. 3 Ethiopia is one of the developing Sub-Saharan African countries facing double burdens from infectious and non-infectious diseases. 4 On top of this, the current pandemic of COVID-19 brings additional frustration to the country.To tackle the pandemic, the government of Ethiopia has been taking several measures prior to the first case detection and still modifying them accordingly. These include preparing health institutions that will fully serve the patients of COVID-19, organizing the teams that will facilitate the control and prevention of the disease in different levels, declaring the state of emergency, preparing isolation and quarantine centers, awareness creation in different methods and resource mobilization from different bodies to support vulnerable groups and others. Generally, unless mandatory it is not recommended for peoples to be out of home currently; hoping this will reduce the interpersonal virus transmission of COVID-19. [5] [6] [7] Although different measures have been taken, the number of cases is increasing and it is feared that the number might be increased exponentially in the coming few months. 8 This signals the stay of the aforementioned measures to be relatively long and the emergence of the other additional strong measures.Difficult situations bring not only challenges but also fruitful opportunities. The pandemic of COVID-19 by itself and the related governmental or individual level measures have their own challenges and opportunities to the community, which even might be directly or indirectly related to the control and prevention of the disease of interest.The silver linings of the pandemic of COVID-19 should be uncovered to enable the community not only to focus on the black side of the disease but also to enjoy the opportunities. This can contribute to facilitate the control of the disease and avoid the related panics. In this review, we have discussed the challenges of COVID-19 in Ethiopia in terms of health, economy, and social life; and the silver linings in terms of research opportunities, technological transformation, reading culture, and family discussion.We performed searches of published and unpublished articles, reports, and working papers from Google Scholar, PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and official websites of national and international organizations. The terms we have used to search include ""Challenges"" AND ""coronavirus disease/COVID-19"", ""Effect"" AND ""coronavirus disease/COVID-19"", ""Impact"" AND ""coronavirus disease/COVID-19"", ""Opportunities"" AND ""coronavirus disease/COVID-19"" and ""Silver linings"" AND ""coronavirus disease/COVID-19"". In addition, the following search terms were used to retrieve the other remaining studies. These included ""coronavirus disease"", ""novel coronavirus"" ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"" and ""coronavirus"". Articles that evaluated the positive and/or negative effect of COVID-19 on global population or systems were included in the review. Considering this as inclusion criteria, both authors evaluated the title and abstract of the articles independently to exclude ineligible papers before the final review of the eligible studies. Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Ethiopian public health institute websites were accessed to obtain the recent epidemiological profile of the COVID-19.It is obvious that COVID-19 brings an extra strain to the health system of the countries. 9 This becomes more complicated for countries like Ethiopia whose health system not provide basic and regular health services adequately for their citizens in normal situations. In these countries it is estimated that additional morbidity and mortality may occur among vulnerable groups like mothers and children. 10 The health professional to population ratio is 0.96 per 1000 populations 11 which is much lower than the WHO recommended standards, (4.45 per 1000 populations) to meet the sustainable development goal health targets. 12 This indicates that the health need of the country is not being addressed adequately and the addition of unplanned COVID-19 related needs worsen the problem.Another bad scenario is that the health professionals, who are considered to be the pillars of the health systems, are among the high-risk groups to COVID-19 13 and if the significant number of them are going to be infected by coronavirus the health system may collapse.The quality and quantity of nonhuman resources is also limited in Ethiopia. The health facilities are very few in number and they are not well equipped. Currently it was reported that Ethiopia had only 557 mechanical ventilators and 570 intensive care unit (ICU) beds for a population of 110 million. 14, 15 COVID-19 affects not only the health system but also the health of the people. Even individuals who are not infected by coronavirus can have indirect effect of the pandemic. Peoples staying at home are prohibited from going to religious places and recreational areas. Being with the 24 hours COVID-19 related fake and real news, these limitations of movements might result in different mental problems like anxiety, depression, and suicide. 16, 17 Physical inactivity can also predispose them to health risks like cardiovascular diseases, and even to an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 if there is the exposure probability. [18] [19] [20] Moreover, patients with the other health problems might not be the priority clients during this crisis time and the patients themselves may not seek medical care by fearing the risk of acquiring COVID-19 from transportation and/or from health facilities. [21] [22] [23] These all may lead to an increased morbidity and mortality from easily preventable or manageable health conditions. Quarantine, which is one of the control measures for COVID-19, is associated with different problems. Mental problems like stress, anxiety and depression which in turn leading to unhealthy diet are the common problems among quarantined peoples. Physical inactivity, which was reported as more common among women, is also one of the problems of quarantine. These aforementioned problems are likely to predispose the quarantined peoples to cardiovascular diseases. 24 Inadequacy of nutrition is one of the known health problems in Ethiopia and this is going to be exacerbated by COVID-19. There is a bidirectional relationship between nutritional problems and COVID-19. The nutritional inadequacy can predispose to decreased immunity against coronavirus infection and increased susceptibility. In another scenario the COVID-19 decreases availability and accessibility of food through income loss, lack of transportation access, and other COVID-19 related measures. 7, 25, 26 One of the effective measures to prevent COVID-19 transmission is regular hand washing. 27 But in Ethiopia 43% of the rural population has no access to an improved source of clean water which makes regular hand washing practice an ideal. 25 Economy-Related Challenges COVID-19 impacts the economy of a globe as a whole, countries, and individuals in several ways. The closure of the border is disrupting the global chain supply, tourism investment is decreasing, cost spent for health is increasing and the irrational increment of goods' price in the local market is leading to inflation. 28, 29 In Ethiopia, peoples in lower economic classes like daily laborers are waiting for the aid from the donors to get their daily bread, since the temporary contractual agreement between them and their employer organizations is canceled either partially or completely due to the COVID-19; leading to an additional strain of unemployment to the country. Females are more vulnerable to this problem since they are the majority of the employees in the informal economy. 17, [30] [31] [32] Lack of transportation access with other COVID-19 related measures is leading to income and wealth losses in countries. 33 In Ethiopia the public and private transport service provider vehicles are forced to decrease the number of travelers by half from their regular loading capacity and travelers have to pay doubled cost for each trip. This also decreases the access of the people to routine economic activities. 31 Peoples staying at home are consuming what they saved in normal conditions and they are not replacing it. This is also the main challenge for the future economy of the country. In addition, unhealthy people, due to the direct or indirect effect of COVID-19 will not be engaged in income-generating activities. 34, 35 Social Life-Related Challenges Strong social life is one of the main distinguishing features of an Ethiopian society. 36 But this is highly challenged by ""social distancing"", one of the measures to reduce the person to person transmission of coronavirus. 27 Social institutions and events like edir, ekub, mahiber, mourning, wedding, worshiping and others are being practiced in groups in Ethiopia and the disruption of such practices may lead to the social crisis in the future. 37, 38 Lack of participation in the aforementioned social activities can result in mental health problems like depression and anxiety. 39 The contagious nature of the disease prevents people from visiting patients and this can also impact social life negatively. Peoples who lost their families especially when there is a significant number of deaths may be exposed to grief and the problem can be highly complicated when they could not participate in the burial processes due to the infection prevention-oriented burial protocol of COVID-19 related deaths. 40, 41 Another risk that may result in the crisis of the society is political instability aggravated by COVID-19. In this year (2020), there was the country wide election in Ethiopia and it was postponed to unspecified time due to COVID-19. This is becoming the cause of the disagreement among the different political parties in the country and putting another challenge in the prevention and control of COVID-19. 14, 42, 43 Discrimination and stigma against the infected peoples are the hallmarks of the most contagious diseases. Patients with COVID-19 are not spared from this problem and similar situations can be occurred in Ethiopia. 44 As recommended by the WHO, people who have COVID-19 have not done anything wrong, and the population in any part of the world should support them. In addition, when referring to people with COVID-19, it should not be attached to any particular ethnicity or nationality. 45 One of the feared social crisis that may be transformed from health crisis is that, students stayed at home may setback and become food unsecured particularly those who were benefited from school lunch programs from public schools as in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. 46COVID-19 is not only the problem to our globe but also it has its own silver linings. 47 Hereunder we have discussed some of the opportunities related to COVID-19 in the Ethiopian context.Currently in almost all of the scientific journals, COVID-19 related scientific investigations ranging from the trial of effective therapeutics and vaccines to short and long term impacts of COVID-19 on the different sectors are the priority issues. On the front page of the different journals' home page there is an invitation to submit papers on COVID-19 and this itself can encourage the scientists to do more researches. 48 One of the duties of Ethiopian higher education institutions (universities) is conducting valuable and problem solving scientific research. In this crisis time the government of Ethiopia is encouraging the scientific community in these institutions to conduct different researches. The ministry of science and higher education identified different priority areas with respective possible sources of funds and forwarded them to universities.For health sciences to be complete, digging the role of traditional medicine in preventing and treating different health problems is an essential practice. In Ethiopia, traditional medicine has been practiced for a long time with an unreserved contribution to public health. 49, 50 The era of COVID-19 may be the golden opportunity for the Ethiopian traditional medicine experts and the medications themselves if due attention is given to investigate the antiviral effects of these medications.The contagiousness of the coronavirus restricts the physical contact and due to this, different digital technologies are being utilized currently. Most of the technologies on use currently were utilized rarely in the previous time. Researchers are using a telephone calling method to collect the data, governmental and non-governmental officials are discussing using video conferences.Patients, particularly those who were on follow up for different health conditions are getting their services using phone calling in health facilities like Black Lion Specialized hospital, which is among the few tertiary hospitals in the country. This can be taken as a hopeful progression to telemedicine although its utilization was poor in Ethiopia. 51, 52 Telemedicine is important to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission which can occur in different stages during going to health institutions physically. In addition, it can help reduce the number of patients visiting health facilities which also might be increased by cases of COVID-19, and also it can reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19 for health professionals. 53 Currently, there is a nationwide school closure in Ethiopia and this brings an opportunity for the students to learn using different media like television, radio, social media, and others. These methods might be useful for families to follow their children closely. But the visible limitation is that very few numbers of students will have access to the above-mentioned media and this will widen the existing achievement gap between the students from the lower and higher socioeconomic statuses. 46 Peoples staying at home are currently being encouraged to read books. The majority of the literate segment of the population in the country are assumed to prefer to use social media than reading books, and the others did not get adequate time to read. 54 This is the golden time to fill the gap related to reading. Influential peoples in the country including the prime mister are encouraging peoples to read different educational, political, and social (spiritual) books. For instance, the book of the prime minister titled ""Medemer"" is now converted to audio and ready to be distributed freely to citizens since there is a shortage of hard copy publications.Most of the families in the world have no adequate family discussion sessions due to the shortage of time. 55, 56 COVID-19 makes the peoples stay at home and discuss with their family on different issues and this can increase the bond between family members. 57, 58 In another way staying at home enables them to know the behavior of their children and make an appropriate intervention. Ethiopian families are also expected to be benefited from these.Although the pandemic of COVID-19 has negative impacts on the health system, economy, and social life in Ethiopia, it has important silver linings regarding research opportunities, technological transformation, reading culture and family discussion time. The noticeable effects of the pandemic on the health of the peoples is significant and should be managed accordingly. Different measures being taken to control and prevent the pandemic have their own positive and negative influences on the health status of the people. Quarantined peoples are prone to mental and cardiovascular problems. However, other prevention methods like hand washing, wearing protective mask and good ventilation are expected to reduce the prevalence and incidence of the top commonest health problems like acute febrile illnesses, diarrheal diseases and respiratory diseases in low income countries including Ethiopia. Thus, as part of controlling and preventing COVID-19, the opportunities emerging with this global crisis should be recognized and enjoyed without neglecting the measures against COVID-19. This can reduce other health problems, which may occur due to COVID-19, and facilitate the control of the pandemic itself.There is no funding to report.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Ethiopia","abstract","2020-09-16",9

In Japan, a crisp two-peak incidence curve is clear(2). Similar trends are reported from other countries.The notion of epidemics that normally have two peaks of new cases over time is widely accepted(3); although epidemiologists have not characterized this pattern as an established model. In general, the resumption of international travel or the relaxation of the community control measures are are almost always blamed for the resurgence of the disease incidence.In this letter, this author suggests that a double-peaked epidemic curve is an intrinsic feature of viral outbreaks. According to this hypothesis, immune response to virus exposure in different individuals determines the spread pattern in the community.The two principal divisions of the immune response to pathogens are the innate and the adaptive immunity. Both divisions play a major role in the body response to viral exposure. Together with the development of clonal virus-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes, these individuals will experience subclinical or clinical viral illness and are responsible for the early rise in the epidemic curve.Assuming the above hypothesis is true; a viral epidemic curve will show an early upstroke corresponding to persons who pass into viremia upon initial exposure to the virus followed by a second slower rise due to cases who develop the disease after repeated process of inoculation and clearance at the point of entry. It is fairly reasonable to assume that the latter group of patients may be the healthier individuals who will have lower case-fatality rate. Together with the notion of the covid-19 cases getting milder with time, objective evidence from Japan indicates that the second peak in incidence is not accompanied with a corresponding peak in fatality.The implications of this hypothesis are medically and socially relevant. According to this theory, resurgence of a viral outbreak is intrinsically determined by the nature of the virus interaction with the host. Relaxation of the community measures or ""reopening"" of the economy may not be blamed for a second rise in incidence rates. The theory also provides one explanation for the possible observation of decreased case-fatality over time.In conclusion, the author describes an immunological explanation for a double-peaked epidemic curve of Covid-19 and other new viral diseases.","Egypt","first author","2020-09-02",9

They are often zoonotic and several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. 1 The novel corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has been evolving rapidly. On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-general declared that the current outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern, and on 12 March 2020 the COVID-19 the outbreak was declared a pandemic. 2 Worldwide, until July 24, 2020, over 15.5 million confirmed cases, about 9.5 million recovered, and more than 650,000 confirmed deaths were reported. 3 In Africa, over 750,000 were confirmed cases, nearly 450,000 recovered, and 6500 deaths were reported. The most affected countries are: South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria Ghana, Algeria, and Morocco, together, these countries account for 75% of the cases reported in the region. 4 Ethiopia reported a confirmed case of novel coronavirus for the first time on April 2, 2020. Until July 24, 2020, 11,939 confirmed cases, 5645 recoveries, and 197 deaths were reported. Currently, Ethiopia is under a state of emergency declared to fight the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 5 Moreover COVID-19 has negative mental and social consequences, for example, a broad body of research links social isolation and loneliness to poor mental health; and recent data shows that significantly higher share of people who were sheltering in place (47%) reported negative mental health effects resulting from worry or stress related to coronavirus than among those not sheltering in place (37%). Negative mental health effects due to social isolation may be particularly pronounced among older adults and households with adolescents, as these groups are already at risk for depression or suicidal ideation. 6 The widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 are associated with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. 7 A study conducted in China during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 found that 53.8% of rated psychological impact of the outbreak, 16.5% reported moderate to severe depression, 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress level. 8 A review of existing literature revealed that that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16 to 28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. 9 The continuous spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), strict isolation measures, and delays in starting school, colleges and universities across the country is expected to influence the mental health of university students. Despite its mental health impacts, no detailed study on the psychological impacts of university students facing the epidemic has been conducted. Therefore, this study aims to show the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak and its associated factors among university students in the Bench-Sheko zone. The finding of this will help as baseline data for policy makers and programmers to develop mental health programs for individuals during the outbreak.Study Setting, Design, and Period A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bench-Sheko zone of south-west Ethiopia, from May 15 to June 15, 2020. The administrative center of Bench Sheko is Mizan Aman Zone located 582 km from Addis Ababa. The zone has a total of two administrative towns and six woredas (third-level administrative districts). According to the zonal statistics office, the total population of the Bench-Sheko zone is 681,549. According to zonal youth and women affairs and zonal education bureau, the zone has a total of 1350 university students that attend their education in different Ethiopian universities.All university students who live in the Bench-Sheko zone.All university students who live in the Bench-Sheko zone who fully fill the inclusion criteria.All systematically selected university students who live in Bench-Sheko zone were included in the study. Students with severe mental illness and hearing difficulties were excluded.The sample size for both objectives was determined by using a single population proportion formula. Since there was no research done about psychological impact towards COVID-19 and its associated factors among university students in Africa including Ethiopia, we took 50% to determine the sample size. With 10% nonresponse rate, the sample size became 422.Since the total university students on average 1350 which is less than 10,000 we had to consider the correction formula, n final=n/1+n/N, then the final sample size became 322.Systematic random sampling technique was used to select all 322 samples. The list of all accessible university students with their phone number was collected from zonal education bureau and Bench-Sheko Zone Youth and Women Affairs. We calculated the skip interval, k=4. The first study subject was selected using lottery method. We selected the student every fourth interval starting from the student registered at third place. Since the government announced a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students were interviewed via phone calls.The dependent variables were psychological impacts (depression, anxiety, and stress), while the independent variables were sociodemographic variables (age, sex, residence, religion, and ethnicity, family income, and living with parents) and clinical factors (history of medical illness, relatives got COVID) and substance use were the independent variables.Depression: A score of 10 and above in DASS-D indicates the presence of depression. 10 Anxiety: A score of eight and above in DASS-A indicates the presence of anxiety. 10 Stress: A score of 15 and above in DASS-S indicates the presence of stress. 10 Social support: Oslothree-item social support scale, it is a three-item questionnaire, the sum score scale ranging from 3-14, which has three categories: poor support 3-8, moderate support 9-11 and strong support 12-14. 11 Substance use: use of chat, alcohol, cigarette smoking, or others at least once in the last three months.The data were collected using a structured intervieweradministered questionnaire through a phone call to assess sociodemographic, clinical factors, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on psychological impacts of COVID-19 were collected using depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS). DASS is cross-culturally validated tool to assess psychological impacts of pandemic disease. A number of items are 21 items and three subscales. Anxiety subscale (DASS-A), depression subscale (DASS-D), and stress subscale (DASS-S). There are seven depression items measuring cognitive and emotional aspects of depression, predominantly anhedonia; seven anxiety items focused on cognitive and emotional aspects of anxiety; and seven items assess stress.The data collectors and supervisors were nurses who work in Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital. There were three data collectors, a supervisor, and the overall activities were supervised by the principal investigator. Training was given to the data collectors and supervisors by the principal investigator on the objective of the study, maintenance of ethical standards, the methods of data collection, and data collectors were familiarized with data collection tools with respect to the study with practical exercises. A supervisor checked the completeness of the collected data daily.Data completeness was checked manually before being entered into EpiData 3.1 and necessary correction was made. The questionnaire was prepared in English and translated into local language, Amharic, and backtranslated to English to assess consistency. Training was given to the data collectors and supervisors on the objective of the study, maintenance of ethical standards, and methods of data collection. Data coding and cleaning was performed by cross-checking the printout data for possible errors. The missing values and outliers were checked before analysis by running a descriptive analysis.The data were entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS Version 24 for analysis. After data coding and cleaning were performed, descriptive statistics were presented in frequency, tables and graphs. Normality assumption was checked for continuous variables. The association between depression, anxiety, and stress with each covariate was assessed first with bivariate logistic regression to identify a candidate variable for multivariate logistic regression. Variables with a P-value <0.25 were taken into multiple logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress.Backward likelihood ratio with 0.1 probability of removal was used to develop the model. Goodness of fit of the final model was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness of fit considering good fit at P-value >0.05. Finally, independent predictors of depression, anxiety and stress were declared at P-value <0.05 cutoff point and strength of the association was assessed using AORs with their corresponding at 95% confidence level.The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Mizan-Tepi University and ethical clearance was obtained. In addition, support letters were written to Bench-Sheko zone. The objective and purpose of the study were verified briefly to the study participant and confidentiality was assured. Finally, oral consent was obtained from study participants before conducting the interview. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.A total of 322 university students who were living in the Bench-Sheko zone were interviewed with a response rate of 97.5%. The mean age of the respondents was 22.58±2.8SD years and about 199 (63.4%) of them were females. From the total participants, 210 (66.9%) of the respondents were urban and 137 (43.6%) were Bench in ethnicity. Concerning to their religion, about 133 (42.4%) were protestant (See Table 1 ).This study also revealed the clinical characteristics of the study participants. About 31 (9.9%) of the respondents had history of chronic illness. One-fourth of 80 (25.5%) used substance and about 110 (35%) of the respondent stay at their home for the prevention of COVID-19. Nearly one-quarter of 81 (25.8%) of the students had poor social support (see Table 2 ).The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.3% (95%CI: 16.6-25.8), and 27.1% (95%CI: 21.6-31.9), 32.5% (95%CI: 27.1-38.2), respectively (see Figure 1 ).From the total variable entered in the multivariable regression, four variables were found to be independently associated with depression among university students. Female students had 2.1 times (AOR: 2.11, 95%CI: 1.15-3.88), higher risk of developing depression compared to males. Students who stayed at home had 3.6 times (AOR: 3.60, DovePress risk of developing depression compared with those who had strong social support, respectively (See Table 3 ).From the total variable entered in the multivariable regression, three variables were found to be independently associated with anxiety among university students. Students who were not living with their parents had 3.3 times [AOR: 3.34, 95% CI: (1.87-5.97)], higher risk of developing anxiety as compared to those who live together with their parents. University students whose relatives got corona virus had 2.4 times [AOR: 2.40, 95% CI: (1.17-4.90)], higher risk of corona virus when compared with those who had not. Students whose family income below 2500 ETB was 2.8 times [AOR: 2.86, 95% CI: (1.60-5.14)], higher risk of developing anxiety when compared to those students whose family income greater than 2500 ETB (See Table 4 ).From the total variable entered in the multivariable regression four variables namely, substance use, depression, anxiety, and social support were found to be independently associated with stress among university students. Students who had depression had 2.3 times (AOR: 2.35, 95%CI: 1.08-5.13), higher risk of developing stress compared to those who had not. Students who used any substance were 3.4 times (AOR: 3.45, 95%CI: 1.9-6.28), at higher risk of developing stress compared to those who did not use any substance. University students who develop anxiety were 2.8 times (AOR: 2.79, 95%CI: 1.33-5.86), at higher risk of developing stress compared to those who did not have anxiety. Furthermore, students who had poor social support were 2.86 times (AOR: 2.86, 95%CI: 1.40-5.86), higher risk of developing stress compared to those who had strong social support (See Table 5 ).The COVID-19 pandemic was declared as a public health emergency of the world and this emergency causes stress to the whole population as well as university students. The present study assessed the psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress) and its associated factors among university students in the Bench-Sheko zone South-west, Ethiopia. This study revealed that the prevalence of depression was 21.3%, which is in line with a review of existing literature (16-28%), 9 but lower than studies conducted in Pakistan (45%), Spain (34.1%), 12, 13 and higher than Iran (15%) and India (13.97%). 14, 15 The present study also indicated that the prevalence of anxiety was 27.1%, this finding is supported with a study done in China (24.9%) and review of existing literature (16-28%), 9, 16 but higher than Iran (20%), India (12.63%) and Spain (21.3%), [13] [14] [15] and lower than a study done Jordan (69.5%), Pakistan (34%), France (60.2%), and Turkey (69.9%). 12, [17] [18] [19] Furthermore, this study also showed that the prevalence of stress was 32.5%. This result is supported with a study done in Spain (28.14%), 13 but higher than Indian (15.57%), 15 and lower than a study done in France (61.6%), and Jordan (69.5%). 17, 18 The possible reason for the discrepancy might be due to difference in strict quarantine, high incidence rate, effect of lockdown, difference in literacy level and study sittings difference.This study revealed sex is significantly associated with depression. Female university students had 2.1 times higher risk of developing depression compared to male students. This finding supported a study done in India. 9 This may be due to females being more commonly exposed to mental illness, cultural factors, economic deprivation or due to hormonal fluctuations. 20 Students who stay at home had 3.6 times higher risk of developed depression compared to those did not stay at home This is the fact isolation, social distancing, and extreme changes in daily life cause clinical depression because of COVID-19. 21 Students who had history of medical illness had 3.1 times higher risk of developing depression compared to those who did not. This is due to the fact that having previous history of medical illness may exacerbate the impacts COVID-19. This finding is supported with a systematic review of COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences. 22 This study also assessed factors affecting anxiety. Students who were not living with their parents had 3.3 times higher risk of developing anxiety compared to those who live together. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses. 16 This study showed that students whose family income less than 2500 ETB were 2.8 times higher risks of developing anxiety as compared to counterparts. Which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure. This is supported with a study done in China among college students. 16 Relatives being infected with COVID-19 were an independent risk factor in university students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia. 23 Moreover, this study also showed factors that increase stress of university students related to COVID-19. Students who had depression and anxiety had 2.3 and 2.8 higher risk of developing stress compared to those who had no depression and anxiety. This may be due to an exaggerated information dissemination about the health, social and economic crisis of COVID-19. The finding is in line with a systematic review of the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: systematic. 22 Students who had poor social support had 2.8 times higher risk of developing depression and stress compared to their counterparts. Lack of social support may add a pressure to economic, social, and health impacts. Evidence showed that loneliness and poor social support risks depression and stress. 24 Moreover, students who used substance had 3.4 times higher risk of developing stress compared to those who had not use substance. People who use substance are a marginalized and stigmatized group with weaker immunity responses, and vulnerability to stress. 25 This finding is supported with a study done in Dessie, Ethiopia, substance use was significantly associated with mental distress of students. 26According to this study the psychological (depression, anxiety and stress) among university students related to COVID-19 were high. Being female, staying at home, history of medical illness, poor and moderate social support were factors that increased the risks of depression. Factors increasing the risk of anxiety were not living with their parents, relatives got corona virus and low family income. Moreover substance use, depression, anxiety, and poor social support were among the factors that increase the risk of stress.Governmental and private organization and health-care providers also provide psychosocial and mental health services alongside health-care service and various media channels.

The novel virus was initially termed as 2019-nCoV which later changed to ""SARS-CoV-2"" by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) because of the higher resemblance of the virus with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 The continued coronavirus infection that was emerged in China has rapidly spread to each corner and led a declaration to be considered as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although there are many efforts for the provision of suitable therapeutic approaches, there are no vaccines or direct-acting antiviral delivers to those infected with the virus. 2 Right after the first reported case of death on the first week of January 2020 was confirmed as a result of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARSCoV-2]), the end of this month it was declared as an outbreak by WHO and subsequently named as coronavirus disease . Globally, as of 5 August 2020, there have been 18,318,928 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 695,043 deaths, reported to WHO. 3, 4 Findings revealed that the genome sequence identity of SARS CoV 2 and bat CoV is about 96.2%, and based on virus genome sequencing results and evolutionary analysis, bat has been blamed as natural host of the virus SARSCoV-2 to transmit from bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans. It was identified that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the same receptor as SARS-CoV to infect humans. 5, 6 Direct contact with intermediate host animals or consumption of wild animals was suspected to be the main route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the sources and mode of transmission is still open for further investigation. 6 Virus-host interactions affect viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) coronavirus. About two-thirds of viral RNA, mainly located in the first open reading frame (ORF 1a/b), encode 16 non-structure proteins (NSPs). The remaining part of the virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and also several accessory proteins. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to host cell receptors, ACE2 which is assumed to be a critical step for the entry of the virus. However, the possible molecules facilitated membrane invaginations for SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis are still unclear and other virus proteins may contribute to pathogenesis. 6To date, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is being a major concern of the scientific community to treat with potential medications. Becuase there is lack of effective and scientifically proven antiviral therapy against COVID-19, the current treatment approaches mainly focused on the symptomatic and respiratory support based up on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by Oxygen therapy is almost applied to all patients with the COVID-19 and WHO also recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. To certain critical case immunoglobulin G and convalescent plasma are used to save the life of the patients as per their condition. 3, 8 According to literature searched on web, few drugs other than vaccines are enumerated as unproven optional and adjuvant drugs for COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. These include antivirals (opinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir), chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and interferon, tocilizumab, corticosteroids, antibiotic therapy, NSAIDs/ Ibuprofen, and some others. 9 Previous studies reported that Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine possess a broad spectrum of antiviral effects on a variety of viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Marburg virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-1, etc. In addition, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can regulate immune system by affecting cell signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [10] [11] [12] [13] Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been shown by several studies to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and shorten the duration of viremia. Although the immunomodulatory effect of these drugs also plays a role in the treatment of COVID-19, there is still a huge need for further investigation. For coronaviruses, the potential therapeutic benefits of Chloroquine were notably reported for SARS-CoV-1. In vitro, Chloroquine can prevent SARS-CoV-1 from infecting the glycosylation of a virus cell surface receptor, ACE2. 7, 13 Remdesivir has been reported to treat the first US case of COVID-19 successfully. Results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against COVID-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection. Even though in vitro studies showed that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection, these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments. 14,15The pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have a linkage with the function of the nsps (nonstructural proteins) and structural proteins. NSP is able to block the host innate immune response. Among the structural elements of CoVs, there are the spike glycoproteins which have two subunits; one subunit, S1, binds to the receptors on the cell surface; the other subunit, S2, fuses with the cell membrane. For many CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation. 16, 17 The S1 subunit comprises the receptorbinding domain(s) and contributes to stabilization of the prefusion state of the membrane-anchored S2 subunit that contains the fusion machinery. For all CoVs, S is further cleaved by host proteases at the so-called S20 site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. 16, 18 This cleavage proposed to activate the protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational changes. 19 The entry of coronavirus into susceptible cells is something which is complicated and requires the great effort in understanding the action of receptor-binding and proteolytic processing of the S protein to promote virus-cell fusion. SARS-CoV and several SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) interact directly with ACE2 via S B to enter to the target. Studies showed that ACE2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, facilitating viral entry in the host. In human lungs, ACE2 is expressed in lower lungs on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the attachment of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface. The attachment of SARSCoV-2 to ACE2 modulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex, inducing fusion at the cell membrane. Once enter the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate it and spreads through the entire lung. 20 ACE2 could assist SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into cells, thereby establishing it as a functional receptor for this newly emerged coronavirus, COVID-19. The SARS-CoV2 S B engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with higher affinity than to SARS-CoV S B. 21, 22 Both ACE-1 and ACE-2 cleave angiotensin peptides in that ACE-1 cleaves angiotensin I and generating angiotensin (Ang) II, which causes vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, increases vascular permeability, inflammation, and fibrosis and enhance the development of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and lung failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The effect of ACE1 signaling is by the GPCRs; AT1 and AT2 receptors. ACE1-generated AT1 receptors function as the key mediator of Ang II actions and the opposing actions of ACE2-derived peptides. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase (zinc metalloprotease), which is responsible for Ang II degradation to Ang (1-7). 23 The conversion of Ang II to Ang (1-7) by the enzyme ACE2 produces effects that oppose the action of Ang II mediated by AT1. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects alveolar pneumocytes by binding to ACE2 (as in Figure 1 ), leading to a decrease in Ang II conversion to ACE2-derived peptides, for example, a reduction in Ang (1-7) and its actions that counteract effects of Ang II. Higher imbalance between the action of ACE1 and ACE2 aggravates pathology, making it more likely that the immune response will be overcome. Blunting the ACE-1-Ang II-AT1R enhances the action of ACE-1-Yehualashet and BelachewInfection and Drug Resistance 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comAng II-AT2R, the ACE-2-Ang (1-7)-AT2R or the ACE-2-Ang (1-7) which likely protects from ARDS triggered by infectious pathogens, including coronaviruses. 24, 25 ACE2 is expressed at apical plasma membranes of epithelial cells, including those of respiratory origin, the primary location of SARS-CoV infection. 26 During the infection of SARS-CoV, the cell surface expression of ACE2 down-regulated through internalization of the receptor-ligand complex or activation of TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding of soluble ACE2. After attachment of viral spike proteins with ACE2, the amount of cell surface-expressed ACE2 is reduced. ACE2 receptor downregulation provokes a worsening effect of lung failure. 27, 28 In addition to the alveolar cells in the lungs, ACE2 is expressed in other organs, including the kidney, the heart, and the gut. Whether robust ACE2 expression in these organs affects SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains illdefined. Acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiac damage, and abdominal pain are the most common co-morbidities of COVID-19. 20Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have a different mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. As depicted in Figure 1 ACEIs in clinical use do not directly affect ACE2 activity 23 and the intestinal messenger RNA level of ACE2 increased with ACEI but not observed with ARBs. SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates ACE2 expression that decreases protective effects of ACE2 on different organs. 29 ACEIs increased the entrance more than twice the entrance with ARBs. This cannot definitely conclude risks or benefits of these therapies with patients confounding variables like age, hypertension, and impact of yet-unidentified comorbidities on outcome with the COVID-19 pandemic. 30, 31 In the other way, ACEIs or ARBs could prevent COVID-19 viral entry by stabilizing ACE2-AT1R interaction and preventing viral protein ACE2 interaction and internalization. The interaction between viral protein and ACE2 decreased in the presence of stabilized ACE2-AT1R complexes. 31 ACEIs, the first drugs targeting the RAAS (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System), are used for the treatment of a wide range of indications related to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease for over 30 years. ACEIs and ARBs not only lower blood pressure but also may possess unique cardioprotective properties. 32 They improve endothelial function and regress both left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial mass. They also reduce rates of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and revascularization procedures. 33 ACEIs have been shown to protect against oxidative stress and prevent glycosylation of proteins, which may confer cardiovascular benefit. ACEI or ARB also used for conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, family history of diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure, or other risks for the development of type 2 diabetes. [33] [34] [35] The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a homeostatic regulator signaling pathway participated in the control of vascular function. The regulation of blood pressure, natriuresis, and blood volume recruits this signaling pathway. This system also has a local role in the regulation of regional blood flow and controlling our body's responses to a range of stimuli. 36 Following a rapid increase in the cases of COVID-19, different observational studies are undertaken to identify the possible risk factors for infection and related poor outcomes. With that Yang et al, 17% diabetes cases were reported among 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 37 and 16.2% DM and 23.7% hypertension cases were identified from 1099 patients by Guan et al. 38 Similarly, out of 140 hospitalized patients, it was reported by Yang et al that 12% DM cases and 30% HTN cases were observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19. 37 The large percentage of patients with hypertension undertaking ACEIs or ARBs was a remarkable characteristic among those presenting severe COVID-19 manifestations. These are classes of anti-hypertensive massively used as first-line therapy due to their additional kidney and cardiologic protections that occur regardless of their use for blood pressure control. 39 ACE2 is established as a functional receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S-into cells. Considering the pathophysiologic mechanisms and possible drug targets the scientific community is intensively striving to develop therapeutics for the current pandemic COVID-19. Therefore, the driving force of this review is to discuss the correlation between ACEIs/ ARBs with COVID-19 considering the existing scientific evidence.ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein which is expressed and identified to be active in most tissues. The highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the kidney, the endothelium, the lungs, and in the heart. 36 The probable rational proposed for the possible relation between the use of ACEIs/ARBs, and progression to ARDS in COVID-19 is the increased availability of ACE-2 attached to surface in the lung endothelium, an inherent effect of these two classes, leading to enhanced coupling of SARS-CoV2 to ACE-2 and its consequent cell entry. Indeed, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 has a stronger interaction with ACE-2, compared to other viruses from the same family, and any increase of ACE-2 expression may potentially amplify the virus capacity to entry the cells. 40, 41 In the case of ACEI's, the reduced angiotensin II levels increase the proportion of ACE-2 uncoupled to this molecule, which would act transforming angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. The overcompensation of the ACE-2 action of transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9, which may be enhanced under the use of ACEI's, since angiotensin I is increased, does not fully compensate the lack of coupling of the attached ACE-2. Distinctly, ARBs increase angiotensin II availability since this class blocks its coupling with AT2 receptor, leading to compensatory up-regulation of ACE-2 in the membrane. Studies differentiating the risk of ARDS and related pulmonary complications between ACEI's and ARBs lack, precluding from a comparative analysis of the clinical outcomes between these two classes. 40, 42 While expression and availability of attached ACE-2 is directly correlated with COVID-19 severity, the free circulating form of ACE-2 may inactivate SARS-CoV2, and preclude from its entry in the pulmonary endothelium, and has been proposed that recombinant human soluble ACE-2 could act as a potential molecule to protect from the development of severe manifestations, ARDS, and death in COVID-19. Hence, a speculative ratio between attached ACE-2 availability and expression, and freely circulating ACE-2 could predict the lung pathogenicity of COVID-19. 43, 44 According to Yang et al (2020), higher prevalence of hypertension was observed in patients with severe COVID-19; however, a concluding remark has not been made in that the severity of the infection has a link with hypertension. Similarly, no data were reported with respect to the use of ACEIs and ARBs for the infection. Guo et al (2020) , in evaluating cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 infection, the use of ACEIs/ARBs did not show any association with mortality. 37, 45 But previous animal studies showed that ACEIs and ARB increase ACE2 activity. Based on prior animal studies, it was suggested that proposed ACEIs and ARBs can enhance ACE2 activity and thereby increase infectivity of COVID-19 virus. Other studies in mice and humans showed in contrary to the above animal studies. ACE2 mRNA expression in rat heart cells treated with an ACEI 7 and ACE2 activity in the presence of either ACEI or ARBs in humans, in both scenarios the level of ACE2 does not show any change. 46 As per Fang et al (2020), it was hypothesized that the use of ACE2 receptor increasing drugs is at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. ACEI initially inhibits ACE leading to decreased angiotensin I levels, causing a possible negative feedback loop that ultimately upregulates more ACE2 receptor to be able to interact with the decreased angiotensin I substrate available. This ACE2 receptor up-regulation results in increased binding sites for SARS-CoV-2, leading to preferential COVID-19 infection. This is particularly observed in patients with diabetes and/ or hypertension since they are usually taking ACEIs/ARB. It was, therefore, suggested that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACEIs/ ARBs. 47 On the contrary, some studies indicated that ACEIs/ ARB use may be beneficial in COVID-19 infection prevention. Because of a proposed mechanism that ACEI inhibition of ACE may stimulate a negative feedback (given the lack of angiotensin II, up-regulating ACE2 receptors and decreasing overall inflammation). 48 In severe lung injury animal models, preclinical studies have showed that ACE2 is significantly downregulated and it has been shown that the inhibition of the angiotensin type 1 receptor by ARB like losartan reduces severe acute lung injury in mice administered with the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. 49, 50 The above complementary approach reflects that ACE2 is protective in lung injury during infection of coronavirus. Based on this, there are ongoing trials studying the effect of Losartan (an ARB) in patients with COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings. 51, 52 In order to determine the influence of the RAS system and active treatments on SARS-CoV-2 infection and on Depending on the current evidence available in the web, it is difficult to confirm the co-relation of ACEIs/ARB and their use during COVID-19 either to be beneficial or harmful. Therefore, much more research is highly in need to better elaborate the correlation of the RAAS with SARS-CoV2 infection. It is also very challenging to suggest on the consequences of using ACEIs/ARBs in patients infected with COVID-19 because of the complexity of the RAS system and lack of evidence in human to support the hypothesis. 54 So that whether the benefits of ACE-1 inhibitors or ARBs during an episode of infection with SARS-CoV-2 outweigh the potential risk or not, require further investigation.Although some animal studies suggested that their use could have value in preventing and treating the effects of the COVID-19, there are also contradictory scenarios suggesting that the use of ACEIs/ARBs may exacerbate the deleterious conditions of the infection. As a result of the paradoxical issue of using ACEIs/ARBs during COVID-19, it is still an area requiring investigation to prove. Additionally, a trial evidence of their efficacy and the possible benefit-risk analysis of these conventional drugs during COVID-19 in connection with other comorbidities like hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease associated with diabetes mellitus should also be addressed.Both authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether that is in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, or in all these areas; took part in drafting, revising or critically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-09-16",9

The present study, to the best of knowledge is the first empirical attempt at examining the effects of lockdown on COVID-19 for the country, specifically from an econometric perspective. There is no denying the fact that there have been a series of policy papers, opinions, and predictions about the pandemic for the country. However, most of these submissions can be best described as purely qualitative empirical exercise, building merely on hunches, perceptions or at best, intuitive logics. Thus, this study is quantitative based in nature, thus presenting the contribution to the stock of extant literature on COVID-19 at least from the country-specific stance. While the introductory takes up the first section, the stylized facts about the lockdown measures vis-à-vis the virus spread in Nigeria are presented in section two. Section three presents a brief review of the extant literature;sections four and five dwell on the empirical strategy and estimation of the lockdown-COVID-19 nexus. Section six concludes with some policy implications and caveats.This segment presents the stylized facts about coronavirus cases in Nigeria during the lockdown periods. For ease of comprehension, the lockdown period is partitioned into three phases: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and lockdown easing. This division will provide a deep understanding regarding COVID-19 cases during these identified phases.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn the pre-lockdown phase, no palpable pattern can be discerned from the trend regarding the number of confirmed cases. The lockdown phase witnesses some dramatic changes in COVID-19 cases as compared to the pre-lock down period. However, in the latter part of the lockdown, there were several sporadic spikes with the highest reported cases being 238 in a single day. The easing period equally experiences some increases, as can be observed from the diagram. On the first day of the easing, 245 cases were recorded, while the subsequent days witness upward trends in the number of confirmed cases. Figure 2 presents the summarized version for the three periods in which the total aggregate of the easing surpasses 13,000 altogether. The same Figure 2 displays the state ranking with respect to the reported cases of COVID-19 in which the Lagos State surpasses other states, thus topping the list, and directly followed by FCT, Kano in that order.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Note: confirmed= total number of confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 based on clinical tests from the index to the most recent reported cases. Active= the number of COVID19 patients on admission and undergoing treatment at the various isolation centers. Recovered= the number of COVID-19 patients who have tested negatives after treatment and are certified free of the virus by medical personnel. Death=the number of people who lost their lives courtesy of the virus.The literature on COVID-19 can, at best, be described as emerging or in its embryonic stage.Thus far, the available studies on COVID-19 have only examined the prevalence and control measures (Ceylan, 2020 , Zhao et al., 2020 , governance, technology, and citizen behavior (Shaw et al., 2020) , socio-economic impacts (Tang et al., 2020) . Other strands had equally focused on respiratory syndrome (Al-Raddadi et al., 2020) , temperature (Briz-Redón & Serrano-Aroca, 2020), mortality rates (Ferdinand & Nasser, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , and climate factor (Tosepu et al., 2020) , among others.On the Nigerian front, studies have concentrated on the resurgence of Lassa fever amidst COVID-19 outbreak (Reuben et al., 2020) , Almajiris displacement (Akintunde 2020), comparative analysis of models and estimators (Ayinde et al., 2020) , hunger prevalence (Kalu, 2020) , online forecasting (Abdulmajeed et al., 2020) , impact on transportation (Mogaji 2020) , and economic crisis (Ozili, 2020) .Relatedly, studies on social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 cases include De Vos, 2020; Friedman et al., 2020; Schueller et al., 2020; Musinguzi et al., 2020; Vinceti et al., 2020; and Zhang et al., 2020 . These studies only focused on countries from the developed and emerging nations, implying that little or nothing is on record concerning the African countries. This is in fact, surprising given the prevalent rate of the virus across the countries J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in the continent in general, and Sub-Saharan African economies like Nigeria in particular.This study fills this lacuna. It is worth mentioning also that the large chunk of the extant studies has only adopted descriptive or at best, discussion methods (Akintunde et al., 2020; Al-Raddadi et al., 2020; Crossley, 2020; Mogaji, 2020; Ozili, 2020; Shaw et al., 2020) , while those embracing econometric approaches are scanty to date (Ayinde et al., 2020; Ceylan, 2020) .This study employs a negative binomial regression to unravel the impact of lockdown on COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for at least two reasons; first, the dependent variable used is a count data that only covers discrete and nonnegative values. Thus, as a skewed discrete distribution, using ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates can only yield inefficient, inconsistent, and biased (Long, 1997) . Second, if this dependent variable fits equi-dispersion, then the Poisson regression model becomes inevitable. If otherwise, using negative binomial model remains a credible option. This estimator is often used when the variance is larger than its mean (over-dispersion). The robust standard errors are further clustered in order to produce standard errors that are robust to both heteroskedasticity and a general-type of serial correlation within the cross-sectional unit. More importantly, this estimator has found extensive application in studies such as accidents, conflicts, terrorism among others, given the count data nature of their data (Gassebner and Luechinger 2011; Krieger and Meierrieks 2011, Ajide and Raheem, 2020; Ajide, Adenuga and Raheem, 2020).In a more general form, to specify a negative binomial regression, the mean of the outcome variable y is determined by the exposure time t and a set of k explanatory variables (the ' xs). Hence, the empirical expression relating to these quantities is specified as: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe regression coefficients are thus estimated using the method of maximum likelihood. (see, NCSS, 2017).The study employs an all-inclusive daily situation report of COVID The data on lockdown is obtained from Google mobility data. The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 . From the Table, At the level of the states, Lagos has the highest recorded COVID cases (see Table 2 ), which is consistent with Figure 2 above. Table 4 presents the results of the negative binomial regression estimations of the lockdown effects on Covid-19 for Nigeria. The results for all the indicators of lockdown variables are statistically significant and negative except for the residential variable. These results consistent with the theoretical priors, suggesting the mitigating role of lockdown policies on coronavirus spread. By implication, as people comply with the ""stay-at-home"" order, and limit their visits to essential places, thus reduce their chances of being infected by COVID-19. Correspondingly, this also tends to reduce human-to-human contact, which is the main transmission channel of COVID-19. Intuitively, a 1% increase in compliance to the stay-athome order leads to a corresponding reduction by the magnitudes 0.026%, 0.019%, 0.035%, 0.020% and 0.020%. On the contrary, the impact of residential is positive and statistically relevant. This sounds plausible as people desert essential places of visits, they tend to increase their presence at home. In particular, the majority of infected persons usually have one or more of their family members or close relatives infected. This explains why residential remains a key predicting channel to contacting COVID-19 and such reasons can be advanced as why COVID increases during the lockdown. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f This study examines the extent to which lockdown measures impact on COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. Using the Negative Binomial regression estimator on the daily situation data, the following results are established. First, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, and workplaces are negative and statistically significant across the models. Second, the impact of residential is positive and statistically relevant, thus running contrary to other lockdown measures with negative theoretical priors. Lastly, the obtained results are robust to an alternative estimator of Poisson Regression.The study has some relevant policy implications. First, since the importance of lockdown policy has been quantitatively confirmed to be effective in combating the spread of COVID-19 cases, focus should be placed on residential houses, which act as a spur to the virus. This can be effectively achieved through public enlightening programs and general awareness on the need to comply with lockdown measures. More importantly, the government should guarantee and ensure constant supply of electricity to the people, their staying at home is largely predicated on enjoying uninterrupted supply of electricity. This sounds plausible in the Nigerian context where the supply of electricity has been erratic most times. This has often remained one of the reasons why people seek pleasure outside of their homes. This mostly takes the form of visits to relaxation centres like parks, recreation centres, restaurants, etc. Second, if the government has to ease the lockdown, at all, it must be gradual with all the necessary precautions dully enforced. Notwithstanding, this must be supported by sanctions to the defaulters. Third, lack of necessary welfare-oriented supports from the government serves as a reason people often advanced for not making them ''compliant agent(s)'' during the lockdown periods. Going forward, future research can be conducted using the state-level unit of observations for analysis in order to arrive at a more robust policy generalization.What is more, since Nigeria shares similar socioeconomic and political characteristics with other African countries, the outcome of this research work could serve as useful research inputs for other countries in the region to extrapolate.All the authors participated in the making of the manuscript.

[6] [7] [8] The Nigerian Dental Association also issued some guidelines on COVID-19 protocol for dental clinics in Nigeria to postpone elective procedures in April, 2020. 9 This is due to the reported high risk of infection amongst dental professionals as a result of the large amounts of aerosols generating procedures and their close proximity to patients in confined treatment offices/clinic. The coronavirus has also been found in the saliva of infected persons, 10 and shown to survive in aerosols for hours and on surfaces for days. 11 The closure of universities by the FGN in a bid to limit the spread of COVID-19, has hampered the academic activities of dental schools and clinical training of dental students in Nigeria. The pandemic also affected the training activities of dental students in countries such as China 12 and Canada. 13 Dental students in China had to continue learning online after the Chinese Spring Festival and were told not to return to school until further notification at the onset of the pandemic. 12 Also in Canada, many third-and fourth-year undergraduate dental students within a dental geriatric module in the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, were unable to participate in the clinical geriatric care activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 13 The ongoing industrial strike action embarked by the Academic Staff Union of Universities in Nigeria has further worsened the situation as all forms of training in federal universities have been grossly affected. The impact on the effective training of dental students in Nigerian universities is likely to be severe, further worsened by the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19 infection in clinic settings by the time dental schools in Nigeria reopen.Previous studies among Nigerian dental students had highlighted the importance of feedbacks from students on the factors that affecting their training and how these could be overcome. [14] [15] [16] The COVID-19 pandemic presents with a new range of challenges for undergraduate dental training, not only in Nigeria, but worldwide which include infection control practices in the clinic. Understanding these challenges will assist and guide dental faculties in assisting dental students through these very difficult times. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perception and attitude to the COVID-19 pandemic and infection control practices among undergraduate clinical dental students in Nigeria.Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. The Ethical approval number for the study is LUTHHREC/EREV/0420/12. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study in which the study population was made up of undergraduate clinical dental students in their penultimate (Year 5) and final years (Year 6) from 9 out of the 12 accredited dental schools in Nigeria. The estimated population of undergraduate clinical dental students in Nigeria is 400, as they constitute a smaller segment of all undergraduate dental students in the country. The sample size of the participants for the study was determined to be 102 using a confidence level of 98% within a 10% margin of error. Informed consent was obtained from all respondents in the study. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed and sent out repeatedly to participants using an online data collection platform (Google forms), between April 30 and June 6, 2020 using a purposive sampling technique. The respondents were accessed through their WhatsApp general dental students' platform and direct WhatsApp messages. The questionnaire had 3 sections. Section 1 documented the participants' sociodemographic characteristics while section 2 recorded participants' knowledge of COVID-19. Correct responses were assigned 1 point while incorrect answers were assigned 0. Forty-five (n = 45) questions were used to assess the students' knowledge of COVID-19. The total knowledge score was derived based on the total sum of correct responses and converted to percentage scores. The level of knowledge of COVID-19 was categorized into 2: adequate and inadequate, using a cut off value of 60% considering the fact that COVID-19 is still a novel disease. The third section appraised their perception and attitude towards infection control practices in the dental clinic using 13 questions. Participants' attitudes were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Indifferent; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree). All the scores were summed up and converted to percentages. The average percentage perception score was then computed. Scores ≥60% were graded as positive attitude towards infection control.Data analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Descriptive statistics was used for categorical variables that were expressed as frequencies and percentages, while student's t test was used to compute the means and standard deviation of continuous variables such as the age. The 5 Likert scales were collapsed into 3 categories: Disagree (Scales 1,2), Neutral (Scale 3), and Agree (Scales 3,4) for purpose of the statistical analysis. Differences between categorical variables were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact where indicated. The level of statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.A total of 102 undergraduate clinical dental students participated in the study. Males were slightly more (54.9%) than females (45.1%). The mean age of the respondents was 25.3 ± 2.4 years (range of 21-31 years). Majority (72.6%) of the respondents were in their final year. Students in 9 out of the 12 dental schools participated in the study and distribution is as follows: University of Lagos-35 (34.3%); Obafemi Awolowo University-20 (19.6%); University of Maiduguri-15 (14.7%); University of Nigeria Nsukka, Enugu-12 (11.7%); University of Benin-6 (5.9%); Lagos State University-5 (4.9%); University of Ibadan-5 (4.9%); University of Medical Sciences, Ondo-2 (2%); and Bayero University of Kano-2 (2%). The mean overall knowledge score was 70.17 ± 10.0. Overall, 51(50%) demonstrated adequate knowledge of COVID-19. A significant proportion of the respondents (78.4%) reported that they were up to date on the case definition for COVID-19. Figure 1 shows the source of infor-F I G U R E 1 Sources of information about COVID-19 among the respondents in the present study mation about COVID-19, which is the primary data collected among the respondents during the present study. Their source was mostly from the social media (99%), television (81.4%), friends/family (45.1%), colleagues (42.2%), and text message (39.2%), while the least source of information came from academic training courses (8.8%). The social media in this study included Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., while the text message was the short message service (SMS) through phone which was utilized mainly by the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to disseminate COVID-19 related information. Academic training courses on COVID-19 that were freely organized by health organizations/bodies, locally and internationally, were accessible to the respondents in this study through different online platforms. Table 1 shows the responses of the respondents to the questions on COVID-19. Nearly 60% of the students correctly identified SARS-COV 2 virus as the cause of COVID-19 while majority (95.1%) knew the average incubation period as 1-14 days. Only 30.4% of the respondents knew that mild to moderate symptoms occurred in 80% of those infected with COVID-19, while 96.1% knew that asymptomatic people could spread the coronavirus. Transmission routes of COVID-19 were reported as respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking (99%), and airborne (52.9%). Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 known by the respondents included shortness of breath (100%), cough (99%), fever (97.1%), loss of smell or taste (49%), joint/muscle pain (44.1%), chills (42.2%) and diarrhea (25.5%).The sample collection methods to diagnose COVID-19 was reported by 85.3% as real-time PCR with nasopharyngeal swab/sputum and 23.5% as real time PCR with endotracheal aspirate. Only 16.7% of the respondents knew the (Figure 2) . Table 2 shows their perception/attitude towards infection control. Their responses included the perception that the current standard of infection control measures in their dental schools were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (24.5%). Majority (95.1%) agreed that aerosol-generating procedures in dentistry carried a high risk of spreading COVID-19. Regarding their attitude, 92.2% were willing to undergo an infection control training in dentistry for COVID-19 while only 39.2% were willing to personally procure extra personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the dental clinic to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Table 3 shows the association between knowledge of COVID-19 and sociodemographic characteristics, and perception/attitude towards infection control practices against COVID-19. Only the year of study was significantly associated with the knowledge of COVID-19, as the final-year students (58.1%) demonstrated more adequate knowledge of COVID-19 than the penultimate-year students (28.6%) (P = 0.008).The rapid surge in the number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous strain on health care systems and significantly impacted educational systems globally, including dental training institutions in health care settings of undergraduate dental students. There are currently about 12 accredited dental schools in Nigeria. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies by Isiekwe et al. 14-16 among undergraduate dental students in Nigeria observed a lack of satisfaction with the quality of their clinical training. This study sought to provide an overview of dental students' knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude to infection control during this pandemic, which could serve as guidelines in preparation for school resumption and clinical training of the students. The present study revealed that generally, only half of the students had adequate COVID-19 related knowledge. On the contrary, majority had a positive attitude 17 who reported a large proportion (82.3%) of university students in China with good knowledge of COVID-19. A possible reason for the differences observed may be the fact that fewer questions were used in that survey (5 questions) 19 compared to our present survey which had many more questions on COVID-19 (45 questions). It is thus most likely that more information was required from the students in the present study. Clinical dental students are expected to possess an in-depth knowledge particularly due to their access to the social media and television which were their most frequent source of information in the present study. The proportion of respondents with adequate knowledge of the diagnosis, case definition, symptoms (like diarrhea, joint/muscle pain, loss of smell, chills, headache), and at-risk persons was observed to be low. This could be ascribed to the novelty of the infection and the rapidly evolving information concerning its epidemiology. In this study 97% of the participants knew the correct incubation period of COVID-19, which is contrary to the findings of Khader et al., who reported that only 36.1% of dentists in Jordan knew the correct incubation period. 18 The news media in Nigeria has been flooded with regular and continuous information from the NCDC (Nigerian Centre for Disease Control) on the need for self-isolation for a period of 14 days for people who developed specific symptoms such as cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. This would no doubt have increased the respondents' awareness about these common symptoms, as the news media was bombarded by campaigns to identify these symptoms. Besides, the Jordanian study 18 was conducted at an earlier stage of the pandemic, which might have accounted for the disparity in knowledge level of the correct incubation period.The majority of the dental students knew the early and common features of the infection; this finding is crucial as students should be able to easily identify a suspected TA B L E 3 Association between knowledge and socio-demography, perception, and attitude towards infection control practices against COVID-19 case and take the necessary immediate action and respond appropriately. This was also the case in a Jordanian study amongst dentists. 18 The respondents in the present study indicated good knowledge of the preventive strategies for COVID-19. However, it was surprising to observe that the minimum social/physical distance of 1 m (equivalent to 3 feet) recommended by the WHO 19 was unknown by the majority in the present study. A distance of at least 2 m (about 2 arms' length) between people has also been advocated by other health authorities such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 20 It is important to maintain the recommended distance to prevent a person from inhaling droplets from someone with COVID-19 who may be either asymptomatic or with symptoms of coughing, sneezing, or speaking. Knowledge of bronchoalveolar and endotracheal aspirate for diagnosis was poor, however. This finding may be attributed to the most frequently used methods in this environment, which are oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Although nasopharyngeal swabs have typically been used to confirm clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a Chinese study found bronchoalveolar fluid to have the highest positivity (93%), followed by sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), pharyngeal swabs (32%). 21 The respondents' knowledge of hydrochloroquine/azithromycin and remdisivir was particularly impressive compared to that of pluristem and ivermectin. This may be due to the several controversies that have been generated regarding the effectiveness of these drugs, especially the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, which the WHO is testing in some clinical (solidarity) trials 22 in which Nigeria is participating.The higher knowledge demonstrated by the final-year compared to the penultimate-year students could stem from a greater urge to learn more about the coronavirus and a deeper concern, eagerness, and anticipation amongst the final-year students to complete their clinical procedures upon school resumption in order to write the qualifying exams. It would therefore not be unexpected by them to want to learn more about COVID-19. These findings highlight the need to improve the knowledge span of undergraduate clinical dental students about COVID-19 in order to mitigate its spread. This should be included in the curriculum for dental students all over the world. 17 This is crucial, as the current approach to COVID-19 is to control the routes of infection and to conduct extensive infection prevention and control (IPC) trainings with preventive measures to lower the risk of transmission. 18 Surprisingly, knowledge did not influence the attitude of the students significantly in this study.However, it was noted that there was a lack of will by most students to personally procure extra PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19, when they recommence their clinical procedures. These materials are currently scarce in the market and quite expensive too, and many students may lack the funds to procure them. Besides, there could be a notion that the school authorities are to provide these items. Undergraduate dental education in Nigeria is heavily subsidized by the government, with almost all the dental schools located in either federal or state government-owned universities. Thus, students pay very minimal tuition, however, they are expected to purchase most of the bench items required for training. Furthermore, since the dental schools are dependent on the government for most of their funding, they often have restrictive finances due to limited funding from the government. The provision of PPE by the dental school may therefore be an additional financial burden; in this context, without additional help from the government, the dental schools may be constrained to ask the students to procure their own PPE for training.This underscores the critical need by stakeholders to make appropriate PPE available for all undergraduate clinical dental students to curtail the spread of COVID-19 particularly in resource restricted countries like Nigeria. Government and all stakeholders in the health and educational sectors must cooperate to fight this deadly scourge ravaging the whole world.Majority of respondents (74.5%) agreed that wearing of face masks, gloves, goggles, and face shields while performing dental procedures will protect against COVID-19. This observation is similar to effective infection control advocated in China by Meng et al. 12 It was encouraging to note that most of the respondents recognized that it was not advisable to wear the same clothing and footwear between the clinic and their hostels. Approximately 61% of respondents strongly agreed that wearing clinical scrubs with protective footwear without their personal clothes when treating patients or observing procedures in the clinic gives better protection against COVID-19 than wearing clinical white coats on top of their personal home clothing. This is in keeping with standard infection protocols to avoid transmitting infections.The role of health care worker's uniforms on the horizontal transmission of pathogens in hospital settings is controversial. 23 In the study by Munoz-Price et al., 23 they found an association between the contamination of providers' hands and contamination of white coats, yet they found no association between providers' hands and scrubs although this was mainly attributed to the reduced frequency of laundering white coats than the scrubs. Prior to the pandemic, white clinical coats were worn over personal clothes by clinical dental students in Nigeria during school hours in the dental clinics. This may however not be appropriate nor sufficient particularly with the highly infectious nature of COVID-19 and might change when the students resume to school. Advocating the wearing of clinical scrubs and foot wears was supported by most of the students in the present study. It would also equally important to emphasize the frequent laundering of the scrubs and foot wears. Of note is the significant proportion of students supporting the need to change and wash their clinical white coat after daily use.Thus, it should be performed regularly and thoroughly as it is a simple but effective measure that dissolves the lipid coat surrounding the virus and kills or inactivates the virus if the hands have been contaminated. 12, 19, 24 In addition, in the present study, the perception held by many of the students was to pause the dental treatment of patients who start sneezing or coughing persistently in the dental clinic and refer them for further screening and possibly a COVID-19 test. This is in tandem with the WHO policy that procedures which are likely to induce coughing should be avoided (if possible) or performed cautiously. 6, 15, 24 The importance of hand hygiene as one of the most critical factors for reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 has been previously reported. 12, 19 Thus, it should be performed regularly and thoroughly as it is a simple but effective measure that dissolves the lipid coat surrounding the virus and kills or inactivates the virus if the hands have been contaminated. 12, 19 Concerning the dental management of COVID-19 patients, 83.3% supported their treatment in a wellventilated room or in a negative pressure room. It is better and advised to encourage good air flow whilst ensuring physical distancing as much as possible. Meng et al., 12 proposed that based on their experience, relevant guidelines, and research, dentists are to take strict personal infection control measures that are effective and avoid or minimize operations that can produce droplets or aerosols. Four-handed technique is considered beneficial for controlling infection coupled with the use of saliva ejectors with high volume to reduce the production of droplets and aerosols.The nonprobability sampling method employed in the study may be subject to selection bias as participants were approached via online platforms. Environmental factors in each dental school may have influenced the responses recorded as each dental school has its own peculiarities. Notwithstanding, this study has provided a national perspective on the knowledge and attitudes/perceptions of undergraduate clinical dental students towards the COVID-19 pandemic and infection control practices in Nigeria.This study determined that only half of the undergraduate clinical dental students had adequate general knowledge of COVID-19. The students were not abreast of current updates on COVID-19, particularly the confirmed case definition and less common symptoms. The students however had a good perception and positive attitude towards infection control practices against COVID-19. Our recommendations are that guidelines from reputable health institutions/authorities on COVID-19 be reviewed by the dental school authorities and included in the dental school curricula. The government should also make more PPE available for clinical dental students.The authors declare no conflict of interest.Kehinde Adesola Umeizudike BDS, MPH, FMCDS https: //orcid.org/0000-0003-4893-872X","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-21",9

In a serosurvey of asymptomatic people from the general population recruited from a clinical laboratory in May 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, three of 99 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (3.0%, 95% binomial exact confidence interval: 0.6-8.6%). Taking into account pretest probability and the sampling scheme, the range of plausible population prevalence values was approximately 1.0-8.4%. These results suggest that a larger number of people have been infected than the counts detected by surveillance to date; nevertheless, the results suggest the large majority of the general population in Addis Ababa currently is susceptible to COVID-19.The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is causing both mortality/morbidity and collateral social and economic damage related to public panic and aggressive public policy measures to contain the disease worldwide. 1 The epidemic appears to have taken hold much more slowly in sub-Saharan Africa than in most of the world. 2 Antibody testing to evaluate the population proportion previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to guide public policy but has not been reported so far for sub-Saharan Africa.Because a large proportion of cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic and because the elderly are disproportionately affected with severe and symptomatic disease, we hypothesized that a young population might have experienced an epidemic without having recognized it before COVID-19 become widely known. Such a prior epidemic might explain slower growth of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. We hypothesized that a severe influenza-like illness was epidemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, around the time COVID-19 was recognized, and might represent a prior epidemic. Because responses taken to contain COVID-19 prevent population-based sampling, and because of the urgency of the situation, we undertook a serological study of approximately 100 persons presenting to a laboratory for other reasons, and an additional group convalescent from the outbreak in November 2019/February 2020, to assess the extent of exposure of the population in Addis Ababa and indirectly assess whether this epidemic may have been attributable to SARS-CoV-2.The study was conducted at International Clinical Laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which offers the Abbott IgG test run on the ARCHITECT platform with approval of the Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration to the general public. This test, which has received the European Conformitè Europëenne mark and an Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been found to have 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity using the Abbottdetermined index value cutoff of 1.4 in an independent study by the University of Washington conducted in Idaho, the United States. 3 It has not yet been independently validated in Africa.Subjects enrolled as part of the two groups met the following eligibility criteria: age 14 years or older, resident in Addis Ababa for all of November 2019-February 2020, and no travel outside Ethiopia since November 1, 2019. The following exclusion criteria also were absent: sore throat, runny nose, cough or difficulty breathing, and/or hospitalized or quarantined in the last 28 days; measured temperature > 99. 6 Fahrenheit, resting heart rate > 100/minute, and/or resting respiratory rate ³ 25/minute; incarceration for a crime; unwilling to participate; or unable to consent. The study was approved in advance by the institutional review boards of MyungSung Medical College (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) and Partners Healthcare (Boston, MA), and the Addis Ababa Regional Health Bureau; subjects provided written informed consent in Amharic or English.After training the study team, 99 subjects were recruited from the participating laboratory's waiting room during May 18-21 inclusive; their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Among these, three tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (3.0%, 95% binomial exact CI: 0.6-8.6%). None of the positive cases were taking medications; one had a chronic runny nose with no other symptoms. Taking into account the sampling scheme and the pretest probability (1.3% based on 1,923 positive results among 152,334 tests as of June 9, 2020 4 ; the range of plausible values according to the method of Larremore and others 5 is given in Figure 1 ). Forty-five Ethiopians recruited from the investigators' network who recalled being sick with a COVIDcompatible illness between November 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020 were recruited and enrolled on May 22-27, of whom one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (2.2%, 95% CI: 0.1-12%).Our results-the first serological general population data on SARS-CoV-2 reported from sub-Saharan Africa-are a start toward the vast and important work of characterizing the extent of spread over time in this region, with approximately oneseventh of the world's population. Although the results of this kind of sample are limited in scope and not easily generalizable, the results do suggest that the large majority of residents of Addis Ababa have not yet been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and are at risk. The results do not suggest any particular risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.Decision-makers in Ethiopia, Africa, and elsewhere all are faced with the dilemma of weighing the trade-offs between the direct consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic and the health, economic, and other consequences of aggressive control measures. 2 Given the very young age structure of sub-Saharan Africa with associated lesser direct risk from COVID-19, 6,7 the risk of famine 8 and limited access to essential services, 1 as well as economic problems in this region as collateral problems from COVID-19-associated panic, and restrictive policies, different decisions may be appropriate in the African situation than in countries with an older population age structure and developed economic situation. 9 Exposure to traveler ‡ (%) 8.6 0.0 * Any of the following symptoms each month between November 2019 and March 2020 inclusive: fever > 37.7°C; feverish (did not measure); chills; headache, coughing, or sneezing (more than normal); sore throat; difficulty breathing; runny/stuffy nose; ""feeling more tired than usual""; decreased appetite; body or muscle aches; joint pains; decreased sense of smell or taste; nausea; vomiting > 2 times; abdominal pain; and diarrhea.

This may be aggravated during COVID-19 pandemic when pregnant women may have restricted access to mental health services. The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childbearing women is a major public health challenge, which require appropriate and timely health care support to avert adverse health outcomes.This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 1, 2020to July 31, 2020 at the antenatal clinic of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. The hospital manages about 4500 deliveries annually and receives referral from all parts of the state and neighboring states of Benue, Enugu, Cross River and Abia as well as any part of the country. 10The study participants were pregnant women attending prenatal care at the study facility during the study period. Women who gave consent to participate in the study were included. Those with history of psychiatric illness or conditions that limit their ability to understand the study questions were excluded from the study.A total sampling method was used in the study and consecutive pregnant women who were attending antenatal care were approached to participate in the study.The data was collected using self-administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire had two components that included socio-demographic characteristics and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21).This study was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki. Informed consent was taken from the study participants after informing the study subjects on study objectives, expected outcomes, and benefits associated with it. Confidentiality of responses was maintained throughout the study.Grandmultiparous women were nearly 6 times more likely to report stress symptoms when compared to nulliparous participants (OR=5.9, 95%CI: 2.99-11.9, p<0.001).Although pregnancy is a time of joy for most women, some women experience a range of negative emotions during pregnancy leading to anxiety and depression. 13 Maternal mental health problems are associated with short-term and long-term risks for the affected mothers' overall health and functioning, as well as their children's physical, cognitive and psychological development. 14 Conditions such as extreme stress, emergency and conflict situations, and natural disasters can inflate the risks of perinatal mental health morbidity. 15 Therefore, it is plausible that pregnant women are vulnerable to mental ill-health during the COVID-19 pandemic.Several studies on COVID-19 and pregnancy have been published recently, but few studies have evaluated the impact of this pandemic on maternal mental health particularly in low-resource setting. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown.Similarly, over half (56.8%) of the participants reported stress symptoms. High parity (≥5), urban residence and being in 3rd trimester gestation were significantly associated with risk of development of stress symptoms. This is not surprising as women in these group need social support to lightened the burden of pregnancy.Social distancing has resulted in inadequacy of social supports for many pregnant women as they are separated from their loved ones, whom they rely on for support during this critical phase. While the social support helps pregnant women to relieve stress, inadequate social support is one of the significant risk factors for extreme stress and depression among pregnant women.In conclusion, a significant proportion of pregnant women had psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during COVID-19-related lockdown in Nigeria. There is a need to pay special attention to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, so as to prevent long term adverse psychological outcome that may result from COVID-19 pandemic.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-02",9

This in turn is having an unprecedented impact on health care organizations' ability to provide emergency care and on societies to provide core functions of the state. The COVID 19 pandemic is causing huge stress on the health care system of all countries in the world. The impact of the pandemic is both social and economic. Ethiopia, being one of the developing countries, is currently at the verge of the epidemic [3, 6, and 7] .Pregnancy is an exciting and sometimes stressful experience. Being pregnant during a disease outbreak may add extra anxiety and concern for pregnant women and for those who provide care for them. Currently, the virus is thought to be spread from an infected person to others by respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes and is in close contact with another person. According to the CDC, it is not clearly known if pregnant people are more susceptible to COVID-19 than the general public. Due to changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant people may be more susceptible to viral respiratory infections [8, 9, and 10] .There is no current evidence of adverse effects on pregnant women from COVID-19. The physical and immune system changes that occur during and after pregnancy should however be taken into account. It is critical that all women have access to safe birth, the continuum of antenatal and postnatal care, including screening tests according to national guidelines and standards, especially in epicenters of the pandemic, where access to services for pregnant women, women in labour and delivery, and lactating women is negatively impacted [11, 12] .Dealing with COVID-19 is likely to create imbalances in health care provision, disruption of routine essential services and to require redeployment of scarce health personnel across health services. Acute and emergency maternal and reproductive health services may be hit hardest, with limited facilities for isolation areas to assess and care for women in labour and the newborn [13, 14] .Pregnant women face special challenges because of their responsibilities in the workforce, as caregivers of children and other family members, and their requirements for regular contact with maternity services and clinical settings where risk of exposure to infection is higher.Due to this reason, this study tried to assess the impacts of COVID-19 infection on antenatal care services.Institution based cross sectional study design using mixed (quantitative supplemented with qualitative) method was employed to identify the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among women who get service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. The study was conducted from July 1-15 / 2020.The source populations were all women who get maternal and reproductive health care services in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. All women who get maternal and reproductive health care services in governmental health institutions of Dessie town during the data collection period were taken as study population.The sample size in this study was determined by using single population proportion formula.Since there was no any previous study conducted on the topic, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection was taken as 50%.The required sample based on the usual formula was as follows: n= (Zα/2) 2 . P (1-P) d 2 Where n = desired sample P = proportion of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women to be 0.5 Zα /2 = Z value to 95% significance level=1.96 d = Margin of error (0.05) tolerated Then, n = (1.96) 2 *(0.5) *(0.5) = 384, from undefined population.(0.05) 2 n = 384, adding 10 % non-response rate, the final sample taken was ~422.Study subjects were selected from each health institution by using systematic random sampling until the minimum calculated sample size is obtained. The number of subjects selected from different hospitals and/or health centers were determined proportionally. For qualitative part a total of 20 homogeneous study subjects were selected purposely from each health institution (approximately 3 interviewees from each health institution).For the quantitative part, pretested and semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data was collected by using face to face interview technique from the mothers.Questionnaires for each item were adopted from previously done similar studies and modified according to the objective of this study.For the qualitative part, face to face in depth interview was used. During interview, the responses were recorded and the interviewer has taken notes.From the very beginning, data collectors and supervisors have given a full course of training regarding the basic principles of data collection procedures for both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The data collection tool was pretested with 5% of the study subjects.The participants for the pretest were taken from Kombolcha 03 health center to prevent information contamination. The principal investigator and supervisors have made a day to day on site supervision during the whole period of data collection. At the end of each day, the questionnaires were reviewed and checked for completeness, accuracy and consistency by the supervisors and investigators and corrective discussion was undertaken with all the research team members.The questionnaire was checked for completeness and consistency and entered and edited in the computer for statistical analysis. Data was entered in to Epi data 4.4.1 database.Furthermore, the data editing and clearance was done on the same software. Finally, the data was taken to SPSS version 23.0 for the final analysis. The findings of the study was summarized and presented using tables, descriptive measures and statistical diagrams. The findings from the qualitative part were presented by narration.The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Wollo University, research and community service vice president office and a cooperation letter was obtained from South Wollo health office and each respective hospital administrative office. Verbal consent was obtained from each study participants. The right of the respondents to refuse to answer for any or all questions was respected.Names of the clients was not recorded in the questionnaires and strict confidentiality was assured through anonymous recording and coding of questionnaire and by placing them in safe place after they had been collected; and was used for the purpose of the study only.A total of 422 participants were responded to all the questions making the response rate 100%. Thirty seven percent of respondents were in the age group of 25-29 years. Most of the respondents were married which accounts, 346(82% perpetuity.Eighty two percent of respondents reported that they had got appropriate care while 27(18%) said that they did not get appropriate care after corona outbreak. Concerning the reasons why they did not get appropriate care, more than three-fourth (77.8%) of participants mentioned fear of health care providers. The majority, 81.3% of respondents believed that COVID-19 does not strengthen home delivery. More than one-third (39.3%) of participants reported that their support people were not allowed them to attend delivery at health institutions. Nearly one-third (29.3%) of study participants believed that the support they got from health care providers was somewhat worsened. A total of one hundred fifty (150) respondents gave birth at health institution during the data collection period. Nearly half (50.7%) of postnatal care attendees stayed at health facility greater than or equal to 24 hours while significant number(49.3%) of participants were sent to home less than 24 hours. Shortage of health care providers was the most frequently (40.5%) reported reason to send to home at less than 24 hours followed by clients desire to go to home (36.5%). More than half (53.3%) of respondents reported that they were visited by health care providers every 15 minute. Among 70(46.7%) of participants who said that they were monitored by health care providers less frequently (every 30 minute or every 1 hour), 71.4% reported that health care providers were busy. Half (50%) of postnatal care attendees said that COVID-19 had no impact on their regular child care while more than one-fourth (26.7%) of respondents had experienced difficulty of arranging their regular child care. Three-fourth (75.3%) of postnatal care attendees had changed their plan from formula feed to All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.perpetuity.A total of 72 clients were asked regarding their reproductive health care service utilization after corona outbreak. More than half (65.3%) of respondents had ever used contraceptives after corona outbreak. More than one-third (34.7%) of the study participants did not ever used contraceptives due to unavailable service (32%), travel restrictions (28%) and no plan to use family planning(40%). Majority (90.3%) of respondents did not experience abortion after corona outbreak while only 9.3% of them had experienced it. From those who had All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.perpetuity.For the qualitative part, 20 participants were interviewed by face to face in depth interview.During interview, the responses were recorded and the interviewers have taken notes. The responses are summarized in 5 sections.Most study participants were stressed due to risk of corona transmission from health care providers while they provide care for them. They also described that they were stressed because they think that if they became infected with corona it may affect their fetus. perpetuity.Most of interviewees expressed that health care providers didn't frequently visit them due to shortage of health care providers. A 33-year-old woman said that '' I was in labor ward. My labor pain became worse and I was shouting and calling the doctor to see me, but no one treated me for at least 2 hours after admission.'' Some of the interviewees described that the care they got from health care providers didn't change due to corona; rather the care was improved a little bit. A 35-year-old woman described her experience as '' I was admitted in labor ward and the health care providers provided me special care better than usual; all of them wore masks &gloves and has washed their hands frequently.''Some interviewees reported that the postnatal care provided was significantly decreased.After delivery health care providers didn't visit frequently and sent clients to home at less than 24 hours of hospital stay. A 25-year-old woman said that ''I had faced difficulty of breast feeding after birth and no one helped me to breast feed my neonate. I was also sent to home after 6 hours of hospital stay.''This study tried to assess the impact of COVID-19 on maternal and reproductive health care services in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. The result of this study was discussed with different findings all over the world.Even though the majority of antenatal care attendees said that they got appropriate antenatal care, some respondents reported inappropriate care due to fear and shortage of health care providers which may strengthen home delivery. The finding of this study is in line with the finding in America which reported that an increasing number of health workers are being exposed, while midwifery services are overwhelmed by calls from concerned mothers now exploring home birth options. The problem of shortage of health care providers might be more profound in developing countries like Ethiopia [6, 7] .According to this study, three-fourth (74.5%) of ANC attendees agreed that covid-19 decreases ANC visits. The finding of this study revealed that the most frequent reported impact of Covid-19 on ANC service were shifting of human resources to corona prevention (36.5%) followed by cancellation of ANC visits (33.5%). Similarly, COVID-19 Technical Brief Package for Maternity Services reported that Deploying maternity care workers away from providing maternity care to work in public health or general medical areas during this pandemic is likely to increase poor maternal and newborn outcomes. Ten percent (10%) decline in service coverage of essential pregnancy-related and newborn care (1,745,000 additional women experiencing major obstetric complications without care) were reported from 132 low-and middle-income countries. This similar finding could be justified that the impact of COVID-19 is global [22, 23] .In this study, eighteen percent (18%) of delivery care attendees reported that they didn't get appropriate care, of this 35.3% of them said that the support they got from health care providers was worsened. The result is similar with the study conducted by Ashish KC, Rejina G and Mary V which indicated that delivery care after the pandemic was decreased (health workers greeting the mother decreased by 2.2% (-3.1 to -1.3), the use of gloves and gown for childbirth decreased by 2.4% (-3.1 to -1.9), companionship during labour decreased by 6.0% (-6.9 to -5.1), and intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring decreased by 13.4% (-15.4 to -11.3). This might be due to fear of health care providers to frequently make contacts with laboring mother and shortage of medical supplies such as gloves [24] .This study revealed that nearly half (49.3%) of postnatal care attendees reported that they stayed at health facility less than 24 hours after delivery and the most frequently mentioned reason to stay at less than 24 hours was clients desire to go home. This finding is similar with a study conducted in Europe by Kirstie C and Cristina F which reported that women are sent home more quickly after a miscarriage or stillbirth, and accounts of bereavement rooms being re-allocated to the care of women who have COVID-19 [21] . The reason might be clients' attitude that staying more at health facility could increase risk of acquiring COVID-19, In this study, nearly half (46.7% of respondents said that they were visited less frequently after delivery and the reason was that health care providers were busy which accounts 71.4%). Similar study conducted by Kirstie C and Cristina F in Europe showed that maternity providers have often limited follow-ups, and as in other EU countries, some UK hospitals have stopped allowing birth partners to be present [21] . The reason could be justified that maternity care providers are shifted to COVID-19 prevention as well as shortage of necessary medical supplies to frequently visit clients.In our study, significant proportion of postnatal care attendees (37.4%) reported that the support they received from health care providers was worsened. Similarly the study in Nepal reported decreased postnatal care (placing the baby skin-to-skin with the mother decreased from 30% to 20%, and breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth decreased by 3.5% (-4·6 to -2·6). The possible explanation could be health care providers may worry that skin to skin contact and breast feeding would transmit the virus to newborns. The study in Nepal also showed that immediate newborn care practice of cord clamping 1 min after birth increased slightly after the outbreak. This could be due to health care providers' assumption that immediate cord cut may reduce risk of transmission to the newborn [24] .In this study, among women who were in need of contraceptives, nearly one-third (32%) of them didn't use contraceptives due to unavailability of the service. The result is in line with the study in America which reported that women were unable to access family planning and some of these women stopped going to facilities due to fear of infection and increased physical and financial barriers [9, 10] . Another study done by Taylor Riley, Guttmacher, Elizabeth Sully et al also indicated that COVID-19 pandemic is already having adverse effects on the supply chain for contraceptive commodities by disrupting the manufacture of key pharmaceutical components of contraceptive methods or the manufacture of the methods themselves (e.g., condoms), and by delaying transportation of contraceptive commodities. A report from 132 low-and middleincome countries indicated that Potential annual impacts of a 10% proportional decline in use of sexual and reproductive health care services resulting from COVID-19-related disruptions [11, 12, and 23] .In this study, more than half (57.1%) of respondents who has experienced abortion didn't go to health institutions since all (100%) of them think that the service may not be available during this corona period. This study also showed that, among those who have experienced unwanted pregnancy after corona outbreak, 63.6% of them mentioned unavailability of family planning services as a reason for the occurrence of unwanted pregnancy. This is similar with the study 19 done by Taylor Riley, Guttmacher, Elizabeth Sully et al which reported that and providers are being forced to suspend some sexual and reproductive health services that are not classified as essential, such as abortion care, thus denying people this time-sensitive and potentially lifesaving service. Ten percent (10%) shifts in abortions from safe to unsafe (3,325,000 additional unsafe abortions) were reported from 132 low-and middle-income countries [14, 15, and 23 ].In this study, a substantial decrease in institutional delivery was seen (in spontaneous vaginal delivery and instrumental delivery, 0.6% and 12% respectively) while the number of women who gave birth by c/s was increased by 8% (from 46% to 54%). Similar study conducted by Ashish KC, Rejina G and Mary V revealed that a substantial decrease (7.4%) in institutional delivery was seen between January and May, 2020. The same study also revealed that the proportion of women who had caesarean section increased from 24.5% (n=3234) before lockdown to 26.2% (n=1879) during lockdown (p=0·0075). The reason might be due to that women came to heath institutions for delivery only if they faced complications otherwise they would give birth at home during this pandemic [24] .The neonatal death in this study was increased from 35.7% to 64.3%. This finding is in line with the study done in Nepal which reported that the institutional neonatal mortality rate increased from 13 deaths per 1000 live births before lockdown to 40 deaths per 1000 live births during the lockdown. This might be due to decreased quality and frequency of antenatal care visits as well as maternal stress due to COVID-19. The current study showed a decreased still birth from 64.6% to 35.4%. In contrast to this, the study in Nepal revealed an increased in still births from 14 to 21/1000 total births. This might occur due to difference in sample population, study period as well as study design [24] .In this study, the proportion of maternal complications was increased from 41.7% to 58.3% which was higher than the finding in Nepal in which the proportion of women who had a complication was increased from 6.7% (n=884) before lockdown to 8.7% (n=587) during lockdown (p=0·0126). The difference might be justified that the quality of health care was better in Nepal (the supply of medical equipment's that help to prevent COVID-19 in Ethiopia was low [24] . 20 This study concluded that COVID-19 significantly affects the quality and utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services. According to EDHS 2016 report, the utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services in Ethiopia was low (institutional delivery-26%, antenatal care coverage-34% and contraceptive prevalence rate-36%) and Covid-19 could further decrease this coverage.According to this study, Six percent (6%) of antenatal care attendees, 18% of delivery care attendees and nearly half (46.7%) of postnatal care attendees reported inappropriate service delivery due to fear of health care providers, shortage medical supplies and staff work load. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions.Significant number (32% of antenatal care attendees, 35.3% of delivery care attendees and 37.4% of postnatal care attendees reported that the Support they received from the health care provider was worsened due to COVID-19. Additionally, more than one -third (33.5%) of antenatal care attendants reported cancellation of regular ANC visits.The majority (85.3%) of participants was stressed due to corona and health concern was the greatest source of stress which accounts 42%.Most (93.3%) of the respondents reported that COVID-19 has negative impact on their life, of which nearly one-third (29.3%) of them stated it as extremely negative impact.Significant numbers of respondents have experienced unwanted pregnancy after corona outbreak. Of these, 63.6% of them mentioned unavailability of family planning services as a reason for the occurrence of unwanted pregnancy.The qualitative finding indicated that Covid-19 has significant negative impact on maternal and reproductive health care services (stress, cancellation of ANC visits, decreased quality and no desire to go to health institutions as clients think health institutions is risky place).The data collected from documents indicated that the number of clients who have used different maternal and reproductive health care services was significantly decreased.According to the findings of this study, the researchers would like to forward the following recommendations. To ministry of health: ministry of health should  Continue maternity services to be prioritized as an essential core health service, and other sexual and reproductive health care such as family planning, emergency contraception, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and where legal safe abortion services, to the full extent of the law, also need to remain available as core health services.  Provide full access of all personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitation and a safe and respectful working environment for maternity care providers  To health institutions: Health institutions should  Avail all necessary medical supplies (gloves, masks, sanitizer etc) for both health care providers and clients to improve quality of maternal and reproductive health care services.  Assign adequate number of health care providers at each unit/ward.  Provide health education for clients to avoid misunderstanding towards corona as respondents think going to health institution increases risk of acquiring it.  Improve the quality of their services to attract clients  To Wollo University: Wollo University should  Organize awareness creation program at community level to increase utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services. To researchers  Further study using strong study design with additional variables should be conducted in the future.

It was first reported to World Health Organization on December 31 st , 2019 after it was isolated in a cluster of patients in Wuhan China. COVID-19 has the same veiled RNA structure resembling SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but it is more infectious [1] . The basic idea about COVID-19 infection is that it spreads through the direct mucus contact with the breath/ingestion/salivary droplet of an infected person that can live on hands, objects or surfaces [1, 2] . The outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30 th , 2020 by WHO and called for collaborative efforts of all countries to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 [3] . The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and by end of May 2020, the virus has reached over 215 countries, areas and territories resulting in more than 6 million confirmed cases and 370, 000 deaths worldwide including Nigeria.Nigeria Centre for Disease Control announced the first case of coronavirus disease in Nigeria on February 27, 2020 and since then many confirmed cases have been reported in many States across the country. As at the end of May 2020, over 10, 162 cases have been confirmed, 3007 cases have been discharged and 287 deaths have been recorded in 35 States and the Federal Capital Territory. In Enugu State 18 cases have been confirmed, 12 discharged and no death. To reduce the continued spread of the coronavirus disease and its associated mortality, World Health Organization has recommended series of preventive measures including regular hand washing with water and soap, social distancing, covering nose and mouth while coughing and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Implementing personal hygiene and public health behaviors such as hand washing and social distancing are necessary to curb the spread of coronavirus, but it will be challenging to practice these in many cities and rural areas in developing countries. Without sustained bans on large gatherings (including specific cultural and faith practices such as mass prayer gatherings, large weddings and funerals) these may create super-spreading events that accelerate transmission [4] . This situation may be compounded by the spread of COVID-19 misinformation including unsupported treatments or promotion of ineffective preventive behaviors [5] .In Nigeria, preventive measures have been adopted to prevent further spread of the virus in the country. The government of Nigeria has also engaged in media campaigns to disseminate information on preventive measures to the general public. However, the level of knowledge and preventive practices against COVID-19 infection among adults in Enugu are yet to be evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the knowledge and preventive practices against coronavirus infection among adults in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria.Study setting: Enugu is the capital of Enugu State which is one of the five States in the south-east geo-political zone in Nigeria. The metropolis is made up of three local government areas namely Enugu North, Enugu South and Enugu East local government areas. Its population according to the 2006 national population census was 722,664 people with a growth rate of 3.05% [6]. Its inhabitants are mainly of Igbo ethnic nationality and are predominantly Christians. The occupation of the people includes civil service, trading, artisanship and farming.Study design and population: this was a descriptive cross-sectional study on heads of households in Enugu metropolis, Enugu state, Nigeria. A household is a group of people who live together and feed from the same pot. The head of household is the individual responsible for leadership and financial decisions in the household. We estimated the minimum sample size using the formula for single proportions.A sample size of 320 respondents was estimated based on a type 1 error (α) of 0.05, tolerable margin of error of 0.05 and a proportion of 83.9%, representing the proportion of respondents that had good knowledge of COVID-19 in a study among Nigerians [7] .Sampling technique and study instrument: a multistage sampling technique was used to recruit respondents for the study. In the first stage, a simple random sampling technique of balloting was used to select one out of the three local government areas in the metropolis. In the second stage, a simple random sampling technique of balloting was used to select two out of four districts in the selected local government area. In the third stage, a simple random sampling technique of balloting was used to select two communities each from the list of communities in the two districts that are located in the urban section of the selected local government area. In the fourth stage, a systematic random sampling technique was used to select houses in the selected communities. House numbering was done in each of the selected communities and that served as the sampling frame. A total of 80 respondents were allocated to each of the four communities. The sampling interval for each of the selected communities was determined by dividing the sampling frame by the sample size of 80. The sequence that the houses were selected was based on the numbers allocated to the houses. The index house was selected using a simple random sampling technique of balloting. In the fifth stage, a list of households in each of the selected houses where there were more than one household was made and one household was selected using a simple random sampling technique of balloting. The head of each of the selected household was included in the study. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire developed by the researchers was used for the study. The questionnaire had three sections. The first section had information on sociodemographic characteristics, second section assessed the knowledge on COVID-19 and the third section assessed the practice of the preventive measures on COVID-19. The questionnaire was administered to the respondents by trained research assistants.Outcome measure: outcome measure included Good knowledge and Good preventive practices against COVID-19. Knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed using 22 variables. A correct response to each of the variables was awarded a score of one while an incorrect answer was scored zero.Respondents who scored ≥70% of the 22 variables were regarded as having good knowledge of COVID-19. Preventive practices against COVID-19 was assessed using ten variables. A correct response to each of the variables was given a score of one while an incorrect answer was scored zero. Respondents who scored ≥70% of the ten variables were designated as having good preventive practices against COVID-19. The socioeconomic status index was developed using Principal Component Analysis, (PCA) in STATA statistical software version 12. The input to the PCA included information on estimated household monthly income and ownership of ten household items that included radio, television, cable television, generator, gas cooker, refrigerator, electric iron, car, air-conditioner and washing machine. For calculation of distribution cut points, quartiles, (Q) were used. Each respondent was assigned the wealth index score of the household. The quartiles were Q1 = poorest, Q2= the very poor, Q3= the poor and Q4= least poor. The first two quartiles, Q1 and Q2 were grouped as low socio-economic class while Q3 and Q4 were categorized as high socio-economic class.Data management: data entry and analysis were done using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences statistical software version 25. Frequency tables and cross-tabulations were generated. Chi square test was used to assess the relationship between the good knowledge and sociodemographic characteristics. Multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression was used to determine predictors of good knowledge and good preventive practices against COVID-19. Variables that had a p value of <0.2 on bivariate analysis were entered into the logistic regression model to determine the predictors of good knowledge and good preventive practices against COVID-19. Result of regression analysis was reported using adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval at 5% level of significance.Ethical considerations: ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Research and Ethics Committee of Enugu State Ministry of Health, Enugu state, Nigeria. We obtained a written informed consent from the respondents before questionnaire administration. The participants were assured by the researchers that participation in the study was voluntary and that information obtained for the study will be treated anonymously and confidentially.The mean age of the respondents was 41.6 ± 12.5 years. There were 168 (52.5%) male, 74.7% of the respondents were married, 20.5% (65) had more than four children, 94.1% were Christians, 69.7% had attained tertiary education and 57.8% were self-employed (Table 1 ). All the respondents were aware of COVID-19 pandemic and the major source of their information on COVID-19 were television 94.7%, friends 81.9%, social media 80.3%, radio 72.2% and family members 67.2%. The least common sources of information for them were market 19.4% and town criers (4.7%). The most common symptoms of COVID-19 the respondents were aware of were fever (85.0%), sneezing (79.1%), dry cough (76.9%) and difficulty in breathing (63.7%). Overall, 80.0% (256) of the respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, none of the socio-demographic characteristics examined was found to be associated with having good knowledge of the COVID-19 ( Table 2 ).The use of preventive measures (nonpharmaceutical interventions NPI) among respondents was observed to be generally poor among the respondents. Only 41.6% (133) had good practice of preventive measures among respondents ( Table 3 ). The most common NPI practiced among the respondents were use of alcohol hand sanitizer (86.6%), physical distancing (85.6%), washing of hands with soap and water (81.6%) and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces (80.9%). The NPIs the respondents practiced poorly were use of face mask (33.8%) and avoidance of crowded areas (47.2%, Table 3 ) Education, employment status and having good knowledge of COVID-19 were found to be associated with good practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 among the participants (Table 4) , however when modelled to remove the possible effect of confounder, having good knowledge (aOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.65 -6.05) and attaining secondary education or less (aOR: 2; 95%CI: 1.10-3.13) were the only predictors of good practice of preventive measures. Those who had good knowledge of the disease were 3.2 times higher odds of having good practice of the preventive measures compared to those with poor knowledge of the disease. Those who have secondary education or less had twice higher odds of practicing good preventive measures compared to those that had attained tertiary education (Table 5 ).We found that the heads of households in Enugu metropolis were all aware of the COVID-19 disease. This is good and signifies that the awareness creation effort of the government and the various public health agencies had yielded some result. Awareness and good perception have been reported as a good predictor of proper preventive measures to infectious disease [8]. The main sources of the information about the diseases were found to be the news media and social media. The finding was similar to an earlier study which reported that high proportion of the respondents sourced their information from social media [9, 10] . The use of traditional means of information dissemination was not popular among this population. This could be due to the high proportion of well-educated people among the respondents and the metropolitan nature of the study population.We observed that a high proportion of the respondents had good knowledge about the COVID-19. However, this knowledge was not found to be associated with any of the sociodemographic characteristics assessed. Age and economic status have however been reported to be a predictor of good knowledge among some health workers [10, 11] . This showed a good penetration of risk communication messaging across the different layers of the community. The level of knowledge reported in this study was higher than those earlier reported among health workers in China [9] . We observed that the practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 was generally poor among the respondents. This is despite good knowledge of the disease. It is however important to note that the practices of the preventive measures varied from one measure to another. The use of the preventive measures which are also generally called non pharmaceutical interventions has been noted to help in limiting the transmission of the virus from one person to another [12] . Its effectiveness depends on the right use of a cocktail of the measures. One cannot be fully protected if one practices the use of face mask alone and do not wash hands regularly. Hence despite the good practice observed among some popular measures, the use of the combination of measures, which ensures better preventive effectiveness, was rather poor among the populace. This could be due to incomplete risk communication or other factors such as cost of procuring the materials or its availability. It could also be due to personal preferences or level of risk perception to being infected.Education and good knowledge of the COVID-19 were the only factors that predicted the good practice of preventive measures against the disease. Having lower educational attainment was associated with greater odds of practicing the preventive measures against COVID-19. This could be as a result of the more acceptance among this segment of the population. The more educated segment of the population were less accepting of the preventive measures probably because they feel less at risk of contracting the diseases. They are less likely to live in crowded areas, more likely to have their own personal means of transportation and feel less exposed to the risk of the exposure to the virus. Having good knowledge about the disease is known to be associated with good preventive practices. Those that know about the diseases, its effects and the mode of transmission are more likely to better prevent themselves from being infected. Efforts should be targeted to improving the level of knowledge in the community about COVID-19 as this will have multiplier effects on the preventive practices against the disease.The national public health institute, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and other national and subnational public health agencies need to improve on the risk communication messaging on the use of the NPIs to help improve the acceptance and practice of these NPIs. The highly educated segment of the population needs to be target with appropriate messages to improve their adoption of the right preventive measures against COVID-19. Effort at educating the whole population about the COVID-19 disease should be encouraged as this has a multiplier effect on also improving their use of preventive practices.• Effective use of the non-pharmaceutical interventions has been known to limit the spread of respiratory diseases spread by droplet; • Good knowledge of the disease is associated with practice of preventive measures to protect against infection.However, the practice of preventive measures is low, and this might have implications for the control of the spread of the disease in the metropolis.The authors declare no competing interests.

Still, pathogenic viruses usually cause the most serious diseases and among these viruses; coronavirus is the large family of pathogenic viruses.Infection with these types of viruses can cause respiratory, liver, gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. They are distributed among humans, birds, cattle, mice, bats and other wildlife [1] [2] .World Health Organization (WHO) received notifications from Chinese authorities about many respiratory problems was linked to people who visited a local market for seafood and wildlife in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China [3] . Virological investigation suggests that the causative agent of this pneumonia is a new coronavirus (COVID-19) [4] .This new coronavirus has made hundreds of thousands of victims around the world and becomes a global pandemic threatening human health.Dehesh et al. [5] proposed an ARIMA model to predict the trend of confirmed cases in different countries.. They suggest that China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable. Iran and Italy had unstable trends. Al-qaness et al. [6] proposed an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast the COVID-19 confirmed cases ten days ahead with good performances. The model was tested using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in USA and China.Tang et al. [10] proposed a mathematical model to estimate the transmission risk of COVID- 19 . They concluded that the basic reproduction number might be as high as 6.47. They also predicted the number of confirmed cases in seven days (23 to 29 January 2020).At last, In [11] , data of 47 patients were used to estimate sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The author concluded that the transmission is 0.41. However, with intense surveillance, the probability that an imported case will result in sustained transmission is only 0.012.Since Huang el al [12] proposed the extreme learning machine (ELM), several researches based on the application of these models in various fields of science and engineering have been published to prove their significant progress over conventional neural network models.No iterative process is required to adjust the biases and weights of the free connections between the hidden layer and the output layer, since this adjustment is adopted randomly, thus allowing a reduction in computation time. Therefore, an ELM model is remarkably efficient particularly over conventional artificial neural network to reach a global optimum, following a universal approximation of the capacity of a single-layer feed-forward network [13] [14] . More other applications of the ELM model can be found in [14] .In the present research paper, the implementation of the machine learning regression model, namely extreme learning machine (ELM) is developed for the first time to predict new COVID-19 cases in Algeria.The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) proposed by Huang et al. [12] is a model based on a single hidden layer neural network, which after setting the weights and biases of the hidden layer, and based on a single layer feed forward network (SLFN) algorithm, allows to obtain a closed form solution for the output weights by a least squares solution. It is drawn from a continuous probability distribution function [13] .The advantages of the ELM model are [11] [12] [13] :1-Less complex design;2-High classification accuracy;3-Good generalization ability;4-Less computing time.During training process, the weights and biases of the hidden single hidden layer feed-forward networks (SLFN) are randomly adopted and never updated. The output weights are stated using the generalized Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix [19] .For a set of d-dimensional vectors defined for i i = 1, 2, …, N training samples, the SLFN with L hidden neurons is mathematically expressed as follows [12] :Where:] is the output weight matrix between the hidden the hidden neurons and output neurons;The output function of the hidden neurons, hi(x) can be represented as follows [14] :( , , ), which is defined using hidden neuron parameters (a, b), is a non-linear piecewise continuous function that must satisfy the ELM approximation theorem [12-13-14] .To develop the proposed ELM model, the sigmoid transfer function was adopted, which has been widely adopted in neural network-based modelling, the sigmoid equation is expressed below:Huang et al. [14] state that the approximation error must be minimized when solving for the weights connecting the hidden and output layer (W) using least square fitting:In Eq. (4), the term ‖ − ‖ is the Frobenius norm and H is the randomized hidden layer output matrix of the form [14] :The target matrix in the data-training period is expressed in [14] as:For these linear equations, an optimal solution was proposed in [12] as: * =where: H + : Moore-Penrose generalized inverse function (+).The optimal solution is then used in Eq. (7) to issue prediction for any given input vector x.Finding the appropriate number of nodes in the single layer hidden in the extreme learning machine neural network is a very difficult and critical task. A model with a large number of hidden nodes will have an excessive configuration, will follow the noise in the data and consequently will require more time in training phase, with the risk that overfitting occurs. The generalization properties during the test phase can be considerably influenced [13] .Some general rules for selecting the number of nodes in hidden layer (NNHL) are presented below:1. Hecht-Nielsen [20] used the Kolmogorov theorem to prove that:2. Hecht-Nielsen [21] suggest that it should be:3. Masters [22] suggests that the ANN architecture should resemble a pyramid with:Where:and are respectively, the numbers of inputs and output.For determining the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer, initially, two neurons were tested. Subsequently, the number of neurons was gradually increased to 7 by an interval of one.Sigmoid activation function (sig) was adapted for all the ELM models tested in the hidden layer and linear function as transfer function (pure line) in the output layer.The best ELM configuration is adopted based on the minimum statistical error measurements = averaged predicted values.Legates and McCabe [23] mentioned that RMSE has the advantage of expressing the error in the same units as the variable, so, providing more information about the efficiency of the model.A model with a lower RMSE value will have a high accuracy prediction. In addition a model with high value of OI means a perfect fit between the observed and predicted data [24] . The ELM models development and construction process consists of the following five steps:1) Selection of the input and the output data for training ELM model (data set).2) Normalization of the input and the output data attributes.3) Training of the normalized data using a hybrid-learning algorithm.Testing the goodness of fit of the model.Comparing the predicted output with the target output.The input and the output data was normalized using min-max normalization; the data are normalized to values between 0 and 1 using the equation:After obtaining the normalized data, the next step is to train the input data using the proposed Table 2 .In this research, an extreme Abstract: In this research, an extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the new COVID-19 cases in Algeria. In the present study, public health database from Algeria health ministry has been used to train and test the ELM models. The input parameters for the predictive models include Cumulative Confirmed COVID-19 Cases (CCCC), Calculated COVID-19 New Cases (CCNC), and Index Day (ID).The predictive accuracy of the seven models has been assessed via several statistical parameters. The results showed that the proposed ELM model achieved an adequate level of prediction accuracy with smallest errors (MSE= 0.16, RMSE = 0.4114, and MAE = 0.2912), and highest performance's (NSE = 0.9999, IO = 0.9988, R 2 = 0.9999). Hence, the ELM model could be utilized as a reliable and accurate modelling approach for predicting the new COVIS-19 cases in Algeria. ","Algeria","abstract","2020-09-29",9

While the lungs are the organ primary target of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent COVID-19, other organs, including kidneys, can be affected, and this is associated with increased mortality and morbidity [3, 4] . Previous autopsy reports from China and more recent reports from the USA have described mostly kidney tubular injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . However, cumulating evidence from Europe and the USA yields collapsing glomerulopathy (CG), a variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [7] . Interestingly, the patients reported in these early papers are of African descent, and the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles likely contributes to the pathogenesis of the renal disease [7] . To date, there has been no similar report from continental Africa. We report the first COVID-19-associated CG from sub-Saharan Africa, in a Congolese patient infected with COVID-19, who presented with acute kidney injury (AKI) and de novo nephrotic syndrome.A 48-year-old African man presented to the Kinshasa University Hospital (KUH) for persistent fever since March 16, 2020, associated with dry cough, vomiting, myalgia, and generalized weakness. At home, he self-medicated with two antimalarial medications (artemether and lumefantrine) for three days. His symptoms persisted, and he visited a medical center on March 23, 2020. A blood smear demonstrated Plasmodium falciparum and was given intravenous Artesunate, another antimalarial drug, for five days combined with cefixime, a broad-spectrum, third generation cephalosporin.Two weeks after his symptoms began, he experienced anuria and he visited the emergency unit of KUH on April 2, 2020. He stated that sixteen days previously he had been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19. His past medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension for the past three years. His medications included the oral antidiabetic drug repaglinide and the antihypertensive drug amlodipine. His family history was notable in that his father had chronic kidney disease. Laboratory tests six months prior to admission included a serum creatinine of 0.72 mg/dL and urinalysis that showed no proteinuria.On hospital admission, he was noted to be dyspneic, with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was 152/84 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 93%. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive for COVID-19 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Kidney function tests revealed severe kidney dysfunction, with increased plasma level of urea (222 mg/dL) and creatinine (15.9 mg/dL). A kidney ultrasound excluded an obstructive uropathy; kidney echogenicity, length (13.2 cm), and resistive index (0.8) were increased. In the setting of anuria, no urinalysis was performed. Initial laboratory assessment and selected trends are depicted in Table 1 .A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made and the patient received chloroquine, azithromycin, and vitamin C, starting on day 1, according to the national COVID-19 management protocol (unpublished data). COVID-19 RT-PCR testing and Plasmodium falciparum blood smear performed on days 14 and 21 after his hospital admission were negative.Assessment of kidney function included anuria, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and stage 3 AKI according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. On April 2, the patient started hemodialysis three sessions per week. After five dialysis sessions, the patient progressively recovered renal function, with diuresis reaching 4 liters/day and a fall in serum creatinine levels (2 mg/dL). e clinical diagnosis was acute tubular necrosis.One week after recovery of kidney function (admission day 27), he developed full blown nephrotic syndrome (NS), characterized by heavy proteinuria (18 g/d), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 2.3 g/dL), and dyslipidemia; microscopic urinalysis was normal. He experienced progressive increase in serum creatinine up to 13 mg/dL. ere were no episodes of hypotension, and the patient received no nephrotoxic drugs. A kidney ultrasound excluded renal vein thrombosis. Serologic analyses for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, and HIV were negative. A percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed on hospital day 30. e biopsy contained three cores, each of which contained with both renal cortex and medulla. ey yielded a total of 17 glomeruli, none of which was globally sclerotic. All but one displayed segmental or global collapse, implosion of the glomerular capillary tuft, and enlargement of Bowman space ( Figure 1 ).Bowman space was occupied by hypertrophic and hyperplastic epithelial cells in 1-3 layers some of which showed cytoplasmic vacuolization and occasional protein droplets. Multiple early synechiae connecting glomeruli to Bowman capsule were seen. ere was a severe tubular injury, with degenerative and regenerative changes. ey included epithelial cell denudation loss and attenuation of the tubular brush border and cellular blebbing and mitoses. ese changes in tubules were strongly Ki-67 positive, a molecular marker of cell proliferation (not shown) by immunohistochemistry.Tubules showed microcystic dilatation and contained positive proteinaceous casts. Some proximal tubules also contained abundant PAS-positive resorption protein droplets. Tubulitis was not seen. e interstitium showed mild edema and patchy moderate fibrosis and patchy moderate to marked chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. 2 Case Reports in Nephrology e arteries and arterioles showed no conspicuous changes. e biopsy findings were interpreted as being consistent with the collapsing variant of FSGS based on Columbia classification of FSGS, also known as collapsing glomerulopathy (CG) [8] .Shortly after the kidney biopsy, the patient began producing urine. e patient received pulse therapy with methyl prednisolone intravenously, 500 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, and cyclophosphamide intravenously, 500 mg day 1; despite this therapy, proteinuria remains still heavy (4 g per day). Figure 2 shows changes in serum creatinine and proteinuria with time. Although kidney function does not return to normal, serum creatinine levels decreased to 5.0 mg/dL after two weeks.Prior studies on kidney disease, based on postmortem autopsy specimens in COVID-19 patients, showed acute tubular injury without glomerular abnormalities [5] . e authors linked these observations to the fact that angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protein serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in host cells, are prominently expressed in epithelial cells of proximal convoluted tubes [9] . However, recent reports from COVID-19 patients demonstrated the glomerular injury mainly in the form of CG encountered particularly in people of African ancestry [7] . CG is an aggressive variant of FSGS exhibiting high rates of podocyte injury and depletion. Diseased podocytes exhibit a loss and gain of markers of differentiation and proliferation, respectively, and podocytes have been described to ""transdifferentiate"" toward a macrophagelike cell [10] . By light microscopy, CG is characterized by hyperplasic and hypertrophic visceral epithelial cells overlying segmentally or globally collapsed glomerular capillaries that are narrowed or obliterated by wrinkling and retraction of glomerular basement membranes [11] . e tubulointerstitial compartment often contains an infiltrate of mononuclear cells. Tubular epithelial cells typically display degenerative and regenerative changes and aberrant cellular proliferation and differentiation, leading to microcystic transformation. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are common [11] . is histologic description corroborates the findings in the patient herein reported. Ancillary techniques such as electron microscopy (EM), immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and other sophisticated techniques have been used to identify pathogenic viral particles in biopsies from kidney structures in well-resourced settings, yielding so far no conclusive results besides podocyte changes related to proteinuria [12] [13] [14] , although a recent EM report of a necropsy claims ultrastructural evidence for the presence of virus in podocytes [15] .In the present case report, AKI and NS with a bland microscopic urinalysis were the clinical expression CG. is clinical presentation of CG in the context of COVID-19 illness has been recently reported [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . CG can be of idiopathic origin or most commonly secondary to autoimmune diseases, interferon therapy, and viral illnesses, including HIV, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19 [16] . Our previous experience also reported CG associated with filariasis [17] . As many of these secondary causes were ruled out in the present patient, COVID-19 and coinfection with malaria were retained as potential causes of CG and ensuing NS and AKI. To date, less than 30 cases of CG have been described worldwide in the context of COVID-19, while AKI alone occurs in 1.3% to 36.4% [18] . Although rare, some cases of CG associated with malaria have also been described; indeed, malaria can be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hemophagocytic syndrome [19, 20] .Kidney involvement in COVID-19 is now believed to originate from a double hit mechanism thought to rely upon the interaction of environmental factors, mainly SARS-CoV-2, altered host immune response, and genetic susceptibility. Recent data indicate that kidney injury in COVID-19 could be initiated by viral cytotoxicity or cytokine storm related to sepsis or other associated comorbidities [21] . Direct infection of kidney resident cells is enabled by the high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells of proximal convoluted tubes and podocytes [9] . e virus likely gains access to the kidney via the bloodstream [21] .Reports from Europe and the United States of America on CG in COVID-19 patients have indicated a high susceptibility of people of African descent compared to other people [7] . is high susceptibility of black people to CG has been reported to be linked to the presence of high kidney risk genotypes of APOL1 genes, well-known risk factors for the development of CG in HIV and non-HIV black patients [22] . Regardless of the associated disease, nearly 70% of these African-descent patients with CG are homozygous for APOL1 risk alleles [23] . In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, G1 APOL1 risk variants are frequent and are associated with hypertension-attributed nephropathy [24] . High-risk APOL1 genotype may mediate podocyte damage via up regulation of APOL1 through activation of a viral program in the podocyte, leading to dysregulated endosomal trafficking and autophagic flux, resulting in podocyte depletion and glomerular scarring [11] .In conclusion, this first report from African continent confirms that collapsing glomerulopathy now referred to as collapsing-associated nephropathy (COVAN) represents an emerging entity in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, particularly involving individual with sub-Saharan African ancestry.Informed consent was obtained from the patient. e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.","Democratic Republic of the Congo","first author","2020-09-28",9

COVID-19 is a severe human pathogen, which affects the respiratory system, liver, digestive and nervous systems is distributed among birds, humans, mice, bats, and other wildlife [1, 2] . Two previous coronavirus (SARS-CoV was discovered in the year of 2003 and enhance the performance of FLAT to find LCCS of COVID-19 against other viruses in a reasonable time.FLAT was proposed to speed up the execution time of the SW algorithm with acceptable alignment results [18] to speed up the process of aligning sequences with huge length and search databases. The idea is fragmenting the two sequences into many fragments with short lengths and perform the SW algorithm on these fragments where SW will consume a short time due to the short length of sequences. Due to there are many possibilities of positions to cut the fragments, Meta-Heuristic Algorithms (MA) are used to point the search toward the locations in the sequences that have LCCS found. MA are stochastic algorithms based on search methodology inspired by nature, animals, and physics phenomena to find the optimal solution. Common and recent released MA, for example, Sine-Cosine Optimization Algorithm [19] , Particle Swarm Optimization [20] , Volleyball premier league algorithm‫‬ [21] , Lightning Attachment Procedure Optimization [22] , Lightning search algorithm‫‬ [23] Electron radar search algorithm [24] , The Whirlpool Algorithm [25] and Squirrel Search Algorithm for optimization [26] .FLAT was implemented using the Sine-Cosine Optimization (SCA) algorithm [19] and the improved algorithm of SCA using PSO (ASCA-PSO) [18] . The two algorithms are succeeded in finding reasonable alignment results with a high percentage of real LCCS in a reasonable time. The percentage of the length of LCCS founded relative to real LCCS founded by the SW algorithm is the criteria for evaluating the performance of FLAT. FLAT based on ASCA-PSO produces the highest average percentage of 83 % real LCCS can be founded over sequences with a product of lengths in the range from 250,000 to 9,000,000 while it produces 40 % of real LCCS when using SCA. Therefore, the quality of the founded solution still causes a flaw that motivates the development of FLAT for enhancing the founded solutions. The poor performance of the FLAT version, which is based on SCA due to SCA, has good exploration capability but poor exploitation capability. The positions of sequence lengths represent the search space that was explored using FLAT, and the LCCS between the two aligned sequences is the desired output that was located at certain positions in each sequence. As seen in Figure 1 , there are 4 positions (P1 to P4) explore the search space by visiting most positions over the entire length of the sequence, and two fragments are cut (one in each sequence) to be aligned to find the length of the common subsequence.The algorithms try to find the positions in each sequence to cut a fragment, and the fragments that have the longest common subsequence founded all other search agents moved toward its position to diverse the solutions and may found better LCCS. As shown, the search agent P3 found part of real LCCS that have a length (K), and this part is the longest founded part; hence all other solutions will move toward it according to the updating mechanism of metaheuristic algorithm. The search agents intensify around the best search agent (P3) and improve the search around the region marked by a green circle‫.‬ [27] is developed. Since no one optimization algorithm can handle all problems efficiently, as stated by No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem [28] . IMO is inspired by the attraction and repulsion law of ions for performing the search process.Ions Motion Optimization (IMO) algorithm has two groups of search agents; each group has global best solutions and the movement of theses agents based on the attraction and repulsion force law. Two global best solutions will increase the diversity of released solutions due to the updating movement of search agents; hence it has efficient exploration capability, and this the main advantage of IMO. Another main advantage IMO, its few parameters to be tuned and efficient exploration for the feasible search space. However, the exploitation of IMO is weak, which is performed if a certain condition is satisfied hence it cannot execute on all iterations for all search agents; hence it produces poor performance, which needs to be enhanced.The performance of IMO was tested for implementing FLAT, which produces poor results, which represented as finding LCCS far from real one measured by the SW algorithm or very small percentage of real LCCS. The reason for these poor results is the huge length of sequences that represent the search space, and IMO succeeded in locating the region of LCCS due to its good exploration capability. However, poor exploitation makes it fail to intensify the region to increase the common part is found.According to the huge length of aligned sequences in the FLAT, so efficient exploration of the search space needed to visit most regions of the sequences. Therefore, IMO is predicted to propose an enhancement performance better than that of SCA. However, It has poor exploitation capability, so it is merged with PSO to enhance its exploitation phase. IMO has been successful in optimizing many engineering applications such as load economic dispatch (Wang, Pan, et al. 2020 ), short-term hydrothermal scheduling‫‬ [29] , breast cancer prediction [30] , AGC investigation in [31], protein folding prediction [32] , robotics [33] and cloud job scheduling [34] .Some trials were performed to enhance the exploitation of IMO, such as [35] proposed enhancement of IMO based on adding random perturbations to the update equations of ions during solid states. The enhanced version was called diversity IMO (DIMO) due to it based on the diversity of solutions. The proposed version was tested on mathematical benchmark function and the engineering problem of localization in a wireless sensor network. They claimed that the convergence speed of IMO and localization accuracy in wireless sensor network was enhanced. Another trial for enhancing IMO by combining the greedy algorithm and was tested on the problem of the protein folding prediction of the HP model [32] . The proposed enhanced version of IMO (IMOG) proposed an efficient ability to produce high accuracy of prediction with high stability, especially for longer sequences.In this work, DIMO and IMOG were used for implementing FLAT to test their performance, and they produced poor results, which prove that the enhancement of exploitation of IMO using the two versions is not efficient for FLAT according to No Free Launch theorem [28] .In this paper, an improved IMO algorithm for FLAT is proposed based on enhancing the exploitation phase of IMO by combining the PSO algorithm with has efficient exploitation process. In general, the PSO algorithm [20] , which inspired its search methodology from bird flocking, is the best choice since it has efficient exploitation of the search space. So, there is motivation to use it due to its success to optimize the exploitation phase in a lot of metaheuristics such as SCA [18] , Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) [36] , Differential Evolution [37] , Tabu Search [38] , Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [39] , Swallow Optimization Algorithm (SOA) [40] , Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) [41] , Ant Colony Algorithm [42] , [43] , Genetic algorithms [44] . There are other trials of optimization of different algorithms.The proposed model starting by accepting the protein sequences of COVID-19 and the against protein virus, and the LCCS between the two protein sequences is the required output. Then FLAT explores the search space using IMO, and then the founded solutions are assigned as initial solutions to be exploited by PSO then return to IMO. These operations are performed for some iterations. Therefore, each algorithm is self-contained with no influence of one of them on the search methodology of the other and are executed in a relay execution manner. The way of assigning solutions between search agents of each algorithm during the transition between the two algorithms (from IMO to PSO or the reverse) will affect the enhancement of IMO. So, in the improved IMO, and there are some rules for assigning these solutions. The required LCCS between COVID-19 and the other virus is the one founded by the best global solution of PSO.In this paper, the main achievements can be concluded as follow:1-Propose an alternative method to improve the analysis of COVID-19 using modified FLAT. 2-Enhance the performance of FLAT based on the improved IMO. 3-Propose an improved IMO algorithm based on merging with PSO.The following sections of this article are organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic information for the Fragmented Local Aligner Technique, IMO, and PSO. Section 3 presents the Proposed IMO-PSO for FLAT. In section 4, the experimental results and discussion are given. Section 5 introduces the conclusion and future works.The following subsections propose a brief description of Ions Motion Optimization (IMO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms also presented.Aligning genomic sequences (DNA, Protein, and RNA) is a vital operation in bioinformatics that measures the functional and evolutionary relationships between the genomic sequences (Cohen 2004) . Besides, other operations in biology use alignment operation such as prediction of protein secondary structure (Di Francesco, Garnier et al. 1996) , construction of phylogenetic trees (Feng and Doolittle 1990) , and DNA fragment assembly (Li and Khuri 2004) . Local pairwise sequence alignment is one of two common kinds of alignment algorithms that finds the LCCS between pairs of biological sequences, and the standard algorithm to perform the local alignment is the SW algorithm (Smith and Waterman 1981) , which depends on the dynamic programming approach. Therefore, it produces the accurate LCCS between a pair of sequences; however, it engrosses powerful execution time, especially for sequences with huge lengths.Fragmented Local Aligner Technique (FLAT) was proposed to speed up the execution time of the SW algorithm with acceptable alignment results (Issa, Hassanien, et al. 2018 ) to speed up the process of aligning sequences with huge length and search databases. The idea is fragmenting the two sequences into many fragments with short lengths and perform the SW algorithm on these fragments where SW will consume a short time due to the short length of sequences.As shown in Figure 2 , there are three fragments with length L F and the yellow parts are the common between each corresponding fragments. As shown, fragments are cut at positions P A1 and P B1 are aligned using the SW algorithm, and it contains the LCCS founded with length W. Hence, other positions must be moved toward this position to enhance the search operation. This is the rule of using MA, which aid in traversing the huge length of sequences and point the search toward the location has LCCS founded. Eq. 1 is used as an objective function (The fitness function that is used to evaluate the solutions) that is used to control the movement of search agents and assess the finding alignments. (1) where A and B are the aligned sequences with length L. The procedure of FLAT is presented in the algorithm (1).FLAT has a complexity of time , where N, L F , and T are the number of search agents, the length of cutting fragments, and the number of iteration respectively.1. N agents (P i , i in the range (1, n) ) are initialized with two positions (one in each sequence) chosen randomly in the range (1, length ((Seq 1 or Seq 2 ) -L F )) where L F denotes the fragment length.2. SW alignment algorithm aligns every two fragments pointed by each search agent, and Eq. 1 is used to evaluate the alignment score as an objective function. IMO algorithm is a stochastic optimization algorithm which inspired its search methodology from the properties of ions in physics. The population (candidate solutions) of the IMO algorithm is divided into two sets of anions and cations. Updating the movement of these ions (solutions) according to the theory of attraction and repulsion of the ions that states, ""ions with the same charges repel each other, but with opposite charges attract each other"" [45] . The algorithm consists of two states: liquid state and solid state wherein liquid state, the ions are moved freely more than in the solid-state that give possibilities for exploration search space and produce more diversification of the solutions, which is an advantage of IMO. While in solid-state (exploitation phase), the stabilized attraction forces between ions make it not free enough to search around in narrow regions; hence the exploitation phase is poor. In the following liquid and solid phase are described :-Liquid phase (exploration phase)In the liquid state, each population of anions and cations update its movement such that each anion move toward the best cation and each cation move toward the best anion found. Eq 2 and Eq 3 are used for update anions and cations in order.where i is the ion index, j is the dimension, A i,j is anion candidate solution, C i,j is the cation candidate solution. A bestj is the best anion solution, and C bestj is the best cation solution found, AF i,j and CF i,j is the mathematical model that represents the distance between ions and cations as in Eq. 4 and Eq. 5.Exploration can be guaranteed due to ions are attracted to the opposite charges ions, and during the next iterations, more interaction between ions leads to converging toward the best opposite charge ions until reaching balance attraction force between ions leads to stabilization of the ions form.For a certain condition where the best fitness found becomes more than half of the worse fitness of anion and cations, the solid-state was entered where the ions become approximately fixed due to the stability of attraction forces. This condition may not be satisfied in some cases (for certain runs or certain engineering problems), and the exploitation phase cannot be occurred or not clear hence it needs to be enhanced. In the solid-state, ions are difficult to be moved and form the stabilization phase, so there is a need for an external force to move the ions around the search space to escape from local minima. Eq. 6 and Eq.7 are used for this purpose, and also there is a random initialization of some ions around search space to increase the diversity of ions around search space. Hence, the important condition to apply external force is the value of the best ion of anions (and cations) is bigger than or equal half of the worst value of anions (and cations), which means the ions are in the stable case.andare random variables in the range [-1, 1]. After updating ions based on Eq 7 and Eq 8 if a probability lower than 0.05 hence re-initialize the ions in the search space to guarantee to escape from freezing and enhance exploration.where T and n are the number of iterations and the number of search agents in order. C Liquid and C Solid are the costs time for updating equations of one search agent in the liquid and solid phase iteratively.PSO is a swarm optimization algorithm that mimics the attitude of birds flocking for flying. It has a stochastic search strategy that depends mainly on the global communications between the search agents, where all search agents modify their movement pointed to the global search agents that finds the global solution. Besides, it memorizes the best solutions each search agent pass through, which influences the new update of it as stated in Eq. 8, and this memorization of location enhances the exploitation phase of PSO.The updating equations of PSO are represented as Eq. 8 and Eq. 9, where the particle (P gbest ) has the global best position (solution) among all search agents and the best personal position (P i best ) that each search agents found during the previous iterations.Where v i represents the velocity of the i th particle, c 1 and c 2 are the local the global best position coefficient in order. w is the inertia coefficient that estimates the influence of the prior velocity on the new estimated velocity. rand () is a uniformly distributed random variable in the range [0-1].PSO has a complexity of time where T, n, and express the number of iterations, the number of search agents, and the cost time of modifying the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof position of one search agent, respectively. PSO has a main advantage is the interchanging of information between search agents, which gives it more reliability to achieve an approximate optimal solution with acceptable convergence speed besides robustness.PSO was used in many optimization problems such as solar cell design [46, 47] , electrical motor design [48] , and surgical robot applications [49] .This section proposes the details of the proposed IMO-PSO algorithm for FLAT, which is described as a framework in Figure 3 , which describes the rule of using FLAT for aligning the COVID-19 virus against another virus to find LCCS between them. LCCS will be input for another biochemistry and biological operations on COVID-19 to aid in drug design of it, constructing its phylogenetic tree or updating therapeutic protocols. [17] . To determine the best anion and best cation, which represents the position of sequences at which the cutting fragments have the LCCS found. The fitness function that is used to measure the objective of solutions of search agents as expressed in Eq. 1, where it used to count the number of similar residues (character of sequences which represents amino acids).FLAT processing finding the LCCS starting from the third step in a framework where the ions will be attracted to opposite best ion to move the positions toward the best positions founded in each sequence, and this step represents exploring the sequences by producing more diversifications of positions. The founded solutions (positions) due to exploration by IMO are mapped to the search agents of PSO to be intensified and find better LCCS around the founded one.Since IMO can find part of the LCCS but PSO can enhance it by finding the remainder by searching around the founded one. The solutions founded by PSO mapped back to IMO to resume exploration, and the transition between IMO and PSO is executed for some iterations. Still, the main rule during the mapping is mapping the solutions if it provides better fitness. The best LCCS that will be output is that of the best global search agent of PSO, which has the best global solutions over all iterations and overall search agents.In this section, the steps of the proposed COVID-19 model are discussed as in algorithm (2) PSO) algorithm. The proposed model starts by accepting the pair of sequences to be aligned. Then initialize (n) ions of IMO (two groups of ions anion and cation, so the total number of ions is 2*n) with two positions (one position in each sequence) and the lower limit of solutions is 1 (the first residue of the sequence) while the upper limit is the end position of the sequence subtracted by the width of the fragment (L F ). These two positions represent the start of cutting fragments (one fragment in each sequence) to be aligned using the SW algorithm (in step 3). The next step is to align the two cutting fragments by anion or cation ions using the SW algorithm, and the similarity measurements of the LCCS founded are measured using Eq. 1 (In step 4).Algorithm ( Steps (9-10) represents the mapping of solutions for transition from IMO to PSO where solutions found by IMO are assigned to the search agents of PSO (y i ), the best personal solutions for each search agents (y best i ) and the global best solutions among all search agents (y gbest ).The global best solutions (y gbest ) are updated from the best anion (A gbest ) or best cation (C gbest ) if they provide better fitness (In step 10). As shown, IMO explore the search space and move the ions toward two best solutions, which lead to more diversity of solutions and exploring large search space hence the global best solutions (y gbest ) each iteration may locate the regions of best fitness. In step 11, the best personal solutions of each search agent (y best i ) are updated from the corresponding anion ion (A i ) or cation ion (C i ) if they provide better fitness and the corresponding search agent (y i ) is assigned with the left choice.Steps (11) (12) (13) (14) are the procedure of updating equations of PSO for some iterations T 1 . In step 11, the fragments are cut and aligned using the SW algorithm for each particle, and the fitness is evaluated based on Eq. 1. Steps 12-14 update the particle positions and best particle of PSO.The exploited results found by PSO will return back to be assigned to the ions of IMO if they provide better fitness to resume exploring and exploitation of the search space for some iterations T 2 . In steps (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , the mapping between PSO to IMO is performed as the anions search agents are assigned by the corresponding best personal solutions of each search agent (y i best ). The cations are assigned with the solutions (y i ) of PSO, but these assignments are done if it provides better fitness. The best anion is assigned the global best solution (y gbest ), while cation is chosen from the cation ions that provide the minimum fitness. Note that, the solutions of PSO are assigned to cation ions since it will attract to the best anion (A gbest ) while anions which are assigned by corresponding (y best i ) will be attracted to the best cation that is determined from the solutions of cations. The assignment mechanism will lead to more diversity of solutions to explore the search space.The final output (best LCCS founded) is produced in step 19 where the positions stored in the best particle of PSO (y gbest ) represent the positions of the fragments that have the best LCCS founded in the overall length of aligned sequences. Therefore, the fragments are cut and aligned to find LCCS and calculate its width, which represents the output.IMO-PSO has a complexity of time is O (T 2 * (T 1 * N * (C IMO + C PSO ))) where T 1 and T 2 are the number of iterations for each algorithm and the number of a total round of execution in order. N is the number of search agents, and C IMO is the cost time of modifying the position of one ion of IMO, and C PSO is the cost time of modifying the position of one search agent of PSO.The experimental results of measuring the performance of FLAT based on the improved IMO algorithm against other algorithms in the literature work will be presented in this section. Two experimental tests are performed to evaluate the performance of FLAT based on the improved (IMO-PSO). The first test measure different metrics for the performance of FLAT, such as the quality of solutions represented as average LCCS founded, the success rate of finding 75 % of real LCCS, and statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test [50] . The second test for finding the LCCS for COVID-19 virus against the protein of other viruses using FLAT based on the improved IMO (IMO-PSO) relative to the real LCCS founded by the SW algorithm.The performance of the IMO-PSO algorithm in the two tests is compared with standard IMO [27] , SCA [19] , ASCA-PSO [18] , IMOG [32] , and DIMO [35] . All the settings of parameters of algorithms as listed in Table 1 . In this study, ASCA-PSO [18] , SCA [19] , IMOG [32] , and [35] are used in our comparison.The number of iterations was 30 iterations for all algorithms except IMO-PSO; the number of iteration for each algorithm was 10, and the two algorithms repeated 5 times. The fragment length was 30. The number of individual runs is 20; the number of search agents was assigned to the length of each sequence as listed in Table 2 . Inertia Coefficient 0.2 Local coefficient (C1) ‫‬ 0.5 Global coefficient (C2) 0.52.0Various measurement criteria are used to evaluate the performance of FLAT are described in the following:  The average of LCCS: the average of the length of the common substring that is found for all runs of the algorithm and for each range of sequence product lengths. The success of rate: It is the number of runs that found 75 % of the real length of common subsequence (LCCS founded by the SW algorithm) divided by the total number of runs. The execution time: it is the execution time of FLAT using different algorithms for each range of products of sequence lengths.For testing the performance of FLAT for measuring the percentage of LCCS founded relative to one founded by the SW algorithm, real biological protein sequences datasets that are used are gathered from GenBank of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). FLAT has a pair of sequences as input, so each pair of gathered sequences have approximately equal lengths and have common consecutive subsequences founded by SW alignment algorithm. The sequences are divided at 16 ranges based on the product of pair sequence lengths, and the levels range from 250,000 to 9,000,000 to measure the performance over different lengths of sequences. Table 2 proposes the results of testing the average percentage of LCCS founded by FLAT based on the improved IMO (IMO-PSO) algorithm versus other algorithms relative to the real LCCS founded by the SW algorithm. In this test, each pair of sequences of the datasets are aligned using to measure the length of LCCS between it using the SW algorithm. Then the FLAT based on different metaheuristic algorithms is executed to measure the LCCS founded, and the percentage of it relative to the ones J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof founded by the SW algorithm is presented in Table 2 . Then the quality of solution criteria for FLAT is represented by what is the percentage of the length of real LCCS founded by any metaheuristic algorithm. In the first and second columns of Table 2 are the length of sequences product and the corresponding search agents (population) of each metaheuristic algorithm that was used. As the length of sequences increasing, the search space increasing hence the search of agents increasing to substitute the increasing of the span of search space. IMO, SCA and DIMO have the same results approximately, and the lowest percentages LCCS founded in comparison with other algorithms. DIMO cannot produce an enhancement of IMO in FLAT that guarantee the theorem of NFL [28] where no algorithm cannot solve all engineering problem with the same efficiency. IMOG produces little enhancement of IMO for analyzing FLAT on biological sequences. ASCA-PSO algorithm was produced the highest percentage of LCCS using FLAT with an average percentage of 83 % overall lengths; however, IMO-PSO has a percentage of 93.5%, which proves the superiority of IMO-PSO overall algorithms. The second criterion was measured to guarantee the performance of IMO-PSO versus other algorithms is the success rate of finding LCCS but with at least 75 % of the real LCCS founded by the SW algorithm. As shown in Table 3 , SCA, IMO, and DIMO produced the lowest poor success rate with DIMO has zero values in some test which mean no one result of the 20 independent runs achieve 75% of the real length founded by SW algorithm. IMOG produces a success rate better than IMO but not efficient like ASCA-PSO. IMO-PSO produced the highest success rate versus all other algorithms, which implies the superiority of it. For the statistical analysis of the results, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test [50] , (a nonparametric test detailing of t-test for two independent groups) was performed on the 20 independent runs of algorithms. Table 4 shows the results of the statistical analysis between standard IMO and each other algorithm. As shown, the p-value of comparing IMO with IMO-PSO and ASCA-PSO has the best results over other algorithms (SCA, IMOG, and DIMO). Figure 6 presents a comparison of the execution time of the SW algorithm, improved IMO, and ASCA-PSO for performing the alignment over various length products of pair of sequences and FLAT based on. As shown in the figure, FLAT save huge execution time in comparison with others but improved IMO consumes little time more ASCA-PSO for long sequences. The incensement comes from serial execution of IMO and PSO but provides better performance for finding LCCS approximately 93.5 % of the real one, and this is the main advantage of improved IMO. FLAT was tested for finding the LCCS between the orf1ab poly-protein of COVID-19 and other viruses protein sequences such as Alveolar Proteinosis, Human Immunodeficiency, Hepatitis C, Influenza A, Influenza B, and Trachea Infections. The real LCCS that was founded by the SW algorithm is used as the reference to measure the FLAT performance.The protein data of viruses were gathered from GenBank of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The protein ID of the virus was used in the test as Table 6 shows the result of finding LCCS between COVID-19 and other diseases using FLAT based on the improved IMO algorithm versus standard IMO, standard SCA, DIMO, IMOG, and ASCA-PSO algorithm besides, SW algorithm was used to find the real LCCS. The score column in the table represents the length of LCCS founded and also denotes the number of similar residues. As shown in Table 6 , the IMO-PSO algorithm succeeded in locating the real LCCS but part of it in all tests; however, the ASCA-PSO algorithm locates it three times only. However, other algorithms cannot determine the real LCCS located by the SW algorithm; it finds common subsequences with small length. Table 7 shows the test results of using FLAT to analyze the surface glycoprotein of COVID-19 with other different surface glycoproteins with ID as in the table. Here, the pair of sequences have many common consecutive subsequences, and the LCCS has a length no more than 5 residues, so the challenge is finding the real LCCS from many ones common but with lower length. IMO-PSO algorithm succeeded in enhancing the performance of FLAT to locate the real LCCS as produced by the SW algorithm, and the ASCA-PSO algorithm locates it in most test cases.These tests show the superiority of the improved IMO algorithm to enhance FLAT and its ability in a biological application where COVID-19 was tested as a case study, and the application can be developed to not locate only one feature (LCCS) but more than ones. However, the idea is proposing the application of FLAT with efficient results in an acceptable time.The main advantages of implementing FLAT based on the improved IMO (IMO-PSO) algorithm are listed as in the following :1. The synergy between exploration of IMO and exploitation of PSO aids efficiently for solving the problems with huge search space such as FLAT.2. It produces a better quality of solutions by finding real LCCS with a percentage of 93.5% over various sequences lengths with the highest success of rate for finding 75% of the length of real LCCS in comparisons with other algorithms.However, the limitation of FLAT based on the IMO-PSO algorithm is consuming more execution time more than that of other algorithms for aligning sequences with huge length since the serial execution of IMO and PSO algorithms. However, its execution time still reasonable in comparison with the time of the SW algorithm.This paper proposed enhancement for FLAT based on novel hybrid optimization of IMO and PSO algorithms. The key to hybridization is using the exploration of the IMO and then mapping solutions to PSO to exploit it and then mapping solutions to IMO, and this process is repeated for some iterations. To guarantee the efficiency of FLAT based on the IMO-PSO algorithm, it was tested to measure the LCCS between biological sequences gathered at various levels of lengths.

As a result, the majority of evidence to date reflects disease progression, hospitalization rates, and deaths among cases in more developed and higher transmission settings across Europe, North America (CDC COVID-19Response Team 2020), and Asia (Chen et al. 2020; Guan et al. 2020) . While absolute case and death counts are lower in SSA, individual countries are reporting high case fatality ratios (CFRs) and available information warrants investigation into mortality reduction strategies. It has been hypothesized that the SSA region is vulnerable to high rates of COVID-19 deaths given limited healthcare capacity to manage critical cases and poor detection leading to delayed care-seeking (Africa Center for Strategic Studies; Gilbert et al. 2020; Skrip et al. 2020) .Across SSA, healthcare-related resource constraints range from inadequate supplies of medical equipment to low per capita capacity for isolation and treatment. A recent report estimated that the entire African continent has 1% of the ventilator capacity of the United States (Maclean and Marks 2020) .Furthermore, countries have reported between one and 36 hospital beds per 10,000 capita (World Health Organization). These constraints have been at odds with policies to quarantine presumptive cases in precautionary isolation centers (allAfrica 2020a (allAfrica , 2020b or isolate all positive cases in dedicated hospitals as a control strategy (World Health Organization 2020c). Moreover, messaging around the lack of effective treatment for COVID-19 or unavailability of resources may be deterring early care-seeking among individuals who develop symptoms and could benefit from supportive care. Given systemic vulnerabilities in health system capacity, it is critical to investigate and invest in lower cost and readily scalable interventions, including some already with precedent for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with respiratory and/or viral infections. Notably, oxygen therapy (Geiling et al. 2014 ) and use of bloodrelated therapies (Office of the Commissioner 2020) hold potential for not only managing COVID-19 cases but also treating other conditions prevalent or emerging in LMICs.Burkina Faso was among the first countries in SSA to report COVID-19 cases. The first case of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso was confirmed on March 9, 2020. Since then, several containment measures have been adopted by the government of Burkina Faso, including social distancing, closure of airports and land borders, quarantine of the affected cities and the mandatory use of masks ( Figure 1 ). Such efforts may be suppressing transmission, yet the country is reporting among the highest numbers of deaths regionally.COVID-19 cases in Africa currently comprise approximately 1% of the reported global burden (World Health Organization 2020a). Low levels of detection, partially due to insufficient testing capacity and laboratory supplies, and the lack of published data from individual African countries challenge understanding of the true scale of infection as well as study of potential risk factors and intervention approaches (Skrip et al. 2020 ). Here we seek to leverage existing, yet minimal, data and generate insight into the impact of potentially lower cost and more logistically feasible approaches to case management in the LMIC context, where care-seeking may be affected by the perceived lack of treatment options. We provide an overview of demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases across SSA overall and in Burkina Faso specifically. Trends in mode of detection and care-seeking among all cases were compared to trends among cases who ultimately died of the disease. Mitigation strategies to prevent excess mortality while also preparing for future treatment opportunities such as the use of blood-related products, were investigated through statistical analysis of a synthetic case population matched to demographic and clinical characteristics of cases in West Africa.Data. Data from publicly available sources were line-listed to assess epidemiological and clinical characteristics of deceased COVID-19 cases across the entire SSA region. Specifically, data on sex, age, underlying conditions, and mode of detection were identified for deceased cases as previously done for a line list being curated for all cases in SSA (Skrip et al. 2020 ). Additionally, data on age, sex, and time in hospital were recorded for 49 deceased cases reported as of May 10, 2020 and 163 hospitalized cases reported as of April 15, 2020, from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Age distributions between hospitalized and deceased cases were compared using a chi-squared test.Data simulation and statistical analysis. We generated a synthetic case study population of individual COVID-19 cases using multinomial distribution sampling (Ikeda et al. 2011; Bai et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2017) .Specifically, for a fixed stratum n and a vector of proportions π=(π1,π2,…,πk), we sampled X ∼ Mult (n, π) to attain a sample representative of characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity, disease outcome) in the population. The base uninfected population was randomly drawn using demographics as reported by census data to account for age and gender strata in Burkina Faso (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2015). Age-adjusted distributions of non-communicable diseases (i.e., hypertension and diabetes) in West African populations were used to randomly assign underlying conditions to individuals (Agaba et al. 2017; Soubeiga et al. 2017 ). In the absence of age data for all confirmed cases in Burkina Faso, COVID-19 infection was randomly assigned to individuals following the age-binned distribution of cases in Senegal (Ministère de la Santé et de l'Action sociale 2020) assuming that the infection dynamics in the two countries are similar. Age distributions of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality rates were based on data from the CHU in Burkina Faso. Hospitalization and mortality rates in younger and elderly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ages were assumed to vary 100% and 50%, respectively, to address uncertainty in measurement and propagate it using non-linear combinations estimates of errors.To evaluate COVID-19 case fatality rates in the absence of oxygen therapy, we used adjusted odds ratios as increased risk of death by hypoxia (hypoxia is defined with a cut-off for oxygen saturation rate SpO2 < 90%) in patients of Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (Lazzerini et al. 2015 ) and brain injury (Seo et al. 2019 ) to simulate a binomial distribution of oxygen treatment and non-treatment as described in the contingency Table (Supplementary Table 1 ).To consider COVID-19 case fatality rates reduction in the presence of convalescent plasma therapy, we simulated a convalescent plasma treatment study in our hypothetical inpatient population. Given the current lack of data on anti-COVID-19 convalescent plasma treatment, we assumed an absolute risk difference in mortality of 10.5% between treatment and non-treatment groups considering that convalescent plasma during the present COVID-19 pandemic is two-fold less likely to reduce mortality than convalescent plasma did during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (21% [95% CI, 15% to 27%] in (Luke et al. 2006) ). Sample sizes distribution to meet a 10.5% risk difference in mortality between groups is described in Supplementary Table 1 and hospitalized patients were randomly assigned to the groups.Associations between the odds of survival and patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity), convalescent plasma treatment, and health care capacity (oxygen-therapy) on COVID-19 mortality were estimated using logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratio for survival among cases receiving intervention (oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma) versus those not receiving the intervention were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Ethics statement. All data presented here were derived from publicly available sources or provided by CHU as part of the national epidemic response program. The data from CHU were reported in aggregate, as frequency distributions across 10-year age bins, by sex, or length-of-stay in hospitals. The study was therefore not subject to review by an ethics board.Data description. As of May 10, 2020, 976 deaths had been reported out of the 39,104 confirmed COVID-19 cases across 48 countries in the SSA region (regional CFR: 2.5%).(World Health Organization 2020a) Line-listed, country-reported data on age and/or sex were available for 75 and 103 deceased cases, respectively. Deceased cases were majority male (63/103, 61.2%) and a median 62 years old (range: 28 days -89 years) ( Figure 2 ). Over 78% of deaths were reported among individuals aged 50 years or older (59/75, 78.7%). For those cases with information available, the majority of deaths were among individuals who self-presented to facilities or were tested post-mortem (20/30, 66.7%), rather than among cases who were being followed as part of active monitoring initiatives.In Burkina Faso specifically, 49 deaths occurred among 751 detected cases, as of May 10. With the exception of sex, which was reported for all 49 deceased cases, data for analysis were available for 163 hospitalized cases and 33 deaths through April 15, 2020. The majority of deceased cases were male (28/49, 57.1%) and nearly all deaths occurred among individuals aged 50 and above (30/33, 90.9%) ( Figure   2 ). Underlying conditions were prevalent among deceased cases. Nearly half had a history of hypertension (15/33, 45.5%); diabetes (7/33, 21.2%), or other cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions, such as stroke, embolism or cardiopathy (3/33, 9.1%).Oxygen therapy was most frequently used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 cases before their deaths (27/33, 81.8%) ( Figure 3A) . Pulsometer values indicate that at time of death, 90% of clinical cases presented with a median oxygen level of 61 (IQR, 45-82) which is below normal value of 90. Clinical treatment also routinely included administration of antimicrobials (Ceftriaxone, Chloroquine, Azithromycin) and fever-reducers (paracetamol). Only two (2/33, 6.1%) critical patients were intubated before their deaths.Prior to death, the majority of individuals either did not seek care or were hospitalized for only a short duration: 21.9% (7/32) of cases hospitalized for less than one day or not at all, and 37.5% (12/32) and 15.6% (5/32) hospitalized for one or two days, respectively, before death ( Figure 3B inpatient treatment-seeking and death were associated with increasing age. Disruption of oxygen therapy was found to approximately double the case fatality rates across age groups. Introduction of convalescent plasma therapy was associated with reduced COVID-19 case fatality rates irrespective of age ( Figure 5 ). In our case population of 831 individuals, the mortality risk difference for those on treatment with convalescent plasma versus those not on treatment was 10.5% [95% CI, -4% to 25%]).Regression results on the impact of individual factors (age, gender, comorbidities), oxygen disruption, and treatment (convalescent plasma) on case fatality rates are shown in Table 1 . Age over 50 (AOR = 5.15, 95% CI: 3.34-8.17, p<0.001) was associated with significantly increased odds of mortality in the adjusted analysis. No significant association was found for presence of comorbidity (AOR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.77-1.53) or female sex (AOR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69-1.37) in the adjusted analysis. The odds of mortality among COVID-19 cases not treated with oxygen therapy was 2.07 times the odds among cases receiving oxygen therapy (95% CI: 1.56-2.75, p<0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, and presence of underlying comorbid conditions. convalescent plasma was found to be significantly (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.24-0.93, p=0.038) associated with reduction in mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities.Here we present data from a retrospective analysis of clinical and demographic characteristics of deceased COVID-19 cases in SSA. Deaths in the region were more frequently among individuals who self-reported or were tested postmortem compared to among cases identified through active monitoring. This ratio is notably different than that previously identified (Skrip et al. 2020) for the ratio of overall case detection, which was heavily skewed towards detection via active monitoring among all reported cases.Deceased cases in Burkina Faso tended to be older with a higher proportion male, relative to all COVID-19 cases hospitalized for treatment. The data further suggests late or no care-seeking among the most severe cases that result in death. This is consistent with observations in other SSA countries. In Liberia, for instance, 11 of 18 reported deaths as of May 10 occurred in communities and only one occurred in a designated COVID-19 facility. 26 Nigeria has also reported clusters of deaths among individuals who were not suspected of the disease (Daily Trust 2020a, 2020b) suggesting that health seeking and access to care are relevant for reducing COVID-19 mortality.Importantly, the data from Burkina Faso indicate that early detection, oxygen therapy as well as effective treatments are important to mitigating disease progression and preventing mortality. Using a synthetic case study population matched to data from West Africa, we demonstrate the potential effects of appropriate oxygen therapy and convalescent plasma in reducing odds of death among COVID-19 cases.Preliminary evidence has suggested that blood-related products, such as convalescent plasma, may attenuate COVID-19 disease severity or duration. 29 Convalescent plasma was widely used in previous viral outbreaks (Cheng et al. 2005; Luke et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2017 ) and the mechanism underlying its effectiveness is well described (Shakir et al. 2010; Rojas et al. 2020) . For instance, during the 1918 pandemic of Spanish Flu, patients who received convalescent plasma therapy saw a reduced mortality rate, despite treatments being given to more severely ill patients (Luke et al. 2006) . Similar results have been estimated for H1N1 flu treatment in smaller studies (Hung et al. 2011) . Furthermore, the use of convalescent plasma as treatment in LMIC settings has precedent from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where mobile laboratories were used for the apheresis process (Brown et al. 2017 ).Of note, our investigation on convalescent plasma was implemented to reflect the range of uncertainty of its effect size (mortality risk difference of 10.5%, 95% CI: -4% to 25%) as observed in studies addressing convalescent plasma's effectiveness against the Spanish flu. It is important to emphasize that our choice to implement a 10.5% relative risk reduction in mortality with a wide confidence interval was guided by uncertainty around the effect of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19. Robust data from randomized control trials will allow for better quantification of convalescent plasma effectiveness (i.e. a significant reduction in mortality with less uncertainty is) and for informing treatment policies by providing clearer evidence of any risks versus benefits. In parallel to studies investigating clinical effectiveness, proactive efforts are needed for minimizing logistical barriers to implementation (Roback J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and Guarner 2020) if recommendations around the use of convalescent plasma were adopted. Such efforts might include enhancing blood bank capacity around freezing, storage, and donor recruitment to increase supply, and equipping additional sites with transfusion needs to broaden the reach of the intervention and monitor safety (Leider et al. 2010; Roback and Guarner 2020) . Lessons learned on practical challenges can be drawn from LMIC-based clinical trials during the Ebola outbreak (Brown et al. 2017 ).The results presented here are based on parameters informed by the use of oxygen and convalescent plasma on other respiratory diseases (2018 Spanish Flu) and hypoxia (respiratory and brain injury) disease, respectively, such that our findings should be interpreted with caution and revisited as empirical data from the clinical treatments provided to COVID-19 patients becomes increasingly available. Despite the evidence limitations and practical considerations around implementation, highlighting and evaluating low-cost, potentially scalable approaches for clinical management is critical to lower the CFR and to encourage timely care-seeking. This is particularly important in settings with significant undetected community transmission, so that individuals who develop COVID-like symptoms seek care early and are not deterred by the notion that the disease has no cure.When considering clinical interventions, it is important to recognize that availability alone is not adequate to ensure proper clinical care. Reports on oxygen availability in LMICs have indicated that use is common but heterogeneous (Zhu 2020) , with greater availability in more urban environments and at higher levels of care due to reduced access to pulse oximetry in more rural settings and at lower levels of care (PATH 2018a (PATH , 2018b (PATH , 2018c . In addition to requiring the necessary equipment, patients and caregivers must be willing to accept and administer the care respectively, which has been observed as a barrier (Dauncey et al. 2019) such as due to perceived cost and lack of familiarity with the equipment which will need to be addressed during the COVID care response. This is concerning because if patients are escalated to higher levels, this introduces delays in care, and means that they will bring COVID with them to the hospital populations. In parallel to building treatment capacity, risk communication and community engagement (Bedson et al. 2019) will be essential to increasing awareness of its availability and affordability, so that people will actually seek care promptly. Critical cases who delay care-seeking would likely arrive too late for oxygen or other interventions to have much effect.If oxygen therapy can reduce the rate of severe disease, and convalescent plasma can reduce progression and mortality, it may be possible to substantially reduce the impact of COVID (Xie et al. 2020 ) without the need for critical care and respirators, which are more difficult to rapidly scale up capacity for than these treatments would likely be. Expanding access to oxygen treatment not only benefits COVID patients, but would likely also have long-term impact on child mortality due to pneumonia or all causes (Hansmann et al. 2017 ); literature has shown risk reductions of about 20-60% in small-scale studies in LMIC (Graham et al. 2017) . Investment in capacity and protocols for use could have significant and long-term implications on overall disease burden.We provide the first study of data from deceased COVID-19 cases in the sub-Saharan Africa region. While absolute counts in SSA are considerably lower than in other regions globally, low-cost and readily scalable case management approaches remain important to reducing mortality due to COVID-19 in resourceconstrained settings. Investing in capacity for oxygen therapy administration and apheresis, along with research infrastructure to assess effectiveness, could not only improve outcomes during the pandemic response but also have long-term implications for health systems. .

The case ofAlgeria, Russia, USA and Italy is studied. We end the paper by a conclusion.Here we review some of the important properties of wavelets, without any attempt at being complete. What makes this transform special is that the set of basis functions, known as wavelets, are chosen to be well-localized (have compact support) both in space and frequency (Arneodo and Bacry, 1995) . Thus, one has some kind of ""dual-localization"" of the wavelets.This contrasts the situation met for the Fourier Transform where one only has ""monolocalization"", meaning that localization in both position and frequency simultaneously is not possible.The CWT of a function s(z) is given by Grossmann and Morlet (1985) as:Each family test function is derived from a single function ) (z ψ defined to as the analyzing wavelet according to [19] :Where a * + ∈ R is a scale parameter, b R ∈ is the translation and ψ * is the complex conjugate of ψ.

Globally, 10,185,374 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed and 503,862 deaths translating to a 4.95 percent case fatality rate were reported as at June 30, 2020 [2] . As at the stated time, Africa regions had reported the lowest number of confirmed cases, case fatality and deaths -297 290 cases, 2.02% and 6 010 deaths respectively [2] . Cases continue to increase and in Asia and Europe, a second wave is beginning to emerge [3] [4] [5] . Health systems are expected to adapt to maintain the routine essential health services in addition to managing an increasing COVID-19 case-load.Public health emergencies have shown that the impact of an epidemic on reproductive, maternal and newborn health, domestic and gender-based violence and mental health often goes unrecognized, because the effects are often not the direct result of the infection, but instead the indirect consequences of strained health care systems, disruptions in care and redirected resources [6] [7] [8] . As noted by the World Health Organization (WHO), ""People, efforts, and medical supplies all shift to respond to the emergency. This often leads to the neglect of basic and regular essential health services. People with health problems unrelated to the epidemic find it harder to get access to health care services [9] ."" To avert indirect morbidity and mortality when services are disrupted, WHO developed and updated guidelines to support country preparedness and response plan [10] . These included prioritization and continuation of context-relevant essential health services during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and community-based health care, including outreach and campaigns, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of June 2020 [11, 12] . Among the high-priority categories of essential health services by WHO included -essential prevention and treatment services for communicable diseases, including immunizations; services related to reproductive health, including during pregnancy and childbirth; and provision of medications, supplies and support from health care workers for the ongoing management of chronic diseases, including mental health conditions [6] .Governments around the world have had to quickly adapt and respond to curb transmission of the virus and to provide care for the many who have been infected. National mandates to contain the pandemic, such as complete or total lockdowns, curfews, and temporal closure of non-essential services (elective survey, cancer treatment etc), the resultant economic slowdowns have adverse effects on accessing, utilising and provision of RMNCAH services especially for low and middle income countries [6] . Evidence from the 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus in west Africa showed that the indirect effects of the outbreak were more severe than the outbreak itself [13] . In Sierra Leone, maternal and newborn care service utilization decreased due to disrupted health services and fear of seeking treatment during the outbreak related to fear of contracting Ebola virus at health facilities, distrust of the health system, and rumours about the source of the disease [14] . There were reductions in antenatal care coverage by 22 percent, family planning (6 percent), facility births (8 percent), and postnatal care (13 percent) [15] contributing to an estimated 3,600 maternal deaths, neonatal deaths and stillbirths-almost similar to the deaths (about 4,000) directly caused by the Ebola virus in the country [15] . Elsewhere, there were sharp reduction in contraceptive use and family planning visits in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone due to the Ebola outbreak [16, 17] . As a result, policy makers must consider not only the immediate health effects of the pandemic but also the indirect effects of the pandemic and rapidly develop strategies to mitigate these.Statistical models in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted a reduction in the overall utilization of reproductive, maternal and newborn health services with related adverse mortality outcomes across the globe [18, 19] . For instance, a reduction in coverage of essential maternal health interventions by 9.8 -51.9% would result in 8.3 -38.6% increase in maternal deaths per month [18] . Consequently, a 10% decline in use of short-and long-acting reversible contraceptives would result in 48,558,000 additional women with an unmet need for modern contraceptives and 15,401,000 additional unintended pregnancies [19] . The objective of this study was to determine the initial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on RMNCAH services in Kenya in the first four months of the pandemic by comparing RMNCAH Kenya Health Information System (KHIS) utilization data for 2019 and 2020.This was a crosssectional design comparing RMNCAH utilization data for Kenya extracted from the national KHIS, formerly known as the district health information system version 2 (DHIS2), an open-access publicly available reporting platform managed by the Ministry of Health (MOH). This design was used as it helps to describe the status, any changes or relationships in a phenomena over a fixed point in time [20] . Four-month period from March to June 2020 was assessed for any trends in the utilization of pregnancy and antenatal care, facility/skilled childbirths, family planning, postabortion care and immunization services. This data was compared to the equivalent period in 2019, a year before the COVID-19 pandemic, to demonstrate any significant changes in the utilization and outcomes of these services during the COVID-19 outbreak.Kenya is a low-and middle-income country in the sub-Saharan Africa located in the East Africa region. It is geographically divided into 47 counties/county governments. Overall, the national government is mandated with policy and guidelines development while the county governments are mandated to support the implementation of the national policies and guidelines.Kenya reported its first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020. The government advanced preparedness, readiness and preventive measures for COVID-19 pandemic as well as to address the emerging effects of COVID-19 on the health and economy. Key measures are summarized below and the periods of enforcement against number of cases and deaths are presented in Figure 1 .-March 2020: start of mandatory quarantine; testing of persons in quarantine; contact tracing, quarantine and testing of exposed cases; daily briefings by the MOH on the state and progress of COVID-19 since the first case; public awareness on COVID-19 through television, radio and print media (briefings and awareness communication ongoing at the time of writing). -April 2020: start of countrywide dawn-to-dusk curfews; partial lockdowns/restrictions of movement in and out of priority high-risk counties of Nairobi . In addition, a total of 6,190 confirmed cases with 144 deaths (a 2.3% case fatality rate) were reported [2] .Data on RMNCAH service utilization variables of interest were extracted from the KHIS to Microsoft Excel 2016 for processing and cleaning. The variables of interest were antenatal care attendance (new and revisits; adolescent pregnancies), skilled birthstotal births and caesarean section rates, family planning services uptake by age and method, immunization and post-abortion care services accessed. Relevant rates/proportions were computed. Cleaned data was exported to STATA v12 (StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) for analysis. Pairwise comparison for means using paired t-tests were performed to compare the mean difference in monthly and period attendance counts between the two years (2019 considered pre-and 2020 peri-COVID-19 pandemic period). Two-sample test of proportions were computed to compare the hospital RMNCAH services utilisation and maternal and perinatal outcomes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. P -values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the outcome measures in March to June 2019 compared to March to June 2020. When a statistically significant difference was identified, the null hypothesis was rejected.No institutional research and ethics review was sought because KHIS data is deidentified open-source and publicly available. Also the use of aggregate data is not human subject research as defined by the World Medical Association's declaration of Helsinki [22, 23] .There were no significant changes in the mean total hospital attendance per month for antenatal care, hospital skilled births, family planning, post-abortion care and immunization services during a 4month period (March -June 2019) pre-COVID-19 compared with during the equivalent 4-month period peri-COVID-19 pandemic (P>0.05). Even though the changes were not statistically significant, there were reductions in the attendance for antenatal care and immunization services with increments in hospital births, family planning and post-abortion care services (Table 1) .There was a significant reduction in the proportion of adolescents presenting with pregnancy among 10 -14 years and 15 -19 years from 0.4% to 0.3% (p<0.0001) and 8.4% to 7.0% (p<0.0001) respectively from the pre-COVID-19 to the peri-COVID-19 period. Similar reduction trends were observed for revisiting clients for antenatal care services (69.8% to 67.9%, p<0.0001) and clients completing four antenatal care visits at the health facilities (18.6% to 17.0%, p<0.0001). Interestingly, there was a significant increase in the new clients seeking antenatal care services at the health facilities during similar periods (30.2% to 32.1%, p<0.0001) but also a significant decrease in ANC revisits (69.8% to 67.9%, p<0.001) although climbing up to March 2019 and March 2020 levels ( Table 2 and Figure 1 ).Despite the reduction in proportions of adolescent pregnancy for both the 10 -14 and 15 -19 years groups, monthly trends showed a steady rise in numbers of pregnancy in the 15 -19 years group during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID period with a flat curve observed in the 10 -14 years group during similar periods ( Table 2 and Table 3 ).The mean monthly skilled birth attendance rate increased significantly from 68.5% (SD±2.0) to 79.7% (SD±1.2) from the 4-month pre-COVID-19 to peri-COVID-19 period (p<0.0001). Mean caesarean section births increased significantly from 14,385.3 (SD±689.9) to 15,703.8 (SD±496.8) (p = 0.021) with the overall caesarean section rate increasing significantly from 14.6% to 15.8% (p<0.0001) during the same periods (Table 2 ). Comparing the trends for caesarean section rates, there was a steady increase across the peri-COVID-19 period beyond the 10-15% recommended by WHO compared with the pre-COVID rates that were within the WHO recommendations (Fig 3) .There was a significant increase in the proportion of clients revisiting the hospitals for FP services from 53.0% to 56.6% (P<0.0001) from the pre-COVID-19 to the peri-COVID-19 period. In contrast, a significant reduction was reported in the new clients seeking FP services from 47.0% to 43.3% (P<0.0001). The proportion of adolescents 10 -19 years seeking post-abortion care services reduced significantly from 21.8% to 18.6% while the women seeking the same services increased from 72.8% to 81.4% from the pre-to peri-COVID-19 period (p<0.0001).Comparing FP services utilisation by age, there was a significant increase in proportion among adolescents 10 -14 years (0.5% to 0.6%) and youths 20 -24 years (18.3% to 19.6%) seeking the FP services in the health facilities (p<0.0001). Comparing by method, injectable FP method was the most utilised both pre-and peri-COVID-19 periods. There were significant increases in the proportion of clients utilising injectable FP methods (58.2% to 62.3%) and combined oral contraceptive pills (13.6% to 14.0%) during similar periods (p<0.0001). In contrast, there were significant reductions in the proportions of clients utilising emergency contraceptive pills (1.7% to 1.6%), intrauterine devices (5.9% to 4.2%) and implants (16.5% to 13.0%) during the same periods (p<0.0001) ( Table 2) . Comparing trends over different data points, there was a steady rise in adolescents 15 -19 years and overall 10 -19 years utilising FP services across all the 4-months peri-COVID-19 period (Table 3) . the same period, there was a significant increase in the proportion of fresh stillbirths from 0.9% to 1.0% (P = 0.0066). However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of neonatal deaths from 1.1% to 1.0% (P<0.0001) with no changes in the proportions for macerated stillbirths during the two periods (Table 2) . Like for trends across the months for the other indicators, there was a steady rise in fresh stillbirths, macerated stillbirths and adolescent maternal deaths during the four peri-COVID-19 months.This study has demonstrated the overall impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilisation and maternal and perinatal outcomes during the first four months, when strict measures were in place to limit community spread in a lowand middle-income setting.Overall, there was no significant change in the mean total hospital attendance for all the RMNCAH servicesantenatal care, skilled birth, family planning, post-abortion care and immunization services during the 4-month peri-COVID-19 period as per the earlier global predictions [18, 19] . However, the trends across the services showed a dip in April 2020 before eventually rising in May and June reaching and/or even surpassing the 4-month pre-COVID-19 period. This could be attributed to a well-coordinated and centralised risk communication strategy by the government first by decreeing that health services were critical essential services to be accessed by all. Secondly, the centralised communication campaigns through daily ministerial briefings (through radio and television) and other social media platforms helped to dispel any fears from the public in seeking hospital care for the critical essential services. Experts including the WHO, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and UNICEF recommend that risk communication is a critical component of the response to COVID-19 as is with other epidemics [24, 25] . Such communication helps the public make the right decisions about how to protect themselves, when to seek care, and to avoid contributing to panic about the disease and its effects. This approach manages the 'infodemic' (an excess of information that makes it hard to know what's trustworthy and what's not) and maintains trust in public health authorities that is critical to any ongoing management of the outbreak [24] .There was a general reduction in new ANC clients, the uptake of long-term family planning methods and an increase in the short-term contraceptive utilization during the peri-COVID-19 period. It appears like current FP users were more motivated to continue using compared with never-users in the initial months of the pandemic. Evidence suggests that first discussion with a health care provider is a key determinant for uptake of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods among women of reproductive age [26] [27] [28] . The injectable contraception was the most prevalent FP method used during the peri-COVID-19 period. Besides, this method had the highest increase in uptake during the period. Injectable and other short acting family planning methods remain the most dominant among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa [29, 30] . Women prefer this method as it is considered private: no one else can tell that a woman is using contraception [31] . Evidence from 33 sub-Saharan countries showed that young women (15-24 years) prefer short-term methods obtained from limitedcapacity, private providers, compared with older women. Besides, the use of long-term methods among young women is low, but among those users, more than 85 percent receive the service from a public sector source [32] .An interesting situation was seen with adolescents accessing RH/MNH services: there were more adolescent pregnancies, increased uptake of FP services, reduced uptake of PAC services but increased adolescent maternal deaths. Closure of schools could have a part to play in this trend as majority of this age group is school going and therefore kept engaged with the rigorous education routines that have been suspended. A research conducted by Plan International in nine counties of Kenya in 2019 showed that 98 percent of pregnant girls were not in school, and 59 percent of the pregnancies among girls aged 15-19 years were unintended. Furthermore, 45 percent of severe abortion complications were also reported among adolescent girls [34] . Evidence shows that pregnancy before the age of 18 years increases the health risks for the mother and her baby [35] . Clearly the effect of increased FP uptake amongst adolescents in terms of health outcomes will not be visible in the short term but further investigation of adolescent maternal deaths recorded during this period is required to understand the underlying causes of deaths, associated and contributing factors related to these deaths. This is more so because the there was a significant reduction of maternal deaths in women aged 20 and above compared to adolescents in the same period. This is critical to ensuring that the predicted additional maternal deaths are avoided during this pandemic and during similar outbreaks in future.The caesarean section rates in the peri-COVID-19 period are steadily rising beyond the WHO recommendation of not more than 10-15 percent as rates higher than 10 percent are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates [36] . The rising caesarean section rates are consistent with evidence from a systematic review among women who had COVID-19 [37] . According to WHO, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and Kenya MOH COVID-19 guidelines, COVID-19 infection is not an indication for caesarean section and therefore the rising rate of caesarean section needs to be monitored and investigated [25, 38, 39] . It would be expected that this rise should translate to a reduction in the fresh stillbirths in the facilities. However, there is an unexpected rise in the fresh stillbirths which could reflect falling standards of quality of care during labor and childbirths in the health facilities during the pandemic. Dawn-to-dusk curfews, related fear to police enforcers of the curfews (leading to interrupted transport and support systems) and lockdowns presented a worrying period for pregnant women disrupting access to antenatal and skilled birth services [40] . This could easily lead to delays in accessing skilled health services further complicating pregnancies/labor which could have contributed to the rise in stillbirths in the country. Consequently, evidence from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania showed that worries among midwives in provision of essential health care services due to poor infrastructure, lack of/inadequate personal protective equipment and fear of contracting the disease could have contributed to the worsened trend for stillbirths in the country [40] [41] [42] . The exact nature of the delays experience by women when they reach health facilities needs further investigation, this could potentially include but not limited to delays in providing care due to reduced number of health workers, poor preparedness of facilities to operate during the pandemic, and increased frequency of disrespectful maternity care [43, 44] .Our study has strengths and limitations. The use of a comparison period enabled testing the hypothesis on whether the COVID-19 pandemic had any impact on the utilization of RMNCAH services and maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, the use of DHIS2 data poses key data quality challenges including inaccurate and incomplete reporting that are prevalent in low and middle-income countries [47] [48] [49] [50] . The short period reviewed during the peri-COVID-19 pandemic represents the period when the burden of the pandemic was not at the peak in the country compared to the transmission trends as experienced in other European and American countries at similar periods and therefore the results should be interpreted in context. Further evaluations at 6 and 12 months may be required to validate the outcomes.Based on the earlier models, the predictions in reduction of access and utilization of essential RMNCAH services and worsening maternal and perinatal mortality did not hold at four months. The concerted efforts by the government in managing the communication and messaging during the pandemic played a key difference although further evaluations may be required to clearly assess the impact of the pandemic on RMNCAH services and maternal and perinatal outcomes.Findings demonstrate that the earlier gains achieved in family planning, pregnancy and skilled child births and adolescent sexual and reproductive health are likely to be watered down by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rising caesarean sections with no improvement in maternal and perinatal outcomes require further monitoring and investigation. While the overall picture for maternal mortality ratio is reassuring, a significant increase in maternal deaths amongst adolescents is of concern. If unchecked, there is a likelihood of worsening of adolescent maternal deaths and stillbirths. Further research urgently needed to understand the reasons for increased adolescent maternal mortality, reduced uptake of long-term FP methods, and increased still birth rate. This will be critical to developing policies and interventions to prevent additional maternal deaths during this pandemic and in future infectious disease outbreaks.-COVID-19 like other pandemics, is projected to result in low access and utilization of reproductive, maternal and child health services -Women and children are the most affected during the crises caused by pandemics-The COVID-19 has contributed to a high utilization of short-term family planning methods (injectables and pills) with a reduction in long-term methods (implants and intra-uterine devices). -There are rising cases of caesarean section rates beyond the WHO recommended 10-15% with no improvement in maternal and perinatal mortality rates. -There is rising teenage pregnancy rates with a rising adolescent maternal mortality rates but decreased maternal mortality amongst women aged 20 years and above.All rights reserved.

The virus was first identified on 31 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei Province in China. Some of the common signs of COVID-19 include fever, shortness of breath and dry coughs. Other uncommon symptoms include muscle pain, mild diarrhea, abdominal pain, sputum production, loss of smell, and sore throat. On 11 of March 2020, the WHO announced that it was a global pandemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . On 15 th of June 2020, as the Worldometer corona virus updates information reported that we have 8,028,253 total COVID-19 cases, 436,276 total deaths with 5.4% fatality rate and 4,148,128 total recovered with 51.7% recovered rate as globally. It was distributed from highest to lowest ranks of the new cases and deaths by the World Regions as follows: North America has led by 2,480,701 total new cases (1 st ) and 144,979 total deaths (2 nd ), Europe has 2,398,779 total new cases (2 nd ) and 188,001 total deaths (1 st ), Asia has 1,616,962 total new cases (3 rd ) and 40,248 total deaths (4 th ), South America has 1,425,696 total new cases (4 th ) and 60,457 total deaths (3 rd ), Africa has 244,578 total new cases (5 th ) and 6,490 total deaths (5 th ), and the last in both ranks is Oceania, which has 8,931 cases and 124 deaths. In the report, the male and female cases were 71% and 29%, respectively [6] . On this date, Ethiopia was ranked as the 2 nd , 15 th , 16 th and 23 rd on the table by 176 new cases, by 3,521 total COVID-19 cases, by 60 total deaths (1.7%) and by 620 total recovered (17.6%) as compared from African countries as the Worldometer corona virus updates information showed [6] . The report also showed that Ethiopia was listed on the 27 th place by the capacity of COVID-19 laboratory tests. It was 1,629 tests per 1,000,000 populations. This is bad news for Ethiopia. Currently, the Ethiopian population is near 115 million. This is the fact that Ethiopia has a very low proportion of COVID-19 laboratory tests compared with other countries tests. This report indicated that Ethiopia needs increasing efforts and strategies to increase daily laboratory tests. Otherwise, she will be the next ''African USA''. Then, this study aimed to achieve the following objectives: 1. To predict COVID-19 new cases based on the number of days, and daily laboratory tests using a regression model. 2. To predict new deaths based on the number of days, new cases, and new recovered using a regression model.The COVID-19 new case report data were collected from Ethiopia Ministry of Health and Ethiopian Public Heath Institution reports from their face book and telegram pages [7, 8] . 14 th of March 2020 was the first date that COVID-19 was confirmed in Ethiopia. The time period of data was from the 12 th of May to the 10 th of June 2020 (for the last 30 days). The data included the total number of new cases, date of recorded, number of new total COVID-19 cases, number of new deaths, number of new recoveries, persons who have contacted infected cases, number of male total COVID-19 cases, number of new cases from AA city, and others.In this study, I used Pearson's correlation analysis and the linear regression model to predict COVID-19 new cases based on the available data from 12 th May to 10 th June 2020 in Ethiopia.Regression analysis is a statistical technique for investigating and modeling the relationship between variables. Applications of regression are numerous and occur in almost every field, including engineering, life and biological sciences, and other sciences. In fact, regression analysis may be the most widely used statistical technique.The regression model has many variants such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and others [9] .The fitted multiple linear regression model was used to determine the most predicator variables for COVID-19 new cases and new deaths from 12 th May to 10 th June 2020 in Ethiopia. ൌWhere: Y is COVID-19 new cases or new deaths. And X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 are independent variables with their corresponding coefficients (b 1 , b 2 , and b 3 ). And, b 0 is the intercept coefficient in the model.The fitted cubic regression model was used to estimate the parameters of independent variables as X, X 2 , and X 3 . All the estimated parameters (b 1 , b 2 , and b 3 ) shown the change of Y when the independent variable changed from x to x+1. ൌWhere: Y is COVID-19 new cases or new deaths. And X is an independent variable with corresponding regression coefficient b(s). And, b 0 is the intercept coefficient in the model.Total number of COVID-19 laboratory tests: The total numbers of COVID-19 laboratory tests were 158,521 and 121,938 from 14 th of March to 10 th of June and 12 th of May to 10 th of June, respectively. This indicates that the testing rate was increased to 77%. The newly reported COVID-19 laboratory tests peaked at 6,092 on June 07, 2020.The correlation analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between COVID-19 new cases and the number of days, daily laboratory tests, new cases of males, new cases of females, new cases from AA city, new cases from foreign natives, new cases with unknown contact and travel histories, and new cases with contact with infected persons (table 4) . This implied that the new cases will be increased to 585 after 100 days. And the table also showed that a daily laboratory test was significant predictor for new cases in the linear regression model (p-value of 0.000). But, this variable and its two expressions were not predictors in the quadratic and cubic regression model. In this model, new deaths due to COVID-19 were predicted significantly by the number of days and new recoveries at the 10% and 1% levels of significance, respectively. 3) In addition, it is predicted to be 0 (negative deaths not applicable) when the two variables are zero. The main limitation of this analysis was that the data were not found together as collectively for all the previous reports and were taken from the face book and telegram pages of Ethiopia Ministry of Health. Second, limiting my analysis was that some data values were missed to report for 8 dates (such as the contact and travel history of the cases).Despite all the limitations, the greatest strength of this study was the very high adjusted R 2 found in the predictive model. Three predictors for COVID-19 new cases were found in the multiple linear regression model, and its assumptions were fitted. In addition, there was cross-validation with two different software programs (R and SPSS).There were 2,506 total COVID-19 cases and 35 deaths due to COVID-19 with a crude mortality of 1.4% from 14th march to 10 th June in Ethiopia, 2020. However, the total cases and total deaths of COVID-19 were 10 times and 6 times more, respectively, from the 12 th of May to the 10 th of June compared to the 14th of March to the 11 th of May 2020 in Ethiopia. In the multiple linear regression model, variables of the number of days, daily laboratory tests and new cases from Addis Ababa city significantly predicted COVID-19 new cases at the 5%, 10% and 1% levels of significance, respectively. Thus, COVID-19 new cases are predicted to increase 135, 503 and 881 when the number of days increases by 100 days, the daily laboratory tests increase by 100,000 tests, and the new cases from Addis Ababa city increase by 10,000 tests while holding other variables constant. In the multiple linear regression model, variables of the number of days and new recoveries are predicted new deaths due to COVID-19 at the 10% and 1% levels of significance, respectively. Thus, new deaths due to COVID-19 were predicted to increase 6 and 79 when the number of days increased by 100 days and the new recoveries rose by 1,000 tests while holding other variables constant, respectively. Finally, according to this analysis, if strong preventions and action are not taken in the country, the predicted values of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths will be 590 and 12 after two months (after 9 th of August) from now, respectively.The data are available if required.The research work was not supported by anyone.The author declares that I have no competing interests.All the research's sections were performed by A.S.

The questionnaire consisted of 22 closed and open-ended questions to leverage the balance between obtaining quick responses to straight forward questions and probing for depth. A total number of 103 respondents completed the survey.The survey was distributed to residents across all 5 sub-counties of Mombasa, namely, Mvita, Nyali, Kisauni, Likoni and Changamwe (figure 1). Survey questionnaires were sent to residents who were 18 years.The online survey was distributed to contacts and contacts of contacts in a manner that is consistent with the snowball and convenient sampling techniques. Contacts were asked to share the survey widely with their networks. The survey was conducted from 20 th May to 1 st June 2020.Coastal and Marine Resources Development (COMRED) Nyali, Mombasa, KenyaThe data was collected from the coastal city of Mombasa, situated at 4 0 0'S, 39 0 36'E and 18 ft above sea level. Mombasa.Raw data is available at COMRED's repository and has also been shared with Data in Brief journal. The data provides a snapshot of the socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 on Mombasa city residents. Analysed along key demographic aspects such gender shows disparities in the impacts of Covid-19, among residents, in terms of access to information, income differentials and livelihood options. This data is vital in helping authorities, partners and other stakeholders to tailor responses to facilitate recovery from the crisis. For instance, it can support local and national authorities in addressing the challenge of dissemination of mis and disinformation about Covid-19, by formulating specific information on policy responses and specific behaviour to be adopted. As the pandemic is still evolving, this data can be used as a baseline for continuous data gathering, analysis and interpretation to provide new insights about the disease. The survey can be further developed to gather data on the residents' access to essential services, such as running water, during Covid-19 or similar pandemics.The gathered information is general in nature and was meant to provide a preliminary assessment of the socio-economic impact of Covid-19 during restrictions. However, we isolated gender issues for further analysis. This was dictated by the data, whose casual examination revealed gender disparities. Consequently, we divided our results into two categories, namely, i) gendered social -economic impacts and ii) general socio-economic impacts. Our data did not return significant values across all variables when analyzed against age.Throughout history, pandemics have been known to have differential impacts on women and men. Because of this , the draft resolution from the 146 th session of the WHO executive Board recommended that strategies for Covid-19 preparedness and response must be grounded in strong gender analysis (WHO, 2020) . The WHO has been calling for gender-sensitive research on adverse health, social and economic impacts of Covid-19. Hence, disaggregating data by sex and age would help in understanding the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on women and men According to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census report, the gender composition in Mombasa is nearly 50-50 (50.5% male and 49.5% female) (KNBS, 2019). Participants in this survey comprised of 40.8% female and 59.2% men with no other gender identified. While the gender differentiated response might have been occasioned by our sampling technique, it is most likely an indication of the underlying gender inequality. For example, survey respondents required internet to access, complete and return the survey. However, while men have long been able to surf the web, many women in Africa lack access to the internet, even though they might have smartphones. Many women lack enough money to use the internet, with 7 out of 10 online mobile users being men. In Kenya, only 26% of women use mobile internet (Fröhlich, 2019) . Employment is in many cases a determinant of household disposal income which in turn determines whether individuals can afford to pay for internet or not. Yet in Mombasa, 26% of women are not economically engaged, and only 15% are employed while men make up 15% and 29% of the two categories respectively (KNBS, 2020b) A survey report on the 'socio-economic Impact of Covid-19 on Households' released by the Kenya National Treasury Office, in May 2020, revealed that more women than men work in jobs that are vulnerable to disruption, especially in the service and manufacturing industries (KNBS, 2020a). Our survey showed that only about 11% of the women in self-employment could work from home and of the 28% of the women in casual employment, none could earn a living by working from home (Table 1) . This points to the type of self-employment that women are involved in. A previous report had shown that women tended to operate smaller businesses associated with traditional women's roles such as hairdressing, selling fish, trading in vegetables, operating small kiosks and so on, in order to provide for their families (see Mwobobia, 2012) . Hence, these require face-to-face interactions. Those who could worked from home expressed various challenges. Figure 2 shows some of the challenges mentioned by this group. The challenges related to access, reliability and affordability of internet services. Overall, problems associated with internet for those who worked from home accounted for 31%. This points to the low level of connectivity and affordability of internet services in Mombasa. Another challenge was distractions, which mentioned by 29% of the respondents. Many respondents attributed the distractions to multitasking as they home-schooled their children while completing work related tasks. Others found the home environment unconducive for work due to limited spaces. The problem of space was further confirmed by our data, which shows the average household size to be 4.5 people. This is much higher than 3. 1 people per household reported for Mombasa by the Kenya National Bureau of Standards, population census report (KNBS, 2019). However, it is worth noting that KNBS obtained its figure by dividing the city's total population with the number of households. Our figure of 4.5 people per household is consistent with the findings that African women have 4.5 children on average. It could also be explained by the fact that Mombasa has a high population density of 5495 persons per square kilometre (Pison, 2017; KNBS, 2019) . The high average household size coupled with the small house sizes explains why the respondents found the home environment to be unconducive for work.The women's lack of access to internet is an additional stratifier of the gender inequalities that could exacerbate adverse differential impacts of Covid-19. For example, this might mean that women are missing out on credible Covid-19 information that is shared through social media networks and other internet sources. Women comprised of about 35% of those who use social media and online research for Covid-19 information, which is the close to Fröhlich (2019) finding that 7/10 online mobile users in Africa are men.Gender differential was also evident regarding the most challenging issues during restrictions. Male respondents were mostly experiencing lack of income and loss of business at 42% and 15% respectively. On the other hand, most female respondents reported facing challenges of separation from family/friends and not attending religious gatherings (figure 3); pointing to gendered power relations which depict women's relational interests and men's preoccupation with the pursuit of personal growth.internet 31% not meeting clients 17% other 4%In addition to identifying the challenges presented in Figure 3 , majority of the respondents said that the restriction of their movement had grossly interfered with their day to day activities. Not surprising, 31% of the respondents specifically identified financial loss as a major consequence of the Covid-19 measures. Some respondents (7%) felt their expenses were higher as a result of the restrictions. Though not in significant numbers, it is noteworthy that some residents reported feeling stressed and having to incur additional expenses due to price hikes of some essential commodities, and the continuous presence of children at home owing to school closures (see table 2). Restricted religious activities 4Loss of education for children 6Expensive 7Others 7Similar to other crisis situations, the Covid-19 pandemic has raised important issues around information dissemination. Our survey showed that approximately 55% of the residents relied on the national government for Covid-19 information (figure 4). This was expected given the national government has been providing press briefings every day since the first case was reported. These briefings are broadcast live on national TV and Radio stations. Electronic media was the second most common source of information at 26.9%. This means that some of the respondents who identified electronic media as their source of Covid-19 got their information from the government. Electronic medial included TV and Radio; Social Media included Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram (figure 4) When asked whether they found Covid-19 messages conveyed by the government easy or difficult to follow, 20% of those who said the messages were difficult to follow gave the reason that it was difficult to practice social distancing in crowd places. Another 24% mentioned the government's mixed messaging, which led to confusion and conflicting information. The government has done little to address infodemics. One of the myths which went viral within Mombasa was that of the mystical tea. The coastal region was rife with rumours that black tea without sugar, drunk before dawn, could both cure and prevent coronavirus. This information was attributed to a child who was born at night, and uttered words about black tea before dying (Omar, 2020) . The spread of such rumours is not unexpected given the usual tendency for fringe ideas to acquire prominence when people become anxious and isolated without much social support.It was interesting to note that while a higher percentage of Mombasa residents relied on the national government for Covid-19 related information, there was a significantly low trust for the government to do what it was promising to do with regard to taking care of the vulnerable people. 28% of the respondents stated that they did not trust the government ( Figure 5 ). This is despite the National government having announced an economic stimulus of KES 53.7 Billion to help keep the country afloat, and effecting cash transfers under the National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) as well as local relief food distribution efforts by the Mombasa County government. Those who did not trust the government to care for the vulnerable gave various reasons for not doing so. The reasons fitted into one of the following 3 categories, namely; government is corrupt, government is unreliable and government is unprepared to deal with emergencies of the scale of Covid-19 ( Figure 6 ). Many Africans assess their public officials skeptically, wary of corruption, coercion and inadequate care for ordinary people's physical, economic and social welfare (Boadi & Logan, 2020). Mombasa is a world-famous tourist city, as exemplified by the number of Hotel-Bed nights. The combined Hotel-Bed nights in the region stood at 3904 in 2019. This accounted for about 43% of the total occupied beds in the entire country (KNBS, 2020b). While Covid-19 has affected all business in all sectors, the tourism industry has been the hardest hit, especially due to the local restriction of movement and cessation of international travel. According to the KNBS survey, accommodation and food services had a high variance of 30 hours, compared to the usual hours of work per week (KNBS, 2020a) . In April 2020, the Kenya Tourism Federation (KTF) reported some hotels on the coasts having occupancy rates below 10%, necessitating close down and sending staff on unpaid compulsory leave (UNDP, 2020).In terms of service provision during Covid-19 restrictions, access to running water was imperative because the number one recommended protective measure against the virus is frequent washing using soap. Our data does not determine whether the respondents referred to the availability of running water, standpipes or water kiosks. However, water statistics in Mombasa show that the demand for portable water per day is 200,000m 3 . The piped system is only able to supply a maximum of 50,000m 3 . The rest of the water comes from boreholes and other unidentified sources (Kithiia and Gamoyo, in press) The provision of electricity, health care and accommodation/housing services is also vital. For example, with the increasing number of cases, the demand on health facilities and health care workers would increase leaving health systems overstretched and unable to operate effectively. According to WHO, previous outbreaks have demonstrated that when health systems are overwhelmed, mortality from vaccine-preventable and other treatable conditions can also increase dramatically (WHO, 2020). The surveyed residents adjudged health services to be insufficient, and in some cases, completely lacking (see figure 7) . It is unclear how our data might have been affected by the respondents' misunderstanding of the functioning of the health care systems during this time of Covid-19. However, it must be remembered that over the years, Kenya has relied on external funding for the implementation of health interventions, with government allocation to health still at 6%, way below the international benchmark of 15% (Ministry of Health, nd)The government's 'stay home orders' brought to the fore the importance of adequate housing/accommodation provision in the city. Yet, Mombasa has the second-highest number of street individuals (1809), only second to Nairobi with 6,743 (KNBS, 2020). The respondents concern about inadequate housing are captured in our data, whereby nearly 35% of the respondents have described housing/accommodation as 'insufficient' (figure 7). This also agrees with our findings on large household sizes (4.5 people) meaning that even where residents have accommodation, this may not be adequate to cater for all the individuals in the household.The question of whether or not people have learnt from crisis is often posed after every crisis event. Lessons learned from crisis, if implemented, could lead to a better society. After the crisis, people tend to want to pick up, as quickly as, possible from where they left off, with little motivation to incorporate lessons learnt into structural processes for long term implementation. While the effects of Covid-19 are still unfolding, it would be interesting to know what lessons Mombasa residents will eventually learn from it, and how these would be incorporated into everyday processes. So far, our preliminary assessment shows that only 17% of the survey respondents felt that their Covid-19 experiences have prepared them to face similar crisis in the future. 57% were either unprepared or unsure of the extent to which their current experience has prepared them for future pandemics. However, this reflects our earlier findings that 59.6% of respondents were on full time employment, the rest likely being in informal sector or casual labour and therefore would do little to disrupt their normal life even after this pandemic.A survey questionnaire was developed to elicit information, from residents of Mombasa city, on various socio-economic aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The questionnaire consisted of 22 closed and open-ended questions to leverage the balance between obtaining quick responses to straight forward questions and probing for depth. The online survey was distributed to contacts and contacts of contacts in a manner that is consistent with snowball and convenient sampling techniques. Contacts were asked to share the survey widely with their networks. The survey was conducted from 20 th May to 1 st June 2020. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel. It did not return significant values across all variables when analysed against age.All ethical issues which were likely to arise from the conduct of the study were considered as part of the preparation and administration of the survey. The survey was part of a broader funded by WIOMSA and approved by the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI) in Kenya. Survey questionnaires were only shared with those above 18 years who were willing to volunteer information.","Kenya","abstract","2020-09-18",9

The COVID-19 is contagious and can spread during the incubation period or recessive infection, making it difficult to identify suspected cases without clinical symptoms and epidemiological history. The lack of information on how COVID-19 spreads delayed COVID-19 preparedness which resulted in underestimating its severity until the World Health Organization (WHO) declared public health emergency and health crisis [3, 4, 5] . After that, COVID-19 prevention methods were comprehensively upgraded and this marked the beginning of universal concern; and prompted WHO to implement physical distancing and self-isolation [6] .Globally, COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially. As of 30 August 2020, WHO reported 25,225,566 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 847,676 deaths and 17,574,888 recovered patients while African continent reported 1,237,070 cases, 29,430 deaths and 968,962 recoveries [7] . In Africa, the first imported COVI-19 case from China was reported in Egypt on the 14 th of February 2020 [8] . The fact that China is the largest commercial investor in Africa led to large numbers of people travelling to and from China hence o the importation of COVID-19 cases. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) in collaboration with Southern Africa Center for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) formed Africa Taskforce on Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR) which consists of Health Ministries of all member states of African Union Commission [9, 10] . AFTCOR together with the Africa CDC implemented prevention and containment strategies such as case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), surveillance and publicity to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 [9] and minimizing its potential impact on fragile health systems.Therefore, this explanatory study sought to provide effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. Also, the study provides an overview of South Africa COVID-19 preparedness and prevailing challenges to combat the pandemic.The study applied literature search of journal articles written in English from electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. Reports, policies and guidelines from WHO, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), South African Department of Health, World Health Organization African Region, South Africa's COVID-19 Online portal and resources and Africa CDC were also analyzed. Articles, reports and policies were searched using the following key terms, ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV2"" OR ""Coronavirus"" AND ""impact of COVID-19"", ""effects of COVID-19"", ""novel coronavirus disease"" ""COVID-19 preparedness in South Africa"", ""COVID-19"" OR ""Corona positive"", ""COVID-19 policy"" OR ""COVID-19 guidelines"", ""COVID-19 pandemic"". The literature search was done up till August 27 2020. The study excluded information from blogs and other unverified sources. Also, the study excluded articles and reports that did not include the effects or impact of COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f South Africa reported first imported COVID-19 cases from nine adults who returned from a holiday in Italy, where cases were rampant, on 29 February 2020 [11] . The returnees started showing flu-like symptoms which later confirmed COVID-19 positive by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the 5 th of March 2020. Some of the returnees were asymptomatic but tested positive. The aftermath of imported cases prompted the President of the Republic of South Africa to declare a national state of disaster to mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic. With increasing COVID-19 cases and no approved vaccines [12] , the South Africa authorities and health system implemented drastic measures in addition to WHO recommendations and Africa CDC COVID-19 mitigation strategies and guidelines. These measures include scaling up the testing process, national total lockdown as shown in Figure1, travelling restrictions internally and local (interprovincial) except workers providing essential services, bans on large gatherings (music, sports, religious and other social gatherings) as well as selling of alcohol and cigarettes, campaigns for physical distancing, practising good hygiene, implementation of curfew, stay at home, and establishment of communication protocol for the reporting cases and closure of unit or department if an employee tested positive. To strengthen COVID-19 mitigation efforts, the health system embarked on awareness campaigns, case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), surveillance, risk communication and human capacity (training in surveillance, epidemic response, and diagnostic testing kits). As of 24 August 2020, within Southern African Development Region (SADC) region, South Africa continues to record highest cumulative COVID-19 cases and account for 90 per cent of 91 per cent of the confirmed deaths, with fatality ratio of 7 per cent [13] . With the high level of government commitment, COVID-19 screening and testing are decentralized to provincial, districts and sub-districts to the scaling-up testing process, coordination of action and enforcing collaboration amongst COVID-19 task teams. A series of national lockdowns and the evolution of COVID-19 in South Africa and measures undertaken are shown in Figure 1 .Several COVID-19 awareness campaigns are intensified to fight stigmatization, anxiety and debunking myths and misinformation about COVID-19 especially the 5G technology conspiracy theory. The Ministry of Health engaged media platforms such as television, radio, social media, short messaging services (SMS), leaflets, banners and also road campaigns to create COVID-19 awareness. These platforms are engaged to teach the community about the effective ways of handwashing techniques and preventive measures such as wearing masks, sanitizing and social distancing among others.As part of the precautionary measures, the washing of hands, as well as cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces, is done especially in densely populated places including school buildings, taxi and bus ranks among others [14] . Disinfection of objects and surfaces is further extended to healthcare settings, where furniture, rooms, toilets, medical equipment and other computer peripherals in isolation and quarantine centres are often disinfected using chemical disinfectant (chlorine or alcohol). This is done to reduce pathogens on contaminated objects and surfaces.The South African health system implemented temperature screening at ports of entry, laboratory testing facilities, clinical diagnosis, quarantine facilities and refurbishment of designated hospitals as COVID-19 isolation centres in each province. The isolation centres are equipped with ventilators and dexamethasone for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress [13] . If someone tests positive, health workers do contact tracing and collect information about the person to determine the level of risk for COVID-19. The information includes symptoms, travel, exposure to anyone with COVID-19 infection, exposure to healthcare facilities, and details about how to contact the person.In addition to case management activities, South Africa healthcare system implements infection prevention and control to slow down the spread of COVID-19. These COVID-19 preventive measures include maintaining of physical distancing (individual and community) [15] , reduction of face-to-face contact during staff meetings, wearing of N95 respirators, sterile gloves and surgical masks only for frontline healthcare workers, wearing of face masks by the general public, decontamination and disinfection of contaminated areas and objects using sanitisers. Moreover, the health system also recommends social distancing as infection prevention and control to combat COVID-19 [7] as well as risk communication and surveillance.Increased mortality rate and deaths As of 24 August 2020, South Africa recorded 611450 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases and 13226 deaths from March 2020, and national case fatality rate of 2, 2% based on deaths from 24 August 2020 reflecting an increase of new deaths [13] . The deaths are attributed to limited access to medical care especially for women that are in need for antenatal and postnatal care services as more women deliver at home. Also, more attention is given to COVID-19 which prompts the resurgence of other deadly non-communicable diseases (NCDs) during the lockdown. This burdens the government and the communities as the number of children requiring social support increases. The death of the breadwinner of the family caused hardships, hunger and pain especially in the vulnerable families that are living below the poverty line. Although the estimated fatality rate is inclusive of people who already had underlying conditions, however, more precise information of infected individuals that include asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases would make precise fatality rate [16] . Again, it is unclear how many people have died of COVID-19 in areas including rural settlers, where testing is not intensified or people avoiding seeking medical care for fear of getting infected or stigmatisation.The uncertainty of COVID-19 pandemic threatens both people's physical health and affect people's mental health [5] . Once someone experiences pneumonia-like symptoms, the close relatives are likely to develop negative emotions and avoidant behaviours by avoiding contact with the person and affect their mental health. In addition to that, high infectivity, unemployment and fatality rates, financial losses, continuous lockdowns, forced quarantine, restrictions on the movement of people caused by COVID-19 [17] , significantly change the daily lives and ultimately lead to mental health problems and substance abuse. This brought uncertainties, acute panic, fear of contracting the virus, obsessive behaviours, post-traumatic stress disorder, stigmatisation, anxiety, depression, hoarding among others. These problems have increased drastically as evidenced by the increased number of reported gender-based violence cases in South Africa fuelled by restrictive access to psychosocial support services and lack of financial support [18] . The prolonged effects of COVID-19 on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of riotous acts, racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against communities with high COVID-19 cases and discrimination in the distribution of COVID-19 relief food aid.South African government announced the temporary closure of schools and universities to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic [19] . The suspension of teaching and learning activities affect learning and the academic calendar and implies less economic opportunities and human capital in the future as well as the increasing number of teenage marriages. However, the Government through the Ministry of Education implemented strategies such as practising social distancing, limiting the number of learners and students at schools and universities (completing students) [20] . Despite the closure of the schools, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) introduced online learner support programmes such as COVID-19 Television and radio curriculum support programmes for learners. Institutions in Higher Education and Training adopted online learning facilities (blended learning) such as Learning Management Systems (Moodle), as wells as social media platforms such as WhatsApp [21] and video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Skype and Microsoft Teams among others. However, teaching and learning practicals and labs remain a daunting task especially in the medical field, engineering and science practical-oriented courses during the lockdown period. Also, the digital divide among students is another limitation to facilitate blended learning.Gender-based violence cases continue to increase rapidly amid COVID-19, especially violence against women [22] . This is evident with received 120,000 calls by the South African National helpline from victims of gender-based violence within three weeks [23] . With this upsurge, it is evident that South Africa battles another deadly epidemic of domestic violence amidst the coronavirus lockdown. Sadly, some perpetrators of GBV are the breadwinners of the family [24] ; therefore, victims find themselves in juxtaposition, whether to report their perpetrators or keep silent for food. Measures to deal with rampant cases of GBV together with mental health and substance abuse must be enforced. Programmes to assist victims must be accessible, remain open and treated as part of essential services; these include shelters, helplines, and place of safety and counselling services and be afforded necessary financial, political support, provision of rehabilitation and psychosocial support services during COVID-19.The closure of borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, sharp depreciation of currencies, a sharp decline in share prices and commodity prices (Brent crude oil price), flights as well as dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during COVID-19 causes socio-economic crisis in South Africa and globally. China, the major supplier of inputs for manufacturing and production industries stopped shipping out of goods which tremendously affected business operations in South Africa. Several sectors of the economy have been disrupted with the COVID-19 pandemic [12] . This inflicts high and rising human costs and daily expenditure because of depreciating exchange rates and supply shortages and poses risk to the near term inflation outlook as well as fiscal positions and debt trajectories.With continued travelling restrictions, poverty and national lockdowns without sustainable COVID-19 relief food aid, social unrests [25] , confrontation, shop looting [26] and obsessive behaviours are inevitable because of lack of food supply, loss of income, panic, and anxiety, especially in the informal settlement [24] . Loss of employment, which is the main source of income for many informal settlers, is a psychological blow with knock-on effects on entire households and families concerned, as one income earner typically supports extended family members. Social unrests have posed new challenges to combat COVID-19 pandemic as an imposition of contact tracing and social distancing become difficult.Due to reduced physical activities and active intake of snacks especially in quarantine and isolation centres results in weight gain which poses diabetes-related complications [27] . This is exacerbated with limited movements and access to the gym facilities, controlled movements which further restricts outdoor and open space physical exercises. Reduced physical activities, restricted access to entertainment, loneliness and weight gain increases health risk factors such as obesity [16] , hypertension, cardiorespiratory and mental health disorders among others. This could prompt a resurgence of non-communicable diseases during or post COVID-19.Despite the impact of COVID-19 in Africa, there is a paucity of healthcare professionals worldwide, especially in developing countries (World Health Organisation 2013). This serious impediment to healthcare progress is influenced by factors such as brain drain, shortage healthcare training and educational facilities [28] .In many countries, the deficit is even caused and exacerbated by the disproportionate distribution of healthcare professionals in rural and urban areas. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated a deficit of skilled healthcare professionals globally because of population growth [29] . The concern of inadequate healthcare staffing levels was raised many years ago in the World Health Report 2013, which described the global shortage as a ""crisis"" then. The situation is even more critical today amid COVID-19 since nurses are part of the front-line healthcare professionals. The push factors such as poor remuneration and poor working conditions fueled the shortage of skilled medical doctors and nurses through cross-border migration of health workers to developed economies [30, 31] . South African health system is overwhelmed with COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the existing challenges in healthcare service delivery. Despite significant progress in the South African health system since 1994, the country faces challenges in healthcare service delivery which include lack of funding and insufficient budget [32] , environmental change [33] and unequal distribution of resources (including health facilities, healthcare workers, inadequate production, and inadequate recruitment especially in rural areas, for both the public sector and private sector. [34] . Other challenges include slow progress in restructuring the healthcare system [35, 36] , Increased disease burden [34] , management and leadership crisis caused by poor leadership and inadequate management, and reflected in a lack of vision, lack of clear philosophy and poor goal setting in the healthcare sector [37, 38] . Ensuring universal access to skilled, motivated and supported health workers, especially in remote and rural communities is a challenge because of the existing health facilities disparities between urban and remote areas [39, 40] . In addition to these challenges, South African health system is plagued with acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face shield or goggles, heavy-duty apron and gloves, as well as N95 respirators for frontline healthcare professionals due to disruptions in the global supply chain of medical equipment. Shortage of equipped health facilities and PPE for COVID-19 healthcare workers, patients and suspected individuals in quarantine and self-isolation centres increased chances of infection of healthcare workers [13] . In addition to that, striking a balance providing essential healthcare to COVID-19 patients and protecting healthcare workers from infection, especially in the face increasing healthcare workers infections due to lack of PPEs is a challenging task for the COVID-19 response team. The situation is exacerbated by rampant corruption, abuse of funds allocated to fight COVID-19, lack of PPE local reprocessing companies that can manufacture PPEs due to huge capital investment required, which is not always available in most African countries including South Africa.Fighting COVID-19 pandemic brought new multidisciplinary research opportunities for sustainable solutions globally. For instance, Vaishya [41] , Pan [42] , Lalmuanawma [43] and Ting [44] highlighted how emerging and digital technologies could mitigate COVID-19 in terms of identification, detecting, screening, drugs development as well monitoring COVID-19 patients and contact-persons. In addition to the existing research opportunities highlighted by Vaishya [41] , Pan [42] , Lalmuanawma [43] , Ting [44] , Table 1 illustrate research opportunities for integrating emerging technologies that can alleviate the effects of COVID-19 in South African health systems and society. • Integration of mobile applications(apps) in reporting GBV cases • Big data to store names of GBV perpetrators and remotely monitor their behaviour • Integration of Internet of Things and mobile apps for remote counselling and virtual consultations of GBV victims • GIS technology to monitor the migration patterns GBV perpetrators • Intensify ""Stop Gender-based Violence"" campaigns on radio, instant messaging, SMS, teleconferences, television and evaluate the effectiveness of these platforms • Find strategies to involve vulnerable women living in resource-constrained areas in South AfricaCOVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented and catastrophic effects in the South African health system, society and the economy. Continued national lockdowns have affected the GDP of the country and makes it imperative for the government at all levels to reassess and re-evaluate the effects of lockdown as the pandemic unfolds. Social protection and provision of basic services remain vital mitigation strategies, especially for the vulnerable populace. However, to slow down the spread of COVID-19, massive testing must be adopted [27] , crafting of policy for food relief, contact tracing programmes [6] , isolation activities as well as home quarantine guidelines for asymptomatic cases which promote behavioural change.Integration of emerging technologies in fighting COVID-19 in South Africa is inevitable as the country moves from one lockdown level to another.

Public perception of hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory coronavirus 2 was first discovered in Wuhan Animal Market, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. 1 Since its discovery, it has spread to more than 200 countries around the world and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. 2 COVID-19 has had unprecedented impacts on the health and well-being of people all over the world, as well as the economy of many countries. 3, 4 In Nigeria, the index case was reported on 27 February 2020, and more than 50,000 cases and over a thousand deaths have been documented since then. 5 As with past outbreaks, the novel nature of the current coronavirus outbreak implied that no definitive therapy existed for its treatment, instead, empirical therapies are being employed in the management of the disease. The rapid spread of the virus and continuous increasing number of cases alongside the partial and/or total lockdown protocols in most countries necessitate the urgent development of accurate diagnostic methods, effective treatments and vaccines for the disease. 6 The long term solution to COVID-19, however, would most likely be a safe, globally implemented vaccination program with a broad range of clinical and socioeconomic benefits. 7 It is of point to note that vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. It is the greatest human intervention besides clean water and sanitation. 8 Major infections such as smallpox and rinderpest have been eradicated worldwide due to vaccines, while polio has almost been eradicated with the exception of Afghanistan and Pakistan where it is still endemic. 9, 10, 11 The impact of vaccination on vaccine-preventable diseases cannot be overemphasized. The incidence and prevalence of diseases such as cervical cancer, hepatitis, yellow fever, tuberculosis, cholera and tetanus, among others, have been severely reduced due to vaccine availability. 12 Vaccination plays such important roles in the fight against disease eradication and elimination, control of mortality, morbidity and complications, mitigation of disease severity, prevention of infection and even protection of unvaccinated population through herd immunity. 8 Thus, the availability of COVID-19 vaccine(s) will drastically change the course of the pandemic. As of 9 September 2020, 35 vaccine candidates are in clinical evaluation and 145 vaccine candidates are in preclinical evaluation. 13 Despite the immense benefits that vaccination has offered since the first discovery of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner till date, saving millions of lives globally and doing so at a comparatively low cost, vaccine hesitancy has always plagued this great discovery. Vaccine hesitancy is ""the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines"". 14 It was classified as one of the top ten threats to global health by the World Health Organization in 2019. 14 Vaccine hesitancy is a complex phenomenon, with a growing continuum existing between vaccine acceptance and refusal. Despite the proven effectiveness and safety of vaccines, an increasing number of individuals perceive vaccines as unsafe and unnecessary. 15 In recent times, there has been a steady decline in vaccine coverage and an increase in the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases. For instance, there has been a 30% rise in measles cases globally. Vaccine hesitancy is believed to contribute greatly to this. 14, 15 Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and has a convoluted history of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccination coverage in Nigeria has continuously dropped since its peak of 81.5% in the 1990s, and by 2013, only 25% of children under the age of 2 were fully vaccinated. 16 The 2003/2004 polio vaccine refusal in Nigeria had far-reaching effect as it not only increased the incidence of polio by many folds in Nigeria, but also contributed to outbreaks of polio across three continents. 17 Vaccine hesitancy could have a direct and wide-reaching effect on the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine(s) by individuals in the community as it confers threat not only on the hesitant individual but on the community as a whole, as delays and refusals would make it impossible for communities to reach the threshold of vaccine uptake necessary for the conferment of herd immunity. While the focus of attention currently is on developing a vaccine to protect the population against COVID-19, stakeholders should prepare for the next challenge: vaccine adoption (access and acceptance) among the public. Our study aims to understand the perception of the public in Nigeria towards the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine.Data analysis: Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. Simple descriptive analysis, including frequencies and percentages, was computed for demographic characteristics, and the reasons for non-acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, intention to take vaccine and reservations toward vaccination were presented with bar chart. Chi-square test was carried out to determine the significant level association and the relationship between the independent variables and outcome variables with statistical significance defined at P < 0.05.This study is the first in Nigeria to assess the public perception towards the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. It has been documented that the effectiveness of vaccination programs is governed by the public perception of vaccination. 20 There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Vaccination, one of the greatest advances in medicine, is one of the most effective tools for reducing the burden of infectious diseases. Over the last 20 years, worldwide, vaccination programs for polio, whooping cough, diphtheria, and measles have reduced the prevalence of these diseases significantly. 9 Despite the benefit vaccination reap for public health, this fundamental effort for disease control still faces major obstacles globally, and Nigeria is not an exception. 21 It has been noted that one of the major obstacles to vaccine acceptance is the public perception of the relative risks and benefits of vaccination. 22 Findings from our study revealed that there is no significant association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sex. This in contrast with a multi-national survey in Europe, where there was a significant association between the two variables and a significantly higher proportion of males were willing to get vaccinated. 23 Even though there is no significant difference in the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine and sex, males are slightly willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine than females. Our results also revealed that there is a significant association between age group and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, with respondents age 16 to 30 more willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. One might argue that the group who currently disagreed with taking the COVID-19 vaccine may be the most relevant. However, these sets of people can easily be persuaded to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity; if they are informed on the benefits, vaccination can reap for public health.Furthermore, about 25% of our respondents disagreed with taking the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available. This is higher than what was reported in China (3%), Brazil (12%), Australia (12%), India (13%), Malaysia (15%), Great Britain (15%), Saudi Arabia (16%), South Korea (16%), Peru (21%), and Canada (24%) according to a recent World Economic Forum's Ipsos survey of nearly 20,000 adults on whether they will take COVID-19 vaccine or not when it is available. 24 However, the unwillingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine was higher in Russia (47%), Poland (45%), Hungary (44%), France (41%), South Africa (36%), Sweden (33%), United States (33%), Germany (33%) and Italy (33%) 24 compared to our study (about 25%). Findings from our study also revealed that the top three reasons for nonacceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine are unreliability of clinical trials, immune system is enough to combat COVID-19, and that COVID-19 vaccine is not safe. This is similar to what was reported by the Ipsos survey, where the top 3 reasons were ""worry about side effects"", ""doubt about the vaccine effectiveness"", and ""perception of not being enough at risk from COVID-19."" 24 Another multi-national study in Europe revealed that more than half said they were concerned about the potential side effects of the vaccine. 23 This is not surprising in that all these findings have been found in literature as some of the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. 31 It has also been documented in the literature that vaccine adoption is a sum of vaccine access and acceptance. 32 Interestingly, one of the reasons for the non-acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is the perceived high cost of the vaccine according to our findings. Therefore, access is an important factor to be considered as regards the COVID-19 vaccine, and it is essential to translate the willingness to be vaccinated into actual vaccination decisions when the vaccine becomes available. Even though our study did not assess the willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine, equitable access to vaccination is much-needed to quickly achieve herd immunity.Our study is not without limitations. Generalization of the survey results should be avoided because pattern of questionnaire distribution may influence the outcome. We used the social media platform, and so it may omit older adults, people from lower socioeconomic classes, and certain geographical locations, lower educational attainment, and those who were illiterate as well as people who not have access to internet. Besides, response/social bias is also a possibility which is not uncommon in self-administered questionnaire research. Finally, acceptance was assessed using a potential (hypothetical) vaccine, which may differ from the respondents' revealed preferences when the vaccine becomes available.Even though the majority of our respondents are willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, our findings reiterate the need to reassure the public that any vaccine which becomes available is safe and effective. Otherwise, there is a risk of a reversal of hard-won achievement of building public trust in vaccination in Nigeria, potentially compromising herd immunity. Public trust is important in promoting public health and plays an essential role in the public's compliance with vaccination programs and other health interventions. However, if the public trust is eroded, false information can spread, and this can lead to the rejection of health interventions with a major threat to public health. Besides, national health authorities, stakeholders and policymakers in Nigeria need to ensure that access to the COVID-19 vaccine is equitable, when it becomes available.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-25",9

They are considered amongst the principal causes of mortality, especially in many developing countries. Accordingly, mathematical modelling in epidemiology occupies more and more an increasingly preponderant place in public health research. This research discipline contributes indeed to well understand the studied epidemiological phenomenon and apprehend the different factors that can lead to a severe epidemic or even to a dangerous pandemic worldwide. The classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model was first introduced in [1] . Nevertheless, in many cases, the infection incubation period may take a long time interval. In this period, an incubated individual remains latent but not yet infectious. Therefore, another class of exposed individuals should be added to SIR and the new epidemic model will have SEIR abbreviation. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have revealed that the phenomenon of mutation causes more and more resistant viruses giving appearance of many new harmful epidemics or even new dangerous pandemics. Indeed, H1N1 flu virus is considered as mutation of the seasonal influenza [2, 3] . Also, the late coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 is classified as a strain of SARS-CoV-1 [4] . Other processes of mutation were observed in many infections such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and dengue fever [5] [6] [7] . For this reason, the multi-strain SEIR epidemic models present an important tool to study several infectious diseases that include a long incubation period and also various infection strains. The relevance of studying multistrain models is to find out the different conditions permitting the coexistence of all acting strains. The global dynamics of one-strain SEIR model have been the subject of many investigations by considering either bilinear or nonlinear incidence rates [8] [9] [10] . The global stability of two-strain SEIR model have been tackled in [11] , the authors include to the studied model two incidence functions, the first one is bilinear, while the second function is non-monotonic. Recently, the same problem was studied in [12] by assuming that the two incidence functions are non-monotonic. It is worthy to mention that the incidence rate gives more information of the disease transmission. Hence, the general incidence function has as goal to represent a large set of infection incidence rates. Accordingly, the purpose of this work is to generalize the previous models by taking into account a multi-strain SEIR model with two general incidence rates. Hence, our study will be carried out on the following two-strain generalized epidemic model:= Λ − f (S, I 1 )I 1 − g(S, I 2 )I 2 − δS,with S(0) ≥ 0, E 1 (0) ≥ 0, E 2 (0) ≥ 0, I 1 (0) ≥ 0, I 2 (0) ≥ 0, R(0) ≥ 0. where (S) is the number of susceptible individuals, (E 1 ) and (E 2 ) are, respectively, the numbers of each latent individuals class, (I 1 ) and (I 2 ) are, respectively, the numbers of each infectious individuals class and (R) is the number of removed individuals. The parameter Λ is the recruitment rate, δ is the death rate of the population, γ 1 and γ 2 are, respectively, the latency rates of strain 1 and strain 2, μ 1 and μ 2 are, respectively, the two-strain transfer rates from infected to recovered. The general incidence functions f (S, I 1 ) and g(S, I 2 ) stand for the infection transmission rates for strain 1 and strain 2, respectively. The incidence functions f (S, I 1 ) and g(S, I 2 ) are assumed to be continuously differentiable in the interior of R 2 + and satisfy the same properties as in [13, 14] :f (0, I 1 ) = 0, The properties (H 1 ), (H 2 ) and (H 3 ), for the both functions f and g, are easily verified by several classical biological incidence rates such as the bilinear incidence function β S [1, 15, 16] , the saturated incidence function β S 1 + α 1 S or β S 1 + α 2 I [17, 18] , Beddington-DeAngelis [22] [23] [24] , the specific nonlinear incidence function β S 1 + α 1 S + α 2 I + α 3 S I [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and non-monotone incidence function β S 1 + α I 2 [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The flowchart of the two-strain epidemiological SEIR model is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Our main contribution centres around the global stability of multi-strain SEIR epidemic model with general incidence rates. In addition, a numerical comparison between our two-strain epidemic model results and COVID-19 clinical data will be conducted. It will be worthy to notice that the dynamics of SEIR COVID-19 epidemic model with two bilinear incidence functions was tackled in [35] , and the authors introduce seasonality and stochasticity in order to describe the infection rate parameters. Taking into account non-monotone incidence function, the technique of sliding mode control was used to study an SEIR epidemic model describing COVID-19 disease [36] . The COVID-19 SEIR epidemiological model with Crowley-Martin incidence rate was studied [37] , and the authors study the effect of different parameters on the disease spread. In our numerical comparison with COVID-19 clinical data, we will take into account the three latter incidence functions along with Beddington-DeAngelis incidence rate. A brief analysis to a more complex compartmental epidemic model will be established in Appendix of this paper.The rest of this paper is outlined as follows. In the next section, we will establish the wellposedness of the suggested model by proving the existence, positivity and boundedness of solutions. In Sect. 3, we present an analysis of the model, we calculate the basic reproduction number of our epidemic model and we prove the global stability of the equilibria. Numerical simulations are given in Sect. 4 by using different specific incidence functions, and the comparison between the numerical results and COVID-19 clinical data is conducted in the same section. The generalization of the problem to a more complex compartmental model as well as concluding remarks is given at the end of this paper.For the problems dealing with population dynamics, all the variables must be positive and bounded. We will assume first that all the model parameters are positive.Proposition 1 For all non-negative initial data, the solutions of the problem (1.1) exist, remain bounded and non-negative.Proof By the fundamental theory of differential equations functional framework (see for instance [38] and the references therein), we confirm that there exists a unique local solution to the problem (1.1).In order to prove the positivity result, we will show that any solution starting from non-negative orthantFirst, letLet us now prove that T = +∞. Suppose that T is finite; by continuity of solutions, we haveIf S(T ) = 0 before the other variables E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 , R, become zero. Therefore,From the first equation of system (1.1), we havėthen,However, from (H 1 ) we havėwhich presents a contradiction. If E 1 (T ) = 0 before S, E 2 , I 1 , I 2 and R. Then,Again, from the second equation of the system (1.1) with the fact E 1 (T ) = 0, we will haveHowever, from (H 1 ) and (H 2 ), f (S, I 1 )I 1 is positive, then we will haveBut from the fourth equation of the system (1.1) with I 1 (T ) = 0, we will haveSince γ 1 > 0, we haveThis leads to contradiction. Similar proofs for E 2 (t), I 2 (t) and R(t).We conclude that T could not be finite, which implies that S(t) ≥ 0, E 1 (t) ≥ 0, E 2 (t) ≥ 0, I 1 (t) ≥ 0, I 2 (t) ≥ 0 , R(t) ≥ 0 for all positive times. This proves the positivity of solutions.About boundedness, let the total population(2.12)From the system (1.1), we haveand therefore,at t = 0, we have 15) then 16) consequentlysince 0 < e −δt ≤ 1, for all t ≥ 0, we conclude thatThis implies that N (t) is bounded, and so are S(t), E 1 (t), E 2 (t), I 1 (t), I 2 (t) and R(t). Thus, the local solution can be prolonged to any positive time, which means that the unique solution exists globally.In this subsection, we show that there exist a diseasefree equilibrium and three endemic equilibria. First, since the first five equations of the system (1.1) are independent of R and knowing that the number of the total population verifies the Eq. (2.14), so we can omit the sixth equation of the system (1.1). Therefore, the problem can be reduced to:(2.20)As usual, the basic reproduction number can be defined as the average number of new cases of an infection caused by one infected individual when all the population individuals are susceptibles. We will use the next generation matrix F V −1 to calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 . The formula that gives us the basic reproduction number is:where ρ stands for the spectral radius, F is the non-negative matrix of new infection cases and V is the matrix of the transition of infections associated with the model (2.19) . We haveSo,The basic reproduction number is the spectral radius of the matrix F V −1 . This fact implies thatwithand.(2.23)We denoteandWe call R 1 0 the strain 1 reproduction number and R 2 0 the strain 2 reproduction number. Proof In order to find the steady states of the system (2.19), we solve the following equationsFrom where, we obtain -When I 1 = 0 and I 2 = 0, we find the disease-free equilibrium-When I 1 = 0 and I 2 = 0, we find the strain 1 endemic equilibrium defined as followsDefine now a function Ψ on [0, +∞[ as followsusing the conditions (H 2 ) and (H 3 ), we deduce thatHence, there exists a unique strain 1 endemic equilibrium-When I 2 = 0 and I 1 = 0, we find the strain 2 endemic equilibrium defined as followsDefine also a function Φ on [0, +∞[ as followsHence, there exists a unique strain 2 endemic equilibrium-When I 1 = 0 and I 2 = 0, we find the third endemic equilibrium defined as followsTheorem 2 If R 0 ≤ 1, then the disease-free equilibrium E f is globally asymptotically stable.Proof First, we consider the following Lyapunov function in R 5 + :(3.1)The time derivative is given bẏWe will discuss two cases:then,By the above discussion, we deduce that, if R 2 0 ≤ 1 andThus, the disease-free equilibrium point E f is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 ≤ 1.For the global stability of E s 1 , we assume that the function f satisfies the following condition:Proof First, we consider the Lyapunov function L 1 defined by:The time derivative is given bẏ(3.14)We have(3.15) Therefore,(3.16)Then, (3.20) by the relation between arithmetic and geometric means, we haveWe discuss two cases:which implies,L 1 ≤ 0. By the above discussion, we deduce that if R 2 0 ≤ 1, we will haveL 1 ≤ 0.We conclude that the steady state E s 1 is globally asymptotically stable when R 2 0 ≤ 1 and 1 < R 1 0 .For the global stability of E s 2 , we assume that the function g satisfies the following condition: Proof First, we consider the Lyapunov function L 2 defined by:The time derivative is given bẏ(3.25) Therefore, By the relation between arithmetic and geometric means, we haveWe discuss two cases:• If S * 2 ≤ S, then from (H 2 ), we will have g(S * 2 , I * 2,s 2 ) g(S, I * 2,s 2 ) ≤ 1, since g(S * 2 , I * 2,s 2 ) g(S, I * 2,s 2 )0, from R 1 0 ≤ 1, we will haveL 2 ≤ 0.• If S ≤ S * 2 , then from (H 2 ) we will obtain g(S * 2 , I * 2,s 2 ) g(S, I * 2,s 2 )we will get g(S * 2 , I * 2,s 2 ) g(S, I * 2,s 2 )which implies,L 2 ≤ 0. By the above discussion, we deduce that if R 1 0 ≤ 1, thenL 2 ≤ 0.We conclude that the steady state E s 2 is globally asymptotically stable when R 1 0 ≤ 1 and 1 < R 2 0 .For the global stability of E t , we assume that the functions f and g satisfy the following condition:(3.32)The endemic equilibrium E s t is globally asymptotically stable when R 1 0 > 1 and R 2 0 > 1.Proof We consider the Lyapunov function L 3 defined by:(3.34)It is easy to verify that(3.35)As a result,Using the following trivial inequalitiesby the relation between arithmetic and geometric means, we havealso from (3.32) we haveWe conclude that the steady state E t is globally asymptotically stable when 1 < R 1 0 and 1 < R 2 0 .In this section, we will perform some numerical simulations in order to examine numerically the SEIR infection dynamics under various incidence functions and also validating our theoretical results. Indeed, we will restrict ourselves to four cases, the first one is to consider the model (1.1) along with the simplest two bilinear incidence functions f (S, I 1 ) = αS and g(S, I 2 ) = β S, the second case deals with two Beddington-DeAngelis incidence functions, f (S, I 1 ) = αS 1 + ω 1 S + ω 2 I 1 and g(S, I 2 ) = β S 1 + ω 3 S + ω 4 I 2 , while the third case is devoted to check the impact of choosing both incidence functions under Crowley-Martin incidence form, f (S, I 1 ) = αS 1 + χ 1 S + χ 2 I 1 + χ 1 χ 2 S I 1 and g(S, The disease-free equilibrium is characterized by the extinction of the infection, and the disease cannot invade the population. In this subsection, attention will be focused to the numerical stability of such diseasefree equilibrium. Indeed, Theorem 2 points out that we can expect the stability of disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. This permits us to look for the right model parameters in order to check numerically the stability of the first steady sate. Figure 2 shows the behaviour of the infection for the following parameter values: Λ = 1, α = 0.17, β = 0.15, γ 1 = 0.3, γ 2 = 0.4, μ 1 = 0.65, μ 2 = 0.75, δ = 0.2, ω 1 = 0.4, ω 2 = 0.6, ω 3 = 4.5, ω 4 = 5.8, χ 1 = 2.5, χ 2 = 3, χ 3 = 6.5, χ 4 = 5, α 1 = 2.5 and α 2 = 3. We clearly see that the solutions of the system, under the various suggested incidence functions (bilinear, Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin and non-monotonic functions), converge towards the same disease-free equilibrium point E f = (5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) . In this situation, the nature of the incidence function has no effect on the steady-state value. Consequently, it was remarked that the diseasefree equilibrium first nonzero component depends only on the birth and death rates of the susceptible individuals and does not depend, in any way, on the incidence functions parameters. Here, the disease dies out, the susceptible reaches their maximum value, and the other variables vanish. With the chosen parameters, we can easily calculate the two-strain basic reproduction numbers; in our case, we will have R 1 0 = 0.6 and R 2 0 = 0.5263 for the bilinear incidence functions case; we will have also R 1 0 = 0.1 and R 2 0 = 0.6579 for the Beddington-DeAngelis incidences case; R 1 0 = 0.1154 and R 2 0 = 0.1645 are calculated for Crowley-Martin incidence functions case, and finally, we have R 1 0 = 0.6 and R 2 0 = 0.5263 for the non-monotonic incidence functions case. In all these cases, we have the basic reproduction number R 0 is less than unity which is consistent with the theoretical result concerning the stability of the disease-free equilibrium E f .The dynamics behaviour concerning the stability of the strain 1 endemic equilibrium E s 1 is shown in Fig. 3 . in the figure the convergence towards the steady state (2.7223, 0.7592, 0, 0.5062, 0, 1.0123) and we have R 1 0 = 2.7778 and R 2 0 = 0.3789. We remark that, for the all four cases, the strain 1 basic reproduction number R 1 0 is greater than unity while the other strain 2 basic reproduction number R 2 0 is less than one which confirms our theoretical findings concerning the stability of the strain 1 endemic equilibrium E s 1 . This endemic equilibrium is characterized by the vanishing the strain 2 latent and infectious individuals.The strain 2 endemic equilibrium E s 2 stability is illustrated in Fig. 4 . In this figure, the following parameters are chosen: Λ = 1, α = 0.2, β = 0.4, γ 1 = 0.4, γ 2 = 0.3, μ 1 = 1, μ 2 = 0.5, δ = 0.2, ω 1 = 0.4, ω 2 = 0.85, ω 3 = 1.5, ω 4 = 0.05, χ 1 = 4, χ 2 = 3.5, χ 3 = 0.3, χ 4 = 0.05, α 1 = 2 and α 2 = 1.5. We observe the convergence of the solution towards the steady state (2.9167, 0, 0.8333, 0, 0.3571, 0.8928) for the bilinear incidence functions case and with the adopted parameters we have R 1 0 = 0.5556 and R 2 0 = 1.7143. For the model with Beddington-DeAngelis, we observe the convergence towards (4.1559, 0, 0.3376, 0, 0.1447, 0.3617) and we have R 1 0 = 0.5291 and R 2 0 = 6.8571; for the third case, Crowley-Martin incidence type, we observe the convergence towards the equilibrium (3.6876, 0, 0.5250, 0, 0.2250, 0.5624) and we have R 1 0 = 0.1502 and R 2 0 = 6.8571. For the last non-monotonic incidence functions case, we see in the figure the convergence towards the steady state (3.2918, 0, 0.6833, 0, 0.2928, 0.7321) and we have R 1 0 = 0.5556 and R 2 0 = 1.7143. We remark that, for all the four cases, the strain 1 basic reproduction number R 1 0 is less than unity while the other strain 2 basic reproduction number R 2 0 is greater than one which is in good agreement with our theoretical findings concerning the stability of the strain 2 endemic equilibrium E s 2 . From the components of this endemic equilibrium, we remark the clearance of the strain 1 latent and infectious individuals.The last endemic equilibrium E t stability behaviour is depicted in Fig. 5 for Λ = 1, α = 0.6, β = 0.6, γ 1 = 0.5, γ 2 = 0.5, μ 1 = 0.15, μ 2 = 0.15, δ = 0.2, 4898. About the last nonmonotonic incidence functions case, we see the convergence towards the steady state (0.8982, 0.5904, 0.5815, 0.8433, 0.8309, 1.2557) and we have R 1 0 = 6.1224 and R 2 0 = 6.1224. We remark that both the two-strain basic reproduction numbers R 1 0 and R 2 0 are greater than unity which confirms our theoretical findings concerning the stability of the last endemic equilibrium E t . This last endemic equilibrium is characterized by the persistence of all strains latent and infectious individuals. The numerical simulations confirm that the model with general incidence functions encompasses a large number of classical well-known incidence functions. Therefore, the generalized mathematical model can give a wide view about the stability of the different problem equilibria.As we have mentioned in the introduction, the recent pandemic COVID-19 is a multi-strain infection. Therefore, the main interest of this subsection is to compare the numerical simulations resulting from our multistrain epidemic model with COVID-19 clinical data.We have chosen to make our comparison the Moroc- can clinical data during the year 2020 in the period between March 31 and June 20 [39, 40] . Figure 6 shows the time evolution of infected cases for the following parameter values: Λ = 1.5, α = 1.67, β = 0.88, δ = 0.2, γ 1 = 1.05, γ 2 = 6.8, μ 1 = 0.005, μ 2 = 0.087, ω 1 = 0.3, ω 2 = 0.5, ω 3 = 0.1, ω 4 = 0.3, χ 1 = 0.01, χ 2 = 0.01, χ 3 = 2.5, χ 4 = 2.8, α 1 = 0.0005 and α 2 = 0.007. We observe that a significant relationship exists between the curve representing the COVID-19 clinical data and the numerical simulations resulting from our mathematical model for the different incidence functions. Indeed, a good fit between the infected cases given by the mathematical model and the clinical data is observed. Each numerical result with the incidence function (bilinear, Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin or non-monotonic function) fits well the clinical data, especially for a certain period of observation. Hence, the multi-strain mathematical model with generalized incidence functions is more appropriate to represent the studied disease. 7, α 1 = 2 and α 2 = 1.5. We see that the solution of our model, under the various suggested incidence functions, converges towards the same diseasefree equilibrium point E f . In this situation, the disease dies out, the susceptible reaches their maximum value and the other variables vanish. Within the chosen parameters, we can easily calculate the basic reproduction number; in our case we will have R 0 = 0.23 for the bilinear incidence functions case; we will have also R 0 = 0.28 for the Beddington-DeAngelis incidences case; R 0 = 0.2 are calculated for Crowley-Martin incidence functions case, and finally, we have R 0 = 0.23 for the non-monotonic incidence functions case.The COVID-19 disease persistence case is illustrated in Fig. 7 (right-hand side) . In this figure, the following parameters are chosen: Λ = 1.2, α = 0.1, β = 0.52, γ 1 = 0.4, γ 2 = 0.1, μ 1 = 0.23, μ 2 = 0.2, δ = 0.03, ω 1 = 0.5, ω 2 = 0.6, ω 3 = 0.1, ω 4 = 0.3, χ 1 = 1.5, χ 2 = 4.5, χ 3 = 0.7, χ 4 = 0.12, α 1 = 2 and α 2 = 1.5. We remark the convergence of the solution towards the endemic equilibrium for all the taken incidence functions. Indeed, for the case with bilinear incidence functions, we have the basic reproduction number is greater than unity R 0 = 14.31. For other cases, the basic reproduction number is also greater than one; indeed for Beddington-DeAngelis case, we have R 0 = 36.6956; for the third case, Crowley-Martin incidence type, we have R 0 = 14.3113. For the last non-monotonic incidence functions case, we have R 0 = 14.3113 which means that the disease persists. We can conclude that the numerical simulations fit well COVID-19 clinical data. Our numerical simulations reveal two scenarios of evolution for this pandemic, and within the first scenario the disease will die out. The other scenario happens when the basic reproduction number is greater than unity; in this case the disease will persist. In this situation, it will be important to eventually undertake some strategies like quarantine, isolation, wearing of masks, disinfection and if it will be possible vaccination.In this subsection, we will study the effect of quarantine strategy in controlling the infection spread. To illustrate this effect and for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the case of the bilinear incidence function. More precisely, we will take the following incidence forms: TimeS u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0.9 u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0.9 u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0I 2 u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0.9 u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0.9 u 1 = u 2 =0 u 1 = u 2 =0.3 u 1 = u 2 =0.6 u 1 = u 2 =0.9Effect of quarantine strategy on the SEIR model dynamics u 2 represents the efficacy of the quarantine measures concerning the second-strain infection rate. Our numerical simulations will be performed in order to check the impact of the quarantine strategy for the case of the last endemic equilibrium. Figure 8 shows the time evolution of the susceptible, the two-strain latent individuals, two-strain infected individuals and the recovered for the following parameter values: Λ = 1, α = 0.6, β = 0.6, γ 1 = 0.5, γ 2 = 0.5, μ 1 = 0.15, μ 2 = 0.15, δ = 0.2 and for different values of the strategy controls u 1 and u 2 . When no strategy is applied, we find the same result as in Fig. 5 . By increasing the efficiency of the quarantine measures, we observe an interesting result. Indeed, the number of the susceptible individuals increases when u 1 and u 2 increase. For higher values of these two control parameters, the number of two-strain latent and infected individuals is reduced considerably, which means that the quarantine strategy can reduce the infection in efficient manner.In this paper, we have studied the global stability of twostrain epidemic model with two general incidence functions. The model included six compartments, namely the susceptible, two categories of the exposed, two categories of the infected and the removed individuals, this kind of model takes the abbreviation SEIR. We have established the existence, positivity and boundedness of solutions results which guarantee the wellposedness of our SEIR model. The disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 1, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 2 and the endemic equilibrium with respect to both strains are given. By using an appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global stability of the equilibria is established depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 , the strain 1 reproduction number R 1 0 and the strain 2 reproduction number R 2 0 . Numerical simulations are performed in order to confirm our different theoretical results. It was observed that the model with a generalized incidence function encompasses a large number of classical incidence functions and it can give more clear view about the equilibria stability. In addition, a numerical comparison between our model results and COVID-19 clinical data is conducted. We have observed a good fit between our numerical simulations and the clinical data which indicates that our multistrain mathematical model can fit and predict the evolution of the infection. We have observed that strict quarantine measures can reduce significantly the infection spread. It is worthy to notice that a generalization form of this problem to a more complex compartmental model is proposed in Appendix of this paper. For this complex model, we have given its basic reproduction number and each strain reproduction number. Furthermore, the forms of the Lyapunov functionals for this complex compartmental model are also formulated.Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.The model is well defined, all solutions with nonnegative initial conditions exist, remain non-negative and bounded. Let N (t) be the total population, we have is positively invariant.The basic reproduction number is given by.(A. 7) and the strain i reproduction number is given by, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.(A.8)By simple reasoning, we can easily prove that this problem has 2 n steady states.It is clear that the disease-free equilibrium point E f ( Λ δ , 0, . . . , 0) is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 ≤ 1.In order to study the global stability for each equilibrium point E s i (∀ i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}), it appears that the Lyapunov functional can take the following form L i (S, E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E n , I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I n )The functions f i are assumed to verify the following condition: ","Morocco","first author","2020-09-08",9

Although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have also been proposed for the treatment of several viral infections, due to their antiviral effects in cell cultures and animal models [9] , and, currently, for the treatment of COVID-19 [3, [10] [11] [12] . The mechanism of action of chloroquine and its derivatives, both an antiviral and an anti-inflammatory, have not been fully elucidated. Certainly, there are many ways in which these drugs could exert their anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine act as weak bases which can have several intracellular effects, including affecting intracellular traffic and disrupting enzymes [13] . Studies of molecular docking and mechanic molecular simulation of Baildya et al. suggest that hydroxychloroquine could have a considerable effect on SARS-COV-2 main protease, which could have a significant inhibitory effect on it [14] .Unfortunately these two drugs have toxic effects and their use in high doses can create major risks for patients [14, 15] ; that is why the use of these drugs to treat covid-19 is not recommended by World HealthImidazole is a heterocyclic aromatic molecule; its structure has been of great importance to scientists in recent years due to its divergent synthetic strategies and different pharmacological activities, e.g. antivirals, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobials, anti-ulcer, etc. Due to the distinct mechanisms of actions, this area of research is always expanding [17] .Molecular docking is an effective method for predicting the structure of ligand / macromolecule complexes. Its use has grown over the years to become one of the most widely used techniques for the discovery and development of biologically active molecules. The general principle is to minimize a simplified potential energy function which measures the interaction between a ligand and a target macromolecule.Repositioning medications may be the only response to the epidemic of unexpected infectious diseases, due to the long time of producing new medicines. Among the drugs proposed to test the antiviral effect of COVID-19, we selected imidazole derivatives [3, 18] . To date, imidazole derivatives has been the first choice as an effective treatment for infections with Malaria, the principe is to replace diethylamine function of chloroquine by substituted imidazole derivatives containing tertiary terminal nitrogen [19] . This kind of compounds have been tested against Malaria infection to explore more active compounds than chloroquine [19] . Many papers reported the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 [3, 10, 11, 20] , today these two drugs are used in different hospitals around the world as antiviral treatment of COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus [12, 21] .Based on all these effects, the study of interactions between chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and the eighteen imidazole derivatives against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease are recommended.In this paper, the modeling interaction of eighteen imidazole derivatives against novel Coronavirus are performed using the molecular docking method followed by comparison with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine interactions formed in the same binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.The studied compounds were evaluated against novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The chemical compounds reported as potent Antiplasmodial inhibitors of imidazole derivatives based on 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline were taken from literature [19] . Each structure of 18 studied compounds is sketched and optimized with SYBYL program [22] , using the standard tripos molecular mechanics force field and energy gradient convergence criterion (0.01 kcal/mol), the partial atomic charges required for calculation of the electrostatic potential are assigned using the Gasteiger_Huckel formation [23, 24] .We performed a docking study of 18 imidazole derivatives (Table 1) , our research is based on crystal structures of studied enzyme with bound ligand molecules. This structure has been obtained from X-ray crystal data of RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) [25] , and we have determine the binding site location. The docking study was carried out with Autodock vina program [26] . bound peptidomimetic ligand [28] . The grid size was set at 20×34×20 xyz points with a grid spacing of 1 Å to cover the folic acid binding site in the enzyme and was generated by using the co-crystallized ligand (N3) as the center for docking [28] . For ligand and enzyme preparations; an extended PDB format, termed PDBQT, is used for coordinate files, which includes atomic partial charges and atom types using Autodock tools 1.5.6.Torsion angles were calculated to assign the flexible and non-bonded rotation of molecules. The results were subsequently analyzed using Discovery studio 2016 [29] .Journal Pre-proofMolecular docking was performed to find a type of interactions and binding affinity between 18 different imidazole derivatives and studied enzyme. Figure 1 shows the position of the best conformation of all studied compounds in the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (the co-crystallized ligand N3 is presented by yellow color) [30] . The result of molecular docking is presented in Table 2 . shows more type and number of interactions in comparison with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (πalkyl, π-Donor Hydrogen bond, π-Sigma, π-π T-shaped, π-Sulfure, Carbon-Hydrogen bond and Hydrogen bond interaction). Re-docking of the Co-Crystallized ligand was applied to validate the accuracy of the docking procedure. In this study, we have tried to carry out a docking study of chemical compounds reported as potent Antiplasmodial inhibitors of imidazole derivatives based on 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline and analogues in the active site of SARS-Cov-2 main protease, flowed by comparison with two drugs; chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.The result indicate that molecules N° 3, 7 and 14 have the best affinity in the binding pocket of studied enzyme than all studied molecules especially than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; that can indicate that these molecules could have the most potential antiviral treatment of COVID-19. The structures with best affinity in the binding site of the protease have more than three cycles and electronegative atoms in the structure. This may increase the binding affinity of these molecules because of formation of π-bonds, halogen J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f interactions and/ or Hydrogen bond interactions between compounds and the enzyme. So, compounds with more cycles and electronegative atoms could have more potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease than the reference compounds. So in this study, we describe the optimal binding features of imidazole derivatives based on 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline and analogues were with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Code PDB:6LU7) for further consideration. The synthesis of these molecules and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against COVID-19 could be interesting.","Morocco","first author","2020-09-18",9

The value of on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6.A mathematical basis has been obtained for using the logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of outbreaks with a small final outbreak size. The evolution of the outbreak in Mauritius was consistent with one modulated by a time-varying effective reproduction number resulting from the epidemic control measures implemented by Mauritius authorities and the PPMs adopted by Mauritius inhabitants. The value of ≈ 1.6 on the reopening of supermarkets on Day 16 was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case the Mauritius population did not comply with the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.Infectious diseases have seriously undermined global health for centuries [1, 2] . The rapidity of the spread of the diseases has increased many-fold with the globalisation of air travel [3] and the formation of air traffic hubs [4] . Contextually, the emergence of the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in late December 2019, [5] and its global spread as a pandemic [6] and manifestation in humans as the highly contagious respiratory disease COVID-19 [7] has been accompanied by large-scale efforts on several fronts to prevent its entry in many territories, contain its spread and mitigate its impact. Entry prevention has, to a large extent, depended on the country-closure of international borders and the quarantining of returning residents. Within countries, spread-containment has been based on active testing and contact tracing and the quarantining of positively-tested persons, lockdowns and the adoption of personal protective measures (PPMs) [8, 9] . Some countries have, however, relied on measures to flatten the epidemic curve, while protecting the more vulnerable persons, so as to alleviate the pressure on their health systems and with the possibility of reaching herdimmunity levels [10] .Mathematical models have significantly contributed to the understanding of the dynamics of infectious diseases. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model [11] provides a sound epidemiological basis for explaining the S-shape [12] of epidemic curves and explains the concept of herd-immunity from which vaccination-threshold levels can be calculated [11] . The inclusion of an exposed compartment generates the SEIR model which allows the inclusion of incubation and latent periods. More sophisticated models such as agent-based models can work at the level of individuals [13] . Logistic growth models are simpler but have nevertheless been widely used to describe epidemics [14, 15] . All these models have helped in informing and shaping policy decisions on effective responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Currently, more than 31 million cases of COVID-19 have been recorded worldwide with about 960,000 deaths. In Mauritius, the first three cases were reported on March 18 (Day 1) and the last locally transmitted case occurred on April 26 (Day 40). An island confinement was imposed on March 20 followed by a sanitary curfew on March 23. Supermarkets were closed as from March 25 (Day 8) and reopened on Day 16. There were a total of 332 cases, including 10 deaths, from Day 1 to Day 41. There were no cases for the next 18 days, following which there have been 34 new cases all of whom have been observed from passengers to Mauritius placed in quarantine. Control of the outbreak depended heavily on contact tracing, quarantine measures and the adoption of PPMs such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene by Mauritius inhabitants. Our objectives were to model and understand the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak using mathematical analysis, a logistic growth model and an SEIR compartmental model with quarantine and a reverse sigmoid effective reproduction number and to relate the results to the public health control measures in Mauritius.Compartmental models are widely used in epidemiological analysis [11] . Simple dynamical equations are used to describe the evolution of epidemics. The basic reproduction number and the concept of herd-immunity are easily understood within the framework of, for example, the SIR model where the population is compartmentalised in susceptible, infected and removed classes. Various extensions of the SIR model exist. We have used a susceptible-exposedinfectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) compartmental model to model the COVID-19 dynamics with the removed compartment consisting of both the recovered patients and the dead people. A schema of the model together with the dynamical equations used are shown in Exposed (E)The dynamical equation for the cumulative number of cases ( ) = + + + , = where is the total population, was analytically integrated with the substitution = − and the solution considered under the assumption that the incidence of infectious cases, , evolved as the derivative of the logistic growth function:(1).The logistic growth model was introduced by Verhulst in 1836 [16] as a model of population growth in a limited environment where if the population at time is ( ) thenis the logistic equation where is the growth rate, is the carrying capacity of the environment and (1 − / ) is a self-regulatory term which limits the growth of the population. The solution of the logistic equation is the logistic growth functionThe growth curve is S-shaped if (0) < /2. Several extensions of the Verhulst model have been proposed to address deviations from the symmetric shape of the logistic curve [15] .We have modelled the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, ( ), in Mauritius using the logistic growth functionwhere is the maximum cumulative case incidence (final outbreak size) and 1/ is the intrinsic growth rate during the exponential phase, 0 is the inflection point, the time where maximum number of cases per day occur. Computations were done using Python (with SciPy library) and MATLAB.The SEIQR dynamical equations were integrated using MATLAB. It was assumed that the effective reproduction number ( ) varied in time according to the reverse sigmoid model, with the inflection point and scale parameter now represented by and respectively. Referring to Figure 1 , the infection rate was ( ) = /( + 2 ) . As initial conditions, we used (0) = and 3 persons in the infectious compartment and none in the others. The values of , Simulations were performed for 2.5 ≤ (0) ≤ 6.0 over a range of and values. For every (0), and , the computed cumulative number of cases were compared with the reported cumulative incidence data using the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) as a comparative statistic. The NRMSE was defined asFrom the dynamical equations,where is the total population, = + + + and = − .On integration and assuming that evolves as the derivative of the logistic growth function as in Equation 1 , it follows that for ≪ and 0 significantly larger than b,. which corresponds to a logistic growth. Details are given in the Appendix.Corresponding to the basic premise of the logistic model, as of March 20, the cumulative COVID-19 cases curve of Mauritius can be described by a sigmoid curve with a single turning point (Figure 2 ). High correlations between the observed and predicted incidence were found (NRMSE = 0.0276, 2 = 0.9945).The optimal values of (0), and which gave the minimum NRMSE under the 10% constraint were found to be 4.0, 14.0 and 5.9 respectively. The variation of the reciprocal of the NRMSE for (0) = 4.0 is shown in Figure 3 as an intensity colormap. The intensity peak corresponds to the values of and for which the NRMSE is a minimum. The computed best-fit cumulative incidence curve (NRMSE = 0.0270, 2 = 0.9952) obtained using the optimal parameter values in the SEIQR simulations is shown in Figure 2 . The optimal ( ) is also shown. The value of on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6.The prediction of final epidemic sizes remains a challenging problem. Logistic models may require the presence of the inflection point in the reported data for good estimates. They, however, do not come with the epidemiological principles anchored in compartmental models such as the SEIR model, where, for example, the inflection of the epidemic curve can be explained using herd-immunity concepts. For the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius with a small final outbreak size, though, the inflection arises from a time-varying decreasing effective reproduction number resulting from control measures and compliance to PPMs and are not due to herd-immunity effects. SEIR models, such as the one used here, are themselves limited by the homogeneous mixing assumption and by the accuracy of the parameters used. Also, asymptomatic cases were not included. Additionally, the errors in the NRMSE calculations may not be normally distributed with the consequence that the mean may not be a complete statistic. However, in spite of these limitations, the models provide a good description of and insight in the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak.In particular, we have shown analytically how the solution of a simple SEIQR model tends to a logistic equation under the assumption that the final outbreak size is small, that the number of cases at the point of inflection is sufficiently large and that the incidence of infectious cases evolves as the derivative of the logistic growth function. Computationally, a good fit was obtained for the epidemic curve of the reported cumulative number of cases using a threeparameter logistic growth model. An equally good fit was also computationally obtained using the SEIQR model with an optimal reverse sigmoid time-varying effective reproduction number. Importantly, the value of ≈ 1.6 on the day of the reopening of supermarkets was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case of the non-compliance of the population to the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.AG did the logistic modelling.

Like common viral diseases, fighting the spread of the novel COVID-19 virus is a complicated mission and requires coordinated efforts by public healthcare authorities. COVID-19 was caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. At the time of writing this paper, countries, where the outbreak has exceeded China, are USA, Italy and Spain. Countries like South Korea has been proven that early diagnosis is one of the most effective factors in controlling the disease and preventing its spread.A large number of infections and the high speed of spread of COVID-19 around the world confirms that the virus is transmitted through carriers or between people, which poses a serious challenge to control its spread. 1,2,3 Therefore, various comprehensive preventive measures such as social distancing have to be taken worldwide to reduce the spread of infection. However, the ultimate measure to end the coronavirus pandemic is the creation of an effective vaccine. Experts and governments recognise that a vaccine may not be ready before 2 years, and this is not an inevitability. Therefore, an effective and immediate prevention mechanism must be adopted until a vaccine is developed.The novel Coronavirus has an incubation period that begins from the first date of contact with the source of the virus and the date when symptoms appear on the virus carrier. The general symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, nausea and shortness of breath. 4 Most viral chest diseases, for example, as H1N1, H5N1 and influenza, have the same symptoms as COVID-19 which may lead to the wrong diagnosis. The most common tools for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), assay or a chest CT scan. The PCR method detects viral nucleic acids directly, but the chest CT scan determines volumes of infection in a segment, one side or both sides of the lung. 5 In this article, we start by reviewing the role of various smart spaces enabling technologies in the efforts to compact the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, we propose an IoT-based model to outline the data flow between various smart spaces entities and demonstrate the potential in tracking, tracing, monitoring, imposing, controlling and even developing a vaccine for COVID-19. Then, we study the symptoms of the COVID-19 and the CT scan results to assist doctors inaccurate diagnosis of the disease by comparison with the other four viral chest diseases, namely, H1N1, H5N1, SARS and Hantavirus. This study formulates the evaluation of the symptoms and the CT imaging results as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The criteria are the symptoms and the CT imaging results, and the alternatives are the viral chest diseases including COVID-19. The research considers the MCDM-driven evaluation under an uncertainty environment to achieve a more accurate evaluation. The proposed diagnosis model employs the best-worst method (BWM) technique in order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) under a plithogenic environment.The contribution of this work is four-folds. First, it aims to show the value of studying all aspects of the COVID-19 under uncertainty conditions. Second, an integrated IoT-based model for monitoring COVID-19 patients is presented. Third, we provide a model to evaluate the symptoms of the most viral chest diseases and the CT imaging results using the BWM. Third, we apply the proposed evaluation model to assess the five viral chest diseases based on a plithogenic set. Fourth, we combine the BWM with TOPSIS to attain a reliable framework that applies under uncertainty environment.The rest of the paper is organised as follows: A literature review on COVID-19 impact and detection methods is presented in Section 2. Section 3 represents the preliminaries of COVID-19 and other relevant viral chest diseases. Section 4 proposes an IoT model for monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Section 5 gives the definitions and methods that constitute the proposed diagnosis model. In Section 6, the application of the proposed model to evaluate the symptoms and the CT imaging results of viral chest diseases are presented. Section 7 presents new directions that may help in studying the outbreak of COVID-19. Section 8 concludes the article and gives future work avenues.At the end of December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases were registered in Wuhan city in China for unspecified reasons. In the first week of January 2020, researchers confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia which was named SARS-CoV-2. 6 This virus was confirmed and classified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 7 On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The main symptoms that appear on most patients are fever (98%), cough (76%), shortness of breath (55%), fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), headache (8%), haemoptysis (5%) and diarrhoea (3%). 8 Figure 1 shows the spread of COVID-19 around the world. 9 A turning point for this epidemic would be the development of a vaccine. However, WHO estimates that this could take 18 months. 6 Until this time, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatments have been used to treat the symptoms of the virus. Thus, preventing the spread of the virus remains the first line of defence until a vaccine is developed. Concurrently, effective infection methods tools remain critical in the treatment and control of COVID-19 infections.In the last few months, thousands of studies on COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, control and impact appeared in the literature. Devaux of COVID-19 with suggestions for patients who may need antibiotic treatment. 15 Shen et al. summarised the currently available detection methods for COVID-19 to assist researchers in developing better tools for the detection of the infection. 11 Kooraki et al. studied radiology can support epidemiologists with the diagnosis of COVID-19. 10 Bonilla-Aldana et al. gathered information about COVID-19 using an Internet-based reporting system and proposed an improvement to the ProMED system to improve its efficiency during the outbreak. 16 From an economic perspective, McKibbin and Fernando examined the impacts of COVID-19 on macroeconomic outcomes in different scenarios. 17 Anderson et al. studied the impact of government strategies in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. 18 In the literature, MCDM methods have proven effective in many healthcare data-focused applications. Recently, Stevic et al. applied the MARCOS method in the evaluation of sustainable supplier selection in the healthcare industry. 19 Bhalaji et al. assessed the risk factors facing the healthcare product development process under a fuzzy environment. 20 Fei et al. evaluated the hospital service factors under uncertainty as an MCDM problem using BWM based on belief function theory (BFT). 21 In this work, we advance the literature with a new COVID-19 diagnosis model that employs BWM technique in order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) under a plithogenic environment. We combine the BWM with TOPSIS to attain a reliable framework that applies under uncertainty environment.Smart technologies are playing a vital role in the fight against COVID-19 such as predicting the disease spread patterns, the chance of infection, the opportunity of recovery, track and trace, amongst other uses. This section review some of the key smart spaces enabling technologies and how they are being used in the current pandemic.• • Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is used for analysing and mining big data to build models to perceive, illustrate and estimate various COVID-19 patterns. It is also used in the development of vaccines and drugs. In many countries, AI is driving robots that perform sterilisation and disinfection operations, and are used in the manufacturing processes of medical equipment needed in the healthcare sector. • • IoT: IoT, specifically wearable and personal, devices are being used for collecting valuable data such as body temperature and geographical location of individuals. Amongst the many applications of IoT in the fight against COVID-19 is on drones to monitor quarantine operations as well as track and trace of people who may have contracted COVID-19. • • Big data mining: The information held in the huge volumes of data collected by medical personal, researchers, IoT devices, mobile networks or even crowed sourced can help decision-makers take the right actions at the right time to control the pandemic. • • Virtual reality (VR): VR proved to be a very useful tool for remote cooperation, training and communication without the need for real contact or travel. • • Cloud computing: It allows connecting and sharing of computer system resources such as processing power, storage resources, databases, networks and others through the Internet. This technology helps increase resource efficiency and reduce operating costs. Cloud computing helped solve many problems caused by the quarantine that was imposed to limit the spread of the virus. Applications have been introduced that help people continue their digital lives naturally such as Zoom video, Slack, Netflix through services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.• • Autonomous robots: Autonomous robots are AI-enabled robots used to collect information about the surrounding environment without assistance. They are being used on both the air and ground to monitor quarantine measures, social distancing and • • 3D scanning: This type of scanning is often used to perform human body imaging in the medical field, where it collects data on the shape and appearance of the body. It helps in the fight to compact COVID-19 through the thoracic chest scanning. It is also a valuable tool for identifying and quantifying COVID-19 viruses.In the following, we illustrate an IoT-enabled model for detecting and monitoring COVID-19 patients using several body sensors. This model illustrates the contribution of smart technologies to effectively compact the COVID-19 pandemic. Information about the patient's health is collected through various body sensors. As shown in Figure 2 , body sensors monitor the patient's health condition, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory monitoring, glucose detection, etc. This data is relayed through a gateway to a cloud platform where it can be processed and analysed. The databases contain AI-enabled expert systems that can classify the patient's condition. If a patient is diagnosed as being infected with or suspected to be infected with the virus, one of the following procedures can be taken: (1) The doctor determines based on the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient whether the patient needs to be tested, transferred to a hospital or simply being monitored closely at home; (2) If the patient is diagnosed as unstable and needs intensive care, a report will be sent to the patient and his local healthcare centre/hospital and an ambulance will be dispatched to transfer the patient to the hospital with free space to provide the needed care.The system stores all the results of medical examinations and CT images that were made for the patient in the cloud databases for the doctors to follow the development of the patient's treatment. The remote monitoring, pooling or resources, data analysis and intelligent decision making has been determined as a key to successful utilisation of resources.A Model for the Effective COVID-19 Identification in Uncertainty Environment Using Primary Symptoms and CT ScansIn this section, we give the details of the various constituents of the proposed model for effectively identifying COVID-19 in uncertainty environment using primary disease symptoms and CT scans.Ever since Florentin Smarandache introduced the theory of neutrosophic in 1998, it has been extensively applied in healthcare research. For instance, 22 proposed an IoT-based framework for cancer diagnosis based on the neutrosophic set and 23 proposed a medical image denoising method based on the neutrosophic set. 23 Plithogenic is a generalisation of crisp, fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic set introduced by Smarandache. 22 A plithogenic set (P, A, V, d, c) is a set that comprises elements characterised by attributes' value V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . ., v n }, for n ⩾ 1, each attribute value has an appurtenance degree concerning some given criteria. The set attributes denoted as A = {α 1 , α 2 ,. . ., α m }, m ⩾ 1. The main contribution of the plithogenic set is to have more accurate aggregation operators which can be applied by the contradiction degree function c(v, D) that describes the relationship between attribute values and the dominant. Appurtenance degree function of the element x concerning set of given criteria is noted as d(x,v). 24 The attribute value contradiction degree function used in the plithogenic set operators are Intersection (AND), Union (OR), Implication (=>), Equivalence (). Definition 1. Let  a a a a = ( )be two plithogenic sets. The plithogenic intersection is given as:, .(The plithogenic union is given as: , .(wherewhere, t norm = ∧ F b=ab, t conorm a∨ F b=a+b−abBWM is a simple vector-based method that requires fewer pairwise comparison than the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). BWM requires 2n-3 comparisons, whereas AHP requires n (n-1)/2 comparisons. 25 BWM provides more consistent comparisons than AHP, hence, it provides more reliable results. 26 It compares the best criterion and the worst criterion with the rest of the problem criteria. 27 The steps of the BWM are as follows: }, where c is the preference of criteria n compared by the Best criterion B. In this step, decision-makers determine their judgement, using a number from 1 to 9 (where 1 is equally significant and 9 is extremely significant). w j ≥ 0, for all j TOPSIS TOPSIS is a popular MCDM technique that aims to find the least and most distance between negative and positive ideal solution. 28 It chooses the alternative that has the shortest distance from a positive ideal solution and farthest from the negative ideal solution. The steps of TOPSIS operation are as follows:1. Build the evaluation matrix  D, where i is the alternative and j is the criteria, using equation 7. 2.Normalise the evaluation matrix using equations 8 and 9. 3. Calculate the weighted normalised evaluation matrix using equation 10 .where w j is the priority of each criterion.Determine the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution using equations 11-14:) | } . 1 (14) where J b is a set of beneficial criteria, and J nb is a set of non-beneficial criteriaCalculate the distance of each alternative from PIS and NIS using equations 15 and 16. In this section, we present the details of an integrated MCDM method which is based on the plithogenic set to improve the accuracy of the evaluation process. This method integrates the features of the plithogenic set with BWM and TOPSIS. In this method, the plithogenic set provides accurate aggregation results while considering uncertainty, BWM evaluates the optimal weights of the criteria and TOPSIS determines the ranking of the optimal alternatives by measuring their distance from the positive and negative ideal solutions. a) Each decision-maker k builds the evaluation matrix using the triangular neutrosophic evaluation scale (see Table 1 ). b) Aggregate the k decision matrices into a single decision matrix of all decision-makers' evaluations using plithogenic aggregation using equations (10) (11) (12) . c) For simplification purposes, de-neutrosophication the aggregated decision matrix into crisp values using Eq. 18.S a ( ) = + + × + − − 1 8 2Calculate the normalised and weighted normalised decision matrices according to Eq. 16, 17, and 18. Calculate the distance and the closeness coefficient using equations 11-15, and rank the alternatives according to the closeness coefficient.The symptoms of COVID-19 appear differently from one patient to another making accurate diagnosis a challenging task. However, like other viral chest diseases, COVID-19 has a set of common symptoms that appear on patients. Consequently, doctors face a serious challenge in the diagnosis of suspect cases before performing the PCR, that is, to take a preliminary decision on whether to perform further procedures. This adds to the doctor a sense of uncertainty in the diagnosis of this disease. Hence, this study attempts to assist doctors inaccurate diagnosis of COVID-19 through assessing patient's symptoms and the CT imaging result to differentiate them from four other common viral chest diseases under the uncertainty environment. Table 2 shows the main symptoms and the CT image results that will be used in distinguishing of COVID-19 against H1N1, H5N1, Hantavirus and SARS. In the following, we detail the application of the proposed integrated method to evaluate the symptoms and the CT imaging result of differentiating between five viral chest disease including COVID-19. The first step of this method is measuring the priority of symptoms to each other and also to the results of the patient's CT image. To do so, the problem dimension must be specified first. The criteria in this application will be the common symptoms of viral chest diseases. The alternatives will be the five viral chest diseases. And the decision-makers in this problem are the specialists and doctors. In this application, we selected three doctors are specialised in this field to assist in these evaluations.To calculate the weights of the symptoms, we determine cough as the best criterion and shortness of breath to be the worst. Best-to-others vector and others-to-worst vector are determined as specified in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. In many studies, 2,3 it has been proven that cough and high fever are the first symptoms to appear on a COVID-19 patient. Using the BWM model described in Table 5 , we found that the weight of cough = 0.3133 and the weight of fever = 0.1920 as the highest two weights; hence, they are considered carefully. BWM evaluates the CT imaging result, where the best result will be the occurrence of Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO), while the worst is the occurrence of GGO with Consolidation Effusion. The result of the BWM model for evaluating the weight of each CT image is shown in Table 6 . Using the neutrosophic evaluation scale shown in Table 1 , each doctor constructs his own opinion about the evaluation of the five diseases according to the set of symptoms, as shown in Table 7 . Then, the three doctors' evaluation matrices are aggregated using plithogenic aggregation operator based on equidistant contradiction degrees as shown in Table 8 . This is followed by de-neutrosophication of the aggregated evaluation matrix using equation 18. Table 9 shows the crisp evaluation matrix. Table 10 shows the normalised evaluation matrix. Using equation 10, the weighted normalised evaluation matrix is calculated in Table 11 . The weight in this step is calculated using the BWM model. The ranking of the five viral chest diseases according to the symptoms using the TOPSIS method is given in Table 12 . The results of TOPSIS show that the patient with most of these symptoms is diagnosed with COVID-19 where CC = 0.985748, while SARS at the end of ranking with CC = 0.126606. The five viral chest diseases are ranked as follows: COVID-19 > H1N1 > H5N1 > Hantavirus > SARS (see Figure 4) .One of these research objectives is to apply the proposed method to evaluate the five virus chest diseases according to the common symptoms firstly and then using the CT imaging result. Table 13 shows the three doctors evaluation of the type of diseases according to the CT imaging. The aggregation of the three doctors' evaluation is shown in Table 14 . While the weighted normalised matrix is shown in Table 15 . Finally, the evaluation of the five viral chest diseases using TOPSIS is shown in Table 16 . The results of TOPSIS show that the patient with this CT imaging of CC = 0.8876 is mostly will be diagnosed COVID-19 positive, while Hantavirus came last with CC = 0.1692. The studied five viral chest diseases are ranked as follows: COVID-19 > SARS > H1N1 > H5N1 > Hantavirus (see Figure 5 ). Figure 6 shows the ranking of the five diseases is almost similar to the one performed according to the common symptoms and the CT imaging results. The doctors' assessment results are based on the fact that COVID-19 is the most prevalent infection of this period. However, the PCR analysis is necessary to prevent any misdiagnosis.In this article, we proposed an integrated MCDM method under uncertainty environment. This method integrates the benefits of the BWM and TOPSIS to evaluate a set of alternatives according to decision criteria. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this method by achieving accurate results when applied in a plithogenic environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it for the evaluation of five viral chest diseases that exhibit similar symptoms to COVID-19 using their common symptoms and CT imaging results. The plithogenic aggregation operations contradiction degree feature increases the accuracy of the aggregation. Moreover, the TOPSIS is applied based on the weights calculated by the BWM to further improve the reliability of the method.The future research directions for the study of COVID-19 are many and varied as we continue to learn about the behaviour and characteristics of this virus. By the time we completed this study, the WHO added more symptoms of COVID-19 such as the loss of taste and smell. We plan to repeat our experiments with more symptoms and bigger datasets when they become available. We also plan to continue the technological developments that aim to compact the spread of COVID-19. Detecting infected cases and tracing people who may be infected is a daunting task in which technology may play an effective role. In this area of study, we intend to explore how adding data from track and trace systems, that is, whether a person came in contact with a COVID-19 patient, could improve the diagnosis accuracy.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Mohamed Abdel-Basst https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2794-3936","Egypt","first author","2020-09-04",9

As the armed combat can affect the prevalence of COVID-19 in the surrounding communities, the prevalence of COVID-19 in each city was recorded along with the distance to the fighting on the front lines. Distant cities were defined as those over 100 km away from the fighting area and adjacent cities as those within 100 km. A map of the regional distribution of COVID-19 from March 25 to June 25 in Libya was made, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was color coded on the map.Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 12.0 were used for data entry and analysis. The continuous variables included the daily cumulative number of cases, the daily number of newly confirmed cases, the number of deaths, and the numbers of severe and recovered cases [21] . The data were summarized as means ± standard deviation or medians, and the percentage of patients in each group was calculated. The available data were plotted to show the daily number of cumulative cases for each region and province. The geographical distribution of COVID- 19 Given that the southern region has the smallest population, COVID-19 prevalence was highest in the south (292, 41.8 % of all cases). There were 235 cases (33.7%) in the western region, which is the most populous, and 171 cases (24.5%) in the eastern region. reuse, remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors.this preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain.

This parallels, to a much smaller extent, the pandemic spread from Wuhan to the neighboring provinces and then all over China, and the Italian scenario, where the pandemic started in northern Italy, which at one time accounted for as much as 71.5% of the cases and 81.8% of the deaths, and then spread over the rest of Italy [26, 27] .Comparison of the epidemiologic situations in different parts of Libya indicates that the ongoing armed conflict has affected the geographic spread of COVID-19 in two ways. On the one hand, it hindered access to populations and thus masked the actual status of the pandemic, particularly in cities such as Tarhona, Tawerga and Sert. On the other hand, it aggregated the spread of the pandemic to distant cities such as Sebha. Hence, the cross-national variation in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases due the armed conflict is evident. Intervention strategies should be planned with that in mind [28, 29] .Controlling the emergence of infectious diseases in conflict situations is challenging because the fighting creates situations that facilitate the emergence of infectious diseases and enhance their transmission.

The virus was found to phylogenetically belong to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lu, Zhao, et al., 2020) . The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 (C. S. G. of the International, 2020; Gorbalenya, 2020) , and the disease named coronavirus disease-19 . The entry of the virus into host cells is facilitated by binding of its transmembrane spike (S) protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . The spike protein is a class I viral fusion transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a dual role in viral entry and fusion with host cell membrane (Bosch et al., 2003; Li, 2016) . Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed the structure of S protein as trimeric spikes composed of three S1 and S2 heterodimer subunits, protruding out of the viral envelope (Gui et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020) . The S1 subunit facilitates viral binding to cell receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas the S2 subunit encloses a hydrophobic fusion domain, allowing viral fusion (Song et al., 2018) . Cleaving the S1-S2 boundary is primed by host cell proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and is required for viral activation and entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . TMPRSS2 and ACE-2 are highly expressed in the epithelial tissue of multiple organs and thus significantly contribute to viral pathogenicity, clinical manifestations, and mortality (Sungnak et al., 2020) .One of the clinical indicators of the severity of SARS-CoV-2 is low lymphocytic count (lymphopenia) , especially in the CD8 þ , CD4 þ , and CD3 þ T lymphocyte populations (Zeng, 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . Lymphopenia is a risk factor in viral infections, and was reported to predict the severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Gui et al., 2017) .Although several studies examined the causes of lymphopenia during viral infections (Lalueza et al., 2017 (Lalueza et al., , 2019 , the mechanisms underlying this feature are not fully understood in COVID-19 patients. Proposed mechanisms for the observed lymphopenia include direct invasion of lymphocytes , hyperlactic acidemia causing suppression of lymphocyte proliferation (Fischer et al., 2007) , as well as an inflammatory cytokine storm resulting in lymphocyte apoptosis (Liao et al., 2002) , similar to that reported earlier with MERS-CoV infection (Chu et al., 2016) .Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE-2 receptor, has been shown to provide an entry point to SARS-CoV-2 in different types of human cells Zhou et al., 2020) . However, T lymphocytes were shown to be consistently negative for ACE-2 receptors (Hamming et al., 2004) , suggesting an alternate route for viral entry. CD147 was recently proposed as a probable route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into Vero E6 host cells (Wang, 2020) . CD147 (also known as Basigin or EMMPRIN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that was originally identified in 1992 as a T lymphocyte activation-associated antigen (Kasinrerk et al., 1992) . Further research confirmed its expression on activated T lymphocytes and its relatively weaker expression in resting T lymphocytes, and that its expression increases rapidly upon T lymphocyte activation (Koch et al., 1999) . CD147 induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production during physiological and pathological events including inflammatory response, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis (Cruzat et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Kato et al., 2009; Ungern-Sternberg et al., 2018) . Interestingly, CD147 receptor is expressed on red blood cells (RBCs), providing a route for malaria entry (Zhang et al., 2018) . It is worth mentioning that PfRH5 complex on the cell membrane of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, interacts with CD147 on human RBCs, a binding which was necessary for invasion by all strains when tested in vitro (Crosnier et al., 2011) . Anti-CD147 antibodies were shown to prevent entry of P. falciparum and SARS-CoV-2 into host cells (Bian, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018) .To understand the mechanism of interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the CD147 receptor, we have performed a four-stage in-silico study. First, the binding site of both proteins had to be accurately predicted, taking into consideration the few number of their available crystal structures. Second, molecular docking was performed using three different protein-protein interaction servers. Then, the best docking pose was analyzed in MD simulation to check its stability. Finally, the binding free energy was estimated, using snapshots of the MD simulation, to get in-depth knowledge of the binding determinants.The study starts with determination of the most probable binding sites for spike and CD147. This was specially challenging for the latter because only few crystal structures were reported for this membrane glycoprotein. Later, the molecular docking was performed using three different web servers and the best pose was selected using the PDBePISA website. Then, the best complex was subjected to a 100 ns MD simulation in NPT ensemble. Finally, free energy calculation was performed to gain insights into the major contributing forces in binding and the critical residues involved.The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) was obtained from its crystal structure complexed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (PDB ID: 6LZG), while that of CD147 was isolated from its crystal structure complexed with malaria invasion protein, reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH5) attained from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PDB ID: 4U0Q). The crystal structures of both targeted proteins, SARS-CoV-2 and CD147, were closely examined for integrity and the active residues taking part in the interaction were identified. The surface of CD147 was examined using the Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) server. The default probe radius used by CASTp is 1.4 Å. We opted to use a smaller probe of 0.8 Å to get more exhaustive coverage of all the potential binding sites on the CD147 surface.Prior to the docking simulation, both proteins, spike and CD147, were checked for errors and prepared in the Protein Preparation Wizard, within MOE software. The preparation steps include removal of any bound ligands, water of crystallization, and salts. Also, all the hydrogens were added and the protein termini were capped. Both proteins were minimized individually in MOE to a gradient of 0.001 kcal/mol.Å 2 . First, all heavy atoms were kept fixed, and the hydrogen atoms were allowed to optimize their positions. Second, the entire backbone of the protein was kept fixed and the side chains were minimized using the same parameters. Finally, the whole molecule including the backbone was minimized (Helal et al., 2011; Helal & Avery, 2012) . Three different webdocking servers, HADDOCK v2.2, ZDOCK v3.0.2, and HawkDock 2018, were utilized to computationally predict the protein-protein interactions of the two unbound protein structures. The docking trial on each server was repeated twice using the default settings; in the first run no restraints was given to the server so that it can freely determine the binding region (interface) for each protein. This step was performed to find out to which extent the software would bias toward a specific docking pose. In the second run on each server, specific active residues were defined for the software to be considered as restraints (see the discussion part). These residues were selected based on our understanding of the crystal structures of both SARS-CoV-2-RBD/hACE2 and CD147 RH5 as well as the prediction by CASTp server.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using GROMACS 2019 software package and the all-atom OPLS force field. The protein complex was solvated in a cubic box of SPC water model of 100 Â 100 Â 100 Å size and Periodic boundary conditions were implemented. Ionizable residues were assigned standard ionization states at PH 7. The system was then neutralized by the addition of five sodium ions. The total number of atoms in the system, including the water and ions, was 117,013. Short-range interactions were treated with a 10 Å cutoff for both Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials, while the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was used for long-range electrostatics. The MD simulation was performed in four steps. During the first three steps, a force constant of 1000 kJ mol À1 nm À2 was used to restrain all the heavy atoms to preserve the original fold of the proteins. First, the solvated protein system was minimized using a 5000 steps of steepest descent algorithm to resolve any steric clashes or inappropriate geometry. Then, to ensure a reasonable starting structure, the system was equilibrated under constant Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature (NVT) ensemble for 100 ps using Berendsen thermostat (Golo & Sha K %tan, 2002) . The second round of equilibration was performed under constant pressure (NPT ensemble) using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat for an additional 100 ps (Tuble et al., 2004) . Finally, the position restraints were released and the system was simulated in the production run under an NPT ensemble (Nos e-Hoover thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat) for 100 ns using a time step of 2 fs. Simulation results were analyzed using the Visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software, ver. 1.9.3 (Humphrey et al., 1996) . Pymol graphical software ver. 2.3 was used for the generation of the figures of protein-protein interactions.Binding free energy was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method with the g_mmpbsa script. This method calculates the binding energy using molecular mechanics potential energy (electrostatic and van der Waals interactions) and free energy of solvation (polar and nonpolar solvation energies). A total number of 100 snapshots, extracted at regular intervals from the whole MD trajectory, were used for calculating each energy term. The average for each term was then calculated. In addition, a per-residue binding free energy decomposition at each snapshot was performed and the average binding energy for each residue was calculated and depicted. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) model was used to compute non-polar solvation energy with a surface tension of 0.02267 (kJ/mol 2 ) and a probe radius of 1.4 Å.The recently reported crystal structure of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein complex with ACE2 (PDB ID: 6LZG) reveals that the virus utilizes the external subdomain of the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to recognize the human ACE2 receptor . This external subdomain is composed mainly of a flexible loop, S438-Y508, connecting two anti-parallel small b strands. Also, a part of this loop, the segment F486-G502, represents the most solvent accessible part of the spike RBD and makes direct contact with ACE2 in the crystal structure. In addition, in a recent in-silico study, it was proposed that a small circular region of this loop, C480-C488, could be responsible for the interaction with the human GRP78 (Ibrahim et al., 2020) . Collectively, these findings have convinced us to use the solvent-accessible F486-G502 segment as the interaction site of the spike protein in our docking simulation. Regarding the CD147 receptor, the only crystal structure available of this protein, bound to another biological molecule, is for its complex with the PfRH5 protein (PDB ID: 4U0Q) (Wright et al., 2014) . In this structure, the PfRH5 binds to the cleft between the two domains of CD147 assisted by a network of H-bond and salt bridge interactions. Notably, the glycoprotein CD147 is a relatively small protein and few pockets could be noticed on its surface. To get an accurate prediction of the potential binding site on CD147, we have performed a comprehensive search for its surface pockets using the Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) server (Tian et al., 2018) . This tool enables an exhaustive and quantitative characterization of the protein topographic features, providing a complete list of the available pockets with the amino acid residues lining these pockets. Figure 1 (A) shows the pockets with significant volume (>15 Å 3 ) on CD147 surface. Among them, pockets 1, 3, 4, and 6 are the most solvent accessible and constitute a nearly continuous grove extending at the interface of the two domains of CD147. Furthermore, according to the crystal structure 4U0Q, the PfRH5 protein uses pockets 1 (124.67 Å 3 ) and 6 (72.57 Å 3 ) for interaction with CD147. In addition to the CASTp server, we have also used the CPROT tool (Bonvinlab) which is an algorithm for the prediction of protein-protein interface merging six calculation methods into a consensus result (de Vries & Bonvin, 2011) . Interestingly, the CPROT results were very similar to those of CASTp with most residues of pockets 1 and 6 identified (Figure 1(B) ). Therefore, we have selected the residues of these pockets, 1 and 6, as the active residues in our docking study, namely Ser78, Asp79, Gln81, Trp82, Gly103, Pro104, Pro105, Arg106, Val 107, Lys108, Lys127, Ser128, Glu129, Ser193, and Asp194. (Table S1 , Supporting Information).Molecular docking was performed using three different protein-protein docking servers, namely HADDOCK v2. interacting, residues as the segment F486-G502 of the spike RBD and the residues of pockets 1 and 6 of the CD147 as illustrated in the previous section. In order to evaluate the docking results of the three software servers, the top ranking pose from each was examined using the PDBePISA online tool, developed by The European Bioinformatics Institute, EMBL-EBI, for the exploration of macromolecular interfaces (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) . Moreover, a Molecular Mechanics energies combined with Generalized Born and Surface Area (MM/GBSA) calculation, as implemented within the Hawkdock server, was used to estimate the binding affinities (Hou et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2020) . The results of the examination of the top complex generated by each software are illustrated in Table 1 . Interestingly, all the three servers returned very similar arrangements of the interacting proteins with RMSD of 2.23 for ZDOCK/HADDOCK and 0.24 for HawkDOCK/HADDOCK. Moreover, for each server, performing the docking run without specifying any constraints returned quite a similar docking pose, to the one with constraints, within the top ten out of more than one hundred solutions (data not shown). Based on the RMSD values and visual examination, it was noticed that the poses proposed by HADDOCK and HawkDOCK are very close and almost converging. We decided to use the pose generated by the HADDOCK server as it shows a higher interface surface area of 1,069 Å 2 and the best score of À68.00 in the MM/GBSA calculations (Table 1 ).In addition, thorough investigations were carried out using PDBePISA tool to determine the key interacting residues in the selected docked complex generated by the HADDOCK server. Only interfacing residues within 4 Å van dar Waals distance cutoff between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and CD147 were examined by the PDBePISA algorithm (Table S3 , Supporting Information). It can be easily noted that the docked SARS-CoV-2 RBD adopted a similar orientation to that observed in its cocrystal structure with hACE2, which highlights the binding role of the region that extends between the residues C480 and Q505 (Figure 2 ). The spike external subdomain forms a surface to which parts of CD147 domains dock. This surface is dominated by the interaction of the C-terminal domain of CD147 which binds to the spike external subdomain in the grove between the short antiparallel b strands b1' and b2' and the small helix a1' (Figure 2(A) ). This grove makes contacts with nearly 50% of the C and F strands of CD147. On the other domain of CD147, parts of the A and G strands forms a complementary surface to the cyclic highly solvent-accessible segment C480-C488 of the spike RBD.In the predicted complex, a row of hydrophilic residues along the interface formed strong and intricate polar contacts ( Figure 3 ). The most important interacting residues from both sides, together with the distances between each pair, are listed in Table 2 . Strong polar contacts were found to involve the spike RBD residues Gln493 and Ser494 with the side chain of Thr135 in CD147. Also, the side chain nitrogen of the spike Gln493 makes a 3.00 Å H bond with the hydroxy group of Ser190 in CD147. In addition, the backbone carbonyl of spike Glu484 formed a strong H bond (2.5 Å) with the backbone NH of Gln100 in CD147. Moreover, the side chain NH 2 of Asn481 on the cyclic segment of the spike b1'/b2' loop formed a bidentate H-bonds with the backbone of Phe27 and side chain OH of Thr28 in CD147. Another set of adjacent hydrophilic residues located on the spike RBD external domain (Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502 and Tyr505) were found to contribute a network of H-bonds with CD147 amino acids Trp137, Thr140, Ser163 and Thr188, which further augments the two proteins interaction. Furthermore, two strong salt bridges were observed to stabilize the binding interface at both ends of the spike F486- Interface area, calculated as difference in total accessible surface areas of isolated and interfacing structures divided by two. c D i G P-value indicates the P-value of the observed solvation free energy gain. The P-value measures the probability of getting a lower than observed D i G, when the interface atoms are picked randomly from the protein surface. p < 0.5 indicates interfaces with surprising (higher than would-be-average for given structures) hydrophobicity, implying that the interface surface can be interaction-specific.G502 segment. The first one was noticed between Arg403 and Asp136 of the CD147 and the other was a stronger interaction (2.7 Å) emerging from spike Glu484 towards CD147 Lys191. The latter was acting as a centrally located anchor point that might have a key role in stabilizing the complex. It is worth noting that the same residue, Lys191, is an important player in the interaction of CD147 with the P. falciparum protein (PfRH5) (Wright et al., 2014) . Notably, fewer hydrophobic interactions were noticed at the interface as shown in Table 2 . The most important of these interactions was the one between the spike Tyr489 and His102 on the linker between the two domains of CD147.In addition, to further validate the proposed binding mode, we have docked the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the 2003 epidemic (PDB ID: 5XLR) to the target protein CD147. This protein is known to bind with the human cell CD147 to facilitate entry of the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak. We used HADDOCK server and the same parameters exploited for docking of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. To our delight, this protein adopted a very similar binding pose to that of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted above, with a slight shift towards the C-domain of the CD147 ( Figure S2 , Supp. Info.). Also, CD147 protein made polar contacts to the SARS-CoV protein using the same residues, namely, Gly100, His102, and Lys191. This gives added validity to our proposed binding pose of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and CD147.The complex was then subjected to a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation study in order to check the stability of the proposed binding mode and to study the time-dependent behavior of this system. In absence of 3D structure information, MD simulations is especially useful for studying proteinprotein complexes as it can help the molecules ""explore"" their conformation space more efficiently than using the static ""image"" provided by the molecular mechanics energy minimization (Karplus & Petsko, 1990; Zhao et al., 2013) . The system was solvated in a cubic SPC water box and simulated for 100 ns in GROMACS software package under NPT ensemble using Nos e-Hoover thermostat (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005) . The final frame was extracted, minimized to a gradient of 0.001 kcal.Å À2 .mol À1 in MOE software, and was further analyzed for key structural changes (Vilar et al., 2008) . To our delight, the overall fold of both interacting proteins was preserved as well as most of the binding interface with an RMSD of just 1.25 Å. The spike RBD has moved slightly towards the CD147 N-terminal domain, while most of the polar interactions were retained or replaced by similar interactions with nearby residues (Figure 4(A, B) ). The backbone RMSD fluctuation of the whole complex as well as the interface residues were monitored during the MD simulation to check the stability of the system (Figure 4(C) ). Both proteins were stable with some RMSD fluctuations that stabilized after 40 ns. To our delight, the residues of CD147 at the interface attained a significant stability over time and reached 1 Å after 60 ns. Distances of the most important polar contacts at the interface were calculated throughout the simulation and represented as a heatmap in Figure 4(D) . It was noticed that the salt bridge between Arg403 of the spike and Asp136 of CD147 was stable during the simulation with only minor fluctuation for a short time between 20 and 36 ns. This ionic bond could be critical for anchoring the b-strand B of the CD147 C-terminal domain to the binding grove created by the spike RBD. Similarly, the H bond between Gln498 and Thr188 at the end of stand F of CD147, although weak, could contribute to some extent to the interaction of this strand to the surface of the spike. On the other side, at the beginning of the spike F486-G502 segment, the H bond of Asn481 to Thr28 was replaced by a stronger and more stable one with Thr44. The most prominent difference was the loss of the characteristic salt bridge between Glu484 and Lys191. In the starting complex, this interaction was centrally located below the loop connecting the two domains of CD147 and we initially thought it would be essential for stabilizing the interaction. As a compensation, both residues Glu484 and Lys191, upon liberation from the ionic bond, were able to form H bonds with Gln100 and Tyr449, respectively. Finally, we noticed that Tyr140 adopted a swing movement to bind with the backbone NH of Gly502 instead of Thr500, thus, stabilizing the strand D of CD147 to the edge of the spike F486-G502 segment.The residues proposed to be critical for the Spike-CD147 interaction were mutated to alanine to validate their important role in the interaction. These residues are: Arg403 and Asn481 in spike, and Tyr140 in CD147. The mutated proteins were docked using HADDOCK server with the same parameters used for docking of the wild-type proteins. As expected, the number of residues at the interface and the interface surface area were lower than those of the wild-type proteins (Table S4 , Supp. Data). Also, the MM/GBSA score, as predicted by the Hawkdock server, was À60.64 which is lower than the scores of the wild-type protein complexes generated by any of the docking servers we used. Overall, the mutant proteins bind in a similar fashion to the wild-type one with an RMSD of 1.332 Å. However, the critical salt bridges and H bonds formed by the mutated residues were replaced by weaker contacts involving Phe486, Tyr489, Gln493, and Asn501 from spike with Val160, Asp136, Ser109, and Gln100 from CD147, respectively ( Figure S3 , Supp. Data).In addition, the complex with the mutated residues was energy minimized and then subjected to MD simulation for 30 ns following the same protocol used for the wild-type complex. The purpose of this simulation is to compare the time-dependent behavior of both proteins and validate our proposed binding mode. It was noticed that the H bonds Tyr489-Asp136 and Gln493-Ser109 were maintained throughout the simulation. However, the complex was significantly less stable compared to the wild-type complex. This was evident from the higher fluctuation of the backbone RMSD of the whole complex and, especially, the interface residues ( Figure S4 , Supp. Data). These findings highlight the role of the mutated polar residues, Arg403 and Asn481 in spike, and Tyr140 in CD147, for the interaction of these proteins and give more confidence to our proposed binding mode.To get more insight into the nature of interaction between the two proteins and detailed information about individual ligand contribution, we have performed binding free energy calculation (Cavasotto, 2020) . We have used the MD-based method Molecular Mechanics Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) as implemented in the g_mmpbsa tool. This technique can achieve similar accuracy to the Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) methods but at a smaller computational cost (Kumari et al., 2014) . The calculation was performed with the single trajectory approach using 100 frames saved at regular intervals of the complex MD simulation. According to the MM/PBSA method, the binding free energy of the interacting proteins is calculated using the following equations:where G complex is the total free energy of the complex and G protein is the total free energy of the isolated proteins. hE MM i is the vacuum molecular mechanics potential energy. TS refers to the entropic contribution to the free energy where T and S denote the temperature and entropy, respectively. The last term hG solvation i is the free energy of solvation and is composed of the polar part G polar and the nonpolar part G non-polar ; the former could be estimated by solving the Poisson À Boltzmann (PB) equation and the latter could be calculated from the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). The term c is a coefficient related to surface tension of the solvent and b is fitting constant (Kumari et al., 2014) . The results of the binding free energy calculation are shown in Table 3 . In accordance with our initial prediction, the binding energy is dominated by the electrostatic term with a contribution of 66% compared to 30% of the van der Waals interaction. Therefore, the attractive electrostatic term greatly exceeded the repulsive term and was the main driving force for the binding. The MM/PBSA method also returned a Perresidue binding-free energy decomposition ( Figure S5 , Supp. Data). This helps in identifying the key residues involved in the interaction. In our case, a contribution of more than 5 kJ/ mol to the binding-free energy of the complex was considered significant. As expected, most of the residues participated in the binding of the initial and MD-refined complexes showed a significant contribution. Particularly, the calculation highlighted the role of the spike Arg403, Tyr449, Asn481, Val483, and Tyr505 in the attachment to the CD147 receptor. The overall proposed binding mode of the host cell CD147 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike is illustrated in Figure 5 .Lymphopenia was found to be associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in many clinical reports (Guan et occurrence of lymphopenia corresponds to a nearly 3-fold increased risk of severe disease , supporting its potential usage as a clinical sign for serious morbidity . Although the cause of lymphopenia during viral infection still needs further investigations, several studies have postulated potential mechanisms for the evident lymphopenia. These include direct viral invasion into T lymphocytes resulting in cell death , indirect upregulation of P53 apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes by excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (IL10, IL7, IL6, IL2, TNFa, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A CCL2/MCP-1, and CCL4/MIP1B) Liao et al., 2002; Xiong et al., 2020) , and hyperlactic-acidemia-induced apoptosis (D ıaz et al., 2018) . Notably, T lymphocytes barely express ACE-2 receptor (Hamming et al., 2004 ) -the currently accepted point of entry of SARS-CoV-2 . CD147 may thus present an alternative point for viral spike protein entry. Indeed, CD147 was reported to mediate the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into T lymphocytes (Pushkarsky et al., 2001) . It was also reported to mediate entry of cytomegalovirus (CMV) into endothelial and epithelial cells (Vanarsdall et al., 2018) , and Plasmodium falciparum into red blood cells (Zhang et al., 2018) . CD147, also termed as EMMPRIN or basigin, is a pleiotropic molecule with various effects (Grass & Toole, 2016; Iacono et al., 2007) . Given the emerging use of bioinformatics in biological research (Karim et al., 2020; Mehmood et al., 2014) , it is worth mentioning that, through pathway analyses, CD147 was found to be a significant cell-surface protein contributing to chemoresistance and cell survival in cancerstem-cell-like cells (Kang et al., 2013) , and the invasion of various cancers (Li et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2016; Zheng & Gong, 2017) . Additionally, it was found to be highly expressed in activated regulatory T lymphocytes, enabling it to be a potential marker for distinguishing cytokine-producing activated T lymphocytes from resting T lymphocytes (Landskron & Task en, 2013; Solstad et al., 2011) . The structure of transmembrane CD147 receptor consists of three domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Muramatsu, 2016) . Those domains facilitate its interaction with several proteins, such as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and cyclophilins (Cyps), especially cyclophilin A, to modulate specific functions (Kirk et al., 2000; Yurchenko et al., 2010) . CypA is a ubiquitously expressed chaperon protein that has a high affinity to bind to CD147 receptor for enhancing viral invasion and inflammation (Chen et al., 2005; Yurchenko et al., 2010) ; a study in 2013 reported that blocking of CypA inhibits SARS-CoV infection and replication (Tanaka et al., 2013) . CD147 acts as the major chaperone protein of MCT 1, MCT 3 and MCT 4 proton transporters, that control the export of lactic acid molecules outside the cell (Kirk et al., 2000; Philp et al., 2003) . Activated T lymphocytes have been reported to undergo increased glycolysis with increased lactate production (Cham & Gajewski, 2005) , as they need high energy supplies for proliferation and producing cytokines (Frauwirth & Thompson, 2004) . The expression of MCTs for lactate export helps T lymphocytes to cope with the increased lactic acid levels (Merezhinskaya et al., 2004) , since the accumulation of lactic acid induces T cells apoptosis (D ıaz et al., 2018) . These data provide an insight into the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the balance of CD147-MCT interaction, and direct a need for further research on this role.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE-2 receptor, has been proved to be the entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into the lungs and other types of human cells. However, T lymphocytes are rarely expressing this receptor. Several recent studies have suggested that CD147 is a probable route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into certain host cells. These findings encouraged us to design the current study in which we employed docking and MD simulation to investigate this possibility. The results were also compared with the molecular modeling data of the mutant proteins interaction as well as the interaction of CD147 with the spike of the SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the 2003 outbreak.Our model shows interaction between CD147 C-terminal domain with SARS-CoV-2 spike external subdomain in the grove between the short antiparallel b strands, b1' and b2', and the small helix a1'. We confirmed this proposition using MD simulation and binding free energy calculation. This model provides an appreciation for targeting CD147 for adjuvant drug therapy strategies, to improve the prognosis of COVID-19 pateint. Our data is supported by the results of using Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, for viral clearance and lymphocyte count normalization (Bian, 2020) . In addition, of proposing azithromycin as a therapeutic strategy to treat P. falciparum via interfacing in PfRH5/ CD147 interaction (Muralidharan & Striepen, 2015; Wilson et al., 2015) .

Local and community transmission then resulted in the greater spread of the disease. As with many other African countries, Zimbabwe is at risk of imported cases due to citizens and tourists travelling from COVID-19 hotspots. Of great significance is that as of 29 March 2020, South Africa had 1280 confirmed cases [11, 12] . Zimbabwe and South Africa share a border with high volume of human traffic due to trade, tourist, and personal travel. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in South Africa, the President issued a 3-week national lockdown on 23 March 2020. The situation in Zimbabwe also changed, with 7 confirmed cases and 1 death as of 30 March 2020 [11, 13] . The President of Zimbabwe declared a 21-day national lockdown effective 30 March 2020.Healthcare workers are at risk of contracting COVID-19 during the outbreak because they are on the frontline of the fight. In China, a reported 3000 health workers were infected and more than 22 died [14] . Community pharmacists are the first point of contact with healthseeking patients on the community and therefore at risk of contracting COVID-19 during an outbreak. In Zimbabwe, community pharmacies and pharmacists contribute over 70% [15] of drug supply needs of the population and hence are on the frontline also of the COVID-19 fight. The risk to doctors, nurses, and laboratory personnel who are in direct contact with hospitalised COVID-19 patients is well anticipated, defined, and prepared for. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided for nurses, doctors, and laboratory personnel by the government and international organisation. For pharmacy personnel, it is unclear. In the UK, the government plans to provide COVID-19 protection packs to community pharmacists similar to what was provided to the general practitioners [16] . The protection packs include gloves, aprons, and fluid-repellent masks [16] . In a low-income country, risks to community pharmacists may be poorly understood. This paper aims to review and highlight the risks that are peculiar to community pharmacists in low-income countries and suggest some recommendations to mitigate the risks.Pharmacists on the frontline in the community-healthcare interface Community pharmacies are on the frontline of the interface between the community and healthcare. This is because of physical proximity and easier access to the public. In Zimbabwe, pharmacist consultation is free; hence, the public can easily access the pharmacy for management of minor ailments. A greater proportion of COVID-19 patients present with mild symptoms mimicking a cold or flu and requiring no hospitalisation. With mild symptoms, many patients will consult the community pharmacist and pharmacy personnel first, and without a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, such consultations put the community pharmacist and personnel at risk of contracting the virus. To further aggravate the risk to the pharmacy personnel, the pharmacy is a regularly visited place by the public. Practising social distancing when serving patients is not easy in a pharmacy setting. Daily, a community pharmacist can interact with an estimated minimum of 500 people consulting on cosmetics, minor ailments, and filling in of prescriptions. The people that walk in and out of the pharmacy are already self-selected from the general population because of one or two ailments. Having such a high number of ""sick"" people interacting in one place adds to the risk of infection to the community pharmacist.The setup of the community pharmacy may contribute to the risks of infection [17] . Limited physical space and presence of many bench tops, chairs, and shelves can be contributing to the risk of infection. The small spaces may make it difficult to implement the 1-2-m social distance within the pharmacy. In Zimbabwe, the dispensary space is the one that is regulated to a minimum of 10 m 2 . The other spaces such the waiting area and over the counter areas have no stipulated requirements. As a way to limit rentals, many community pharmacies have very small spaces to aid social distancing. Also, COVID-19 transmission risk within the community pharmacy may be increased due the working surfaces such as patient chairs, over the counter tops, and shelves. Respiratory droplets and saliva can be deposited on these surfaces as clients talk with pharmacy personnel.COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extra demand for pharmaceutical products and sundries. Mainly, there is excessive demand for masks, gloves, antibiotics, vitamins, and sanitisers. Coupled to demand of products directly used in the fight against COVID-19 is panic buying of chronic medications as patients prepare for lockdowns of uncertain length [18, 19] . The extra demand strained already weak supply chain systems of pharmaceuticals in low-to middle-income countries (LMICs). Pharmacists and pharmacy personnel resultantly have a burden to order for restocking. Extra ordering and restocking put the pharmacists and personnel at risk of contracting COVID-19 as they receive stock from suppliers. Such risk is further aggravated by the fact that the manufacturing industry in LMICs is weak hence the need to source products from several vendors at a time.Most LMICs imposed total lockdowns as a way to slow down COVID-19 infections, flatten infection curve, and reduce pressure on healthcare facilities. Pharmacies and pharmacist are classified as essential services and remained open during the lockdown [20] . This means that pharmacists and pharmacy personnel continued travelling to work using public transport. When travelling to and from work daily, pharmacists and pharmacy personnel are at risk of infection from COVID-19 as they get in contact other essential service providers such as policemen, nurses, and food producers.The dispensing system in Zimbabwe involves filling in paper-based prescriptions that come in the form of single sheets from the doctor's pad or thirty-two-paged hospital books that are used several times. The prescriptions pass through the hands of the patients, doctors, and nurses as the patient is being managed. The other health professionals in the patient management may have minimum protection such as gloves, gowns, and head gear. When the prescription is presented to the pharmacist and other pharmacy personnel for dispensing, it is a potential source of pathogens, COVID-19 included, putting the community pharmacy personnel at risk. In many developed countries, prescriptions are electronic thus eliminating this source of transmission.The pharmacist also faces the pressure to dispense off-label medications to patients. Various therapeutic drugs have been repurposed and suggested for use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The list includes chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, azithromycin, corticosteroids, zinc, and vitamin C [21] [22] [23] [24] . None of the agents has been studied long enough to generate enough evidence for use. However, information on the suggestions, data from small studies, and statements from politicians reach the public through the media resulting in excessive demand for unapproved therapies. Pharmacists in Harare, Zimbabwe, have been overwhelmed with patients who have been requesting for chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19. Chloroquine is classified as a prescription preparation; hence, patients cannot purchase it over the counter. The pharmacist is faced with a difficult decision because most of the patients cannot afford to pay the consultation fees to see a doctor, yet the drugs require a prescription.The community pharmacies provide blood glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure, malaria, HIV, and pregnancy tests. Provision of these services has been found to be effective and cost saving [25, 26] . Most of these tests involve blood draw, testing, reviewing the history of the readings, and patient counselling by the pharmacist. The blood draw and the prolonged time of contact increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 to the pharmacist. Coupled to that is the impossibility of maintaining the required social distance when providing these services in the community pharmacy setting.The National Health Services (NHS), UK, drafted a complete guide of how the community pharmacies and pharmacist handle potential COVID-19 cases [27] . The document clearly guides the pharmacist on how to identify, isolate the individual, notify the relevant public health officials, and decontaminate the consultation room. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) also drafted a COVID-19 information and interim guidance for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce [28] . The document provides relevant information and guidelines on COVID-19 in a primary care context and in hospital settings, and for pharmacists working as clinical biologists. In South Africa, the South African Pharmacy Council issued a brief guide to pharmacists and pharmacy staff concerning hygiene, PPE, and infection control in the workplace [29] . One of the reasons for lack of guiding documents in LMICs is the lack of expertise and resources to produce such documents in short space of time. In Pakistan, the pharmacy regulatory bodies partnered with UK pharmacists to come up with a local guiding document to protect pharmacy personnel from COVID-19 [30] . In Zimbabwe, there is no guideline or standard operating procedure specific to the community pharmacies on COVID-19. The lack of guidance increases the risk of infection to the community pharmacists. The COVID-19 is novel, and there are a lot of myths and misconceptions that are misleading. A lack of knowledge has been attributed to fear of infection by health workers in Ebola outbreak [31] . The documents from other countries and international guidelines may not be applicable to a low-income setting where there are significant differences in pharmacy practice, demographics, funding levels, and different COVID-19 transmission dynamics. There is therefore a need for relevant country-specific guidelines on how to handle COVID-19 in the community pharmacy. The FIP guidelines can be used to tailor guidelines relevant to the Zimbabwean context.Coupled to lack of guidance, community pharmacists are at risk of social media-driven misinformation on the transmission, clinical progression, and treatment of COVID-19. Community pharmacists also do provide health information to the community and require access to accurate data to be able to fulfil that role. The spread of misinformation on COVID-19 hinders the response of community pharmacists to the pandemic. Rapid dissemination of scientific, peer-reviewed, and verified information is critical in reducing public panic, spread of misinformation, and providing guidance to community pharmacists [32] .Pharmacy practice in Zimbabwe is governed by the Pharmacist Council of Zimbabwe (PCZ), Health Professions Authority (HPA), and Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ). Responsive guidelines and regulations can help reduce the risk posed by COVID-19 to the pharmacists. Guidelines come as educative guides that give community pharmacists clear steps to take when handling potential cases of COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), all health workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 fight need training on infection prevention and control. Community pharmacists should be trained on infection prevention and control (IPC). Most of the community pharmacies are owned by sole proprietors with very limited funds to be able to provide PPE. The government and the international funders such as the United Nations and WHO need to provide PPE to the community pharmacists during the COVID-19 outbreak. The PPE pack should include gloves, masks, and gowns/aprons. Besides what the regulators and the government can do to reduce risk, community pharmacists themselves need to implement infection control measures learnt during professional pharmacy training such as ensuring running water and soap is always available in the pharmacy and dispensary area. All individuals entering the pharmacy should wash hands with soapy water or alcohol-based sanitiser. Measures should be put in place to ensure that a limited number of people are allowed in the pharmacy per given time. Within the pharmacy, a distance of 2 m between clients and between clients and staff should be maintained. Floors and counter tops should be wiped with sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium, or alcohol-based disinfectant after every 30 min or after serving a customer. Innovative ways to prevent contact include placing transparent glass or plastic over the dispensing area with a provision of a very small opening. Contact may be minimised when dispensing by utilising prescription drop in baskets where patients can drop off their prescriptions and the pharmacist can in turn drop the medications. Mobile phones are very common in Zimbabwe and can be utilised to order prescription refills via short message service (SMS) or WhatsApp, and pharmacy personnel will deliver grouped orders. The personnel delivering the order will need full PPE including mask, gown, googles, and gloves. The risk and corresponding recommendations have been summarised in Table 1 .COVID-19 epidemic cases have been recorded and are on the increase in Zimbabwe. Community pharmacists are at risk of contracting the virus from the workplace. A number of ways to reduce the risk have been suggested in this paper. The authors hope that through this review, specific guidelines tailored for a low-income setting will be established to minimise any possibility of rapid transmission of disease through the community pharmacy.

Resource-poor settings withThe study was carried out in Somalia (East Africa). Two consecutive cross-sectional surveys investigating the adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures were conducted. The first took place from 23 April to 7 May, whereas the second was held from 7 to 29 July 2020. The duration of the second survey was slightly longer because it took more time to recruit as many respondents as during the first survey. This study was part of a network of online surveys organized in several low and middle-income countries by the International Citizen Project on COVID-19 (ICPcovid) [9] .The ICPcovid general online questionnaire was adapted to the Somali context by local investigators and was disseminated via social media platforms (in English and Somali) to consecutively recruit adult participants (age ≥ 18 years) via a snowball approach. All responses were submitted anonymously directly to the ICPcovid platform, mainly using smartphones but also via computers. Submitted responses were stored in the secure ICPcovid website until data extraction. In addition to socio-demographic information and self-reported adherence to various preventive measures, the questionnaire also included questions about the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms experienced by the respondents. Participants were asked whether they had been tested for COVID-19, and for the results of the test if available. A copy of the full questionnaire used is available as a Supplementary Material (File S1, Appendix 1).Adherence to the government's restrictive instructions for COVID-19 control were assessed using individual and community parameters, configured either as yes/no questions or as Likert scales in the questionnaire. A composite adherence score was made based on the respondent's self-reported observance of the following personal preventive measures: physical distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, coughing hygiene, and the habit of touching one's face (Table 1) . Descriptive statistics are presented using means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes, and percentages (%) for categorical variables. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to investigate associations between two categorical variables, and to compare proportions across the surveys. Continuous variables were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and compared across groups using parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA) or non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis) as appropriate. Both the WHO clinical definition (fever with at least one respiratory symptom) [10] and a recently proposed case definition (fever and/or anosmia, with at least one other respiratory symptom) [6] were used to estimate the COVID-19 burden in both surveys.For multivariable analysis, we constructed an ordinal logistic regression model to investigate factors associated with adherence to national preventive measures against COVID-19, using the adherence score as the dependent variable. Mandatory covariates in the model included socio-demographic features (age, gender, profession, educational level, urban vs. rural residence), and survey timing (first vs. second survey). Non-Likert covariates which showed a significant association with the dependent variable in univariate analysis were also included in the model. The final model, selected based on the least Akaike information criterion (AIC) value, was obtained after a backward stepwise process (Supplementary File S1, Appendix 2). The significance level adopted was 5%, and all tests were two-sided. Data analysis was performed using the software R, version 3.6.2.The study protocol was approved by the University of Antwerp Ethics Committee (Ref: 20/13/148) and the Mogadishu University Institutional Review Board. Informed e-consent (checkbox) was required from each participant before submitting responses. All responses were anonymous and securely stored in a password-protected server in Belgium.After data cleaning, over 4000 participants were retained in each survey round. Their comparative characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . A majority of respondents during the second survey (2776/4703, 59.0%) acknowledged participating in the first survey as well. During both surveys, the study population was predominantly male, and most respondents had attained a university level of education. Based on data from the second survey only, respondents were geographically distributed across the regions of Somalia as follows: 3786 (80.5%) in Benadir; 227 (4.8%) in Galmudug; 212 (4.5%) in Hirshabelle; 168 (3.6%) in South West; 117 (2.5%) in Somaliland; 101 (2.1%) in Jubaland; and 92 (1.9%) in Puntland. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Somalia, the participants reported low to moderate levels of worry/fear about their own health, with mean Likert scores on a five-point scale of 2.3 ± 1.6 and 1.9 ± 1.3 during the first and second survey, respectively (p < 0.001). A similar trend was observed regarding their level of worry/fear vis-à-vis the health of their loved ones (mean Likert scores on a five-point scale of 3.0 ± 1.7 during the first survey, and 2.2 ± 1.5 during the second survey; p < 0.001). Considering the individual COVID-19 preventive measures, the adherence rates ranged from 51.2% for mask use to 87.4% for coughing hygiene ( Table 3 ). The mean adherence score decreased from 3.54 ± 1.5 in the first survey to 3.40 ± 1.6 during the second survey; p < 0.001. Combining available data from both surveys and comparing work habits in the private and public sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Somalia, we observed that 350/1041 (33.6%) of private employees and 91/176 (51.7%) of government employees were working from home (p < 0.001). Comparing COVID-19 preventive behaviours across genders revealed that women observed the safety recommendations more frequently than men (see Supplementary File S1, Appendix 3).While some respondents reported using face masks all the time when they went out (29.9% in Survey 1 and 28.4% in Survey 2), others used masks only sometimes (19.4% in Survey 1 and 23.0% in Survey 2), and a minority wore masks at home (1.2% in Survey 1, 2.8% in Survey 2). About one quarter of the participants reported wearing reusable cloth (fabric) masks: 25.2% in the first survey, and 27.0% in the second survey. Among the 4071 participants who reported not using face masks during our surveys, the following reasons were given: no money to buy face masks in 933 cases (22.9%); not knowing where to get the face masks for 643 respondents (15.8%); the fact that face masks make them uncomfortable, as reported by 1096 (26.9%); whereas another 1695 (41.6%) thought that face masks are not necessary during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean Likert score assessing the difficulty of observing lockdown measures increased from 2.2 ± 1.6 to 2.3 ± 1.5 in the first and second surveys, respectively (p < 0.001). In both surveys, the level of difficulty of staying at home, as required for lockdown purposes, was significantly different across genders, residential setting, and professional status; p < 0.001 (Table 4 ). Overall, 667 (16.2%) participants in survey 1 and 1796 (38.2%) participants in survey 2 reported experiencing at least one flu-like symptom during the two weeks preceding the survey; p < 0.001. Headache was the most frequent symptom in both surveys (Table 5 ). Applying the WHO's clinical definition [10] and a recently proposed case definition [6] for COVID-19 screening (with no consideration of previous contacts with an infected person) revealed a prevalence of suspected COVID-19 cases ranging from 6.3%-8.1% in the first survey, and 6.5%-7.7% in the second survey (Table 6 ). During the second survey, mean adherence scores varied significantly across geographical regions (p < 0.001), ranging from 2.73 to 3.54. A multivariable model investigating factors associated with the adherence score to COVID-19 preventive measures found that being a female, healthcare worker/student, and obtaining COVID-19 information from official sources significantly increased the odds for higher adherence (Table 7 ). This study shows an overall unsatisfactory level of adherence by Somali residents to the preventive measures put in place by the government to control COVID-19 transmission. Considering that more than half of the second survey participants also took part in the first survey, our findings may indeed reflect the evolution of COVID-19 preventive attitudes in a given cohort of individuals rather than in two different populations. The lower adherence scores during the second survey, compared to the first, indicates that compliance to government measures is decreasing as the COVID-19 epidemic evolves in Somalia. It appears that as the testing capacity increases, resulting in more COVID-19 cases being reported during the second survey, COVID-19 fear and adherence to preventive measures are slowly declining. The fact that the prevalence of suspected COVID-19 cases was fairly similar in the different regions of Somalia suggests that important community transmission of COVID-19 has been ongoing throughout the entire country [6] . This was to be expected, given the low adherence to preventive measures.Our findings are particularly relevant for the population in the capital city Mogadishu, in the Benadir region, where over 80% of the respondents resided (data from Survey 2 only). Considering that Mogadishu is one of the few places in Somalia where the government healthcare system has actually deployed a COVID-19 response [8] , it was not surprising to find relatively lower adherence scores in the other regions (except for Galmudug, which had slightly higher adherence scores than Benadir). Furthermore, the fact that urban residents and university level respondents were over-represented in both surveys makes it difficult to generalize the findings to the entire Somali population. It is estimated that less than 20% of Somalis aged 20 years and above have attained university level education [11] . This leaves a minority of the population fitting the characteristics of our survey participants. Notably, residing in rural areas was associated with more difficulties in complying with the government lockdown instructions, and with lower adherence scores. This may be due to the fact that rural residents are often involved in subsistence farming, and staying at home would imply dropping their main source of livelihood. It is therefore important to design targeted, context-specific COVID-19 prevention strategies that could be differentially implemented in different communities even within the same country.The reported level of worry/fear about the respondents' health or that of their loved ones significantly decreased from the first to the second survey. This was accompanied by reduced adherence scores across the surveys ( Table 3 ). The initially high anxiety caused by the news of the high mortality of COVID-19 in developed countries with aging populations could be a possible explanation for this trend. However, upon realising that the disease is mostly benign among younger populations like in Somalia (barely 5% are older than 60 years [11] ), the respondents may not be considering COVID-19 as a major threat anymore. Consequently, a progressive laissez-faire attitude was noted during the second survey, with more persons reporting that they have been frequenting public places such as bars/restaurants, places of worship, markets, or even travelled during the seven days prior to participating in the survey. The hypothesis of declining adherence as the epidemic evolves is further supported by the lower adherence scores observed among participants who have experienced flu-like symptoms, as it appears that they are no longer scared of the disease and hence are becoming less careful. Although younger persons may be at a lower risk for severe COVID-19, they can still become infected and transmit the disease to the high-risk groups (elderly and chronically sick individuals). Furthermore, COVID-19 deaths have been reported in persons below 40 years, although less frequently compared to older patients [12] . The WHO Director General recently highlighted that it is difficult to convince young people that they may indeed be at risk of dying from COVID-19, and urged them also to observe the preventive measures [13] . In a like manner, the youthful Somali population should be sensitized about the importance of adhering to preventive measures as much as possible for the sake of their own health and of the health of their loved ones.About half of the respondents reported wearing face masks during the COVID-19 epidemic. This is far below the 80% threshold recommended by modelling studies [14] , and therefore needs to be improved. Of note, reusable cloth masks were reported only in about one quarter of participants. Cloth masks offer some advantages, such as lower cost and being far less dangerous for the environment when compared to surgical masks, and have therefore been proposed for COVID-19 control especially in resource-poor settings [15] . Aside from the reported difficulties of acquiring masks (such as lack of finances and not knowing where to obtain masks), other major limitations to wearing masks included the associated discomfort and the widespread thought that masks were unnecessary in times of COVID-19. Indeed, masking is a relatively strange practice among the African population, and they should be educated about its importance during the COVID-19 crisis. This is in contrast with Asian countries, where masks are culturally accepted as a common hygienic practice [16] .The multivariable analysis showed several factors associated with adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. The male gender was associated with poorer adherence, most likely because in the Somali community, men are often the breadwinners and are compelled to leave the house even in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to work to support their families. This finding is in line with the results of a study in Spain, where it was also observed that women were more adherent to COVID-19 preventive measures than men, suggesting a more responsible attitude of women toward the dangers associated with the pandemic [17] . Respondents with a post-graduate educational level, who were probably more informed and knowledgeable about the disease, were more likely to have higher adherence scores compared to their less educated peers. In addition, government employees were more likely to highly adhere to the preventive measures compared to privately employed workers. We surmise that this is because the government agencies were more rigorous in implementing strategies against COVID-19 in the professional milieu (including working from home), compared to private companies, which are often out to maximize profit even at the detriment of employee welfare. Therefore, it is necessary that strict protocols that align with COVID-19 safety regulations be implemented and re-enforced in workplaces during the ongoing health crisis. It is equally worth mentioning that obtaining COVID-19 information from official sources (radio, TV, and government announcements) increased the odds of having a high adherence score, whereas information from social media decreased these odds. This highlights the role of misinformation in determining people's adherence to scientifically proven preventive measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic [18] . Previous research has also demonstrated that social media users tend to be more extraverted [19] , suggesting that such individuals may find it more difficult to stay at home and observe the COVID-19 preventive measures compared to the more introverted non-social media users.It is necessary that our findings be interpreted in the light of some limitations. First, the participants were not a representative sample of the general population in Somalia. Indeed, the majority of respondents were educated people belonging to the middle to high social classes and most often residing in urban settings, since poor people in remote places may have very limited internet access. Based on data from a recent demographic survey in Somalia [11] , our study population constituted a minority (only 38.3% of Somalis are aged 18 years and above); our gender distribution was different (60% male in this study vs. 48.7% male in the general population); education levels were biased (>85% attended university in this study vs. 5.9% in the general population); and urban residents were over-represented (90% in this study vs. 63.9% in the whole country). Second, it is not possible to verify the veracity of responses obtained via a web-based questionnaire. Third, the fact that our study was done only at two time points makes it difficult to fully understand the rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 epidemic and related attitudes in Somalia. More studies, possibly with a longitudinal design, would be necessary to monitor the situation prospectively.Our study revealed low adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among residents of Somalia, with a decreasing trend in adherence over time. Mass sensitization and targeted interventions (based on the residential setting, profession, educational level, and gender) may be needed to improve preventive behaviours and limit the transmission of the virus. Additionally, social media platforms should be leveraged to disseminate accurate information about COVID-19.","Somalia","abstract","2020-09-06",9

As of 24 th August 2020, there have been over 23,472,067 cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus disease and over 809,747 deaths reported globally. [1] The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Africa occurred in Egypt on February 14, 2020. To-date, African countries have reported lower disease incidence than most other countries, with 1,084,904 confirmed cases and 24,683 deaths as of 24 th August 2020 across the continent. However, infectious disease surveillance and reporting infrastructure remain highly underdeveloped, and COVID-19 testing is limited given the shortage of human resources and appropriate laboratory and surveillance facilities across the continent. [2] Although uncertainties underlying SARS-CoV-2 disease transmission and severity persist, ongoing analysis of available data suggests that old age and underlying health conditions play a critical role in the severity of disease prognosis. [3, 4] Approximately 75% of the African population is less than 35 years of age, and African countries may benefit from a largely young population. [5] However, these populations may also be at particular risk for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 given the high prevalence of immunocompromised individuals. In 2016, 417,000 people died from tuberculosis in the African region, where 25% of the world's TB deaths occur. [6] Other prevalent co-morbidities include HIV, for which many patients are receiving anti-retroviral therapy, and malnutrition, in addition to other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. [7] [8] [9] To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the majority of African countries reduced or banned international travel and instituted curfews, lockdowns, and other social distancing interventions beginning in March and April 2020.[10] Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of social distancing and other quarantine measures in tandem with a rapid scale up of SARS-CoV-2 testing. [11] By one estimate, the number of people likely to be infected with the virus after encountering an infected individual declined by 55 percent after one week of shutdown in Wuhan, China.[12] However, as the majority of these restrictions were lifted in June 2020, the transmission rate is expected to increase, especially in highly populated areas where social distancing is not feasible.In this analysis, we combine best available estimates of the parameters that govern SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics with country-specific population data to estimate potential COVID-19 case burdens under four scenarios: baseline (assuming disease transmission is not mitigated by appropriate interventions), moderate lockdown, hard lockdown, and hard lockdown with continued social distancing. Given the current lack of data and understanding of how COVID-19 will impact the continent, these estimates are generated to inform national and continental COVID-19 preparation and response efforts on the basis of how this disease has spread elsewhere.The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the date of the first twenty or more cases were obtained for each country using data aggregated by the Johns Hopkins Centers for Systems Science and Engineering as of 25 th June 2020. [1] Lockdown start and end dates, where applicable, were compiled from a variety of sources including news media reports and government statements (Appendix 1 and Table 2 ). Although data are as current as possible, many government policies are under continuous review and lockdown dates may become rapidly outdated. Where countries do not have dates for the lifting of lockdown, a duration of 60 days has been assumed in line with the recommendations of many governments. Country population estimates were obtained from the World Bank. [13] Projections were simulated across all African nations and territories (excluding Comoros, Mayote, Reunion, Lesotho, and St. Helena which were omitted for lack of sufficient case data).To incorporate the varying age structures of different countries into the model, parameters were weighted by the proportion of the population in the 0-64, 65-79, and 80 and above age brackets in each country to form a unique set of parameters for each country (Appendix 2). Demographic data were obtained from the World Bank for 2018, [13] with the exception of Eritrea, for which population data came from IndexMundi.[14] Many African countries have high rates of TB and HIV/AIDS which are likely to make their populations more vulnerable to severe infection. To further consider the impact of this on our analysis we reweighted the parameters according to the proportion of the younger population with HIV and/or TB. Those over age 80, and 65-79 were modeled as before, however the under 64 cohort was split into healthy individuals and those affected by TB and/or HIV/AIDS. For this group we employed the parameter set previously used for the 0-64-year-old cohort, with the exception of progression to severe disease, which was doubled to 0·404 (upper bound tripled to 0·606 and lower bound of 0·202), for populations with HIV/AIDS and/or TB, based on estimates for mortality from South Africa. [15, 16] Algeria, Mauritius, Eritrea, and Seychelles were excluded from this second analysis due to lack of data.The model follows a modified SEIR structure ( Figure 1 ) with seven unique compartments to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This is adapted from the model structure previously described in Lin et al. 2020 . [17] Susceptible individuals, S, are those in the population that can become infected with the virus. They become exposed, E, to SARS-CoV-2 by encountering infected individuals in the population at rate ߚ ଵ for asymptomatic individuals or ߚ ଶ for symptomatic individuals. We assume that individuals that are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic have a lower transmission rate, β 1, than more symptomatic individuals, β 2 .[17] Exposed individuals incubate the virus at rate ߤ (calculated as the inverse of the incubation period). A proportion of these individuals, ߠ , become symptomatically infected while the rest become contagious with mild or no symptoms, C. Of the symptomatically infected individuals, a proportion, h, have severe symptoms, to the extent that they will require hospitalization if available, I S , and the rest have moderate or non-severe symptoms, I N . Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, moderately symptomatic, and severely symptomatic individuals recover (or otherwise become non-contagious) at rates ߛ ଵ , ߛ ଶ , and ߛ ଷ , respectively. It is assumed that recovered individuals are immune from becoming re-infected during the time period of the study. Severely infected individuals may also die, D, at rate ߜ . The model is described by the following set of differential equations:Parameters are estimated from the literature and the sources for this are outlined in Table 1 and the supplementary materials.To assess the uncertainty of the parameter ranges on model estimations, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), a stratified sampling technique that efficiently analyzes large numbers of input parameters by treating each parameter as a separate random variable. Stochastic sampling of the parameters with LHS was based on an estimation of parameter ranges obtained from the literature (Table 1) . From the parameter sampling, we were able to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all compartment values over the temporal domain.We provide case projections for the following four scenarios:1. Baseline: Disease continues to spread with no curfew, lockdown, social distancing, or other intervention(s) and with no change in transmission rate.2. Moderate Lockdown: Disease transmission is reduced by 25% during the lockdown period, then transmission resumes at 90% of the pre-lockdown value due to sustained changes in behavior.Disease transmission falls 44% during the lockdown period, then transmission resumes at 90% of pre-lockdown levels.Disease transmission is reduced by 44% during the lockdown period then, through social distancing regulations and isolation of symptomatic individuals, resumes at 75% of pre-lockdown levels.It was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.Under baseline conditions, the most populous countries stand to bear the greatest disease burden with Nigeria having an estimated peak case load of 645,081 severe infections (0·31 percent of total country population) and 9,359,221 total infections (4·54% of total country population), followed by Ethiopia, with an estimated peak case load of 335,024 (0·29%) severe infections and 4,978,734 (4·33%) total infections (Figure 2 ; Table 3 ). Smaller countries have a lower case load; Cabo Verde is projected to have a peak case load of 2,244 severe infections (0·40% of total country population) and 32,811 (5·90%) total infections, Sao Tome and Principe are estimated to experience peaks of 14,012 (6·40%) total infections and 1,048 (0·48%) severe infections ( Figure  S1 ). However, the baseline scenario does not reflect the current situation in any country as all countries have instituted some form of social distancing policies.Moderate lockdowns (assumed to lower transmission by 25% during lockdown), reduced estimated peak severe infections by 10% in Senegal, to 37%, in Ethiopia and Egypt. However, South Africa the peak of the severe case load showed a 1% increase of 1,929, given a moderate lockdown of 35 days (Figures S1 and S6) . Longer lockdowns were more effective. In Egypt and Ethiopia, who have the longest planned lockdowns of any of the African countries (137 and 170 days, respectively), the estimated impact was a reduction in total peak cases of 37%, or 130,998 and 123,890 severe cases, respectively ( Figure 5 ). In addition, the estimated peak of infections was shifted by 35 and 27 days, respectively ( Table 2 ). In Cabo Verde, which had the shortest planned lockdown of 17 days, the estimated reduction in severe peak cases was 19% under a moderate lockdown, and the peak date of infections was shifted by 10 days (Figure 5 ).The effect of hard temporary lockdowns without extended post-lockdown social distancing compared to moderate lockdowns varied by country. The reduction in severe peak infections ranged from 7%, in Rwanda, to 35% in Egypt, compared to baseline values. In some countries a hard lockdown had a lower impact on reducing peak cases than a moderate one. For example, in Ethiopia the expected impact of a moderate lockdown reduced severe cases by 123,890 cases compared to baseline, while a hard lockdown reduced cases by 100,743. However, hard lockdowns delayed the onset of the peak in infections compared to moderate lockdowns by several weeks. For example, in Tanzania, a moderate lockdown of 60 days delayed the peak in severe infections by 16 days compared to a 47-day delay in the case of a hard lockdown.Many African countries have young populations, who have been less likely to show severe symptoms in other countries, however, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and TB in these populations potentially renders them more vulnerable to COVID-19. [15] The highest proportional burden HIV countries in Africa are Eswatini, Botswana and South Africa and the highest proportional burden tuberculosis countries are Burundi and Central African Republic. Assuming individuals with TB and HIV/AIDS, once infected, are more likely to progress to severe disease increased the peak number of infections significantly (Figure 2 ). In Eswatini, Botswana, and South Africa the baseline peak number of severe infections increased from 4,529 to 5,279, 9,334 to 10,023, and from 162,977 to 203,261, respectively ( Figure S2 , S11-S18). In Burundi, the peak number of severe cases increased from 40,417 to 44,058. However, progression to severe disease may, under certain circumstances, lead to less infections, as those with severe disease may be more likely to die, quarantine, or be sick enough that they are not widely transmitting the disease. For example, in Nigeria, severe infections decrease from 645,081 to 591,888 under this scenario.Most African countries are likely early in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the initial peak in infections may be several months away in many cases. Policymakers need mathematical models that are attuned to the context in Africa to aid in planning for continued transmission of the virus and to develop interventions that reduce disease transmission. Here we analyzed a model of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 parameterized for low-resource settings. Based on current observed cases of COVID-19 in African countries, we assessed the impact of strict social distancing measures. However, the extent and efficacy of lockdown policies is certain to vary between and within countries. Furthermore, after a lockdown, and in response to a high death toll, citizens are likely to continue to adjust their social behavior. [33] The results from our simulations suggest that national lockdowns will likely slow viral transmission, reducing the peak number of active cases and delaying the time until the peak occurs. This delay can allow governments time to prepare by setting up designated COVID-19 treatment sections in hospitals and additional testing centers in densely populated areas, as well as practical measures within communities such as handwashing stations and soap distribution and information campaigns educating the public in infection prevention behaviors including mask wearing, social distancing and handwashing. Our models suggest that by using this time to prepare, transmission is likely to decrease enough to substantially to reduce the peak in infections, even after lockdowns cease. This may make the consequences of the pandemic more manageable for health and social systems, though many are still likely to become overwhelmed.The predicted dates of peak cases varied greatly by country, from 1 st August in South Africa to 22 nd December in Ethiopia in the case of a hard lockdown with continued social distancing (Scenario 3) ( Table 6 ). This is due to many factors including differences in population size, when the virus first arrived in the country, and length and severity of lockdown interventions. Most infections are mild; however, some countries are likely to bear a much higher per capita burden than others, largely due to differences in the duration and efficacy of lockdowns.There are inherent difficulties in inferring real world results from mass action models such as the one in this study. Our models tend to overestimate the number of infections as they assume people are well mixed, despite many social, physical and geographical barriers to mixing within countries. Peaks in transmission are likely to occur at different times in different regions, as has occurred in the United States and Europe where there have been multiple epicenters. This model is not stochastic and case data are modeled from the first twenty or more cases, each behaving as an average case. In reality, there are no average cases; some individuals are likely to have many contacts, causing multiple infections, [52] and others to have very few. The different contact patterns of different segments of the population were also not included in this model and may have an impact on transmission between vulnerable groups.The estimates presented here suggest that the burden of severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be high for the African continent. Projections of disease progression are needed to enable policy makers, governments, aid agencies and other actors to optimize resource allocation and planning decisions. The high prevalence of TB, HIV, and malnutrition and other immunocompromising conditions accompanied by limited testing capacity and access to healthcare in many African countries are likely to make populations particularly vulnerable to this pandemic. Immediate planning and appropriate resource allocation are essential to save lives and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in Africa.The data for this study is included in the manuscript and supplementary materials, however please contact the corresponding author for any further data.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-07",9

Declaring the disease as a global public health emergency, the World Health Organization (WHO) and different stakeholders have stepped up efforts to convince the world that the disease is a serious problem that needs resilient containment measures.COVID-19 fuels panic in sub-Saharan Africa where the healthcare system is fragile in withstanding the disease. Governments in the continent responded swiftly in the early days of the pandemic, while there are concerns as some countries are experiencing a sharp rise in confirmed cases and countries have limited capacity for testing to early identify cases [1] . As of 25 June 2020, there have been 9 473 214 confirmed cases and 484 249 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR = 5.1%) reported worldwide. On the African continent, 258 752 COVID-19 cases and 5564 deaths (CFR = 2.2%) have been reported, accounted for 2.7% of cases and 1.1% of deaths worldwide [2] .Ethiopia, a country in sub-Saharan Africa, has a population of about 115 million, the second populous country in Africa and the twelfth globally. The median age is 19.5 years and 78.7% of the population is rural. It is also one of the list-resourced, with a per capita income of United States Dollars (USD) 850 in 2019 [3] and a human development index value of 0.47, at 173 out of 189 countries and territories [4] . Tuberculosis (TB), malaria, Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and maternal mortality are the main health concerns in the country, and it is one of the countries with the highest burden of TB, TB/HIV, and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).TB is yet the most killer infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, and the fact that COVID-19 and TB have some similarities in clinical features is a potential risk for misdiagnosing the two. Though the incubation period for TB is longer with a slow onset, both diseases transmit through close contact and droplet particles and both affect the lung [5, 6] . The global scientific community is putting efforts to understand the COVID-19 crisis on TB care and treatment [7] . Healthcare systems, in general, are threatened by the rapidly increasing healthcare demand posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the severity of projections, hospitals across the globe are creating additional critical care surge capacity and limiting patient routine access to care for other diseases like TB.For countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the major health system shift into COVID-19, aggravated by poor health systems and ill-equipped healthcare facilities, is hampering the progress towards health target sets including the End TB [8] . When the COVID-19 pandemic had started in China, many African countries had a few laboratory testing capacities and logistic difficulties to track patients in their community [9] . In Ethiopia, TB program is problematic and the emergence of COVID-19 is assumed to worsen the situation [9] [10] [11] . Here, we looked over the COVID-19 containment measures in Ethiopia in context from reliable sources and put forth recommendations that leverage the health system response to COVID-19 and TB.Ethiopia confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on 13 March 2020, two days later the WHO declared a pandemic of the disease, and as of 26 June 2020, the country tested 237 464 suspects, of whom 5425 (2.3%) cases had been confirmed positive and of these, 89 (CFR = 1.6%) died and 1688 (31.1%) recovered ( Fig. 1 ) [12] . The first case was a 48 years Japanese man who arrived in Ethiopia from Burkina Faso, and the second report was three cases, two Japanese and one Ethiopian, who had contact with the first Japanese person. Of those confirmed positive, 3325 (61.3%) were males.Initially, before community transmission started, cases were largely imported and sourced from mandatory quarantines. Travel history was reported up to 2 June 2020. Of the total 1344 (24.8%) cases reported up to 2 June 2020, 408 (30.4%) were imported cases as they acquire the disease outside Ethiopia based on their travel history. Of these 408, 32 (7.8%) had a travel history to Dubai, 16 (4%) to Djibouti, and 9 (2.2%) to the United States, and they were in mandatory quarantines ( Table 1) .Most of the cases, 5337 (98.4%), were Ethiopian nationals and this involved all nine National Regional States and two City Administrations of the country though the majority of cases, 3822 (71.6%), were reported from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia (Table 2) .The Federal Government of Ethiopia and its National Regional States and City Administrations took several progressive measures to combat the COVID-19 epidemic. (Table 3) .Despite all these important public health containment measures, the outbreak still has the potential for greater loss of life in Ethiopia if the community is unable to shape the regular behavioral and sociocultural norms that would facilitate the spread of the disease. Many Ethiopians live in crowded conditions [13] and this would facilitate the spread of the disease.At the initial phase of the COVID-19 containment, Ethiopia had only one federal-level laboratory at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) to conduct COVID-19 testing. This has improved significantly, with 38 national, regional, hospital, and private laboratories currently involved in the COVID-19 testing as of 26 June 2020. The validation for laboratories has performed and provided by EPHI. The collection of samples from suspects and contacts, transporting, and testing have been followed COVID-19 standard techniques recommended by the WHO. The PM Abiy-Jack Ma initiative and the WHO had significant contributions in the assessment, training, and establishment of COVID-19 testing laboratories in the country. However, a robust testing capacity that would expedite large-scale community-level surveillance of the disease is needed to figure out the actual status of the disease and reshape the containment strategies.The initial readiness assessments conducted in Ethiopia by the WHO documented several gaps and weaknesses in intensive care capacity for COVID-19. Since then, the country took several steps to upgrade its clinical care to isolate promptly and provide optimized care for persons suspected or confirmed cases. A rigorous contact tracing, isolation, compulsory quarantine, and treatment procedures and facilities have been established. Public and private facilities have been identified and prepared at all regional states and two city administrations. In addition to this, different individuals have been provided their hotels, colleges, and universities that have been serving as quarantine centers. Some public universities' dormitories have been converted to quarantine centers to increase the capacity to over 50,000 beds. A In Ethiopia, the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the routine TB diagnosis, care, and treatment significantly. TB cases detection rate has reduced considerably and Directly Observed Therapy visits have been interrupted. Dire Dawa, one of the two chartered cities in Ethiopia, is among the major sits for our project entitled Translation research into policy and practice: Scaling up Evidence-Based Multiple focus Integrated Intensified TB Screening to End TB (EXIT-TB). From the end of March 2020 where the first COVID case was identified in Ethiopia, there have been significant reductions in TB case detection. According to the data that we got from the Dire Dawa Health Bureau, there were 110 TB cases in the period 1 April to 30 June 2020, which was about three times lower than cases detected in the previous reporting periods (Table 4) .We see a similar challenge in Addis Ababa where we have sites for both EXIT-TB study and the SELFTB Trial (Electronic pillbox-enabled self-administered therapy versus standard directly observed therapy for tuberculosis medication adherence and treatment outcomes in Ethiopia: a multicenter randomized controlled trial) [14] . The SELFTB Trial included 10 public health centers with the largest TB client load. The average quarterly cases in the sites [14] have been reduced by two-third in the COVID-19 period.Some health facilities that have been providing TB care and treatment services have been committed as COVID-19 isolation and treatment centers. Human and material resources for TB have been shifted to COVID-19, which also affected the TB case finding and care. Health care workers are frightened for themselves and their family for providing the services without essential adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). In such cases, the smooth transition of patients' follow-up to nearby health facilities with their full documentation is required through creating a system for these purposes between sending and receiving health facilities. Besides, for referral linked facilities, pre-informing to which health facility they will send their patients should be considered as early as possible. As TB symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms are overlapping, awareness creations should be continuously performed and reminded the health care workers to avoid missing more TB cases in Ethiopia where a third of TB cases have missed. Social stigma has been witnessed for patients co-infected with TB. Health education has the potential mitigating stigmatization [15, 16] . Thus, a unique health education platform that connects the two diseases is strongly needed.People with TB are at higher risk of infection and deaths with COVID-19. Considering this, WHO recommended simultaneous testing for TB and COVID-19 [2] . As Ethiopia is among high TB burden countries, a system of routinely testing all TB cases for COVID-19 is important. The specimen of interest and diagnostic modality for the two diseases are quite distinct and this may call the country to mobilize additional resources and a different supply-chain system. At current times, the supply-chain for TB diagnostics is affected by COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown. Xpert MTB/RIF and realtime MTB and RIF/INH testing tools are shown to be useful diagnostic tools for COVID-19 as well. To sustain TB diagnosis, treatment and care, people-centered and community-based care and treatment need to be strengthened. To avoid interruption of TB care and minimize exposure of TB patients to COVID-19, a novel and verified intervention mechanism is needed.In Table 5 , we summarized the COVID-19 related critical issues and problems affecting TB care and treatment program in Ethiopia and potential solutions that would mitigate the challenges.The COVID-19 pandemic influenced many research activities across the globe; it affected data collection at the field and many scientists shifted their focus to COVID-19, including their laboratories. Researchers understood that research activities need to protect the participants' and research staffs' wellbeing. For these reasons, many researchers prefer to keep hold of their research in the COVID-19 outbreak.We are currently implementing the EXIT-TB research project, which is funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2) program under the European Union (CSA2016S-1608). A co-author of this study is implementing a clinical trial on TB with financial support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (D43TW009127) [14] . COVID-19 has a significant impact on these studies. The studies require screening patients with TB and testing using different diagnostic modalities. Here, patients are not coming to healthcare facilities for a fear of COVID-19, and on the other side, TB services are marginally delivered and some sites stopped their routine services. For instance, one of the EXIT-TB study sites has been selected and prepared as a COVID-19 treatment center. Some patients on ant-TB treatment, their healthcare providers, and patients' charts and have been transferred to nearby health facilities which are not in the study. TB services could sustain with this approach but significantly affect the researches. Research funding agencies do recognize the challenges and are looking for different mechanisms for the successful completion of such projects [17] . For instance, EDCTP vowed to accept a no-cost extension of research projects on top of all these difficulties, we believe that researchers' commitment should not be overwhelmed by COVID-19 and that they should look for options to complete started researches successfully or initiate new researches in the era of COVID-19. Similar to Ethiopia, the links between TB and COVID-19 are most noticed in sub-Saharan Africa, where TB is the leading cause of death and the health system is weak to withstand the two diseases [18, 19] . Governments in sub-Saharan Africa African need to exert efforts on preventing the spread of the two diseases and continue the progress towards End TB strategy. WHO warned that Africa could be the next epicenter of COVID-19, with dual public health and economic crisis. It is crucial to keep an eye on the potential upsurge of COVID-19, but not at the cost of TB and other infectious diseases of global importance.Ethiopia took several steps to detect, manage, and control transmission of COVID-19. More efforts are needed to increase testing capacity and bring about behavioral changes in the community. The country needs to put in place alternative options to mitigate interruptions of essential healthcare services and scientific researches of significant impact.

SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, rapidly spread to diverse regions to cause a global pandemic with over 27 million cases and 890,000 deaths [3] . Short-and long-term impacts on the economy, infrastructure and social dynamics are vast. Currently, there is no known effective pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment options are limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented demand for research to guide an evidence-based public health response. Thus, basic science as well as preclinical and clinical research towards these ends have accelerated quickly. Virologic and pathogenesis studies are informing the design of targeted interventions [4] . Animal model development will provide a platform for pre-clinical evaluation of potential interventions [5] . Human studies will clarify the epidemiology, disease course and efficacy of interventions. Longitudinal cohort studies are needed to fully understand the implications of COVID-19. Against this backdrop, it is important to align research priorities with local context, coordinate research activities by information sharing and ensure that activities consider currently available data.Intimate research infrastructures in some developed countries may serve as models for the coordination of diverse and rapid research responses. For example, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Partnership, with members from government, academia and industry, will establish a collaborative framework for prioritising vaccine and therapeutic candidates in order to streamline clinical trials, tap into existing clinical trial networks, coordinate regulatory processes and leverage assets [6] . To mobilise the engineering community, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has announced a call for innovative engineering solutions to COVID-19. These special COVID-19 task forces provide independent, objective analysis and guide public policy. While the current focus is COVID-19, concepts pertaining to the coordination of research activities and the use of research to inform policy apply to diverse infectious and non-infectious disease research topics. We herein share the approach to COVID-19 in Mali to demonstrate how challenges posed by the continuously evolving research landscape might be evaluated and managed.The breadth, intensity and volume of COVID-19 studies are dizzying. Maintaining awareness of current findings, integrating them into one's research and avoiding the duplication of others' efforts are continuous challenges. To this end, attempts to coordinate COVID-19 research around the world are in progress. Efforts in specific areas [7, 8] , broad government efforts such as the ACTIV Partnership [9] and activation of the WHO R&D Blueprint to improve the global response support a comprehensive approach. As part of this strategy, we expect to see increasing linkages between public health and research activities. For instance, public health entities may screen for SARS-CoV-2 as part of their mitigation strategy. Cases may be referred for enrollment in clinical trials. Additionally, research serosurveys may be used to infer prior exposure patterns and inform the targeting of interventions. Mali is presently implementing observational studies and anticipates using these studies as a platform for intervention trials in the near future.The conduct of protocols through networks and multi-centre international collaborations enhances study power, coordination and awareness. For example, WHO is conducting the Solidarity study in over 100 countries [10] . WHO provides access to study agents through public-private partnerships and works with developers and companies to ensure affordable access to efficacious products. However, large collaborations engender the challenges of harmonising activities across diverse settings. To this end, there may be heavy reliance on local partners who are familiar with their system's nuances.Mali is a low-income country in West Africa with an average life expectancy of approximately 59 years [11] and Malaria as a leading cause of mortality. Collaboration between the Mali and United States governments began in the late eighties and led to the creation of the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC) in 1992. The MRTC has since played a major role in malaria vector control, drug resistance and immunoepidemiologic research. MRTC's accomplishments paved the way for the development of a large multidisciplinary research programme known as the Center for Research and Training on HIV/tuberculosis (TB) (SEREFO) in 2003. SEREFO has conducted sustainable laboratory and clinical research on bacterial and viral diseases beyond its initial focus on HIV and TB. In 2015, the University Clinical Research Center (UCRC) was created in Bamako, Mali, through an initiative between the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Malian Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Higher Education and University of Science, Techniques and Technology of Bamako (USTTB). With its immunology, molecular biology and Biosafety Level-3 laboratories, which are rare in the region, SEREFO has become an integral part of UCRC. The UCRC and MRCT together form the International Center for Excellence in Research in Mali (ICER Mali), which is an arm of the USTTB for biomedical and clinical research. UCRC serves as a core clinical research facility in Mali, providing human capital and infrastructure to support infectious disease research of local relevance.The governance structure of UCRC includes a Governing Council, the Executive Committee and the Directorate. The Governing Council is composed of four members (the Rector of USTTB, representatives of the MoH and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MHER), and the Director of the United States NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Clinical Research) who provide strategic guidance. The Executive Committee oversees the research activities of UCRC and is composed of 10 members, including senior researchers representing USTTB, the MoH, the MHER and NIAID. UCRC's mission is to develop sustainable capacity for the conduct of clinical research, nurture the next generation of clinical research scientists, disseminate research results and promote the utilisation of findings. UCRC receives funding from NIAID, the Government of Mali and through competitive research grants funded by diverse agencies. UCRC has over 150 staff members, including a dozen junior scientists trained in United States, European and African universities, and more than 20 MDs, PharmDs and PhDs. Through research and training grants, the UCRC collaborates with universities in the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia. Partners include Johns Hopkins University, George Washington University, Tulane University, Harvard and the University of Florida in the United States; the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, Oxford, the University of Bordeaux and the University of Copenhagen in Europe; and regional research institutions such as the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the University of Conakry in Guinea and the University of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. UCRC is also a member of several research consortiums, including the West African Clinical Research Consortium that includes Mali, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, aimed at advancing evidence-based regional epidemic preparedness and public policy.UCRC adheres to international standards and is continuously enhancing capacity. UCRC collaborators have access to core resources but provide support for additional activities. Through this paradigm, UCRC offers value to collaborators by providing laboratory diagnostic capacity for emerging pathogens such as Ebola, dengue, yellow fever, and COVID-19, clinical trial operations, regulatory monitoring, data management and administrative assistance to support the protocol lifecycle. In return, collaborations further increase UCRC's impact by expanding the research portfolio, building additional capacity and enhancing the integration with the global research community. Several international collaborations have been built on this groundwork with support from NIH, WHO, Gates Foundation and others. For example, the UCRC lab has played a key role in implementing diagnostics and evaluation of vaccines for Ebola as part of the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccinations [12, 13] .The core facilities of ICER Mali consist of key laboratories, a management centre and several field sites. The laboratories include an American College of Physicians certified lab as well as medical entomology, Biosafety Level-3 and geographic information systems facilities. A repository enables storage of research specimens. Internet connectivity is available throughout. The Mali Service Center, established in 2014, provides administrative and financial management. Field sites are located in Dongèuèbougou, Bancoumana and Oulessebougou, villages approximately 40, 70 and 300 km, respectively, outside of Bamako. In Bamako, Point G, Sokonafin and Koulouba serve as Ebola vaccine trial sites. Collaborators may support additional sites for their specific projects. Through the network of core and augmented sites, cohorts for studies on HIV, malaria, TB and Ebola are accessible.ICER Mali collaborates with the MoH by providing diagnostic support for emerging infectious diseases, TB and HIV; performing surveillance of HIV and TB drug resistance; and monitoring insecticide resistance by major disease vectors. Building on ICER Mali's history of collaboration with the MoH to guide national disease control programmes, UCRC is now playing a key role in the government response to COVID-19. The chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), created by the MoH to strategically coordinate the scientific management of the COVID-19 pandemic, is from UCRC leadership. The scientific advisor to the COVID-19 Technical Coordination Committee (TCC), created by the Prime minister's office to oversee implementation of the government response to the crisis, is also from UCRC leadership. In addition, UCRC leadership chairs the biomedical study section of the COVID-19 grant review committee appointed by the MHER to assist the National Center for Scientific and Technological Research (CNRST) in setting COVID-19 research priorities and distributing small grants to local research teams.In anticipation of COVID-19 reaching Mali, UCRC had collaborated with the United States NIH to train staff scientists on COVID-19 diagnostics and procured 2000 test kits in January 2020. This preparation was instrumental in Mali's response, enabling the timely and accurate identification of cases. Respiratory specimens from all suspected cases were tested at UCRC during the first month of the epidemic. Mali's first two COVID-19 cases were diagnosed on 25 March 2020 despite Mali having closed all borders with the exception of permitting a few commercial flights bringing Malians home from Europe, 1 week earlier. The laboratory diagnostic capacity was subsequently expanded to the Laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health, Centre d'infectiologie Charles Mérieux (CICM) and Laboratoire de Biologie Moléculaire Appliqué after additional supplies were also donated by the French Institute for Research and Development, the German government, the West African Health Organization and Jack Ma. Treatment facilities were established to handle positive cases in three major Bamako hospitals: Dermatologic Hospital (20 beds), Point G hospital (100 beds) and Hospital du Mali (100 beds). Nearly 80% of identified cases have been concentrated in and around the capital city of Bamako, though disease has been detected throughout the country.The spread of COVID-19 within Mali has stimulated research efforts toward the development of locally relevant management strategies. Though the IRB of USTTB typically reviews only 2-3 projects per month, they received 16 COVID-19 related proposals in 2 months (Table 1 ). In order to prioritise research activities while harnessing local capacity and simultaneously enriching global knowledge, the CNRST organised a meeting using the WHO R&D Blueprint strategy. This approach seeks to coordinate and accelerate research that can contribute to containing the epidemic and facilitate optimal care. The CNRST meetings involved local scientists of key research institutions in Mali, including ICER Mali/UCRC, the Department of Traditional Medicine, the CICM, the Malian Association of Traditional Therapists and Herbalists, the Malian Association for the Promotion of Research, Invention and Technological innovation, the NGO Pivot Santé Population and the Malian Academy of Sciences. Priority research areas identified include COVID-19 epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapeutics including local natural products, risk factors for poor outcomes, community engagement, and strategies to optimise compliance with prevention and control interventions.The spread of COVID-19 in Mali has stimulated both public health and research responses. These have occurred in tandem, with research being designed to address and support public health needs, and public health programmes and populations contributing to research. The harmonisation of activities is facilitated by key leaders having roles in both domains. To this end, Mali created the COVID-19 TCC under the leadership of the prime Minister's office and the SAC to the MoH to provide strategic orientation and evidence-based guidelines for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The TCC oversees and coordinates general multisectoral response activities for the country (e.g. police, border security, veterinary services, national communications, academia and civil society). It is co-directed by the Coordinator of National COVID-19 Response and the Coordinator of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Management led by the Ministry of Homeland Security and Civilian Protection. TCC recommendations are reviewed and adopted during inter-ministerial meetings led by the Prime Minister. The SAC, chaired by UCRC leadership, is composed of scientists and clinical researchers who meet weekly to assess the status of the epidemic and make recommendations to the MoH on COVID-19 operational issues, including local standards of care and research priorities. SAC representatives participate at the Higher Council of National Defense to advise the President of Mali on strategic decisions regarding COVID-19, including curfew, school closures and lockdowns. Within the MoH, a complementary committee of subject matter experts from different MoH departments was created to oversee control and surveillance.To finance rapid implementation of control measures, the government has created a National Fund to fight COVID-19. This fund is supported by the Malian government in conjunction with private sector donations. Its current balance is over US $8,563,300 and intended to cover the purchase of drugs, healthcare workers, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies and containment centres. In addition, CRNST was able to secure 229,000€ from The National Competitive Fund for Research and Technological Innovation, which is generated through tax revenue of 0.20% of collections. CNRS T then set up a request for COVID-19 proposals, which received 41 applications within 2 weeks. Proposals included clinical studies on diagnosis, treatment and mental health; social and behavioural studies on socioeconomic impacts and knowledge, attitudes and practices; evaluation of a new phytotherapeutic intervention; and innovations related to e-health surveillance. The public health response has been fairly structured, as exemplified by the rapid establishment of three treatment centres in Bamako. However, the research response has been less organised. In the setting of overtaxed capacity, social distancing and desire of multiple partners to rapidly implement studies addressing diverse issues, the limited research infrastructure is challenged to effectively engage and coordinate with its enthusiastic partners and separate research groups with interests in Mali. Proposed COVID-19 projects with UCRC address general epidemiology, potential natural and pharmaceutical interventions, prevention strategies, and the impact on healthcare personnel. Some studies are specific to Mali, while others are conducted through international networks. There is also a general emerging infection study that was being finalised and implemented when COVID-19 emerged. This study serves to collect observational data on COVID-19 patients while more specific protocols are implemented.Malian research teams internal and external to ICER Mali/UCRC continue to be solicited by international partners for collaboration on additional studies against the backdrop of efforts to effectively support the current portfolio. Proposals often overlap with each other and with existing projects in terms of scientific goals, populations of interest and required resources. Without clear coordination enabling the prioritisation of initiatives and strategic selection of study sites, consequences extend beyond inefficiency to potential 'community fatigue' when too many studies are conducted. In such cases, the study population may come to resent or disengage from the research [14] . Given that ICER Mali/UCRC sites have long-term local footprints associated with several longitudinal studies, the multitude of COVID-19 studies should be integrated into a unified picture that the community can embrace. The SAC will ameliorate some of the remaining harmonisation challenges, including the coordination of study sites, study populations, resources, information sharing and staffing for protocols. It will also accelerate Institutional Review Board and MoH regulatory processes.Mali's COVID-19 research activities highlight the need for coordination, provide an example of how that might be approached and demonstrate the challenges associated with rapid expansion. The identification of COVID-19 committees involving researchers, medical providers, public health policy-makers and other key stakeholders and building on existing relationships to address current research gaps associated with COVID-19 have been key to helping investigators understand the existing needs and those already being addressed. To accomplish the unification of the research portfolio, the mission of a scientific committee can be extended beyond an advisory role. This group may serve as a centralised body for review and endorsement of all COVID-19 research initiatives before submission to the IRB. The committee may track the conduct of COVID-19 protocols, coordinate data sharing and integrate findings into public health programmes [15] . Researchers desirous of working in Mali will be required to obtain approval from the central committee and provide updates at regular intervals.Despite progress toward a more efficient and relevant research portfolio, challenges such as communication gaps and resource deficiencies have become obvious as people and infrastructure are taxed beyond capacity. These are exacerbated by quarantine requirements. Our experience in Mali highlights several factors critical for coordination under such circumstances. Communication is of paramount importance. It has not always been smooth, largely due to key players having competing priorities. Existing relationships nurtured through years of collaboration have facilitated communication during this busy time. Team members in Mali and the United States are accessible to each other for urgent and routine issues; standing calls amongst project leaders provide a forum for updates, questions and concerns to be incorporated into the paradigm. Trust and transparency are additional attributes that sustain teams during stress, particularly while finding novel work approaches that maintain social distance. Partners with experience relying on each other are able to build on prior interactions to focus on the science [16] . They must employ flexible approaches, such as developing expedited protocol approval pathways and remote implementation strategies, to accommodate new ideas and challenges.Having an established core in Mali and shared goals amongst key partners has made rapid expansion of Mali's COVID-19 research portfolio possible. Notwithstanding growing pains, these provide a framework on which collaborations can be built and nurtured. The close link with the Malian MoH, including leadership that hold positions in both the MoH and in research entities, connects the framework to public health interests. Thus, studies of greatest relevance can be prioritised.COVID-19 research will further expand in Mali and globally. Some work will support hypothesis generation such as the characterisation of COVID-19 in the general population. Subsequently, findings in subpopulations, such as those with HIV co-infection, can be evaluated in follow-up studies. These cohorts may then engage in treatment and prevention trials to inform public health approaches. Mali will inevitably bring on new partners, which will enable the coordination of internal activities with new partners' portfolios.Lessons learned from COVID-19 research, including its influence on Mali's response to the epidemic, can be applied to future global research challenges. ICER Mali/ UCRC exemplifies collaborative efforts via its unique pathway for knowledge and technology exchange between resource-limited settings and the developed world. Paramount to deploying an effective and efficient research response is communication amongst stakeholders. Maintaining an operational clinical research core built through an international government-togovernment collaboration between the United States and Mali, the availability of research infrastructure and the accessibility of local expertise developed with mentorship from international research partners have been instrumental to Mali's rapid evidence-based response to COVID-19. Nonetheless, effective use of these assets requires coordination when multiple efforts involving multiple partners are being made toward the same end. Over the past few months, this need has been increasingly recognised in the global COVID-19 research community and central sources of information have been developed [17, 18] . Mali will work through its COVID-19 SAC and TCC, both within the MoH, to affect a harmonised national research response to COVID-19 in concert with the world's response.

IBV infects chickens and pheasants and induces a clinical disease known as infectious bronchitis (IB) [2] . The infected chickens may appear depressed with various levels of breathing difficulty and have ruffled feathers [3] [4] [5] [6] . Younger chickens show the most severe clinical manifestations [7] . In addition, there is serological evidence that poultry workers may develop anti-IBV antibodies following exposure to infected birds, although there is no evidence of active infection in humans [8] . However, experimentally, certain IBV strains (i.e., Massachusetts (Mass) and Gray) have been found to be capable of replicating in human cell lines [9] .The first IB case caused by the Mass serotype was recorded from North Dakota, USA [10] . Since then, hundreds of IBVs with heterogenous genomes have been emerging continuously as a result of mutations and recombination [11, 12] . Consequently, high IB-associated losses are recorded in spite of control attempts using live attenuated vaccines. Different strains of IBV demonstrate varying properties with differences in pathogenesis, virulence, tissue and age tropisms and receptor Figure 1 .

The phylogeny contains a total of 21 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains from different countries around the world. The IBV strain and GenBank accession number are given for each strain. The sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method available in RAxML with 1000 bootstrap replicates for branch support (the numbers on the nodes represent the bootstrap values). The analyses were constructed using Geneious ® v10.2.6 (https://www.geneious.com/).It is well established that, following the initial infection in the respiratory tract, the virus is disseminated to other tissues due to viremia [18, 57] (Figure 2 ). However, the exact mechanisms by which IBV leads to viremia are not understood. Recently, Reddy et al. (2016) showed that a Belgian nephropathogenic IBV strain, B1648, could infect blood monocytes and that these monocytes may facilitate the dissemination of IBV to visceral organs, including the kidney [50] . In agreement with this finding, another study [58] showed tropism of IBV towards monocytes by the Mass 41, California Phylogenetic tree based on the S1 nucleotide sequences (from the ATG start codon to the cleavage site of the spike protein).

The analyses were constructed using Geneious ® v10.2.6 (https://www.geneious.com/).IBV is typically transmitted to the host by inhalation, whereupon it attaches to the respiratory epithelium and enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis [46] . Once IBV enters the upper respiratory tract, it targets the epithelium, which is ciliated and includes mucus-secreting glands [30] , causing ciliostasis and mucus accumulation. The virus replication in the respiratory epithelium peaks 3-7 days post-infection (dpi) depending on the infecting IBV strain [35, 47, 48] . Consequently, respiratory signs result within 2 dpi and peak around 6 dpi [49] [50] [51] . These respiratory clinical manifestations include sneezing, gasping, coughing, tracheal rales, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and dyspnea [3] . It is not uncommon to observe non-respiratory clinical manifestations such as depression, weight loss, lethargy and huddling together [32, 50, 52] . The morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory tract IBV infection depend on the age of infection; young chickens are severely affected compared to adult chickens [7, 53] . At post-mortem examination, hemorrhages and the accumulation of caseous, serous and catarrhal exudates in the trachea, nasal passage and sinuses [47, 52] are evident, as well as gross changes in air sacs (i.e., the accumulation of foamy or cloudy exudates) [54] . Depending on the time of sampling, histological features include deciliation and dislodgment of epithelial cells, as well as mononuclear cell infiltration. These changes are visible around 2-3 dpi. Further development of the lesions, with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelium and prominent mononuclear cell infiltration in lamina propria, are visible around 4-6 dpi. These stages are followed by recovery with repopulation of the mucosa with pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and goblet cells (10-20 dpi) [47, 55, 56] .It is well established that, following the initial infection in the respiratory tract, the virus is disseminated to other tissues due to viremia [18, 57] (Figure 2 ). However, the exact mechanisms by which IBV leads to viremia are not understood. Recently, Reddy et al. (2016) showed that a Belgian nephropathogenic IBV strain, B1648, could infect blood monocytes and that these monocytes may facilitate the dissemination of IBV to visceral organs, including the kidney [50] . In agreement with this finding, another study [58] showed tropism of IBV towards monocytes by the Mass 41, California (Cal)99, Connecticut (Conn)46 and Iowa97 IBV strains. Using the Mass and Conn IBV strains, Amarasinghe et al. (2017) showed that IBV could infect low numbers of respiratory tract macrophages [59] . It is also possible that IBV dissemination beyond the respiratory tract may involve the lymphatic system and infected macrophages, similar to Marek's disease virus dissemination via infected lung macrophages [60] . 2017) showed that IBV could infect low numbers of respiratory tract macrophages [59] . It is also possible that IBV dissemination beyond the respiratory tract may involve the lymphatic system and infected macrophages, similar to Marek's disease virus dissemination via infected lung macrophages [60] .Subsequent clinical manifestations of IBV infection related to the reproductive tract depend on the infecting IBV strain. For example, the M41, Aust T and QX-like strains are known to cause reproductive tract defects in long-lived chickens [15, 17, 25] , leading to low egg production and quality, whereas IBV strains such as Conn and Iowa609 do not cause reproductive tract abnormalities [15] . The mechanisms that lead certain IBV strains to establish reproductive tract infection are unknown. in different body systems. All the IBV strains primarily infect the respiratory tract, and based on the genotypes, the IBV infection can extend to various tissues, either persisting or leading to clinical and pathological manifestations. The solid arrows indicate paths that have been confirmed. The empty arrows indicate paths that have been suggested. The text boxes with continuous borders summarize histological changes, and the text boxes with discontinuous borders represent clinical manifestations. SES, shell-less egg syndrome; FLS, false layer syndrome; GIT, gastrointestinal tract.Subsequent clinical manifestations of IBV infection related to the reproductive tract depend on the infecting IBV strain. For example, the M41, Aust T and QX-like strains are known to cause reproductive tract defects in long-lived chickens [15, 17, 25] , leading to low egg production and quality, whereas IBV strains such as Conn and Iowa609 do not cause reproductive tract abnormalities [15] . The mechanisms that lead certain IBV strains to establish reproductive tract infection are unknown.However, IBV replication in reproductive mucosa has been documented in several studies [15, 61, 62] . Depending on the infecting IBV serotype, localization of IBV antigens in the oviduct can vary, and evidence of higher IBV replication has been observed in chickens infected at a younger age when compared to adults [15] . This age difference in IBV replication is reflected in differences in clinical and pathological outcomes in chickens. For example, chickens infected with certain strains of IBV such as Mass, QX-like strain or Aust T at ages of 1-14 days develop cystic oviducts without impaired ovarian functions, which leads to false layer syndrome with no egg production [15, [63] [64] [65] . Such flocks with false layer syndrome do not reach peak production, with a consequence of premature culling [21, 63] . Infection with IBV in laying hens can negatively influence egg production, resulting in poor-quality eggs, such as misshapen, miscolored, thin, rough-shelled or shell-less eggs and eggs with watery albumin, meat or blood spots, which can peak at around two weeks post-infection [15, 63, 66] . In addition, egg production in laying hens can drop by 35-90% [63, 67] . Although production bounces back close to normal within nine weeks, there can be a 6-12% decline relative to normal production [63, 67] . IBV infection of the reproductive tract of laying hens leads to shorter, hypoglandular oviducts and regressed ovaries [15, 66] .Histologically, deciliation of the epithelium and a reduction in the height of the epithelial cells, along with epithelial desquamation and degeneration, are common in infected oviducts between 7 and 21 dpi [66] with occasional follicular destruction and microbleeding [15, 68] . Fibroplasia and edema of infected lamina propria are also evident [66] . In contrast to the development of false layers, chickens with patent oviducts were found to have an intact surface epithelium with localized hypoplasia of glandular areas [5] . Later, following around 10 dpi, lymphoid nodules are seen in the oviduct [15] .Although the consequences of IBV targeting the reproductive tracts of female chickens is known, little attention has been given to changes corresponding to the reproductive tracts of male chickens, which may cause impacted sperm production, infertility and venereal transmission of IBV [69, 70] . Recent studies have found, depending on the infecting IBV strain, that IBV targets the testes and causes low sperm production and infertility [69, 71, 72] . IBV replication in the efferent duct epithelium and the formation of epididymal stones lead to low sperm production and infertility [69] . Gallardo and colleagues observed IBV replication in cells of the seminiferous tubule (i.e., Sertoli cells) infected with Arkansas (Ark) and Mass IBV strains; moreover, they demonstrated IBV transmission to layers via infected semen, indicating the possibility of venereal transmission of IBV [70] . IBV-induced changes including mononuclear cell and heterophil infiltration, necrosis and microbleeding of testes have been documented [68] .The nephropathogenic IBV strains include B1648, Aus T, QX-like, 4/91, Holte and Gray [6, 24, 25, 32, 50] . The IBV B1648 strain is known to spread from the respiratory tissues via blood monocytes [50] . Following dissemination, IBV strains could infect ciliated cells of the nephron, including proximal, distal and collecting tubules, depending on the infecting IBV strain [3, 32, 47, 48] .IBV strains that target the kidney have received increased attention due to their higher virulence in young chickens when compared to other IBV strains [13, 32, 73] . Apart from the general signs associated with IBV infection, nephropathogenic IBV strains result in weight loss, watery droppings, increased water consumption and an increase in the incidence of mortality [6, 50] . The nephropathogenic IBV pathogenesis also varies according to the breed of the chickens; for example, the clinicopathological manifestations of nephropathogenic IBV are more severe in Rhode Island Red chickens when compared to White Leghorn chickens [32] .At post-mortem examination, IBV-infected kidneys are pale, discolored and enlarged [32, 47] . Urate deposits are also commonly observed with tubular distention [3, 32, 50] . Histologically, tubules develop degenerative changes, ureters become distended with cellular debris and urate crystals are seen in the tubules; in addition, mononuclear cell recruitment in interstitial tissues in the medulla and cortex has been observed [3, 32, 50] .Although IBV has been isolated from cloacal swabs, there is no indication that IBV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is possible that gastrointestinal infection follows respiratory infection, subsequent infection of monocytes and macrophages and the spread of IBV via the blood or lymphatics [50, 59] . IBV strains such as QX-like strains, 793/B (4/91) and Moroccan G are known to infect the gastrointestinal tissues, leading to clinical and pathological manifestations [35, [74] [75] [76] . The QX-like strains are capable of targeting the proventriculus and ileum, leading to proventriculitis and, occasionally, diarrhea [56, 76] . Moroccan G IBV has also been shown to target the gastrointestinal tissues, such as the esophagus, jejunum, ileum and rectum [74] . Other experimental studies that used Moroccan G IBV indicated that the virus targets the epithelial covering of the tips of villi of the ilium and rectum, leading to atrophy of the villi and desquamation of epithelial cells, with lymphocyte, macrophage and heterophil infiltration in the mucosa [3, 35] . IBV 793/B (i.e., 4/91) has also been shown to replicate in the esophagus and ileum, leading to enteritis in young broiler chickens [35] .In the early 1990s, broiler chickens infected with IBV strain 793/B were found to develop bilateral pectoral myopathy [34] . The disease was characterized by edema, due to a gelatinous material, followed by facial hemorrhage and mild separation of muscle fibers [34] . Although bilateral myopathy could not be reproduced with IBV 793/B, mild gross changes were observed with no indication of histological changes or muscle damage [35] . Further, a study that collected samples with bilateral pectoral myopathy from a slaughter plant in Brazil could not establish an association of this condition with IBV infection, although IBV was detected in muscle tissues using molecular techniques [77] . Consequently, the muscle lesions were suggested to be caused by type III hypersensitivity involving the deposition of immune complexes in the capillary walls of pectoral muscles, rather than lesions induced by viral replication [35] .Depending on the IBV strain, the virus can persist in the tissues of chickens for an extended period [40, 74, 78] . For example, IBV (i.e., Aust T strain) can persist, particularly in the cecal tonsils and kidney, for more than seven months [40] . The Mass IBV strain can persist in the cecal tonsils, spleen and kidney for about a month [78] . Although the period of IBV persistence is influenced by the age at infection [42] , the length of persistence does not depend on the systemic anti-IBV antibody concentration [4] . The implications of IBV persistence in chickens are twofold. First, persistently infected chickens are a source of infection for naïve chickens [4] . Second, persistent IBV infection promotes viral evolution [4] .The IBV-induced potential immune-suppressive mechanisms are summarized in Figure 3 . IBV strains 4/91, QX-like, Strain G and Mass infect various immune organs, such as the cecal tonsils [35] , spleen [45] , Harderian gland and bursa of Fabricius [3, 79] . It is not known whether the tropism of IBV for these immune organs depends on the virulence of the infecting IBV strain or whether IBV replication in these immune organs impacts immune functions. It is very well documented that avian viruses that replicate in immune organs, such as Marek's disease virus [80] , chicken anemia virus [81, 82] and infectious bursal disease virus [83] , are immunosuppressive, impacting vaccine-mediated immune response and resulting in secondary bacterial infections [84] . However, recent investigations provided molecular and cellular evidence that IBV, in fact, directly interferes with the host's innate response at various levels, potentially impacting the elicitation of adaptive host response. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 7 are innate receptors and have a role in detecting IBV-associated molecular patterns, such as double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) ribonucleic acid (RNA), respectively [85] . Certain Brazilian strains of IBV are capable of inhibiting TLR7 signaling, leading to decreased proinflammatory cytokines and decreased mRNA expression linked to the development of cell-mediated immune response, leading to increased pathology in the kidney [86] . Similarly, a Conn strain of IBV has been shown to downregulate mRNA expression of TLR3, interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), leading to increased IBV genome accumulation and more severe pathology in the respiratory tissues [87] . Certain strains of IBV can inhibit the expression of pathogen recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) or their signaling pathway, leading to reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which eventually interferes with the innate immune response and induction of the adaptive immune response. IBV is also capable of replicating in respiratory tract macrophages, inhibiting their functions and inducing apoptosis. IBV is capable of incorporating CD59 molecules into its envelop during egress from the host cells, shielding it against lysis via complement-and antibody-dependent mechanisms.Protection against IB is mediated by both antibody-and cell-mediated immune responses [102, 103] . Although the antibody-mediated immune response predominantly depends on a response , enabling it to persist in the host for a longer period. Epithelial cells are the primary target sites of IBV replication, which results in deciliation and destruction, leading to inhibition of the mucociliary escalator mechanism. Certain strains of IBV can inhibit the expression of pathogen recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) or their signaling pathway, leading to reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which eventually interferes with the innate immune response and induction of the adaptive immune response. IBV is also capable of replicating in respiratory tract macrophages, inhibiting their functions and inducing apoptosis. IBV is capable of incorporating CD59 molecules into its envelop during egress from the host cells, shielding it against lysis via complement-and antibody-dependent mechanisms.One of the immune cell types that bridges innate and adaptive host responses is the macrophages, and the available data show that certain IBV serotypes (i.e., Mass and Conn) target respiratory tract macrophages and replicate within them, thus leading to a productive infection [59, 88] . Although the impact of immune cell targeting of IBV has not been studied completely, IBV replication in macrophages could decrease type 1 IFNs activity [59] , similar to IBV's ability to hinder type 1 IFNs response in epithelial and fibroblast cells [89] . Type 1 IFNs are the main antiviral molecules synthesized in the host in response to viral replication, and, previously, it has been shown that IBV is sensitive to the antiviral activity of type 1 IFNs given as a treatment to prevent IB in chickens [90] . Although it is not known how IBV inhibits the function of type 1 IFNs in macrophages, one potential explanation is that the accessory proteins of IBV could play a role in this immune evasion strategy. In agreement with this view, the ability of IBV accessary proteins 3a and 5b to interfere with type 1 IFNs production in target cells other than macrophages has been shown [89, 91] . Other than this interference with the production of type 1 IFNs, IBV is capable of inhibiting the downstream signaling of type 1 IFNs, minimizing the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) by preventing the functioning of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) [89] . Another implication of IBV replication in macrophages is the destruction of macrophages due to apoptosis. IBV could induce programmed cell death in avian macrophages via intrinsic and extrinsic routes involved in apoptosis [88] . Although the mechanisms of the destruction of macrophages by IBV require further investigation, evidence has shown that macrophage numbers increase at 24 h and then decline in the trachea and lungs in response to IBV infection [87] . It is important to understand whether this decline is related to the apoptosis of IBV-infected macrophages.The complement system functions as a part of the innate arm of the immune response and also plays a role in adaptive immune functions. The components of the complement pathway aid in the host immune response via complement-and antibody-mediated lysis of viruses [92] [93] [94] [95] . Since host cells are shielded from lysis via this strategy due to the expression of CD59 in the host cell membrane, IBV is capable of incorporating CD59 into its envelop during exit from the host cells, negating lysis via complement-and antibody-dependent mechanisms [96] . Previous studies showed that IBV is vulnerable to attack by this strategy [97] .IBV replication impacting the respiratory tract brings forth a defective clearance mechanism by the deciliation of the respiratory epithelium, thereby increasing the vulnerability of respiratory surfaces to secondary bacterial infections [98] . The co-infection of respiratory pathogens with IBV causes complications and worsens the clinical and pathological manifestations [18, 99] . The infection of chickens with Mycoplasma gallisepticum followed by IBV infection can result in coryza, tracheitis and airsacculitis in the host [100] . In addition, secondary infections with pathogenic Escherichia coli can lead to prominent lesions in respiratory surfaces, pericarditis and death [18] . In addition, the co-infection of Haemophilus paragallinarum with IBV could result in severe lesion development and increased mortality rates [101] .Protection against IB is mediated by both antibody-and cell-mediated immune responses [102, 103] . Although the antibody-mediated immune response predominantly depends on a response to the IBV S1 protein, the main cell-mediated response, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response is elicited by the IBV N protein [103] . Following IBV infection, memory B [104] and T cells [105] are formed and are present in peripheral blood and the spleen. Following IB vaccination, the number of B and T cells increases in the harderian gland [106] . Increased recruitments of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the trachea have also been shown following application of live IB vaccines [107] .Vaccination is the primary choice for the control of IB in the poultry industry. The chickens receive multiple IB vaccinations, and the frequency of vaccination depends on the expected production life of the chicken. For broilers, day-old vaccination in the hatchery is commonly practiced followed by a booster vaccination at 2-3 weeks of age [99] . Multiple vaccinations with live attenuated vaccines are usually given to layers and breeders followed by a killed vaccine just before the onset of the laying period [108, 109] . The live attenuated vaccines are administered via drinking water, eye drop, or coarse spray and inactivated vaccines are given parenterally. For example, in Eastern Canada, the layer and breeder pullets are vaccinated with various combinations of live attenuated IB vaccines starting at one day of age and then, at two, five and nine weeks followed by an inactivated IB vaccine given at fourteen weeks of age. During the lay, the chickens are not vaccinated. The goal of such layer and breeder vaccination strategies is to ensure the transfer of maternal antibodies to the offspring [110] as well as provide the extended protection during the lay [111, 112] .However, vaccination of day-old chickens is controversial for three reasons. First, maternal antibodies could be protective against potential IBV infection during the first few days of life while early vaccination could enhance the decay of the maternal antibodies [110] . Second, early vaccination (i.e., Day 1 of age) induces poor B cell and T cell responses when compared to later vaccination (i.e., Day 7 of age) [106] . Third, IB vaccination at the day of age can induce severe vaccine reactions [113] . Despite these reasons, live attenuated IB vaccination in the hatchery can be critical for the prevention of severe respiratory illness and cystic lesions in the oviduct that results from very early exposure to virulent IBVs [65, 114] .Since the introduction of vaccination against IB using live attenuated (Mass serotype) vaccines, different vaccine serotypes such as 4/91, Ark, Conn, D274 and D1466 have been developed and made available commercially [115] . Based on the prevalence of the various IBV serotypes, and the availability of licensed vaccines in a geographical area, different areas within countries use different combinations of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. In certain regions in Europe, vaccines against Mass and 4/91 serotypes are widely used, while, in certain states within USA, vaccines against Mass, Ark and Conn serotypes are extensively used [108] . The serological response to IBV is mainly induced by the S1 protein [116, 117] and, consequently, cross-protection induced by IB vaccines against heterologous strains varies widely. The study of Cook and colleagues indicated that the use of more than one vaccine serotype can produce better cross-protection against challenge with heterologous IBV serotypes [118] . Therefore, priming with more than one heterologous live vaccines and boosting with inactivated or live attenuated vaccines are practiced particularly by layer and breeder industries [65] . It has also been shown that vaccination protocols that involve more than one serotype induced better immune cell recruitment in the respiratory mucosa when compared to vaccination with a single serotype vaccine [107] .Although control of IB relies on vaccination [113] , several limitations of IB vaccination have been observed. The steady increase of IBV variants leading to frequent outbreaks in vaccinated flocks has become a concern increasingly [99, 119, 120] . In addition, attenuated IBV strains used for vaccination can spread among individual birds within flocks [121] , and changes in virulence during bird-to-bird passage can lead to production problems [120, 122] . Coinfection of host cells with live attenuated IB vaccines and wild type IBV can also result in genomic recombination contributing to the virus evolution [11, 123] as well as mutations that can occur under the effect of immune pressure [124] [125] [126] . Although the global poultry industry practices hatchery vaccination against IB, Day 1 may not be the optimum time for vaccination in terms of inducing systemic and mucosal immune responses against IB [106] because of the developing immune system [127] . The availability of a limited number of licensed vaccines to choose in a geographical area is also a constraint. For example, in Canada, various IBV variants including Mass, Conn, 4/91, CA1737 and DMV/1639 [11, 23, [128] [129] [130] are circulating in poultry flocks and only live attenuated vaccines developed against Mass and Conn serotypes and inactivated vaccines developed against Mass and Ark serotypes are available for optimizing on farm IB vaccination strategies.Given the limited efficacy of existing IB vaccination strategies, it is critical to establish an IBV surveillance system that characterizes the different IBV strains circulating in various geographical areas and that we understand the antigenic and/or genetic similarities between the circulating IBVs and the available IB vaccines. These data will lead to the optimization of IB vaccination strategies to prevent vaccine breaks. If the existing vaccines are not useful in optimizing vaccination strategies, it would also worth developing autogenous vaccines (inactivated) using characterized unique IBV isolates prevalent in a given geographical area in order to include in the existing vaccination regimes. Given the available scientific evidence against IB vaccination at the hatchery [106, 110] , it may also be appropriate to postpone the first IB vaccination to a barn vaccination done at seven days of age relying on maternal antibody response to protect the chickens during the first week of life [110] . There are numerous issues surrounding the use of live attenuated IB vaccines [11, 99, [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] , and relying on inactivated vaccines can be an option, but they inherently lack the ability to induce mucosal immune response, which is critical for the control of IB [131] [132] [133] . It is possible that inactivated vaccines can be used for the induction of mucosal immune response when combined with various nanoparticles [132] .After decades of research into IBV and numerous studies on vaccine efficacy for the control of IB, this disease is still a major economic concern globally. Although many studies have been conducted on IBV pathogenesis, there is little specific information on IBV receptors that determine macrophage tropism and tissue tropism, mechanisms that allow IBV dissemination from the respiratory tract to secondary tissues, IBV persistence in the cecal tonsils and kidney and the immunopathogenesis and immunosuppressive mechanisms of different strains of IBV. Novel and sensitive assays and other necessary tools are now available for in-depth investigations of the mechanisms involved in these pathogenesis events. Given the concern of vaccine breaks and the emergence of heterogeneous IBV strains, investigations leading to an in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of IBV are necessary.Studies of host-IBV interaction lead to the understanding of tropism of IBV for various body systems, severity of lesions produced in each of these tissues and ways the virus is shed to the environment [3, 51, 64, 134] . For example, certain IBV variants impact tissues such as kidney and reproductive tract in addition to the respiratory tract [13, 23, 32, 33] . We are not aware if the current vaccination protocols induce adequate mucosal immune responses in each of these tissues to minimize consequences of IBV replication. It is critical to optimize IB vaccination strategies that induce adequate immune responses in target body systems of these IBV variants minimizing the impact.In addition to secondary bacterial infections, vaccine induced immune response to any pathogen can be impacted by immune suppression induced by IBV. It is necessary to determine if IBV induced immune suppression impact the immune responses intended to be generated by a variety of vaccines used in chickens [127] . Another area worth investigating is whether IB vaccines are immunosuppressive similar to wild type IBV.","Egypt","abstract","2020-09-24",9

These viruses are of special interest because they possess the largest genome among RNA viruses and also have the capability to infect a wide host range causing intestinal and respiratory infections in animals and humans [3, 4] . In recent times, coronaviruses have attracted renewed interest in view of a novel coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID- 19 ) that originated in Wuhan, China [5] . The causative agent was found to be a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that was identified in December, 2019. Barely two months after its discovery, had the disease become a pandemic of global concern causing widespread morbidity and mortality [6, 7] . Because COVID-19 is a serious respiratory disease, the causative pathogen was later known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Before the origin of SARS-CoV-2, six coronaviruses were known to infect man [5, 8] . Out of these, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused severe respiratory illness in humans [9, 10] . In 2002, SARS-CoV, originating from Guangdong Province, Southern China, and MERS-CoV emerging from Saudi Arabia caused serious epidemics in 2002/2003 and 2012 respectively [11, 12] . The severity of the respiratory diseases occasioned by these viruses and the resulting wide spread morbidity and mortality had been reported elsewhere [13] .Immediately after its identification, scientists in several laboratories swiftly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome making the complete and partial sequences available in public databases. Within few months, the number of viral genome entries in databanks grew exponentially, and this afforded scientists unprecedented opportunity for undertaking molecular, phylogenetic and epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2. It was re-established that coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 possess the largest genome ranging from 26.4 to 31.7 kb among all RNA viruses [14, 15] . Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The first two-third portion of the genome beginning from the 5' end codes for a polyprotein pp1ab, whose cleavage gave several non-structural proteins (nsps) that are mainly associated with genome replication and transcription [15, 16] . On the remaining portion of coronavirus genome (i.e. towards the 3' end), there are four genes that encode viral structural proteins namely Spike, (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) necessary for viral infectivity and transmissibility [17] . Out of these four structural genes, the S gene has attracted the greatest attention because it encodes the spike protein which binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) for viral attachment and entry into human cells. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly optimized for binding to human ACE2 receptor using the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike glycoprotein [18] .The first coronavirus genome sequence report in Africa was from a Nigerian index case who travelled to the country from Italy in February, 2020 [19] . In early March, 2020, complete (29, 798 nt) and partial (486 nt) genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from the index case were where the Nigerian index case clustered with a European clade [19] . Subsequent analysis of 18 complete sequences suggested multiple introduction and community transfer in Nigeria [20] .These preliminary reports focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations without a comprehensive molecular characterization in terms of number and distribution of SNPs, haplotype, and conserved genomic regions of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2. We hereby present a report of a detailed computational analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 using genome data deposited in GISAID database. The results of this study will aid the understanding of variability and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome in Nigerian population bearing in mind that such knowledge is crucial for efficient genetic testing, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 interventions in Nigeria.Whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database. A total of 43 sequences were deposited as at 18 th July, 2020. Out of these, 42 sequences were complete genome sequences when filtered out by selecting the 'complete' filter button in GISAID database page implying that one sequence was partial. To ensure acceptable size and quality of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence for the study, 'high coverage' filtering button was also selected. This and quality check by visualization left us with 18 sequences that satisfied all the selection criteria (Table 1 ). According to GISAID database, 'complete' genome sequences are sequences with >29,000 nucleotides (nts) while 'high coverage' sequences are those with <1% Ns 6 and no insertions and deletions unless verified by the submitter. The sequences were retrieved by downloading in FASTA file format from GISAID database for further analysis.To ensure true homology, non-biological differences (i.e. differences due to technical variations) were removed from retrieved sequences. The sequences were aligned in MAFFT and trimmed at the 5' and 3' ends in MEGA X to obtain homologous sequences of 29,787 nts each. Alignment revealed that 49 nucleotides should be removed at the 5' end while 67 nucleotides should be pruned away at the 3' end to obtain the 29,787 nts for each of the homologous sequences used for the study. The trimmed sequences were mapped onto a reference genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved by downloading from NCBI GenBank (Accession No: NC_045512.2) in order to determine the location of sites on the sampled genome sequences [15] . The 5' and the 3' ends of the aligned sequences are shown in Fig. 1 . Then, the sequences were re-aligned in MAFFT (Fig.1) to produce aligned sequences that were fed into DnaSP for SNP and haplotype analysis and subsequently into Jalview 2.11.1.0 for visualization and automatic determination of allelic frequency of SNPs.Genomic locations of SNPs were determined relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome sequence obtained from NCBI GenBank (Accession No: NC 045512.2). A polymorphic site is considered as a genomic location with the frequency of the second most frequent allele greater than 1%; otherwise, they were referred to as monomorphic. Rare alleles are those with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 1%, and the viruses carrying them were rare variants. Detection of SNPs, linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis was done in DnaSPv6.12.03 while SNP distribution and density was obtained by a series of MS Excel formulae packaged by us.Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction was implemented in MEGA X using sequences that had been aligned by MAFFT employing Tamura-Nei evolutionary model under assumption of uniform nucleotide substitution [21, 22] . The tree that had topology with superior log likelihood value was selected from the initial trees by applying neighbor-joining (NJ) and bio-NJ algorithm in a heuristic search. Analysis of the tree was based on topology and clustering pattern analysis. Tree validation was by 100 bootstrap replicates [23] .The summary statistics of 18 SARS-CoV-2 complete sequences that satisfied our selection criteria are presented in Table 1 . The complete genome sequences of mean size 29863 + 35. 11 (mean+SD) were obtained from the retrieved sequences from SARS-CoV-2 isolated from 18 subjects (8M: 6F: 4 Unknown Sex) from 6 states in Nigeria namely, Kwara, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Ekiti and Ondo. Linkage analysis involving pairwise comparison of SNPs showed that several SNPs are in 2locus linkage disequilibrium (LD) in SARS-CoV-2 genome with majority of the SNPs above the significant (P<0.05) horizontal threshold line indicated in Fig. 2 . The total number of significant pairwise haplotypes detected by Fisher's exact test was 108 out of which 12 were highly significant (P<0.001) by Bonferoni procedure (Table 3 ). Two linked SNPs: a C/T SNP at location 8782 nt in the orf1ab region and a T/C SNP at 28144 nt in ORF8 region identified byCui et al., [1] were absolutely linked in this study ( Table 4 ). The frequency of CT haplotype (L lineage) and TC (S lineage) were 13 (72.2%) and 5 (27.8%) respectively (Fig. 3) . Multiple sequence alignment of translated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene revealed a D/G amino acid substitution at position 614 of the spike protein (Fig. 4) . There was a preponderance of D614G mutation because majority 11 (61.1%) of the analyzed genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 had G at 614 position of spike protein as compared to 7 (39.9%) that had D at the site.Clustering analysis of the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree gave 3 major clades. On the basis of the preponderance of taxa, the clusters were identified as Oyo, Ekiti and Osun. Reference sequence clustered with Osun clade. Majority of the nodes have high bootstrap support (60%-100%). The node that defines Ekiti clade had the lowest bootstrap support of 22%. In the present study, whole-genome sequence characterization and phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 subjects was carried out. Out of the 42Nigerian complete genome sequences in GISAID database, only 18 fulfilled our selection criteria for inclusion in the study. In view of the implications of quality of results for validity of results, it was better, in our opinion, to use 18 sequences of acceptable quality rather than using 42 sequences where more than half of the sequences are of low or questionable quality.Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% implying 0.01% dissimilarity in accordance with the global trend [15, 16] . It was therefore not surprising that four large conserved genomic regions were identified in this study. This observation supports the well-established view that the novel virus has a recent origin estimated to be between 6 th October and 11 th December 2019 [24] .Furthermore, Nigeria has extended family and communal structure, which could favour community transmission of the novel virus. Thus, Nigeria's socio-cultural attributes may contribute (at least in part) to the high degree of similarity and the ethnic based clustering pattern on the phylogenetic tree obtained in this study. It will be of interest to carry out comparative analysis of conserved regions involving genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in other parts of the world to compare their tree topologies with that of Nigeria.Despite the high degree of similarity, some degree of diversity resulting from SNPs found in SARS-CoV-2 genome, was detected. The number of SNPs detected in this study was low when compared with other studies [25] . A limitation of this study is the small sample size of eighteen genome sequences used in this study, which we consider too small for detection of all SARS-CoV-2 SNPs in Nigeria. In subsequent studies, it will be of interest to see if distribution of SNPs and conserved regions identified in this study are peculiar to Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 or have complete overlap with genomes of SARS-CoV-2 found elsewhere. If there are regions of nonoverlap, any attempt to produce testing kits with high sensitivity for Nigeria's COVID-19 cases should take note of the conserved regions and SNP distribution in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 detected in this study.The frequency of SNPs observed in the Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 genome is higher than twice the frequency of SNPs in human genome which is generally taken to be 1 SNP per 1000 bps. The UTRs, especially 3'UTR, are mutation hot spots in Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 genome. This is expected because UTRs, unlike coding sequences, are generally under more relaxed or neutral selection pressure which allow mutations to accumulate at a higher rate in that region [25] .Relatively high SNP densities were also recorded in some of the coding regions of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2. An example is ORF 10 region with a SNP density of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts.Although coronaviridae have proofreading capability due to their exonuclease activity during nucleotide replication, mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at ~6 × 10 − 4 nucleotides/genome/year with the capacity to mutate during human-to-human transmission [24] .We share the view that characterizing organisms and viruses by haplotypes is more informative than using individual SNPs. Such haplotype analysis gave results which agreed with an early report by Cui et al., [1] who proposed two major lineages namely the L lineage carrying CT haplotype at the closely linked positions C8782 and T28144 respectively and the S lineage with nucleotides T and C (TC haplotype) at the corresponding genome locations. The higher frequency of L lineage viruses which was higher than those of S lineage in this study is consistent with the original finding by Cui et al., [1] . Few recombinants were observed in their study unlike the present study where both loci were absolutely linked such that no recombinants were recovered. According to Cui et al., [1] , identification as L and S lineages was based on the amino acids resulting from T28144C substitution in which leucine (L lineage) is replaced with serine (S lineage).Similar increased frequency of viruses in the L lineage as compared to those in the S lineage was observed at 23403 nt position where A23403G nucleotide substitution caused D614G mutation on SaRS-CoV-2 spike protein. Majority of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria were G614 (G type) mutants as opposed to the D614 (D type) ancestral form in agreement with the global trend [26] .Preponderance of L and G variants in many populations was accounted for by their increasedDarwinian fitness whereby these newly evolved strains have competitive advantage over their alternative and more ancestral forms in terms of infectivity, transmissibility and, possibly, virulence. Others felt that the preponderance of the L and the G mutants might result from sampling bias and founder effect [27] .Results of studies just concluded in the Center for Genomics Noncommunicable and Personalized Healthcare (CGNPH) in the University of Lagos, Nigeria (not yet published), suggested that SNPs and mutation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 vary between continents and, in some cases, between different countries in the same continent. In view of the fact that testing kits are generally nucleic acid based and the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to evade detection due to its mutational dynamics, it is difficult or impossible to have universal testing kits with equal efficiency for detecting the novel coronavirus in all parts of the world [28] . Therefore, the identified conserved regions and the distribution of SNPs in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Nigeria has implications for Nigeria-based intervention programmes in the area of viral detection, drug designing and treatment options as had been generally noted by Vankadari [29] . According to Puty et al., [28] , it is important for every population to identify key SARS-CoV-2 mutations and SNPs for appropriate population-based intervention specific for its population. The view of Wang et al., [15] that limited sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection kits is possibly associated with genetic variation of the virus is pertinent. Thus, any meaningful intervention activity should consider SARS-CoV-2 strains in the concerned population.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-25",9

[6] [7] [8] However, some patients have been diagnosed positive by real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nucleic acid test results without relevant clinical symptoms or who are only minimally symptomatic. 9 Current research evidence shows that asymptomatic individuals have the same infectivity as those with symptomatic infections and can spread the virus efficiently. 10 In turn, the emergence of these silent transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 has caused difficulties in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. 11 Both innate and adaptive immune responses are activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection to overcome the problem. 12 However, uncontrolled inflammatory innate immune responses may lead to harmful tissue damage. Commonly, the symptoms resulted from the consequent infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. 12 These include interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, which are responsible for fever and fibrosis and/or plural effusion of the lung, which provoke severe acute respiratory syndrome. 13, 14 In addition, CXCL9 and CXCL16, chemoattractants of T cells and/or natural killer (NK) cells, CCL8 and CCL2, recruiting monocytes/macrophages, CXCL8, and other classic neutrophil chemoattractants are profoundly elevated. Therefore, we suggest that the presence of these cells may be a primary driver of the signature pathology observed in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This review describes the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity, and discusses the escaping mechanism against interferons (IFNs), predominantly Nsps, as well as the pathology of the disease, related to exuberant activation of the complement system. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the interactions of the virus with innate immunity and the immunopathology behind COVID-19 could lead to new approaches aimed at improving immunotherapy for SARS-CoV-2.Innate Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2s, For effective recognition of viral infection and successive activation of an antiviral state, innate immune responses are vital and essential host defense mechanisms. 15 The innate immune response is the first-line inborn host defense mechanism against non-specific pathogens. This innate immunity to viruses involves complex interactions between soluble factors and cells. These cells understand and sense the foreign microbes through the presence of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), commonly named toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs, a family of sensor proteins, assist the immune system in discriminating between ""self"" and ""non-self"". 16 The TLR detects a specific and conserved microbial domain called the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), which acts as a ligand with elements such as lipids, lipoproteins, proteins, RNAs, and DNA of the microbe's structure. 17, 18 TLR family members TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 are involved exclusively in the membrane's intracellular compartments, such as endosomes, in the recognition of viral nucleotides. The TLR signaling cascade is mediated by the TIR (toll/IL-1 receptor) domain, which contains an adaptor molecule, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TIR-domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), or TIR-domain-containing adapter (TRIF). [18] [19] [20] The TIR complex plays a role in the inflammatory immune response via the production of proinflammatory cytokines, type I IFN, and up-regulation of costimulatory molecules. 21, 22 In a small COVID-19 patient cohort, levels of IFN-α and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) were associated with viral load as well as disease severity. 23 Taking this a step further, these studies indicate that severe infections lead to high IFN signatures but fail to clear and bring down the viral load. In contrast, owing to their virulence gene product, the expression and IFN-α/β response are decreased (Figure 1 ). In the same way as SARS-CoV, 20 SRAS-CoV-2 uses its spike glycoprotein to bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry to cells, 24 suggesting a similar cellular tropism and route of entry. This receptor is expressed not only in cardiopulmonary tissues, particularly in type I alveolar cells, but also in some hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. 19 Prior to the translocation of IFN regulator factors (IRF-7) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, the single-stranded viral RNA should be recognized by TLR-7 with the following recruited signal transducing adaptor proteins, MyD88, playing a key role. Hence, it promotes the expression of type I IFN (primarily IFN-α and IFN-βs), chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 2 ). 25 The major antiviral chemical mediators in the innate immune response are IFNs, which act to limit the spread of the virus and enhance macrophage phagocytosis of the pathogen, as well as NK cell restriction of infected target cells.Interferons are a large family of genetically and functionally related proteins. These molecules were discovered in the 1950s by Isaacs and Lindemann. They are recognized as essential first-line biological protein defense against viral infection in mammals. 26, 27 The term ""IFN"" was coined to describe a special substance, possibly produced by cells, which is centrally important in the innate immune response to the virus through ""interfering"" with virus replication, with antiviral activity, antiproliferative activity, stimulation of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, and immune modulation. 28, 29 IFNs are divided into three types, named type I, type II, and type III. 20 Type I IFNs are the largest IFN family, including IFN-α (13 subtypes) encoded at chromosome 9, IFN-β encoded at chromosome 12, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, and IFN-ω. 26, 30, 31 IFN-δ, IFN-τ, and IFN-ζ (or limitin) have also been identified as type I IFNs in swine, ruminants, and mice, respectively. 32 Furthermore, four IFN-like cytokines have been reported: limitin (found only in mice), IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29, found in humans and other mammals. Almost all cell types are capable of producing IFN-α/β; however, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are specialist type I IFN-producing cells, particularly producing IFN-α, β, and ω during the course of an infection.The activation of the IFN system is the most important defense for containing the initial stages of a viral infection. IFN is mostly produced when TLRs on the cell surface (TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, and TLR-10) are induced by lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, and virion proteins. 33 On the other hand, some TLRs are anchored to the endosomal membrane (TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9), which is stimulated by PAMPs such as dsRNA, ssRNA virus, and viral dsDNA. Upon the attachment or binding of viral RNAs to TLR-7/8, it can induce genes encoding for inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs via NF-κB and IRF-7 ( Figure 3 ). 16, 33, 34 In addition, cytoplasmic viral RNA genomes or viral replicative intermediates can be recognized by the family of RNA helicases, such as retinoic acid-induced gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), which ultimately can control genes encoded for IFN production. [35] [36] [37] In the foundation of the innate immune response system, type I IFNs are first line of defense against viral infection. Immediately after the body encounters a viral infection, host cell PRRs, such as TLRs, RLR, Mda5, protein kinase R (PKR), and 2′-5′oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), serve in discriminating self from non-self ligands at a cellular level, which stimulates the cells to produce and secrete IFN. The IFN signaling cascades are initiated upon its binding with its receptor, IFRAR1/2, leading to cytoplasmic kinase activation that allows the recruitment of JAK-1 and TYK, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, respectively.Both transcription factors then form heterodimers with IRF-9, and translocate to act on the IFNstimulated response element (ISRE) and promote the binding of RNA polymerase II to expressISG. 20 After translation followed by posttranslational modification, the product of ISG brings an antiviral effect and immunomodulation, and by inhibiting replication it can limit both the spread and the load of the virus ( Figure 3 ). IFNs are rapidly secreted and induce a wide range of effects that not only act upon innate immune cells but also modulate the adaptive immune system. Type I IFNs-α/β are broadspectrum antivirals, both exhibiting direct inhibitory effects on viral replication and supporting an immune response to clear the viral infection. 38 A study conducted in China showed that treatment with IFN-α2b (manufactured using recombinant DNA technology) with or without Arbidol ® (an inhibitor of Nsp12 cofactors called Nsp7/8) significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract. At the same time, IFN-α2b reduced the duration of elevated blood levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and C-reactive protein. Surprisingly, from the onset of symptoms, the mean time to viral clearance was 27.9, 21.1, and 20.3 days for patients treated with Arbidol (umifenovir) alone, IFN-α2b alone, and a combination of Arbidol and IFN-α2b, respectively. 39 Therefore, these research findings illustrate that IFN treatment accelerated viral clearance by approximately 7 days. 39, 40 Moreover, for better clinical outcomes of patients with cytokine storm, the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab (branded as Actemra), a recombinant human IL-6 monoclonal antibody, is useful as a therapeutic adjunct. 41, 42 Complement Activation in SARS-CoV-2 InfectionThe complement system is a key player in innate immunity and consists of both soluble factors and cell surface receptors that interact to sense and respond against invading pathogens. 43 It can also act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity to enhance humoral immunity and T-cell function. 44 Complements recognize non-self-structures which present on the surface of pathogens, and initiate activation of zymogens via proteolytic cascades, resulting in inflammation, opsonization, and/or cell lysis. 45 However, the defensive function of the complement system can exacerbate immune, inflammatory, and degenerative responses in various pathological conditions. In general, in response to foreign pathogen, there are three major complement activation pathways. The first one is the classical pathway, characterized by C1qmediated antigen-antibody complexes. The second is the lectin pathway, initiated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which recognizes the microbial surface glycan domain, called mannose. Mannose-associated serine protease (MASP) cleaves complement (C)4 and 2. C4 and C2 cleavage products form the classical and lectin pathway C3 convertase (C4bC2a), which cleaves C3 into C3b and C3a. A second molecule of C3b can associate with C4bC2a to form C5 convertase (C4bC2aC3b) of the classical and lectin pathways. 45 The third is the alternative pathway, mediated by spontaneous cleavage of C3 binding with the pathogen's cell surface components. [44] [45] [46] While complements play a central role in innate immunity and provide abridge with the adaptive immune response against pathogens, their overactivation may cause excessive alveolar air sac infiltration byneutrophils, and monocytes secondary to excessive production of C3a and C5a ( Figure 4 ). Subsequently, this leads to collateral lung injury and exacerbating factors for SARS-CoVassociated ARDS. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the body does not have memory antibodies or specific IgG to detect the spike glycoprotein through activation of adaptive immunity in the early phase of COVID-19 infection. 47, 48 Since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory disease, the primary antibody secreted might be IgA, which is not reliable for activating the classical complement pathway, unless based on an aggregated antibody. Instead, the virus may form IgA complexes or SARS-CoV-S-N-glycan (N-330) MBL binding to activate the lectin complement cascade defense against the invading virus in mucosal immunity. 49 Overriding activation of complement pathways leads to the formation of bioactive molecules, mainly C3a and C5a. C5a is the most potent chemoattractant involved in the migration and recruitment of inflammatory cells in the activation of phagocytic cells and the release of granular enzymes and free radicals. 50 Since SARS-CoV-2 has a similar identity to SARS-CoV, C3a products of the complement cascade exacerbate SARS-CoV-associated ARDS. 51 A study showed that C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less respiratory dysfunction, decreased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes, and low levels of cytokines and chemokines in both lungs as well as sera. However, they showed similar viral load in the lung alveoli. 51 SARS-CoV-2-mediated C5a triggers inflammatory cell activation and cytokine release. This results in epithelial cell degradation and increased vascular permeability. Together, large numbers of inflammatory infiltrates, fluid, and blood cells shift to the alveoli and lung pleura, resulting in dyspnea and respiratory insufficiency. Many scholars have shown that C5a signaling contributes greatly to inflammation and lung damage, and is targeted at treating highly pathogenic virus infections. Moreover, recently C5aR targeting has shown more promising beneficial effects than C5 in small animal models of ARDS by reducing proinflammatory cytokines. [52] [53] [54] In addition, different research output elaborates that C5 is a bottleneck for both the release of C5a as an inflammatory mediator and the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5b-C9) as a defense against viral infection. Thus, anti-C5a and anti-C5aR only block the effects of C5a without affecting the formation of the MAC, thus protecting against not only viral infection but also superimposed bacterial infections of the lung. 55, 56 Eculizumab is an anti-C5 antibody; however, C5aR antagonists such as MP-435 target the action of C5a alone and do not inhibit MAC formation Figure 4 ). 57 Therefore, receptor antagonists (anti-C5aR) may lessen a patient's susceptibility to bacterial infection, so caution is needed when anti-C5 monoclonal antibodies are used.Viruses have evolved a number of strategies to evade the immune response. 58, 59 Even though SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are sensitive to the IFN-α/β immune response system, this novel coronavirus is still highly pathogenic. Recent and previous research experience on SARS-CoV showed that the genome contains virulence factors that target core molecules to evade the host response. One of the major mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape from host innate immunity is encoded COVID-19 proteins inhibiting IFN production and signaling cascade. This allows the virus to replicate, transcribe, and be transmitted. The detailed understanding of the mechanism of hindrance of IFN production and actions, promoting COVID-19 replication and proliferation, is essential in planning therapeutic options and controls against viral infection. Nsp16 encodes 2′-O-methyltransferase, which can methylate the RNA cap at 2ʹ-O-positions. 60 The first strategies inhibit type I IFN production by viral genes encoding for Nsp16 or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (Ado Met)-dependent 2ʹ-O-methylase. This involves posttranscriptional modification of the ssRNA at the 5ʹterminal and changing 5′-triphosphate groups into methylated 5ʹ-cap-1 formation, and mimicking the host cell's mRNA. Therefore, the viral RNA is capable of mimicking the host RNA and is not detected by MDA-5 and TLR-7/8, allowing the virus to escape innate immune recognition. 61 Yet, any non-self-recognizable RNA (having 5′-triphosphate groups) in the cytoplasm can be specifically recognized by RIG-I or TLR-7/8 or Mda5, which then amplify type I IFN production. 62, 63 In contrast, eukaryotic mRNA, which is not recognized by retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) or MDA-5, usually has a 5′-cap structure methylated at the N7 position of the capping guanosine residue (cap 0), the resulting ribose-2′-O position (cap 1), and sometimes at adjoining residues (cap 2) during posttranscriptional modification. 64 Also, Nsp10 works with Nsp16 to bind to SAM and m7GpppA-RNA as substrated for its 2ʹ-O-MTase activity. 64, 65 Thus, eukaryotic mRNA 5′-cap structures are known to increase mRNA stability, protecting against 5′-exonuclease. This facilitates the binding of translational initiation factor proteins with both 40s and 60s ribosomes, and enhances translational efficacy. 66 Nsp3 (1922 aa) is the largest multidomain protein among all the Nsps of β-CoV. It is cleaved off from ORF1a/ORF1ab by the papain-like protease domain or PL2pro domain that is within Nsp3 itself. 67, 68 It is a central player during the formation of viral replication associated with other Nsps, especially Nsp4 and Nsp6. 69 SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 contains 16 domains, namely ubiquitin-like domain 1 (Ubl1), hypervariable region (HVR) or acidic domain, macrodomain I/II/III (MacI/II/ III), domain preceding Ubl2 and PL2pro (DPUP), ubiquitin-like domain 2 (Ubl2), papain-like protease 2 domain (PL2pro), nucleic acid binding domain (NAB), beta coronavirus-specific marker domain (βSM), transmembrane domain 1 (TM1), Nsp3 ecto-domain (3Ecto), transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), amphipathic helix region (AH1), and domains specific to Nidoviriales and Coronaviridae (Y1 and CoV-Y). 68 After Nsp16, Nsp3 acts as the second most important virulent gene product, mainly by inhibiting RIG-I (cytoplasmic cascade) and TLR-3/7 (endosomal)dependent IFN-α/β production, probably by interaction of the papain-like protease (PLP) domain with protein stimulators of IFN gene (STING). PLP of MERS-CoV downregulates the gene encoding for IFN-β via its deubiquitinating activity. 70 Moreover, even though the mechanism is not yet clear, different scholars have indicated that the PLP of SARS-CoV inhibits the host antiviral innate immune response by inhibiting phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of IRF-7 or -3, likely by forming a complex with IRF-3. 71, 72 Nsp1 is found in the closest portion of the 5ʹ end encoded by ORF1a/b. This Nsp is considered as the third virulent factor, by inhibiting IFN-β mRNA from being translated into the protein product and by promoting degradation of overexpressed host endogenous mRNA. Its mechanism is to bind with 40s ribosomal subunits and cause conformational change (loss of function), and prevent 80s formation, resulting in translational inhibition. Furthermore, the Nsp1-40s ribosomal complex induces the modification of 5ʹ-capped mRNA and renders the template RNA translationally incompetent. 64, 73, 74 Nsp1 also inhibits the action of IFN-α/β on its signaling cascade intermediates, mainly on the JAK-STAT pathway via blocking its phosphorylation (Figure 1 ). 72 The SARS-CoV-1 or -2 genome consists of nine unique ORFs. Of these, ORF3a is the largest and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids. 75 The 3a protein is part of the virus particle and is expressed abundantly in infected cells. 76 The major virulence of this sectioned viral protein is achieved by downregulation of the expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), leading to a blockade on type I IFN signaling. 72, 77 IFNs are known to be crucial regulators of the development of Treg cells. In the regulatory immune system of patients with COVID-19, Treg cell counts have been shown to correlate inversely with disease severity. 78The genomes of replicases are involved during viral RNA gene expression. They are also considered as virulent gene products of the viruses to enable escape from the host immune response. 70, 79 The multidomain Nsp3 (PLP), Nsp5 (3CLpro), Nsp12 (the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), Nsp16 (2ʹ-O-methyltransferase), and Nsp13 (ATP-dependent RNA helicase) are the most important popular drug targets because of their vital biological function ( Figure 5 ). 70 Since COVID-19 does not have a confirmed drug option, many broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral drugs are under clinical trial to reduce and treat the virus. [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] Drugs that have shown high binding affinity to Nsp3 include ribavirin, valganciclovir, thymidine, and levodropropizine. In addition, FDA-approved drugs (remdesvir, saquinavir, and darunavir) and two small molecules (flavone and coumarin derivatives) are potential inhibitors of 3CLpro. 87 Moreover, antibacterial drugs (lymecyclin, demeclocycline, and chlorhexidine) also target3CLpro. 79 COVID-19 uses unique 2ʹ-O-methyltransferase (2ʹ-O-MTase) as capping machinery of its RNA at the 5ʹ-end. As a result of this, the viral genome mimics the host mRNA and escapes from innate immune sensing factors, such as RIG-I and MDA-5, and type I IFN antiviral activities. 61, 88, 89 A known HIV inhibitor drug, dolutegravir (DG) showed an estimated binding free energy of 9.4 kcal/mol, and inhibits 2ʹ-O-MTase, while bictegravir conferred an estimated binding free energy (DG) of 8.4 kcal/mol against 2ʹ-O-MTase.Moreover, natural ligand (SAM) analogues, namely trabodenoson, binodenoson, and regadenoson, may be potent inhibitors of the substrate-binding pockets of Nsp16. 86, 89 Nsp1 inhibits host gene expression via targeting the 40s ribosomal subunit, which induces host mRNA degradation and IFN-dependent signaling. Therefore, Nsp1 is a promising drug target, and its inhibition would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host's antiviral defenses. This implies that the innate immune activities via type I IFN would become free of being inhibited by Nsp1 and work actively against the virus. 90, 91 The other protein that is most conserved in SARS-CoV-2 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), which is particularly involved in low-fidelity replication and transcription at the time of viral priming. 92, 93 In addition, Nsp7 and Nsp8 complexes act as cosubstrates to promote the binding of Nsp12 to RNA and boost enzyme activity at the time of transcription. 79, 92 The other potential alternative COVID-19 broad-spectrum antiviral drug therapy, Arbidol (an indole derivative), also targets Nsp7/8 complex and blocks viral replication by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 fusion to the host cell. 79, 80 Remdesvir (RDV) is a nucleoside analogue and shows the most promising broad-spectrum antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2. 41 This drug was originally developed by Gilead Sciences (USA) for treating Ebola virus disease. Subsequent studies showed that RDV is a monophosphoramidate prodrug that has metabolized into C-adenosine nucleoside analogue by targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a chain terminator. 80, 85, [94] [95] [96] Similarly, favipiravir is a guanine analogue, also used as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but it has been less approved than remdesvir (Table 1) . 79, 97 The other multifunctional non-structural protein is Nsp13 (helicase), for unwinding of dsDNA as well as RNA from 5ʹ-3ʹ polarity, coupled with NTP (ATP) as an energy source. 98, 99 Because this SARS-CoV helicase enzyme is absolutely necessary for subsequent viral replication and proliferation, it is thought to be an attractive target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Lopinavir (known as a protease inhibitor of HIV infection) possibly targets Nsp3b/3c and helicase, with ritonavir being used to increase the half-life of lopinavir via inhibition of cytochrome 450 (Table 1) . 94, 97 Collectively, targeting the Nsp of the novel coronavirus helps to boost the innate immune recognition ability as well as the activity of the type I IFN antiviral signaling cascade.In innate immunity, IFNs are key players against viral infection; however, SARS-CoV-2 infecting cells must overcome the IFN-mediated antiviral response to replicate and propagate to new host cells. Because of different evasion mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, containing virulent accessory as well as non-structural gene products, such as Nsp16, Nsp3, Nsp1 ORF3a, and ORF9, designing drugs that inhibit these gene products is vital for boosting the action of IFNs against COVID-19. Dysregulated complement systems are the most likely cause of the pathogenesis of ARDS or cytokine storms in COVID-19. We have much research evidence to show that anti-C5a and/or C5aR antibody can provide promising therapeutic options by reducing histopathological injury of lung alveoli and decreasing inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we suggest IFN-α2b and Arbidol as potential therapeutic options to reduce the viral load as well as its pathological sequelae. SARS-CoV-2 induces an inflammatory cytokine storm linked with an exuberant elevation of C5a and downregulation of IFNα/β secretion, and its action is associated with the disease severity.

The virus was initially named: Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus before the disease was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) on February 12, 2020. As at September 5, 2020, 08:42 CEST COVID-19 has spread in 216 countries with 26,994,442 confirmed cases and 880,994 deaths, which accounts for 1,293,048 confirmed cases and 31,082 deaths in Africa [1] , [2] . There exists a vast difference in the fatality rates across countries; this might be a result of varied demographic structure, adherence to public health guidelines (wearing of face masks, frequent hand washing under running water with soap and use of alcohol-based sanitizers) and the measures (physical and social distancing, quarantine, self-isolation, partial or full-scale lockdown) put in place in different countries to curtail viral transmission. At the early stage of infection, infected persons could be asymptomatic while some experience mild to moderate symptoms, such as high fever, cough, and headache and, in severe cases, pneumonia [3] . Infected persons with underlying health conditions such as chronic lung disease, diabetes or hypertension are at high risk for severe symptoms and eventual death from the disease.Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with the largest genome (ranging from 26 to 32 kb) among all RNA viruses. The viral genome structure consists of a 3 -, 5 -untranslated regions (UTRs) encoding ORF1ab polyproteins, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, surface or spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [4] , [5] . The Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have identified three major clades of the virus, named clade G (spike glycoprotein variant -D614G), clade V (ORF3a variant -G251V), and clade S (ORF8 variant -L84S).Although earlier report [6] have confirmed a low viral genomic variability, the question still 4 remains if viral transmission, incidence and fatality observed in different regions could be attributed to geographic distributions of viral clades and variants.Comprehensive genomic analysis of epidemiologic viral sequence coming from different countries in a region can help in gaining insights into the SARS-CoV-2 virulence and pathogenesis. To date, no precise antiviral vaccine or therapy has proven effective. Thus, genomic variability studies of the virus can play an important role in gaining insight to the genomic diversity in order to adopt measures to curtail the menace of COVID-19. Scientific findings and complete viral genome sequences have been made publicly available, thanks to researchers, healthcare workers, the GISAID consortium and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), among many others. This data avalanche will aid rapid effort in understanding viral genome diversity, and identification of suitable targets for drugs and vaccine development [7] . Biological description of viral RNA mutations can provide information for assessing viral transmission, drug resistance, host invasion and pathogenesis [8] . In the present study, we investigated the extent of whole genome variation in African population. We stratified recurrent mutations, and also identified the mutational hotspots and conserved domains in the viral genome. These findings may help to understand the pattern of viral transmissibility, evolution and virulence in Africa, as well as identifying possible targets for antiviral drugs, vaccines, diagnostic assays and improved control of the pandemic.Whole-genome protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were downloaded from GISAID (https://epicov.org/epi3) and NCBI database (https://ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2seqs/). A total of 356 SARS-CoV-2 complete protein sequences (Northern Africa -150, Western Africa -102, Eastern Africa -54, South Africa -41, and Central Africa -9) were mined, after filtering as complete, high coverage only, low coverage excluded, and of Africa descent. The regions infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that shared the complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this study are provided as Supplementary file S1.The mined SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were aligned with the reference genome (accession number: NC_045512.2) by using ClustalX version 2.1 [9] MSA software and the default parameters [10] . The evolutionary history of the viral sequences was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrix-based model [11] . The tree with the highest log likelihood (-21700.94) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join (NJ) and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software [12] .In this study, we used the mined data to analyze the variability in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the African population since the onset of the pandemic in order to identify its conserved domains and mutational patterns. Recurrent mutations were focused on as they are likely candidates for the ongoing adaptive strategies of SARS-CoV-2 to human host and possible target for drug development, while sites with undetermined residues (labeled as X), few or single variation occurrence were excluded.Multiple sequence alignment of the 356 SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences revealed high rate recurrent mutations at 23 distinct sites in the ORF1ab polyprotein sequence. Very high rate recurrent mutations exist at the following sites: nsp2 region; T265I with occurrence in 24 viral sequence, nsp3 region; D1037E which occurred in 11 viral sequence, T1246I in 9 viral sequence, and E1363D in 11 viral sequence, nsp4 region; E3073A in 9 viral sequence, 3 chymotrypsin-like proteinase region (3CL pro ) G3278S in 11 viral sequence, nsp6; L3606F in 21 viral sequence, nsp8; T4090I in 10 viral sequence, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase In the spike glycoprotein region, recurrent mutations were observed in the S1 domain; R408I in 4 viral sequence, and S2 domain of the spike glycoprotein; Q677H in 9 viral sequences respectively. The highly recurrent D614G mutation in the S1 domain was observed in 288 viral sequences (80.9%), flagging this position as a SARS-CoV-2 mutational hotspot. The D614G mutation was observed as follows; Northern Africa (43%), Western Africa (20.5%), Southern Africa (17%), Eastern Africa (16.3%), and Central Africa (3.2%).Q57H recurrent mutation in the ORF3 protein region was observed in 104 viral sequence (Northern Africa -52%, West Africa -38%, Eastern Africa -8%, Central Africa -2% and no occurrence in Southern African sequences) and S171L variant in 6 sequences (Egypt -4, and Mali -2). The L84S mutation in the ORF8 region was observed in 41 viral sequences. 8 The L84S mutation was predominant in West Africa (65.85%), Northern Africa (19.51%) and Eastern Africa (12.2%), with very few/no observance in viral sequences from Central and Southern Africa. Recurrent mutations in the viral genome are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 .Concurrent recurrent mutations were observed in the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein; R203K and G204R in 74 viral sequences, S202N variant was observed in 35 viral sequences (West Africa -76%, East Africa -17%, and North Africa -7%) and S187L in 8 sequences. The R203K and G204R mutations were prevalent in South Africa (40.54%), West Africa (32.43%), and East Africa (17.6%) and with little/no occurrence in viral sequences from Central African and Northern African countries. The S187L mutations in this study were all observed in Senegalese population. 1 0The genome is the molecular architecture of any life, dictating its genotypic and phenotypic expression. Although at a minimal rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world [13] . We performed mutational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to understand the epidemiology, extent of spread and implication of mutations in the African population and also to identify loopholes in the viral genome as potential target for drug or vaccine development. In the African population, the SARS-CoV-2ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid were observed as mutational hotspots due to high rate of recurrent mutations. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10.ORF1ab polyprotein, which is the longest ORF in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, is cleaved into many nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16 [8] , [13] has reported recurrent mutations in this region resulting in alteration of protein sequence. In particular, the P4715L mutation (present in 280 viral 1 1 sequences (78.7%) in our study) located close to a hydrophobic cleft has been identified as a potential target for antiviral drugs [8] . The use of molecular docking has identified Atazanavir as a potential candidate for COVID19 drug due to its binding affinity to RdRp (Kd 21.83 nM) [14] . Interestingly, most of the viral sequences bearing the P4715L mutation also concurrently bear the D614G mutation in the Spike glycoprotein; this could suggest a synergistic effect of these mutations in these 2 important domains.The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme controls viral replication and is vital for its life cycle.During the disease outbreak of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 3CLpro was a proven drug discovery target. Molecular docking has also identified potential candidates as antiviral drugs; aliskiren, dipyridamole, mopidamol and rosuvastatin with a relatively high binding energy to viral 3CLpro [14] . In our study, G3278S mutation was only observed in this region in 9 viral sequences, which were all Egyptians. Nevertheless, the importance and the relative conservativeness of this region could make it a suitable target for antiviral inhibitory screening, as suggested in earlier study [15] .The spike (S) glycoprotein mediates host cell-surface receptor binding via its S1 domain and induces fusion of host and viral membranes through the S2 domain and determines viral transmission, invasion and host tropism [16] . These are the initial and critical steps in the coronavirus infection cycle; this can also serve as potential targets for antiviral drug design.The spike glycoprotein which exists in the prefusion or postfusion conformations [16] binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor to gain cellular entry, which facilitates its rapid spread to all parts of the globe. Hence, mutations in the S glycoprotein may result to decreased binding affinity for the ACE2 protein, thereby affecting viral fitness.The S glycoprotein being a surface protein is constantly under selective pressure in a bid to evade immune response; this might have promoted its adaptation to the host genome and the 1 2 recurrent mutation observed. Earlier report before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that mutations in the human SARS-CoV spike S1 domain allows it to bind much more tightly to human ACE2 compared to civet SARS-CoV S1 [16] . We observed mutation hotspots (D614G) in the S1 domain with a relatively conserved S2 domain, which may infer membrane fusion as the central function of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Previous study has likewise established that coronaviruses can elicit receptor-independent viral entry into host cells [16] . Therefore, more focus should be given to understanding the mechanism of S2 domain mediating host-cell membrane fusion as potential cellular targets for antiviral therapy [14] .Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) composed of the C-and N-terminal domain forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the viral RNA; it enhances the viral genome transcription and facilitates the interaction with the membrane protein during virion assemblage [17] .Mutations in the viral nucleocapsid region alters its binding to miRNAs, which might play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of infection in the patient [13] . Save for 15 viral sequences from Kenya, the occurrences of P4715L and L84S (28144T>C) coincide, this corroborates earlier study where L84S in the viral ORF8 is always found in pair with a synonymous mutation, 8782C>T [3] .The membrane glycoprotein (M) determines the shape of the viral envelope and the envelope protein (E) plays crucial role in viral assembly and budding [17] . The M protein (∼25-30 kDa) consist three transmembrane domains. After viral membrane fusion, the interaction of S with M protein is necessary to retain S in the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi complex and its integration into new virions [17] . The M protein also binds to N protein in order to stabilize the nucleocapsid and aid viral assembly.During viral replication, E protein is upregulated in the infected cell facilitating viral assembly. The role of E protein in viral maturation have been expressed in E protein knock- 1 3 out recombinant coronaviruses, with resultant crippled viral maturation, and reduced viral titres [17] . Our findings revealed a well conserved E and M protein, thus based on the importance of these structural proteins; they can serve as potential antiviral therapeutic target; as earlier attempted [18] by altering recombination causing large deletions in the E proteins.The viral ORF3a and ORF10 proteins can synergistically attack heme on the host's hemoglobin 1-β chain, thereby disintegrating iron to form porphyrin, which will therefore result to less and less hemoglobin carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide, interfering with the heme pathway and extreme poisoning and inflammation of the hepatocytes [14] . Studies on chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown the inhibitory activities against viral S protein and ORF8 binding to porphyrin and against the viral ORF1ab, ORF3, and ORF10 proteins attacking heme to form porphyrin, thus easing respiratory distress symptoms [14] . The use of CQ and HCQ as a potent drug against coronavirus has generated a lot of controversies due to their adverse effects in patients. Meanwhile, on Jun 16, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) retracted the use of CQ and HCQ as a potent candidate for coronavirus treatment due to their lack of efficacy and safety concerns (http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/). Hence, the quest for a clinically approved and efficient therapeutic agent is still on and our study has been able to suggest potential targets for drugs or vaccine development.Due to our keen interest in mutations that have effect on protein sequence, synonymous mutations which do not alter amino acid residue were not accounted for in the present study.More so, this genomic dataset includes data from single country each from Central Africa and South Africa, therefore, some of the genomic diversity might likely remain unsampled.Hence, we encourage support for biomedical researchers and research institutes in developing countries in order to generate extensive genomic resources to understand viral transmissibility, evolution and variation in the African region. 1 4 Conclusively, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and pathogenic virus that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives globally since outbreak in December 2019. Our study has elucidated the mutational landscape and conserved domains in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the African population, which may have contributed to its virulence, pathogenicity and transmission in the region. Due to the accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, drugs targeting the viral proteins might not be as efficient as those designed to target host's cellular proteins and/or receptors. Hence, it will be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral All authors declare no conflict of interest 1 5 No funding received for this study","Egypt","first author","2020-09-07",9

[39] recommended the use of simpler 66 models which overperformed complex models in estimating reliable parameters. Hence, 67 in this study, the simple SIR model [31] was considered with the particularity of two 68 removal rates and illustrated in the system below [17] :with initial conditions,In (1), S = S(t), I = I(t) and R = R(t) represent the number of susceptible, infected and 70 removed individuals at time t, respectively while N is defined as the total population size 71for the disease transmission. The parameters β , ν 1 and ν 2 are the transmission rate, the 72 removal rate of reported infected individuals (detected) and the removal rate of infected 73 individuals due to all other unreported causes (mortality, recovery or other reasons), 74 respectively. We considered the removal rate ν 2 as constant with value ν 2 = 1/10 [54] . 75 From the second differential equation of (1), one can notice that ν 1 I 0 represents the 76 daily confirmed cases (Ir 0 ) at time 0 of the outbreak. Thus, the relationship between 77 the initial number of infected individuals and the detection rate, ν 1 is as follow and used 78 in the estimation process: 79 r 4, 2020 4/24Data consideration and parameter estimation procedure 81 For each country, the data considered for the modeling spans the period from the date 82 of detection of the first case of COVID-19 in the country and August, 12, 2020. Data 83 considered were the daily numbers of reported cases that have been assimilated to ν 1 I. 84These data were downloaded from the Global Rise of Education website [55] . Table 1 85 presents the demographic patterns [11] , initial dates of the pandemic [55] and testing 86 efforts (identification of new cases) of the countries [11] . We fitted the model (1) to the 87 observed daily cases to study the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in the sixteen West 88African countries.To improve the prediction power of (1), we used a cross-validation procedure of 90 used as the measure of estimation precision:whereθ and θ are the predicted and observed number of daily cases respectively; k 95 is the number of observations considered. We considered as RMSE 1 , the Root Mean 96Square Error computed on the 90% of the observations and RMSE 2 , computed on the 97 remaining observations (10%)The solutions of (1) were obtained using the built-in function ODE45 of Matlab [56] . 99Then, the non linear least square estimate technique was performed to estimate the 100 six parameters in (1) given starting values, using the built-in function fminsearchbnd of 101-Running reproductive number, R e [1] : measures the number of secondary infections 119 caused by a single infected individual in the population at time t.-True peak size, n pp and True peak time, T pp . The true peak size indicates the largest 121 daily number of new infectious cases in the population:while the true peak time, T pp represents the time at which the largest daily new infected 124 cases is obtained. These two parameters were determined numerically.-Reported peak size, n rp and Reported peak time, T rp . The reported peak size indicates 126 the largest number of daily reported cases:while the reported peak time is the associated time to n rp . They were determined 129 numerically.-Maximum number of active cases, I max : since I 0 , R 0 << S 0 , we assumed the number 131 of initial susceptible individuals to be approximately equal to N (S 0 ≈ N). Thus, I max 132can be approximated as follow [16] :-Final epidemic size, I total [16] : it is the total number of cases over the course of the 134 epidemic wave.S ∞ can be approximated considering the entire population as initially susceptible (S 0 ≈ 136 N); hence, following [16] :-Attack ratio, A r [17] : is the fraction of susceptible population that becomes infected. 140It is calculated along the epidemic wave as follow: respectively. The proportion of the susceptible individuals across West Africa was also 162 r 4, 2020 8/24In epidemiology, understanding the dynamics of an epidemic outbreak and predicting 212 its future course is a major research question, which is often studied using modelling 213 techniques [2, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Estimation and prediction rely on mathematical and statistical 214 models, which inform public health decisions and ensure optimal use of resources to re-215 duce the morbidity and mortality associated with epidemics [14, [27] [28] [29] [30] 33] . For instance, 216 estimation of epidemiological parameters and prediction on the Influenza outbreak dy-217 namics in Canada was done using the Richard's model [14] , while a three-parameter 218 logistic growth model was used to study and forecast the final epidemic size in real-time 219 of the Zika virus outbreaks in Brazil from 2015 to 2016 [2] .In this study, we used deterministic SIR model to understand COVID-19 dynamics 221 in West African countries and estimated the overall number of susceptible individuals 222 that accounted for 1.2% of West African population and 1% for most countries, except 223Guinea-Bissau, and Gambia where the susceptible individuals account for more than 224 9%. In general, small countries with relatively high population density are those with 225 high proportion of susceptible individuals, indicating how high population density with 226 small area can affect epidemics dynamics [57, 58] . Our findings however, revealed a 227 great disparity between countries in terms of testing rate of COVID-19. Countries like 228Guinea and Gambia and in less extent, Côte d'Ivoire and Nigeria, showed a relatively 229 less testing effort to identify many infected individuals. This suggests that there may 230 not be enough tests being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak [55] . In contrast, 231 countries like Cape-Verde, Benin and Togo, which have recorded less than or equal to 50 232 positive cases per 1,000 tests, seem to be effectively controlling the pandemic according 233 to the WHO criteria [45] . Compared to relatively wealthier countries like Australia, 234 South Korea and Uruguay, it takes hundreds of tests to find one case [55] . 235 The detection rate considered in model (1) is a better indicator of testing effort since 236 it represents the proportion of active cases in the population that are identified daily. 237","Mauritania","abstract","2020-09-07",9

Advances in Difference Equations On the optimal control of coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model; a numerical approach","The well-known coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic can be consider as one of the serious pandemic diseases all over the world, for more details, see [1, 2] . The spread of this disease has serious impact on human society and health. The modeling study of infectious diseases is very useful in making strategies to control this disease. Recently, many interesting papers on modeling the coronavirus have appeared, see for example [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .In general, mathematical models involving the known ordinary differentiation could be used to capture dynamical systems of infectious disease, when only initial conditions are used to predict future behaviors of the spread. However, when the situation is unpredictable, which is the case of COVID-19, due to uncertainties associated with the pandemic, ordinal derivatives and their associated integral operators show deficiency. The fractional order differential equation (FODE) models seem more consistent with the real phenomena than the integer order models [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Moreover, one of the new topics in mathematics is the fractional optimal control (FOC). FOC can be defined using a variety of fractional derivative definitions. Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivatives [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] can be considered the most important fractional derivative definitions. Sweilam and Al-Mekhlafi introduced some numerical studies for FOC, for more details, see [19] [20] [21] .The main contribution of this work is to develop a numerical scheme to provide approximate solutions for the fractional optimal control problems (FOCPs). We consider the mathematical model in [4] with modified parameters. The fractional order derivatives are defined here in the Caputo sense. Moreover, we introduce two control variables, u p (t) and u ap (t), in order to minimize the number of the infected and the asymptotically infected. The Grünwald-Letnikov nonstandard weighted average finite difference method (GL-NWAFDM) is established to simulate the obtained fractional order system.To the best of our knowledge, the fractional optimal control for coronavirus (2019-nCoV) mathematical model with GL-NWAFDM has never been explored.This paper is organized as follows: The basic mathematical formulas are introduced in Sect. 2. The proposed model with FO and two controls is presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the formulation of the optimal control problem and the necessary optimality conditions are derived. In Sect. 5, the new numerical method GL-NWAFDM and the stability analysis are introduced. Numerical simulations are discussed in Sect. 6. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Sect. 7.In this section, we recall some important definitions of fractional calculus used throughout the remaining sections of this paper. The fractional order derivative in the Caputo sense can be defined as follows [22] :where is the Euler gamma function and 0 < α < 1.The discretization fractional derivative is given by the Grünwald-Letnikov approach [23] :where N n is a natural number and the coordinate of each mesh point is t n = n t, n = 1, 2, . . . , (1-α) , and i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. Additionally, let us assume that [24] 0 < μ i+1 < μ i < · · · < μ 1 = α < 1,Herein, we consider the new mathematical model of coronavirus given in [4] with modified parameters. Two controls, u p , u ap , are added to health care such as isolating patients in private health rooms and providing respirators and giving them treatments soothing regularly. This model consists of six nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Moreover, The total population N p = S p + E p + I p + R p Table 2 The parameter values for COVID model [4] Parameter DescriptionVirus removing rate from M (0.01) α Table 1 describes the state variables and Table 2 describes the parameters. It is important to notice that the parameters depend on the fractional order α. To make the system consistent in the physical sense and more consistent with the reality, we must make sure that the right-hand sides of these equations have the same dimensions, for more details, see [15] . Let us assume that N p is a constant. The modified model is then represented by a system of fractional order differential equations:The existence and uniqueness of the solutions of (2) follow from the results given in [25] . The feasible region for model (2) is given byThe basic reproduction number of the proposed model (2) is given as follows [4] :where,.The endemic threshold is given at R 0 = 1, the disease will die out when R 0 < 1, and the endemic case when R 0 < 1, for more details, see [26] . In this work we consider R 0 > 1.Consider system (2) in R 6 , letbe the admissible control set. We define the objective functional as follows:Now, the goal is to evaluate u p , u ap such that the following functionalis minimum, subject to the constraintswhereand satisfying the initial conditionsConsider a modified cost functional as follows [19] :The Hamiltonian is defined as follows:From (7) and (8), we have the FOPC necessary conditions:whereMoreover, λ ι (T f ) = 0, ι = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 6.Remark 1 Under some additional assumptions on the objective functional J and the righthand side of equation (6) must be added, for example, the convexity of J and the linearity of ξ in j and u p , u ap , then the necessary conditions of optimality are also sufficient, for more details, see [27] .There exist optimal control variables u * p , u * ap with the corresponding solutions S * p , E * p , I * p , A * p , R * p , M * that minimize J(u p , u ap ) over . Furthermore, there exist adjoint variables λ i , i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 6, satisfy the following:(i) Adjoint equations:(ii) The transversality conditions:(iii) Optimality conditions:Moreover,Proof Equations (13) can be obtained from (9), whereis the Hamiltonian. The transversality conditions λ κ (T f ) = 0, κ = 1, . . . , 6, hold. Using (15), we can claim Equations (16)- (17) . Now, the state system can be claimed:In this section, we construct a novel numerical method called GL-NWAFDM as an extension to the method given in [24, 28] . This method can be an explicit method (easy for coding) or an implicit method (more stable and efficient), depending on the weight factor ∈ [0, 1]. To approximate the solutions of system (19) using GL-NWAFDM, we first discretize the Caputo fractional operator (1) with replacing (t) by ϕ( t), whereThen the discretization for system (19) , where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , N , using GL-NWAFDM can be written as follows:Let f (t n ) = f n = ζ n be the approximate solution of this equation, then using GL-NWAFDM with (1) we rewrite equation (21) in the following form:Then we haveSo the proposed implicit scheme is stable.In this section, numerical simulations of the proposed model (19) and (13) with and without optimal control are presented. Gl-NWAFDM is given to obtain the numerical results of the state equations (19) with the following initial conditions [4] : S p (0) = 8,065,518, E p (0) = 200,000, I p (0) = 282, A p (0) = 200, R p (0) = 0, M(0) = 50,000, and we consider N p = 8,266,000. Then, by using the implicit finite difference method [21] , we solve (13) with (14) by using different values of 0 < α ≤ 1 with B 1 = B 2 = 500, 1 = 2 = 10, and 0 < ≤ 1. In the numerical simulations the time level is chosen in days, it is up to 10,000. The graphical results obtained through these figures demonstrate that in the case without control, the number of the infected and the asymptotically infected population is increasing, while the number of the population is decreasing in the controlled case as we can see in Fig. 1 . This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of two control cases for the proposed model. Moreover, Table 3 reports the values of the objective functional obtained by the proposed method with and without controls and = 1, 0.5. We note that the results obtained in the case of fully implicit at ( = 1) are better than the results in the case = 0.5. Also, the best result of the control case is given at α = 0.8. Figure 2 shows how the behavior of the solutions in the control case is changing by using different values of α and T f = 150. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the approximate solutions for the control variables using different α. It is noted that the range of the solution remains between zero and one. The approximate solutions for S p and M with control case and different values of α are given in Fig. 4 . Figure 5 illustrates the behavior of the approximate solutions of E p , I p , A p , R p at different values of α at big time, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method is unconditionally stable at = 1. The results are given by using MATLAB (R2015a). In the present work, the optimal control of coronavirus model with fractional operator is presented. Also, the combination of fractional order derivative and optimal control in the model improves the dynamics and increases the complexity of the model. Two control variables, u p (t) and u ap (t), are added to health care such as isolating patients in private health rooms and providing respirators and giving them treatments soothing regularly. These have been implemented to minimize the number of the infected and the asymptotically infected as we can see in Fig. 1 . Necessary optimality conditions are derived. GL-NWAFDM is constructed to study the behavior of the proposed problem. This method depends on the values of the factor . It can be explicit or implicit with large stability regions as we can see in our results. Moreover, the stability analysis of the proposed method is studied. It was shown that this method has good stability properties in the implicit case. Some simulations are presented to support our theoretical findings. It is concluded that GL-NWAFDM can be applied to solve such fractional optimality systems simply and effectively.","Egypt","first author","2020-09-25",9

Recently, in December 2019, the World Health Organization was alerted to several causes of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, it has been proved that this new infection is caused by a new virus from the coronavirus family called COVID-19. From then on, this disease has become a serious health problem. Confirmed cases have been reported in more than 210 countries. This disease is transmitted by having a contact with an infected person through droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov and typically dry cough, fever, fatigue, breathing difficulty [1] . Due to the lack of specific anti-COVID-19 therapeutic treatment and effective vaccine, some interventions have been implemented by many countries to prevent and control the disease. Among these interventions, we have travel restrictions and massive quarantine. Contact tracing is also one of the implemented measure that consists to keep track of people who had direct contact with the COVID-19 patients. Contacts are monitored for signs of illness within 14 days. In the case of apparition of the symptoms related to the disease, they are isolated, tested and hospitalized. Several mathematical models related to the COVID-19 epidemic have been studied (see [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ). In [18] , Imai et al. conducted computational modeling to establish the size of the disease outbreak in Wuhan. They show that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in containing disease outbreak. Tang et al. [5] established that intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the transmission risk of COVID-19. Thus, it becomes important for health authorities to know the contact tracing coverage rate that could be required for the disease control or elimination.In the present paper, we propose a complete mathematical analysis of a COVID-19 model that includes contact tracing measures. A stability analysis is performed to study the epidemiological consequences of this control strategy. Specifically, we propose to determine the threshold parameter that measure initial disease transmission and to analyze the steady state stability. This basic reproduction number is used to compute the potential impact of contact tracing on the spread of COVID-19.We proposed a model that describes the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Based on the information about the disease progression, we subdivided the human population into five compartments, namely, the susceptible population (S), the infectious without symptoms or exposed population (E), the quarantined exposed population (E q ), the infectious with symptoms or infected population (I) and the recovered population (R). New individual enter into susceptible population according to rate . A susceptible human has a contact with an exposed or an infected human at rate k. When this contact happens, the probability that this susceptible gets infection from an exposed or infected human is p es and p is , respectively. Furthermore, we assume that contact tracing is implemented by the health authorities. Beyond these investigations a proportion of q of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined and the remain proportion 1q is missed from the contact tracing. μ design the human natural death rate, α is the disease-induced death rate, σ -1 is the incubation period between the infection and the onset of symptoms and γ is the rate of recovery from infection. The dynamics of the different populations is given by the following system of differential equations:Since the recovered human population R does not appear in the remaining equations of system (1), it is then sufficient to consider the following system:with initial conditionsBy considering the system on the faces of R 4 + , we obtainThus, Proposition 2.1 of [19] implies that each solution of (2) remains in R 4 + . Further, we denote by N = S + E + I + E q the human total population. Thus, it follows thatwhich shows that all solutions of (2) are bounded. Thus, the suitable region for system (2) isIt can be verified that the compact region D is positively invariant and attracting under the flow described by (2) . For the rest of the paper, we will study the dynamics of model (2) in D.For every initial value in R 4 + , solutions of system (2) exist for all time t > 0.Proof Since the right-hand side of system (2) is locally Lipschitz, the local existence follows. Since D is positively invariant and attracting, all solutions of (2) are bounded, which gives us the global existence. This completes the proof.By direct calculation we show that model (2) has a disease-free equilibrium given byThe new infection matrix F and the transition matrix V are given byThe contact tracing-induced reproduction number R q of model (2) is then defined as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix FV -1 (see [20] ), that is,The local stability result is stated as follows.Proof Let R q ≤ 1. It is sufficient to prove that the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of system (2) evaluated at E 0 have negative real parts. Direct calculation shows that these eigenvalues are solutions of the equationClearly the proof will be achieved if the roots of Q(λ) have negative real parts. By contradiction, let assume that at least one root of Q(λ) denoted by λ 0 has a positive real part. ThenBy applying the absolute value it follows thatThus,This yieldswhich is a contradiction. Hence, E 0 is locally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof.What follows now states the global behavior result of disease-free equilibrium.Proof Set X = (E, I) T and u = ((1q)kp es , (1q)kp is ). We can verify thatwhere F and V are given at the beginning of this section. By doing some algebraic computation, it then follows thatThus, u is a left eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue R q of the matrix V -1 F. We now consider the following Lyapunov functionTaking the differentiation of L with respect to t, we obtainThus,If R q < 1, the equality dL dt = 0 implies that uX = 0. This leads to E = I = 0 by noting that all components of u are positive. Hence, when R q < 1, setting the right-hand side of (2) equal to zero and replacing E and I by 0 yields S = S 0 = μ , and E q = E = I = 0. The invariant set on which dL dt = 0 contains only the singleton {E 0 }. Therefore, by LaSalle's invariant principle (see [21] ), E 0 is globally asymptotically stable in D.If R q > 1, then it follows from the continuity of the vector fields that dL dt > 0 in a neighborhood of the interior of D. Thus, E 0 is unstable by the Lyapunov stability theory. This completes the proof.Direct calculation shows that model (2) have a positive endemic equilibrium E * = (S * , E * ,kp is σ +kμp es (μ+γ +α) ,kp is σ +kμp es (μ+γ +α) .(4) Theorem 4.1 If R q > 1, the endemic equilibrium E * is globally asymptotically stable.Proof Setting the right-hand side of (2) equal to 0 at E * yields = kp es S * E * + kp is S * I * + μS * ,Let f be a function defined by f :The function f has a strict global minimum f (1) = 0. Furthermore, we set G(y) = y y *x-y * x dx for y > 0, where y * > 0, and y can be replaced by S, E, I or E q .We define the Lyapunov function V bywhere c 1 = 1 kp es S * E * + kp is S * I * ,Clearly V is non-negative and strictly minimized at the endemic equilibrium E * . To avoid long expression, the derivatives of G(S), G(E), G(E q ) and G(I) with respect to t will be calculated separately and combined to get that of V. We compute dG(S) dt as follows:We replace in (9) by using Eq. (5) to obtainThe derivative dG(E) dt is given byReplacing μ + σ in (11) by using (6), we getdG(E q ) dt is computed as follows:In (13) , μ is replaced by (7) to obtaindG(I) dt is given byIn (15), μ + γ + α is replaced by (8) to getBy multiplying Eqs. (10), (12) , (14) and (16) by the coefficients c 1 , c 2 , c 3 and c 4 , respectively, and after a rearrangement we getThat is,The equality dV dt = 0 is fulfilled if and only if (S, E, I, E q ) = (S * , E * , I * , E * q ). The largest invariant subset of dV dt = 0 is the singleton {E * }. Thus, by LaSalle's invariant principle (see [21] ), E * is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof.

Figure 1 shows the numbers of cumulative confirmed cases in mainland China from January 15, 2020 to February 02, 2020 (see [22] for the data). The parameters used are presented in Table 1 and the initial condition is given by Table 2 . Based on the parameters values, we found that the contact tracing-induced reproduction number is R q = 5.63. Figure 2 is a graphical representation that provide a prediction for S (the susceptible individuals), E (the exposed individuals), I (the infected individuals) and E q (the quarantined exposed individuals) using model (2) . Results shows that the infection will reach a peak value for about 40 days and then go down afterwards. The long-term behavior of the epidemic is determined by the property of the endemic equilibrium of the system, which is found to be (S * , E * , I * , E * q ) = (1,599,001, 1561, 656, 74). Table 1 and initial values from Table 2 In this section we explore the effect of contact tracing in the disease transmission. Without contact tracing measure, the model (2) is reduced to the following system of equations:The model (17) has a disease-free equilibrium ( /μ, 0, 0). The new infection matrix F 1 and the transition matrix V 1 are given byThe basic reproduction number R 0 of model (17) is then defined as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix F 1 V -1 1 (see [20] ), that is,The basic reproduction number R 0 measures the power of a disease to invade a population under conditions that facilitate maximal growth.The contact tracing-induced reproduction number R q can be rewritten asNote that 1q is the factor by which the contact tracing strategy reduces the number of secondary infections if adopted in a community.If R 0 < 1, COVID-19 cannot develop into an endemic, and contact tracing strategy may not be necessary. For R 0 > 1, we want to know the necessary condition for slowing the development of COVID-19. Following Hsu Schmitz [27] we haveClearly, if q > 0 then E > 0.Differentiating R q with respect to q yieldsThe conditions E > 0, ∂R q ∂q < 0 for slowing down the epidemic are satisfied for 0 < q < 1. Setting the contact tracing-induced reproduction number R q = 1 and solving for q gives the threshold proportion of contact tracing as follows:Contact tracing strategy would succeed in controlling the epidemic (R q < 1) if q > q c . We observe that q c is increasing function of R 0 , thus for a population where R 0 is large, a high value of q c is required to control COVID-19 using the contact tracing strategy. We conclude that in a population where R 0 is large, COVID-19 may not be controlled using the contact tracing measure alone because the corresponding value of q c required is high and perhaps unattainable for such populations.We formulated and analyzed a mathematical model for COVID-19 epidemic with contact tracing. Five sub populations were considered: susceptible, exposed, quarantine exposed, infected with symptoms and recovered. Mathematical properties of the model are analyzed.We computed the contact tracing-induced reproduction number R q of the model. We proved that when R q < 1, the disease-free state E 0 is globally asymptotically stable. We also established that when R q > 1, the unique endemic equilibrium E * is globally asymptotically stable.The analysis of the model illustrates that the contact tracing strategy can reduce the basic reproduction number R 0 (without contact tracing strategy) to values below unity as intended for disease control, thus one would succeed in controlling the epidemic. The results obtained in this paper show that effective control of the epidemic can be achieved when the effectiveness of contact tracing is high, and if R 0 is not large. Otherwise in the population where R 0 is large, the epidemic may not be controlled using a contact tracing strategy alone because the corresponding value q c required is high and perhaps unattainable for such populations. Another interesting feature to study would be to see the effects of various preventive measures. In principle this can be done using the current paper by considering preventive measures affecting some parameters.","Burkina Faso","first author","2020-09-21",9

While the world of science and medicine have responded with rapid research into this newest microbial challenge and has indeed garnered some insight into SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, large uncertainties remain. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely asymptomatic (80%) in most persons and causes mild, moderate(15%), or severe illness(5%) in others with no clear explanation for the spectrum of illness [3] . Furthermore, the predicted decimation by COVID-19 of populations with highly underdeveloped and unprepared health systems appears widely off-track [4] [5] [6] . The highest cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, most severe COVID-19 and highest crude case fatality rates/ mortalities are in Europe and North America [7] [8] .Overall, COVID-19 mortality varies regionally between 0.8% to 14% [9] . Africa appears to have been largely spared of its worst-case scenarios [10] , a situation currently described as mysterious [11] in search of a better explanation. It has been suggested that the relatively high rates of morbidities like diabetes and hypertension (both known to worsen in Europe and the Americas on the one hand, and the high rate of crossprotecting vaccinations (like BCG) and cross-protecting immunity from rampant endemic infections in Africa on the other hand, may have contributed to the differing outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 in these geographical regions [12] . Emerging serological studies suggest that indeed, high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection are ongoing in Africa with some studies suggesting a background rate of 9.3% of some African population seropositive [13] . Contrary to prediction that incidence intensity should predict COVID-19 mortality, as suggested from studies [14] , the fatality was 8 times less than predicted among a group of seropositive health care workers in Africa [15] . Together, these findings suggest that, although SARS-CoV-2 is indeed spreading in Africa as predicted, certain post-infection events mitigate COVID-19 while at the same time allowing continuing transmission. One possible explanation is post-infection cellular attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 by natural intracellular antiviral mechanisms. One such cellular antiviral mechanism, whose activity signature may be traceable, is Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) [16] .After entering cells, viruses must overcome the intracellular antiviral machinery to establish a productive infection. In response to pathogen detection, host cells produce type 1 Interferons (IFNs) which signals downstream through JAK/STAT to induce numerous IFNs-Stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit various steps in the life cycle of the virus [17] . ZAP is one such ISG that is particularly effective against Beta coronaviruses [16] . ZAP, also called PARP13 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 13), is alternatively spliced and produced as the long form (ZAPL) and short form (ZAPS) [17] .ZAPS is upregulated more than ZAPL by RNA virus infections and has been shown to restrict SARS-CoV-2 in human cell-lines known to be targets of the virus [16] . ZAP crucially inhibits translation of incoming viral RNA (an important action against positive sense RNA viruses) and synergizes with other ISGs to upregulates RIG-1 IFNs-Beta production [17] . Precisely, ZAP uses CpG dinucleotide (5'-Cytosine-phosphate-Guanosine-3') on viral sequences as targets for recognition, binding, and then recruits the exosome complex to degrade viral genome [18] [19] . Viruses with high CpG content are therefore more susceptible to ZAP restriction, while viruses with low CpG content are less susceptible [19] . It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 may have been able to cross to human host by acquiring CpG deficiency [20] and thereby mimic the CpG deficiency of human genome [21] . The null expectation of CpG index (I_CpG) is 1 [20] [22] , and less than or more than 1 are considered deficiency and overrepresentation [22] respectively; though it has also been suggested that I_CpG of 0.78 should be taken as significant deficiencies and I_CpG 1.22 should be taken as significant overrepresentation [23] . In this schema, <0.5 is considered extremely low and >1.5 extremely high [23] . It has been stated that ""SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency of all known Beta coronavirus genomes"" [20] . The I_CpG of the reference Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 is 0.4077 and is 'extremely deficient' according to the criteria previously stated [23] . It has been shown that ZAP knockdown in cells increases SARS-CoV-2 production by 3 folds and that this increase can be as high as 7.7 folds in the presence of Interferons [24] . Given that ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expressions [20] , the resulting difference in intracellular antiviral activity can be predicted to leave CpG signatures on SARS-CoV-2 and that I_CpG variations will reflect the spectrum of tissues infected [20] . Such CpG signatures may therefore be used to identify viral tissue-switching events [20] .It may be predicted that given that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred, several ZAP induced CpG restriction scenarios may occur. In host communities with globally highly effective ZAP, COVID-19 will be milder, and this will also reveal as less variable SARS-CoV-2 I_CpG evolution within the community. On the contrary, in host communities with less effective ZAP suppression, COVID-19 will be more severe, and this will reveal as more variable SARS-CoV-2 I_CpG spectrum. Furthermore, within a host, a highly variable ZAP expression spectrum may result in more widespread tissue affectation with only host tissues with the higher order ZAP expression being spared. APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA-editing, catalytic polypeptide), is another natural antiviral factor that targets CpG to restrict RNA viruses [25] . APOBEC3G deaminates C to U and may contribute to CpG deficiency [26] . Such C to U conversion is deleterious to the viral fitness if the deaminated site is in a functional region but may reduce viral susceptibility to CpG guided antiviral activity of ZAP [20] . Though unlike ZAP, APOBEC3G is not highly specific for cytosine [20] , high activity of APOBEC3G on SARS-CoV-2 may drive UpG overexpression (i.e. I_UpG>1) [27] .SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from GenBank [28] . GenBank was chosen as the primary data source because it has been assessed as exceptionally reliable [29] . All complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences from human host on GenBank on 1st August 2020, were downloaded as a single file without geographical restrictions and then downloaded again with geographical restrictions as separate files per region. The regions were taken as allocated on GenBank-namely, Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America (NAM), and South America (SAM). Complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences that contained patient metadata was downloaded from GISAID [30] . Such data was not available on GenBank.On both platforms, SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded as FASTA format, but on the GISAID platform, patient metadata was downloaded in a separate tab separated values(tsv) file. Sequences from GISAID were then matched to patient metadata on Microsoft excel sheet using 'sequences name' and 'virus name' respectively. Matched data were visually cross-checked for mismatch. Seventeen mismatches were identified and deleted before analysis. The treated GenBank data and GISAID patients matched data are available as supplementary files 1 and 2 respectively on this article. The reference SARS-CoV-2 viral sequence was NC_045512.2 SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome.COVID-19 crude case fatality rate for different geographical regions as of 1 st August 2020 was obtained from 'Our world in data' (OWID). Data from this site has been rated left-center biased but highly factual [31] , [32] , and has been cited in various high impact medical journals [33] , [34] . Again, the geographical regions were defined as Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America (NAM), and South America (SAM). On the OWID website, the crude case fatality at any point in time can be read-off by placing the cursor on the desired date.Sequence analysis and calculations were implemented on DAMBE7 software [35] .I_CpG was calculated as I-CpG=. I_UpG was similarly calculated. The I_CpG and genomic GC proportion(GC%) was initially suggested to be a mathematical artifact [38] but this has been refuted [39] . Furthermore, it has been shown that differential CpG altering events alter the correlation between I_CPG and GC content in a genome [39] . We expected that both intracellular antiviral activities and random mutations may alter I_CpG. We hypothesized that highly variable intracellular ZAP antiviral activity in a host population will lead SARS-CoV-2 'quasi-species' with altered I-CpG vs GC% correlation. Absolute GC% was therefore calculated, as well as the correlation between I_CpG and GC% as another sign of ZAP activity. The population (total sample) rate of change of I_CpG with GC% was determined by linear regression and taken as the background rate.Considering that by nature, both the crude case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and dinucleotide indexes should evolve with time, we consider such a time point comparison plausible. Mann-Whitney was used to test for a significant difference between the age of 'Asy' and 'ICU/Deceased' while Chi-Square was used to test for a significant difference in SARS-COV-2 dinucleotide distribution between genders. These two (gender and age) were considered possible confounders because they are known to influence SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 morbidity and disease severity respectively [12] , though ZAP expression may not vary with age or gender [40] . The slope of change of I_CpG with GC% was determined using linear regression. Contingency tables were developed to compare viral Clade over-representation in any patients' status and type III Chi-Square was used to assess significant differences. All clades were necessarily those used by GISAID (S, L, V, G, GH, GR) [41] . Clade O was also included in the patients' metadata though this clade is generic and less clearly defined [42] .It has been shown that adults greater than 65 years account for 80% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and have a 23-fold risk of death compared to those less than 65 years old [43] .Overall, three CpG based ZAP signatures were, therefore, used for comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 groups of sequences: (i)Group's correlation of I_CpG with GC%, (ii)Group's rate of change of I_CpG for a given GC%, and (iii) Group's median I_CpG and within-group variability. Where the data distribution was not amenable to linear regressions, the rate of change of I_CpG per GC content was considered inestimable.Linear regressions were considered suitable for comparison of slope differences when the R 2 of each slope was higher than 0.3 and the difference between R 2 did not transcend R 2 quality classification [46] , [47] . As sensitivity analysis to account for the variation of I_CpG with GC content, the I_CpG-GC ratio was determined and compared between groups. As regards UpG, only the group's median I_UpG and within-group variability were used for comparisons. Group's central dinucleotides values (e.g. mean, median)were considered poorer comparators for trend because they would be biased by the value of the index case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a country or region.This study used anonymized, non-personal, and publicly available data sets. All necessary authorization and permissions were obtained and reporting standards including due acknowledgments have been complied with.8693 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank, representing 6729(NAM), 934(Asia),568(Oceania), 360(Europe) and 102 (Africa), and 1 reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence were used for analysis. A total of 349 sequences with patients' metadata from GISAID were available for analysis but the gender of only 286 patients was available:172 Male and 114 Female.I_CpG-GC ratio had the same pattern of outcome (significant and non-significant) of comparisons as I_CpG. The results of the parametric analysis were the same pattern as non-parametric except that parametric analysis tends to overestimate test statistics (e.g.Spearman's R 2 =0.357 for I_CpG to GC% correlation but Pearson's R 2 =0.79).Novel viruses in new hosts will more frequently encounter innate nonspecific host defense as the primary challenges [48] , while the specific immune response lags [49] . The usual factors that dictate adequate host response include viral transmission load, viral infectivity, tissue tropism, host immune response, and viral susceptibility to therapeutics, among others. Though a large volume of knowledge has been accumulated on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, there is still no clear explanation for skewed variations in morbidity and mortality as well as apparent discrepancies between ex-vivo viral susceptibility to candidate therapeutic and outcomes of clinical trials. Although a 382 nucleotide deletion has been associated with milder COVID-19, the prevalent D614G mutation, though increases transmission [9] , does not appear related to disease morbidity [50] . However, mutation studies focus on protein-coding regions.To further test and give some validation to ZAP activity as a major factor in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated the signature of ZAP activity in known risk factors whose data were available. In this regard, impressive I_CpG signatures of high ZAP activity and low ZAP activity were detected for Asymptomatic patients versus ICU/Deceased patients, respectively. Furthermore, Clade G(unsegregated), GR, and GH were overrepresented in ICU/Deceased patients and these clades also have I_CpG signature evidence of low ZAP activity. On the contrary, generic Clade O was overrepresented in asymptomatic patients and have I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity. Interestingly, similar segregation is seen with age groups. Age group >65years, known to have a high risk of morbidity and mortality also have compelling I_CpG signature evidence of low ZAP activity. However, no significant differences in I_CpG signature of ZAP activity were seen between genders but the trend is towards higher variability in men, which is interesting because male gender appears to have up to 2.4 times higher risk of severe COVID-19 in some case series [51] though this was not supported by other studies [12] .The public health implication of these findings is that while control of the spread of infection may depend on other factors, ZAP plays a major role in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the disease phenotype, and probably treatment. In the first instance, ZAP activity levels are expected to be distributed within a given population in a Gaussian manner. Thus, in populations with overall high mean ZAP activity level, only 2.5% will be expected to be highly vulnerable while the remaining 97.5% would be susceptible to infection but with highly favourable outcomes mainly represented by mild illness, which may be missed as COVID-19, but leaves a high level of positive serology in the community. Nevertheless, flashes of severe illnesses may be seen in the 2.5% subset of such a population with lower levels of ZAP activity. Even, within countries, such flashes may be noted whenever in the country SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced. These appear to resemble the current SARS-CoV-2 scenario in Africa. However, in populations with an overall low mean ZAP activity level, more severe illness may be more common.Between these extremes, various scenarios may ensue all of which may be modified by other health system factors. Furthermore, it suggests that asymptomatic person probably paradoxically harbour potentially more virulent low CpG viruses which the asymptomatic is fitted to contain but the next person may not be.The therapeutic implication is that candidate SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies may have a better chance of in-vivo success if they enhance ZAP activity and may have invitro versus invitro dissociation of efficacy if ZAP modulation is not one of its mechanism.Zinc sulphate has been found to have consistent invitro [58] and in vivo effect against SARS-COV-2 [59] and amongst many possible pathways for the effect of elemental zinc, it is interesting that it also enhances the production of interferon [59] . Dexamethasone is strongly anti-inflammatory and inhibits interferon [60] , thus reducing ZAP activity.Dexamethasone may, therefore, may be predicted to be harmful in mild COVID -19, when viral replication appears to drive morbidity and beneficial in severe COVID-19 when hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm appears to drive morbidity. This probably explains the finding of the effect of dexamethasone in the 'Recovery trial' [37] . The funding further suggests that going forwards, arms of clinical trials may include a combination of interferon or its inducers, anti-viral, and zinc for mild to moderate cases and the addition of anti-inflammatory agents for severe cases.Given the findings in this study, it is tempting to propose that communities with higher COVID-19 mortalities and those with lower mortalities have been pointed in the respective direction by the innate ZAP activity status while health system effectiveness may change or worsen the directions. It may also be suggested that in patients with lower ZAP competencies, SARS-CoV-2 infection in sanctuary sites, like CNS, may represent a slow smouldering disease, that may be better described as subclinical instead of asymptomatic, with ominous possible long term consequences. Given such scenarios, prevention, vaccine, prophylaxis, and therapeutics may need to be prioritized in that order.Overall, our study suggests that innate intracellular antiviral activities may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This consideration appears to explain many puzzling observations regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. In this regard, it may be important to examine how ZAP levels, forms, distribution, and activities are influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphism, race, co-morbidities, and aging to inform net ZAP activity as a contributing determinant of severity of Covid-19 phenotype.The difference in I_CpG and I_UpG distribution between asymptomatic and ICU/Deceased patients is striking and suggests low ZAP competencies in the latter group.Though not statistically significant(P=0.55), the trend is towards higher I_CpG variability in the male gender, suggesting less competent ZAP activity in the male. This may partly explain the male preponderance of SARS-CoV-2 cases and the higher severity of COVID-19 in the male gender.","Nigeria","first author","2020-09-14",9

The red curve shows expected cases for an uncontrolled outbreak. This curve has three main features: (1) initial exponential growth in new cases, (2) a single peak as the population reaches herd immunity, (3) an exponential decline in new cases. The green curve shows expected cases when governments and people take measures to control disease spread, but those measures are not sufficient to reduce the effective basic reproduction number (R0_e) 2 below 1. The green curve displays largely the same features as the red -disease spread is only halted by herd immunity -but the curve is ""flattened"", with cases spread out more over time and fewer cases at the peak. The blue curve shows the evolution of cases when containment measures are sufficient to bring R0_e below 1. The curve is ""crushed""; the initial exponential growth in case numbers is halted and cases decline (at a slower rate than for the red or green curves). In this case, because most people are not immune to the disease, it is possible for the disease to return if containment measures later allow R0_e to increase above 1, as shown in the blue curve in the Figure 1 . Reported cases in several low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have evolved in a manner that is very similar to the red and the green curves of Figure 1 . We show the 7-day rolling average of reported new cases for 12 such countries in Figure 2 . Other countries show similar patterns; we have chosen to study a subset with the clearest similarities to expected outbreak curves for which R0_e remains above 1. In all these countries, the reported cases have (1) grown exponentially, (2) reached a single clear peak and (3) declined exponentially. Regulations were most stringent, and compliance was greatest, in most of these countries, after the designation of the global pandemic in March and have relaxed to varying degrees in recent months -but cases continued to decline. None of these countries has reported a significant increase in new cases after the peak that would indicate a second wave (although cases in some countries have only recently passed the peak). Together, these observations point to a hypothesis that the outbreaks in these countries have reached herd immunity, and that the recently observed declines in new cases are because many people have already been infected and are immune -at least temporarily.However, the numbers of cases in other countries -including most high-income countries (HICs) but also some LMICs -show patterns that are much different. Figure 3 shows 7-day rolling averages of reported cases for 6 such comparison countries. In these countries, cases have evolved in a manner that is similar to the first part of the blue curve of Figure 1 . There have been peaks in numbers of reported cases, yet the decline is often longer and slower than the red or green curves would suggest. In some countries, there have been resurgences in cases, indicating that the initial suppression was not due to high levels of immunity.We test our hypothesis of herd immunity in these 12 countries by using a simple disease outbreak model and fitting to the reported cases. The outbreak case curves are those described by a linearised Reed-Frost model 3 , the textbook deterministic mathematical model for an epidemic. The curves produced by this model depend on just two parameters, namely the effective basic reproduction number (R0_e) and the generation time (tg), which is the average time from infection of one person and when that person infects other people. Expected reported cases are calculated by scaling the Reed-Frost model's results by a detection rate (p) 4 . The parameters that produce the best-fit curve for reported cases in each country are determined partly analytically from the observed data and partly from least squares regression. Our model parameters (R0_e, tg and p) are constant over time -a beneficial assumption in that it avoids having too many free parameters, which might lead to good fits even if the model incorrectly describes the disease dynamics. Furthermore, in most of the countries studied, reported cases and reported deaths have followed similar trends (with changes in deaths lagging the corresponding changes in cases), even for countries with very low absolute numbers of reported cases and deaths -which suggests that the shapes of the curves likely reflect trends in actual cases and deaths, and that detection rates for both do not vary wildly over time.The best-fit curves are shown with red lines in Figure 2 , for each of the 12 LMICs studied, and the corresponding parameters are presented in Table 1 . The fits are close, with R-squared goodness-of-fit 6 comparison countries Figure 3 : Daily reported new cases of COVID-19 (based on a 7-day rolling average, the dots) for 6 comparison countries, with best-fit curves for first peak in these countries (the red line). Note that the red dots are datapoints that are included in the fits and the blue dots represent datapoints which are not used in fitting.Detection rates are estimated to be very low, ranging from 2.5% in Colombia to 0.05% in Malawi. These low detection rates explain how herd immunity could be reached despite low numbers of reported cases, relative to total population, in all the countries studied. These low detection rates are not surprising. Serological testing results in Kenya, Pakistan and South Africa suggest that the number of people with coronavirus antibodies substantially exceeds the reported cases -by factors of up to 500 in Kenya (based on data in mid-May) 10 , of up to 370 in Pakistan (based on data from May to July) 11 and of 20-40 in South Africa (based on data in August) 12 , which would correspond to detection rates of 0.02% for Kenya, 0.27% for Pakistan and 2.5-5.0% for South Africa. Furthermore, there is evidence that serological tests might underestimate infection rates and immunity by up to a factor of 2, because more people develop T-cellmediated immunity than show antibodies 13 .In all these countries, the analysis indicates that over half of the population has been infected and has become immune -at least temporarily. Current total infection rates derived from the fitted curves range from 51% in Bolivia to 80% in Madagascar 14 . Note that the infection rates required for herd immunity normally quote the percentage of population infected at the peak of the curve, but significant numbers of people continue to be infected after this point, even as the numbers of new cases decline.To test the robustness of our approach, we applied the same methodology to fit curves to the first peaks in the comparison countries shown in Figure 3 (represented as red lines in this figure). Researchers at Imperial College London and others argued convincingly in June that European countries have not reached herd immunity 18 , and subsequent increases in cases have proven their point. Applying our model to fit curves just to the first peaks (shown with red circles in Figure 3 ) 19 , and hence assuming that the peaks were due to herd immunity, we find that the best-fit curves match the observed data for the first peaks fairly well in all cases, but with values for the disease parameters that are implausible. For example, for France, R0_e = 2.7 (near some of the best estimates for the basic reproduction number R0 without any social distancing measures), and p = 0.22% (well below the detection rates of between 7% and 20% suggested by serological studies in European countries 20 ). New Zealand is well known for ""crushing"" the curve -and the parameters associated with the best-fit ""herd immunity curve"" to its reported cases would be R0_e = 2.6 and a completely unrealistic p = 0.0015%. Thus, our approach leads to a conclusion for the comparison countries that the evolution of reported cases was not due to herd immunity (but instead must have been due to control measures). With this check, we increase our confidence in the hypothesis that the outbreaks in the 12 LMICs studied are declining due to herd immunity, which generates wellfitting curves with plausible parameters.Prominent models of the epidemic from teams at Imperial College London (ICL) 21 and the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 22 use SEIR simulations and determine key parameters -especially the effective reproduction number, which can vary over time -by fitting the models' results for deaths to the reported numbers of deaths from COVID-19 and utilising age-specific infection fatality rates from recent studies (in HICs). These models estimate that total infections to date for the 12 LMICs we studied are much greater than reported, but much smaller than our analysis suggests. For example, the models estimate total infection rates for South Africa of 7.7% (ICL) and 9.5% (IHME) 23 significantly lower than the rates of between 20% and 40% suggested by the recently announced serological study findings 24 -and detection rates of 13.9% and 11.2% respectively. It has previously been observed, by the IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team, that the predictive performance of seven COVID-19 models, including those of ICL and IHME, shows significantly higher errors for Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, compared to their performance for HICs 25 . Our research suggests why this might be the case. The ICL, IHME and other models are well-suited to HICs: reported deaths for such countries are likely to be reasonably close to actual deaths; the infection fatality rates used in the models are based mainly on studies conducted in HICs; and it is clear from the evolution of reported cases that these countries have not reached herd immunity 26 and that their effective basic reproduction numbers have varied significantly over time as disease control measures have been introduced and adjusted (necessitating the additional granularity of SEIR modelling). However, for some LMICs: reported deaths from COVID-19 are likely to understate actual deaths by large factors; agespecific infection fatality rates might differ substantially from those in Europe and North America; and a simple model, using the approximation that effective basic reproduction numbers and detection rates remain constant over time, may be sufficient to describe the evolution of reported cases well (at least for the 12 countries we studied).Systematic studies of representative population samples should be conducted in each of the 12 LMICs discussed here, to determine the percentages of people who have been infected and are immune -and consequently test directly the primary conclusion that the overall infection rates are very high and exceed estimated herd immunity thresholds. Serological studies are ongoing in some counties, such as South Africa. However, these studies may still underestimate infection and immunity levels, because people may have immunity driven by T-cells without detectable antibodies 27 . However, it is unclear whether the presence of T-cells provides complete immunity and T-cell immunity is harder to determine than antibodies in blood.Herd immunity means that the virus can no longer spread uncontrollably, but not that it is gone completely. Individuals may still contract the virus if they are not immune. Isolated communities with low infection rates may still experience localised outbreaks. Small general outbreaks might happen as control measures are relaxed, especially if this happens before cases have fully declined from the herd immunity peak.It is not yet known how long immunity from SARS-CoV-2 lasts. Even if a population has herd immunity today, it is possible that this could be lost over time, which might lead to future outbreaks -the severity of which would depend on the share of people losing immunity, the amount of variation in timing of when people lose immunity, and whether susceptibility to reinfection is equal to the susceptibility to first infection. New strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, and it is conceivable that future mutations could allow the virus to evade immune systems, and thus render previously immune populations susceptible again to the disease -but there is no evidence yet of any such immunity-evading strains.","South Africa","first author","2020-09-28",9

The World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (UN News, 2020). By 1 st June, 2020, 6.22 million people worldwide had been infected with more than 373,032 deaths (JHU, 2020) . In Kenya, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 12 th March, 2020 (Anadolu Agency News, 2020 . Subsequently, the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increased and by 9 th June, 2020 a total of 2,989 people had been infected (MoH News, 2020) . The Kenya government instituted measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and minimize causalities. These included restricting international travel, cessation of movement from some cities including the capital city of Nairobi, imposing curfews, social distancing and closure of areas of mass gathering such as schools and places of worship, and dusk to dawn curfews (Africa Press Office, 2020). These measures, and specifically the cessation of movement to cities that are the main fish markets, curfews and social distancing affected fishing trips and duration, disrupted the fish value chain and affected the livelihoods of fishers.During the same period, the African great lakes region experienced floods that were manifested by increases in lake levels and overflowing of banks that would affect natural resources and livelihoods (Obando et al., 2016; Kohfeld and Harrison, 2000) . There was increased support from the donor community and the Kenya government to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, but very little of this was channelled to cushion the fisheries sector (UN News, 2020; Welsh, 2020) .Riparian communities in the African Great Lakes are marginalized, vulnerable, and highly susceptible to the rapid impact of social economic effects of mitigative measures such as those put in place to contain of COVID-19 (FAO, 2020; CFFA, 2020) and floods (Njiru et al., 2012) . This is because lakes and reservoirs are important income and employment generators in developing nations as they stimulate the growth of a number of subsidiary industries and are a high quality source of cheap and nutritious food besides being a foreign exchange earner for riparian communities and lacustrine stakeholders (Hamerlynck et al., 2011; Aura et al., 2019; Nyamweya et al., 2020) . More importantly, inland capture fisheries are a source of livelihood for a large section of an economically disadvantaged population in rural and peri-urban communities including women and young people (Dugan et al., 2006; Gangadhar, 2011; Njiru et al., 2019) . The importance of fish as a source of comparatively cheap animal protein for people in the tropics, especially the most vulnerable groups, and the need for sufficient water to sustain fisheries can hardly be overemphasized (Welcomme, 2008) . Fisheries occupy a significant place in the socioeconomic development of many countries (Woodhead et al., 2018; Njiru et al., 2012 Njiru et al., , 2019 . For example, Kenya's fishery sector generally contributes about 4.7 % of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Mulatu et al., 2018) . Fishers also often have limited livelihood options.Management of inland lake fisheries face many challenges such as increased fishing pressure, invasive species, loss of biodiversity, environmental degradation, access and ownership issues, ecological changes, climate change, inadequate information and un-harmonised policies (LVFO, 2015; Nyamweya et al., 2020) . The concurrent emergence and consequences of COVID-19 and floods in Kenya put the fisheries productivity in crisis (CFFA, 2020; FAO, 2020) . There is limited information on the effect of COVID-19 on inland aquatic systems and fishery livelihoods (Africa Press Office, 2020; FAO, 2020) to guide putting in place present and future mitigation and adaptation measures.The influence of water level fluctuations on fisheries production has been widely studied in rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Welcome 1970 , Hamerlynck et al., 2011 Kolding et al., 2016) . These changes tend to affect productivity and the timing and area of breeding, food availability, catchability, expansion of shallow productive inshore areas, cage culture establishments (Kolding and van Zwieten, 2012; Gownaris et al., 2015; Musinguzi et al., 2019) . Studies on Lakes Chad, Mweru, Mweru wa Ntipa and Chilwa reported variation in yield and species composition with lake level (Lévêque, 1995; Kolding et al., 2016) . Currently, in Kenya, flooding in Lakes Baringo and Bogoria have been reported to displace thousands of people, disrupt several livelihood activities and social infrastructure, erode farmlands, and threaten crosscontamination between the two lakes which are in close proximity (BBC News, 2020). Evaluation of water level fluctuations in relation to fishery production and livelihoods provide useful information for resource management.There is limited information on the impacts of calamities like Covid-19 and flooding on fishers to guide intervention measures. This study was therefore undertaken to contribute to that information as a case study. The objective of the study was to examine the consequence of the measures put in place to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and flooding in Kenya to guide interventions to sustain livelihoods of affected communities.The study was undertaken on Kenyan major lakes, namely, Victoria, Turkana, Baringo and Naivasha (Fig. 1) . The lakes experienced increases in water levels causing widespread flooding that affected lakes-side communities and infrastructure especially of fishers. This was exacerbated by emergence of Covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken to control its spread. Lake fisheries in are important sources of livelihood providing food and employment (Kimani et al., 2018) . Inland capture fisheries contribute >75% of Kenya's total fish production, currently at about 150,000 tonnes valued at about USD $190 million. The principal fishery is that of Lake Victoria with a 5-year average production of about 90,000 tonnes landed and valued at about USD $90 million (Ongore et al., 2018; Aura et al., 2020) . Lake Victoria is the world's largest tropical lake (68,800 km 2) with a catchment area of 193,000 km 2 , a shoreline of 3,440 km, average depth of 40 m and a maximum depth of 80 m with 82% of the water input coming from rainfall and 80% of the loss through evaporation. It has ten major inflowing rivers and one outflow. It produces about one million tons of fish valued at USD 400 annually, which provides employment to 200,000 fishers and up to 700,000 along the value chain. Lake Turkana is Kenya's largest lake (6,405 km 2 ) located wholly in Kenya. It lies in a closed basin at 365 m above sea level with a mean and maximum depth of 31 m and 115 m respectively. It receives over 90% of its annual water input from one permanent river (Omo) that flows into the lake from Ethiopia. The lake is endorhoic with no surface outlet. The water budget is a balance between river inflow and evaporation, which has made the lake to become increasingly saline. The lake's average annual fish production is highly influenced by water level changes. It is estimated to produce 7,000 tonnes per annum valued at USD $1.6 million (Long'ora et al., 2015) supporting about 7,000 fishers and 6,500 fish traders and transporters. Lake Baringo, a Ramsar site, is a Rift valley lake with a surface area of 130 km 2 , which varies greatly due to climatic variation (Kallqvist, 1987) . It has a mean depth of 5.6 m and three river inlets but no visible outlet save for suspected underground seepage (Aloo, 2002) . The lake has an annual production of 263 tonnes of fish with an ex-vessel value of USD $250,000.Lake Naivasha is also a Ramsar site within an urban setting. It surface area varies between 120 km 2 and 150 km 2 in the dry and wet seasons (Harper, 1992; Hickley et al., 2008) . Its mean depth varies between 4 m and 6 m. Two tributaries feed the lake and its fisheries are influenced by changes in the lake water levels (Kitaka et al., 2002; Harper and Mavuti, 2004 ). An annual quantity of 1,063 tons of fish valued at USD $1. 4 million are landed by total of 50 fishing crafts licensed to operate with an average of 150 fishers per month.Data collection was conducted from May to early June 2020 at the peak of COVID-19 and flooding around Kenyan major lakes. Primary data collection included a socio-economics survey on perceptions and attitudes of purposively selected categories of stakeholders at the lake landing sites while secondary data was on lake levels was acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s website and the Kenya Water Resource Authority (WRA). The categories of respondents included: input providers (boat builders and engine repairers); producers (fishers); middlemen (fish traders and processors); ancillary service providers (transporters and community health workers); and managers (Beach Management Units' officials). These categories were expected to provide credible information because they were directly involved in fisheries activities.Data on the attitude to consequence of flooding and the interventions to contain Covid-19 were obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire with a 3-point likert scale rating. The consequences were rated as ""A little"" (< 34% losses), ""Much"" (34% -66% losses) or ""very much"" (> 66% losses). Purposive sampling was applied because it is useful in situations where there is need to reach a targeted sample quickly and where sampling for proportionality is not the primary concern.The data on changes in lake levels for Lakes Victoria, Turkana and Naivasha associated with flooding were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website (https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/) while that for Lake Baringo were obtained from Water Resource Authority (WRA), but were only available for the year 2017 and during the peak of flooding period in 2020. The lake levels are monitored daily by WRA. These daily readings were compiled into monthly averages, which are referenced to a benchmark set in 1960s to quantify the degree of flooding.The changes in fish landing and prices before and after flooding and Covid-19 were obtained by comparing data collected between 2009 -2017 before (before 14 th March 2020) and during (after 14 th March 2020) using the Electronic Fish Market Information System (EFMIS). EFMIS is an ICT (Information and Communication Technology Authority) pilot project, being implemented around Lake Victoria in Kenya based on mobile phones to provide information on landings in terms of species and prices at fish landing sites and markets .Quantitative socioeconomics data were subjected to descriptive analyses, and the qualitative data from open-ended questions to thematic analyses were used to triangulate results. The trend of the lake level was forecasted at 95% confidence interval using the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series data and for predicting future points in the series (Hyndman and Khandakar, 2008; Asteriou and Hall, 2011) . The EFMIS data was used to compare landings and prices for major commercial fish species before and during flooding and COVID-19 .Microsoft Excel 2016 was used for data entry and cleaning while SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R version 4.0.0 (R Core team, 2020) were used for statistical analyses. Variation in the parameters were compared per lake. Descriptive statistics were used to show the ranges and means over the period. The statistical significance level was set at an alpha of 0.05.The EFMIS data was used for validation of the socioeconomics field data. This is because the EFMIS platform is extensively used on Lake Victoria which accounts for >90% of fish production in Kenya . The magnitude of production from Lake Victoria makes its fishery have a strong influence on the demand and supply of fish on both domestic and international markets.A total of 336 respondents were interviewed across the four lakes. The respondents were mainly fishers and fish traders (80%, n = 260) and was dominated by males (52%, n = 171). A fisher in this context is a person directly involved in fishing (Lwenya et al., 2009 ). The perception of respondents' indicate that they were adversely affected by both floods (92%, n = 290) and the COVID-19 (94%, n = 306) pandemic (Table 1) . A recent study on the effect of Covid-19 pandemic on small-scale coastal communities who dealt in tilapia species reported similar setback (Bennett et al., 2020) . Most (71%, n = 118) of the fishers, traders and processors who were affected by the pandemic and flooding dealt in tilapia species. Tilapia fish dominate the African menu due to its preference owing to good taste, fast growth and adaption to tropical climate, including Kenyan lakes and are among the dominant species on many inland fisheries in Africa (Njiru et al., 2006 (Njiru et al., , 2012 .The Kenyan major inland lake levels had a five-year general trend of rise and decline scenario, but with an overall rise from the year 2010 (Fig. 2) . This could be attributed to the domination of runoffs from inlets in conjunction with increased precipitation that has occurred since early 2020. The study could not clearly forecast Lake Baringo's future water levels due to limited availability of long-term trend data, although, from the previous literature, the lake has been known to experience rising lake levels especially during heavy precipitation (Aloo, 2002) .On the other hand, Lake Naivasha's estimation variance was high; hence, the study could not robustly predict the future rise in water level points due to limited long-term data for the time series. Nonetheless, Lake Turkana is predicted to experience water level rise in the coming decade, and this could exacerbate the undesirable impacts of flooding that have already been experienced so far by dependent livelihoods. The lake level rise in Lake Victoria, which coincided with the two rainy seasons from March to May (long rains) and from October to December (short rains), is still projected to increase in the next 5 years.From the socioeconomics survey, many fishers and traders reported that they had suffered from floods due to loss of homes, business and farmland, drowning of colleagues and relations, destruction of fishing infrastructure and flooding of landing sites. These alongside the predicted increase in precipitation and the associated rise in water level, illustrates the need to adhere to fisheries and environmental regulations (i.e. no settlements within 100 meters from the highest water mark or on riparian zones) to minimize the effect of floods on riparian communities that may have encroached into these nominal waterways' reserves. In addition climate warming over Africa has intensified since the 1970s (Hulmes et al., 2010) and IPCC (2003) has predicted that climate warming will be accompanied by increases in precipitation in the East African region. The flood being experience could be partly due to this, and there is need to develop adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce its impact on resources and livelihoods.The study showed that all fisheries related occupations in the lakes examined registered substantial livelihood and material losses from the COVID-19 pandemic and floods (Table 2) , although the pandemic effects were more extensive (many people) while the flooding effects were more intensive (more losses). Fish traders and processors were more affected by COVID-19 while fishers and BMU officials by floods. This finding could be attributed to the fact that COVID-19 regulations mainly affected markets where traders and processors operate while floods mainly impacted on fishing infrastructure and adjacent infrastructure where BMUs and fishers operate from or live. As such, losses from the pandemic were mainly on livelihoods whereas losses from floods were mainly on physical assets and infrastructure (Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Plates 1 and 2).The COVID-19 pandemic containment regulations impacted fishing and fish trade in all the freshwater lakes examined, for instance, dusk to dawn curfew (66%, n = 128), lock-down to major markets such as Nairobi and Mombasa (28%, n = 55), sanitary measures (3%, n = 6), and the rest being social distancing and curtailment of non-essential services. The sanitary measures had the highest impact in Lake Victoria while the curfew had most impact in all the other lakes (Table 3 ). This study was in agreement with others that noted that socioeconomic aspects and life in developing countries has been affected by hampering movements and connectivity (e.g., Béné et al., 2010; Béné and Friend, 2011; Immanuel, 2020) .The fishers reported fishing time to have been reduced (76%, n = 116) as well as fishing trips per week from an average of seven to five trips (n = 103) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction in fishing time and trips were occasioned by the dusk to dawn (1900 hours -0500 hours) curfew. In addition, during the pandemic, there was a notable decline in the average crew (fishing inputs) and boat fuel (consumable) used in fishing activities resulting into a cross-cutting decline in catch quantities and prices (Fig. 3) . The decline in fish prices is attributed to closure of major markets in the cities under lock-down, resulting in market glut within the nearby markets. The relatively difficult economic conditions also resulted into lower prices owing to reduced purchasing power of potential fish consumers. A significant reduction in fishing effort and inputs would significantly impact the socio-economic status of the already poor small-scale fishers (Béné and Friend, 2011; Freduah et al., 2017) . While the current study did not emphasize the positive impacts of the Covid-19 on fisheries, it is expected that the pandemic would offer relief from any over-fishing through reduction in fishing effort.Many fishers and traders reported that they had suffered very intense loss from floods mainly due to loss of homes, business and farmland, drowning of colleagues and relations, destruction of fishing infrastructure and sub-immersion of landing sites (Fig. 4) . These, alongside forecast of future water level rise of lakes, calls for the need to adhere to fisheries and environmental regulations such as the 100 m setback to minimize the effect of floods on riparian communities that may have encroached into waterways' reserves. On a positive side, floods have been reported to enhance recruitment of some fishes especially inshore commercially important tilapias (Welcome 1970).There was close agreement between the EFMIS data collected before and that of the current study. Only dagaa (small cyprinids) recorded higher prices during COVID-19 and flooding (Fig.  5) . Unlike dagaa, Nile perch prices were highest before COVID-19 pandemic than during the pandemic. Nile perch is mainly an export fishery with European Union being an important market for Nile perch fillets and the far East Nations (China, Hong Kong and India) being important destinations for Nile perch maws from Lake Victoria (Marshall and Mkumbo, 2011) . The introduction of internal and external travel restrictions, lockdowns and curfews affected movement of Nile perch and its products in and out of Kenya thereby affecting both internal and external markets (Béné et al., 2010; Agboola et al., 2018; Rajeev and Nagendran, 2020) .A fluctuating trend was exhibited for Lake Victoria tilapia in the major landing sites and markets. This could be related to disruption of market because of movement restrictions from some towns such as Nairobi, which has been the major market . A similar scenario was noted when China imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions (Tester, 2020; Dao, 2020) . In this case, the demand for luxury seafood declined and markets collapsed for Canadian and American lobsters, Australian crayfish, Vietnamese shrimp and many other fisheries (Taunton and Cropp, 2020) . In Homa Bay County on Lake Victoria, the price for tilapia was high during COVID-19 pandemic, probably due to high demand and very low quantities or supply that could not be supported from other parts of the lake and neighbouring countries was the case before COVID-19 crisis. Tilapia is the most valued fish delicacy in Kenya with increasing demands . It however had low prices during COVID-19 pandemic in Siaya County (Lake Victoria) probably due to the availability of cage culture nearby, which supplements wild tilapia . Notably, there was no significant difference between the EFMIS data and the field data collected during this study (Fig. 6) .The respondents proposed various intervention measures to the COVID-19 pandemic and floods (Fig. 7) . Key among these included disaster preparedness and financial assistance. Ishiwatari et al. (2020) proposed an integrated approach to disaster management, which starts with adequate preparedness. On the other hand, the unexpected and rapid onset of the COVID-19 situation could have called for the prioritization of financial assistance as its main intervention measure.This study was intended to demonstrate the short term consequences of calamities such as COVID-19 pandemic and flooding on vulnerable dependent communities such as those of inland capture fisheries to guide interventions towards sustaining livelihoods now and in the future. Although done for a short period, it provides a basis for further discussion and research on addressing impacts of calamities which are increasing in frequency on vulnerable resources and communities and how these should be addressed. The study showed that all the lakes examined registered substantial livelihood and material losses from the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. The COVID-19 pandemic containment regulations were cited to have impacted fishing and fishing trade due to curfew (66%) and lock-downs (28%) in major cities of Nairobi and Mombasa that act as major markets of fish. The fishing time, consumables such as boat fuel used during fishing activities, and the frequency of fishing trips were reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. resulting into a cross-cutting decline in catch quantities and prices of fish. Nile perch as an export fishery experienced setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, amidst flooding due to restrictions, lockdowns and curfews. but also suffered from lowered internal and international trade and movements.The prominent interventions proposed by the fish value chain actors included disaster preparedness and financial assistance. In order to withstand the inland fisheries shocks that are caused by calamities, this study recommends the development of an integrated fisheries management strategy for combating calamities in the Kenya inland lakes. There is also need for more detailed research on the impact of calamities to provide information and data to guide policy and management actions.

The disease that has grown into a pandemic is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS- and has infected more than 25 million people globally, causing the death of more than 850,000 people [1, 2] . The distribution of diseases is described in terms of person, place and time or who, where and when [3] . According to Chan et al. [4] and Andersen et al. [5] , the initial outbreak seemed to be as a result of a zoonotic transmission from bats. However, as the outbreak continued, it was evident that human to human transmission of the virus via close contact was also possible through close contact with an infected person and through respiratory droplets, saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes [6] .The clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 ranges in patients ranges from being absent (asymptomatic infections) to the mild or moderate infection with symptoms such as fever, dry cough, abdominal pain, fatigue, aches and pains, sore throat, breathing difficulty, diarrhoea, headache, conjunctivitis, loss of smell and/or taste, skin rash, and so on. Those who develop the severe disease exhibit more serious symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure and ultimately death [6] [7] [8] [9] . Treatment remains largely supportive with the severe cases requiring oxygen supplementation and intensive care [10] . There are no approved vaccines yet for COVID-19.The first case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was identified on 27th February 2020 in a visiting Italian.Since then, the epidemic in Nigeria has resulted in more than 54,000 cases and causing more than 1,000 deaths (mortality rate of 1.85%) as of September 1st, 2020 [11] . More than one-third (33.5%) of the cases in Nigeria were recorded in Lagos, Nigeria [11] . The epidemic in Nigeria has resulted in patients presenting with different symptoms and there is scarcity of information on the description of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. The only available study, to the best of our knowledge, describing the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria evaluated the first 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria [12] . This study was designed to provide a larger description of the clinical characteristics of patients presenting to an isolation centre in Lagos, Nigeria and confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).With ethical approval obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria, patient data were obtained and reviewed at the Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba. Informed consent was also obtained from the study participants before their health records were obtained. This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between June and August 30, 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. The IDIC is a central, comprehensive and integrated healthcare organization attending to COVID-19 patients in Lagos, the epicentre of the epidemic in Nigeria. All the patients included in this study were confirmed to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of nasopharyngeal, throat and blood samples. Clinical outcomes were also monitored and recorded.Clinicians and trained research assistants reviewed patient health records retrospectively and copied them out to a standardized data collection form. Health records copied out include demographic information, signs and symptoms presented with, co-morbidities, and patient outcome. A formal sample size was not calculated for this study because the objective of the study was to describe the clinical characteristics of the patients who had enough information in their health records for analysis. Records were double entered into the forms before merging to reduce errors during data entry. Descriptive analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 25 (IBM, USA).With COVID-19 being a novel disease, it is assumed that the immune system is naïve. Hence, the definition and description of the clinical characteristics after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 is important to foster early detection and control of the spread of the disease.A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The mean age (Standard Deviation, [S.D]) of the study participants is 46. 16 (13.701 ). Information about travel history was not collected because a nationwide lockdown was effected on 30 th March 2020 [13] , and the study participants presented at the health centre between May and August, a time when community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was already established in Nigeria [14] . Hence, it was assumed that the virus was contracted from other individuals infected with the virus.The disparity between the severity of the disease in Nigeria (and by extension the African continent) and the rest of the world has been discussed by other studies with some reasons given for the observed disproportionality in outcomes include the relatively young population in Africa, lower rates of obesity, poor access to health care, familiarity of the continent with outbreaks of infectious diseases, impact of health disparities, and lower socioeconomic factors in Africa [18] [19] [20] . Although, on the other hand, reports from other continents show higher morbidity and mortality in people of African heritage [21, 22] .About three-quarter of the study participants were men, a trend also observed in other studies [7, 16] . SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been reported to infect more males than females, a phenomenon that could be attributed to protection from the X chromosome and sex hormones, known to play significant roles in innate and adaptive immunity [23, 24] . Other possible reasons proposed for the increased susceptibility of men to COVID-19 include biological reasons such as a higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE 2, a reception coronaviruses) in males than females; and behavioural reasons -higher levels of smoking and drinking in men, and irresponsible attitude, reviewed by [25] The results of this study suggest that older adults are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and be more susceptible to develop the severe disease, a trend that may be due to the reduced immunity in older adults. This trend is well established globally, reviewed by [26] . In this study, the four patients who died were all older than 60 years. It has also been reported that old age, obesity and the presence of co-morbidities may be associated with increased mortality [27] .This study has its limitations. First, the study is limited by the sample size. Only 154 patients were included in the study. Suspected, but not confirmed, cases were not included in this study.More patient data from other health centres around the country should be added to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics of the disease in the country. Second, patient data such as travel history was also incomplete at the time this study was conducted, hence the assumption of local transmission. However, this study presents, to the best of our knowledge, the largest report describing the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.In conclusion, this study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. From the results of this study, males are more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and the most occurring symptoms are fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain. Old age and the presence of comorbidities may also be associated with disease severity.• The only study from Nigeria on the subject so far (32 patients) reports fever and dry cough as the most common symptoms.• We present data from 154 COVID-19 patients, with the most common symptoms being fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain.• Males are more likely to be infected; old age and co-morbidities are associated with disease severity.This work represents an advance in biomedical science because we present the most extensive description so far on the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 in Nigeria.Approval to conduct this study was received from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at NIMR, Yaba, Lagos.

Emerging pathogens may enter wastewater systems from pathogen shedding in human waste, introduction of decontamination wastewater, illicit activity, animal farming, and hospital effluents, or surface water runoff following a wide-area biological incident. Some emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola virus [EBOV] and SARS-CoV-2) pose a significant health threat and their exposure in a wastewater system could have potentially serious health consequences. The need to assess the potential exposure and transmission of disease through sanitation systems is therefore necessary.Excretion of SARS-CoV-2 and its RNA from the body in saliva, sputum, and feces can be found in sewage. The main route of transmission of this virus would be inhalation by person-to-person transmission and aerosol/droplet, as well as fomite and hand contamination. However, currently available data indicate that there is a need to better understand the role of wastewater as a potential source of epidemiological data and a risk factor for public health. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in feces has prompted several groups around the world to promote the analysis of wastewater to assess its circulation in populations (Mallapaty, 2020; Lodder and de Roda the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and take appropriate measures to prevent and control the spread of the disease in the community. However, it is very difficult to track the virus because most people are asymptomatic; and further, it is not possible to do active clinical testing of all individuals, due to resource and cost constraints. Furthermore, COVID-19 may also display second or more waves. Under these circumstances, the passive, but effective, method of sewage or wastewater monitoring can be used to trace and track the presence of SARS-CoV-2, through their genetic material RNA, and screen entire community. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is predictable because it can infect the gastrointestinal tract and are shed through the stools of the patients (Xiao et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2003; Zumla et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2020) .With the objective of keeping the water community informed of COVID-19 related findings, this review highlights the recent scientific evidence, as well as topics not previously discussed.Emphasis was placed on their presence and persistence, as well as detection methods in different water matrices. Virus-infected wastewater treatment techniques are also highlighted.Environmental persistence refers to the length of time a pathogen, such as the SARS CoV-2, is able to survive outside the human body; the longer it survives, the more likely it is to cause infection. For the most part, investigations on the fate of viruses in the aquatic environment have focused on non-enveloped enteric viruses, given that these viruses are characterized by high resistance under a variety of environmental conditions (Annalaura et al., 2020) . As for the number of studies concerning the fate of enveloped viruses in aquatic compartments, it is rather limited, because enveloped viruses are predisposed to deactivate in water (Wigginton et al., 2015) . In fact, although enveloped viruses are inactivated more quickly than non-enveloped J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof viruses, the survival time of enveloped viruses can still be very long depending on the specific environmental conditions. This is explained by the fact that the surface S-proteins ( Figure 1 ) are deeply anchored and only pass through the envelope: if the envelope is altered, but the surface Sproteins are preserved, infectivity is maintained.The persistence of viruses can be affected both by the type of environment (e.g., surface, water, wastewater) and by the physical and chemical properties of the environment (e.g., temperature, pH, humidity, exposure to sunlight and the type of surface (Rzeżutka and Cook, 2004; Thevenin et al., 2013) . Furthermore, it is also possible to be influenced by the composition of the media. This is consistent with a recent study published detailing the survival rates of SARS-CoV-2 on different non-living surfaces: 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper (Van Doremalen et al., 2020) .Studies to verify the survival of SAR-CoV and SAR-CoV-2 have a strong phylogenetic similarity (Forster et al., 2020) , showing the survival rate of a pathogen with a viral titer of 10 5 on aluminum, plastic, metal, wood and paper of 4-5 days at room temperature (Kampf et al., 2020) .Generally speaking, viruses are microscopic pathogenic agents ranging in size from 18 to 1500 nm (Hurst and Gerba, 1989) and are abundant in water and wastewater (Gantzer et al., 1998) , especially domestic and urban effluents, which are particularly laden with animal and bacterial viruses. These two groups are of particular interest for environmental and human health studies.Infected subjects are considerable and can have up to 10 10 per gram of stool (Masson, 1996) . The transmission of these viruses to humans generates several diseases and epidemics that affect all age groups. In some cases, they can be fatal for children (e.g., gastroenteritis leading to morbidity and mortality during the first five years of life) (Parashar et al., 2013) . Humans are considered to be the primary contaminator, and secondary receptor (Gantzer et al., 1998) . Several potential routes ensure viral transmission to humans: domestic use of the contaminated surface, or groundwater, bathing in contaminated water, consumption of infected seafood, or crops grown in contaminated soil.There are many different types of viruses to include, for example, Picornaviridae (e.g. polioviruses, echoviruses, and hepatitis A), Reoviridae (e.g. reoviruses, rotaviruses), Adenoviridae (e.g. adenovirus A.), Coronaviridae (e.g. coronaviruses), Caliciviridae (e.g. caliciviruses), small round viruses (e.g. astroviruses, Norwalk), and bacteriophages (Gantzer et al., 1998; Girard and Hirth, 1989; Havelaar, 1991; Grabow et al., 1995; Havelaar et al., 1986; Havelaar et al., 1986; Havelaar et al., 1990; Joffre, 1991) . According to Kai et al. (1985) , their concentration in the feces is less than l0 5 particles per gram.Owing to their characteristics, bacteriophages are considered by researchers as indicators of fecal pollution and as models for monitoring the fate of viruses in different water environments and WWTP (Havelaar, 1991) . Bacteriophages have a morphology, structure, and composition similar to those of enteric viruses. Resistance and behavior, especially of F-specified RNA phages, are comparable to those of enteric viruses (Havelaar, 1991; Havelaar et al., 1988; Lewis, 1995) .Concretely, on the one hand, phages are not involved in human pathology.One of the main problems is the spread of viruses between polluted environmental waters and populations. It happens that water is contaminated by humans on the one hand, and water becomes a means of infection for humans on the other hand. Since wastewater contains viruses that are repelled by everyone, regardless of their health, monitoring for viruses in wastewater and environmental waters that receive effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can determine the true prevalence and molecular epidemiology of gastroenteritis viruses and the risks to human health (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) in a given geographical area rather than clinical research (Prevost et al., 2015; Kazama et al., 2017) . Such data would be a useful indicator, especially for poor countries, as it would allow simple, reliable and inexpensive epidemiological surveillance. In such a situation, the two fundamental factors that require attention to prevent the spread of infection, especially in high-risk locations such as hospitals, are the interconnection of the plumbing system and its condition (Gormley et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) . The genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (Wölfel et al., 2020; Lescure et al. 2020 ) and in cured individuals who no longer have symptoms (Wölfel et al., 2020; Lescure et al. 2020; Holshue et al., 2020) . However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the stool does not necessarily indicate infection or disease. A few studies that have attempted to detect a viable infectious virus in the stool have produced conflicting results. Three studies reported the detection of live virus (Wölfel et al., 2020; Lescure et al. 2020; Holshue et al., 2020) in the stool and one study reported no detection of live virus despite the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (Holshue et al., 2020) .Researchers in Netherlands were the first to successfully isolate and detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (Medema et al., 2020) . They demonstrated that the coronavirus genome can be detected at several wastewater collection sites within days of the identification of the first human case of COVID-19. This hypothesis was confirmed by Wurtzer and his colleagues (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/coronavirus-found-paris-sewage-points-early warning-system). It also demonstrates, for the first time, that the quantities of viral genomes detected in wastewater are increasing in line with the number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations at the regional level. Preliminary results obtained even more recently at the same sites show a very significant reduction in the viral load in wastewater, an expected consequence of containment measures on the circulation of the virus.Queensland and the Australian National Scientific Agency CSIRO that took samples from a suburban pumping station and WWTP. They analyzed the wastewater samples using RT-PCR tests, which helps identify gene fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is also the method used by hospitals to test for the virus in human samples.Passive surveillance through wastewater mining and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2, as a subset of the National Water Quality Monitoring Network, therefore, can be utilized to assess community or public health in COVID-19 pandemic as well as post-pandemic scenarios. The monitoring should commence in red, orange, as well as green zones to alert health officials in advance about the possible second wave of COVID-19.However, these methods remain more difficult, especially for SARS-CoV-2, and take more time than most molecular techniques, which explains why they are less frequently used. In order to develop and test methods for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage, a study is currently underway (Kitajima et al., 2020) . With this approach, it is possible to estimate the frequency of the disease in communities, identify areas where few tests are performed, predict a possible second wave of infection, and monitor vaccine results. The approach is not yet ready and is not an alternative to human testing.There are then creations of a risk to public health either as a result of the contamination of water bodies by migration of viruses through the soil or the consumption of contaminated market garden produce.The reuse of treated and untreated wastewater in agriculture is a practice that is steadily increasing. It is therefore important to know the fate of these viruses, particularly on plants. This can only be done with enteric viruses that can multiply on cell cultures. Indeed, the presence of viral genome does not indicate the presence of infectious viral particles.Studies reported in the literature show that viruses can survive on plants irrigated with sewage for variable periods ranging from a few days to nearly 4 weeks depending on conditions (Badawy et al., 1990; Tierney et al., 1977) . In addition to the nature of the vegetable under consideration, it appears that two factors have a fundamental influence on the survival time of viruses on plants after irrigation. These are the initial level of contamination and the temperature associated with sunlight. It must be fully aware that even in regions with a very hot climate it takes more than 6 hours to achieve a 2-log reduction in virus contamination. This means, for example, that in case of irrigating a golf course with wastewater in the morning, enteric viruses are likely to be still present when the players will be on the course during the day. The same situation can be found on irrigated lawns in public parks. In both cases, players or children are likely to come into contact with enteric viruses.On the other hand, with regard to vegetables, it is clear, and this has been well confirmed by Croci et al., (1991) , that plants irrigated during cultivation with contaminated water retain significant amounts of viruses on their surface. In addition, storage at +4°C not only does not accelerate viral inactivation but slows it down. It is therefore extremely important to have virusfree vegetable crops at harvest time. Figure 2 illustrates the potential impacts of reusing recycled wastewater for agricultural irrigation. In addition, since the onset of the crisis, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment has attracted attention, including observation and analysis of recent impacts, and estimates related to long-term changes. Qualitative assumptions prevail, while consistent quantitative research must await relevant data sets and additional knowledge. Most aspects of the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic do not come directly from the virus itself.Sudden restrictions or closures of economic sectors (such as heavy industry, transportation, or hotel businesses) had a direct impact on the environment. From an anthropocentric point of view, the pandemic may lead to a more sustainable future, and particularly to more resilient socioecological systems or shorter supply chains, which is a positive development.However, countries can still choose less sustainability by pursuing rapid economic growth and reducing environmental concerns. Although the overall negative impact on the economy and society can be enormous, it is likely that the reduction in global economic activity due to the COVID-19 crisis will trigger many major improvements in the quality of service of the environment and climate systems. However, not all the environmental consequences of the crisis are or will be positive. Some of these include the increase in the amount of non-recyclable waste, the large amount of organic waste generated due to declining agricultural and fisheries exports, As in many countries in the world, wastewater offers Morocco an alternative solution as the pressure on freshwater is constantly increasing, particularly due to repeated droughts. In the country, wastewater reuse is intended for industry, particularly phosphate washing, but also for golf course irrigation. A letter from the Ministry of the Interior addressed to the local authorities prohibits the use of wastewater before it has been treated due to the possible presence of traces of genomes from the stools of affected persons (https://www.leconomiste.com/article/1061485-leseaux-usees-un-moyen-de-tracage-du-covid-19). The letter mentions that the use of this wastewater is set by the laws and regulations in force.The detection of viruses in wastewater and drinking water requires the following detection methods: sensitive, resistant to false-positive results, and enabling full automation. In addition,Journal Pre-proof the method used must be fast and inexpensive. A method, which fulfills all needed requirements, as yet was not worked out.In addition to economic agents, the implementation of methods for the detection of viruses in the aquatic environment can come up against several obstacles, including: the considerable dilution of the sample, the influence of the environmental matrix on the analytical results and the mutagenic variability of viruses. In faecally contaminated water, viruses are present in relatively small amounts. It is therefore often necessary to concentrate the samples before determining the exact virus content (Marzouk et al., 1979) . These include, for example: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Li et al., 2002; Pina et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2000; Fout et al., 2003; Schvoerer et al., 2000) , nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Rutjes et al., 2006; Jean et al., 2002; Jean et al., 2001) , DNA chip technique (Nettikadan et al., 2003; Alhamlan et al., 2013) , atomic force microscope (AFM) (Nettikadan et al., 2003) , fluorescence microscopy (Hara et al., 1991; Hennes et al., 1995; Noble et al., 1998; Shibata et al., 2006 ; Wen et al., 2004 ; Weinbauer and Suttle, 1997) , electron microscopy (Weinbauer and Suttle, 1997; Bettarel et al., 2000 ; Alonso et al., 1999; Wommack et al., 1992) , biosensor application (Liu and Zhu, 2005; Rengevych et al., 1999) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Kittigul et al., 2000; Nasser et al., 1987; El-Esnawy, 2000; Nishida et al., 2009 ) and flow cytometry (Marie et al., 1999; Abad et al., 1998 ; Brussaard, 2004 ; Chen et al., 2001) . Some of these methods have been modified by: i) concentration (ELISA tests, PCR and NASBA reactions, application of microarrays) (Li et al., 2002; Alhamlan et al., 2013; Kittigul et al., 2000) , ii) combination of different methods (PCR reaction combined with plate-forming tests, atomic force microscopy combined with protein microarray technology) (Straub et al., 1995; Haab et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2001) , iii) change in the pore size of the filter (epifluorescence microscopy) (Weinbauer and Suttle, 1997) , iv) dilution of the sample (flow cytometry) (Nettikadan et al., 2003) . CombinedJournal Pre-proof methods can also be used. For example, the combination of PCR with plate formation tests is possible. Polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify the specific sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In this reaction, double-stranded DNA, called template DNA, is amplified. The PCR technique, because of its high specificity, has been adopted for several years for the detection of viruses in the environment, in particular enteroviruses and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (Egger et al., 1995; Gantzer et al., 1997) . PCR is a technique that amplifies (i.e. synthesizes many copies) a specific segment of DNA of interest using short sequences of synthetic nucleotides called primers that bind to unique regions of the target genome for organism-specific identification.While much simpler than cell culture, molecular methods also present many challenges. The (Li et al., 2002) . Molecular methods pose another problem when it comes to translating nucleic acid test results in public health risks. Using nucleic acid-based analysis, the result is the expression of all viral genetic material present, without distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious particles (Metcalf et al., 1995) . It is beyond the scope of PCR to measure the extent to which viruses are affected by different disinfectants. In fact, PCR targets specific parts 2005). In addition, the technology is highly sensitive and allows observation of the interaction between molecules in real-time (Liu and Zhu, 2005; Keusgen et al., 2002) . Considering the need for rapid information on the infection status of the population, and the presence of the virus in the environment, biosensors can play an essential role in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease in the current global pandemic. Qiu et al. (2020) were able to demonstrate a dual-function plasmonic biosensor that combines plasmonic photothermal effect (PPT) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA transduction without the use of RT-PCR. The biosensor demonstrated high specificity and a low detection limit of SARS-COV-2 sequences down to 0.22 pM (Qiu et al. 2020) . As the viral concentration is relatively low in a patient sample, the detection limit is of paramount importance. LOC devices appear to have the lowest detection limits, making them most immediately relevant for this application (Qiu et al. 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Kaarj et al., 2018; Seo et al., 2020) .Plaque forming tests connected with PCR reaction enable detection of viruses present in water in time of 2 to 4 days (Straub et al., 1995) . In this method, the detection period is considerably shorter than that of the traditional plate-forming test, as well as a shorter incubation period.Techniques based on biosensors in terms of time-saving are much better (Liu and Zhu, 2005) .Comparison of described methods is presented in Table 1 .Insert Table 1 6Wastewater treatment is designed to reduce or eliminate suspended solids, dissolved and particulate organic matter, nutrients, and heavy metals. The degree of wastewater treatment is With well-designed and well-functioning wastewater treatment plants and on-site sanitation systems with reliable in-situ disposal or a network for emptying and discharge to a sewage sludge treatment plant, the risk posed by fecal pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, should be limited.As a further precaution, WWTPs may consider adding a final disinfection step (often called tertiary treatment) to further reduce the risk posed by viral pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, before spilling. The methods are available for the inactivation of viruses in wastewater effluents and water range from the purely physical (ionizing radiation by gamma rays, non-ionizing radiation by ultraviolet light, photodynamic oxidation and heat) to the purely chemical (chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, iodine, bromine, and bromine chloride). Two treatments such as the addition of chlorine to provide a residue after ozonation can be used to produce finished water free of toxic residues.Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant because it is effective at low concentrations, relatively inexpensive, and forms a residue if applied in sufficient doses. It can be applied as gas or hypochlorite, the gaseous form being the most common. Chlorine gas reacts readily with water to form hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid; the hypochlorous acid produced then Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) form is the main form of chlorine responsible for its disinfecting properties. At neutral and lower pH levels, more HOCl is formed, resulting in greater disinfection capacity at these pH levels. Chlorine in the form of HOCl or OClis the available free chlorine.The combination of HOCl with ammonia and organic compounds in wastewater produces combined chlorine in the form of chloramines. Low-level wastewater disinfection can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-1 (0.5 mg L -1 free chlorine residual), although standard dosage recommendations must be followed (Wang et al., 2005) . Therefore, the safety of drinking water and wastewater depends on the appropriate selection of the disinfectant dose and contact time in the treated environment, which are very important analytical techniques and methods that can detect viruses.Viruses are charged colloidal particles that have the ability to adsorb on surfaces. Their adsorption interaction with solid particles is very important for their behavior in aquatic and soil environments and for their elimination or concentration by water treatment processes (Bitton, 1975) . To control the adsorption of viruses on surfaces, factors such as the type of virus and the relevant surface, pH, electrolytes, and the presence or absence of interfering substances in the suspension medium must be considered (Bitton et al., 1976) .As with all other treatment systems capable of removing viruses from water and effluents, carbon requires continuing study. Although it is not an exciting system for this purpose, carbon does retain viruses. The extent to which it acts as a filter by adsorbing or filtering other materials that adsorb viruses should be investigated.Carbon, of course, is important in the disinfection process because it removes organic compounds that interfere with disinfectants. Carbon may also alter effluent quality in a way that adversely affects disinfection. For example, iron used for coagulation may react in carbon columns and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof subsequently reduce iodine making it unavailable for disinfection. Problems of this kind must always be monitored.Treatment processes are generally unable to remove all viruses from sewage. Research must therefore focus on how best to remove substances that interfere with the disinfection process from effluents and raw waters. Techniques that lead to an increase in pH are of particular interest because strong alkalinity has a destructive effect on viruses. The concentration of viruses entering treatment facilities varies greatly from season to season, from one location to another, and even within 24-hours (Bitton et al., 1976) . Management of virus removal by treatment procedures requires coordination and synchronization of sampling. Quantitative methods of virus concentration must be developed to accurately assess the effectiveness of treatments.The ability of some viruses to survive in disinfected effluent can be problematic (Cromeans et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017) . To overcome this dilemma, one solution is to adopt wastewater treatment technologies that achieve high levels of pathogen inactivation while removing carbon and nutrients. For example, the removal of pathogens (as well as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrient removal) can be achieved by size exclusion using membrane bioreactors (Purnell et al., 2016) . But high membrane costs and frequent fouling limit their large-scale application. The efficient operation of membrane bioreactors is suggested in this regard by filtering coronaviruses attached to suspended solids (Naddeo and Liu, 2020) . Use of electrospun nanofibre membranes, which have the property of attracting the genetic material of viruses, is a potential tool for WBE surveillance (Venugopale et al., 2019) . In addition, pathogens can be reduced by bioabsorption, photodegradation, gravity settling or chemical lysis (Curtis et al., 1992; Curtis, 2003) .The use of Algal-based WWT should also be evaluated. They were introduced in the 1950s to minimize the energy requirements of the activated sludge (AS) process and/or improve secondary effluent to meet nutrient discharge standards. In recent years, algae-based wastewater treatment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof systems have evolved to become sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to conventional, energy-intensive wastewater treatment systems (Rawat et al., 2011; Oswald and Gotaas, 1957 ).These systems have been shown to inactivate pathogens at high levels while removing carbon and nutrients (Young et al., 2016; Buchman, 2014) .The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in a community. The use of wastewater as a disease surveillance tool is not widespread, but it is beginning to grow. Lack of a standardized protocol for monitoring SARS-Cov-2 in wastewater is a major challenge. Detecting viral genetic material in wastewater requires a virus concentration step to enable extraction and detection, but there is limited knowledge on how to do this efficiently for SARS-CoV-2. Understanding how the virus breaks down in the aquatic environment is also critical to assessing risks to human health at present; the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater is unclear. It is possible to use an effective surveillance tool to provide an alert if viral particles rise above thresholds, allowing for quicker action and containing the infection before it spreads at an alarming rate. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f During this period, the authorities may reconsider their recommendations for local irrigation of wastewater. This also requires a renewed effort to promote micro-irrigation technology that can safely irrigate the soil without leaving the farmers and bring fresh produce into direct contact with the wastewater.As the latest data on SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses show, they can survive on different environmental surfaces for hours or days. Accordingly, further research is needed to better understand such differences in persistence duration. In this manner, supports-based these materials can be developed for the treatment of COVID-19 in wastewater.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Biosensors  It enables rapid virus detection (virus detection using lab-on-a-chip methods takes 7 to 16 minutes)  Low-cost analysis  Size of biosensors enables easy transport  Minimize sample and reagent volume  Possibility of intermolecular observations in real time  High sensitivity  No sample pre-treatment  The range of transcription factor promoter pairs available  Transcriptional regulation is rarely a simple process  The antibody binding capacity is strongly dependent on assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature)  The antibody-antigen interaction is generally robust, however, binding can be disrupted by chaotropic reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation Table 1 Lahrich et al.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Morocco","first author","2020-09-10",9

While many clinical trials are currently underway, there is still no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Many countries have, appropriately, implemented lockdowns to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19, as well as preparing healthcare systems to save lives. COVID-19 testing prompts vary from country to country based on local conditions and capacities. In South Africa, people who qualify to be tested for COVID-19 include hospitalized patients with respiratory conditions, contacts of known positive cases, health-care workers and returnee citizens. While in Nigeria testing is targeting travelers into the country with symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulties, and symptomatic persons with known contacts of positive cases or are resident in an area of high COVID-19 prevalence. Egypt has planned to offer COVID-19 testing in all general hospitals. The country has the most numbers of government designated testing sites, 320, compared to 26 and 17 in Nigeria and South Africa,COVID-19 is a novel disease and as such diagnostic kits are being developed, validated and distributed. The lockdowns implemented has affected diagnostic kits productions and supply chains which has impacted availability of testing materials to scale up COVID-19 testing, and Africa is not spared. One of the main challenges faced by laboratories in the continent is that most of the diagnostic infrastructure requires the use of proprietary test materials, which includes reagents, consumables and cartridges 8 . Despite these challenges, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) rolled out a new initiative to improve testing for COVID-19 response across the African continent 3 .The WHO has recommended countries to ramp up testing capacity and availability as widespread accurate testing is essential to contain the virus spread. The efficacy of this strategy is dependent on resource availability (testing kits and healthcare staff) and functional health systems as this impacts the epidemic dynamics and mitigation plans 9 . The COVID-19 test gold J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f standard is the nucleic acid -based real time quantitative PCR, which is expensive cumbersome and requires a high level of expertise 10 . The alternative serological tests are of low sensitivity and specificity and are mostly available in high-income countries 11 . Further, Africa still faces challenges such as low staffing levels and poor referrals systems that are slowing testing 8 In conclusion, we argue that it is not accurate to offer limited testing capacity, poor health systems and under-reporting as the only explanations for the lower numbers of COVID-19 cases reported in Africa. Africa's lower COVID-19 cases can be attributed to early mitigatory responses enhanced by leveraging existing infection control systems, warmer climate, and the general low risk of virus importation from Covid-19 hotspots. A recent surge in cases, in particular South Africa is a cause for concern and so is the winter season that much of Africa is experiencing. As lockdowns and restrictions are slowly being eased or lifted, there is a need to maintain vigilance in education, awareness, testing and resource mobilization for procurement of medical consumables to reduce the transmission of the virus.

It is one of the emerging and reemerging viral outbreaks throughout the world. Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV epidemic in 2003 [2] and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 [3] , while the newly emergent coronavirus, initially referred to as 2019-nCoV and subsequently termed SARS-CoV-2, the disease it produces has been termed COVID-19, which causes respiratory infection and can progress to severe pneumonia and, in a small number of cases, death [4] . Although these coronaviruses were isolated from different human and animal hosts at different times and locations, they all belong to the species severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus [5, 6] .The increasing mortality rate warrants that vulnerable populations in the society be identified and protected. When COVID-19 and other CoV infect women who are pregnant, it increases the risk of adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes and results in severe respiratory disease [5] . Previous data from multiple studies of influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases have demonstrated an increased risk of maternal obstetrical complications when compared with nonpregnant women due to physiological changes occurring during pregnancy [7] . This association has also been previously demonstrated to occur when pregnant women became infected with either of the two pathogenic coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV 2 and MERS-CoV) [8] .Coronavirus infection in pregnant women makes clinical management more difficult by prolonging and complicating the illness and compromises the treatment [9] . Researchers are still in question regarding the transmission of the novel and previous coronavirus infection from a pregnant woman to her fetus, a process termed vertical transmission [10] [11] [12] . There are few published cases of coronavirus disease occurring during pregnancy and due to the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19 and other CoV outbreaks. Due to the alarming spread of CoV outbreaks throughout the world, a comprehensive understanding of the transmission of the virus from mother to fetus in utero like other emerging viral infections as Zika virus and Ebola virus [13, 14] , that can threaten the health and survival of an infected mother and fetus is essential for effective management of the infection and treatment. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the effect of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) during pregnancy and its possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission.A systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the effect of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) during pregnancy and its possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley [15] .All relevant articles were searched without date limits using the following databases: PubMed, Web science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane library, and Science Direct according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) [16] . All searches were limited to article written in English given that such language restriction does not alter the outcome of the systematic reviews and meta-analysis [17] . The gray literature of observational studies was searched through the review of reference lists and input of content experts. We searched scientific publications from 2003 to 2020. All papers published until the end of April 30, 2020, and fulfill the inclusion criteria were considered. The search used the following keywords: coronavirus, novel coronavirus-2019 infection, pregnancy, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, and vertical transmission. We searched all terms with the help of Boolean operators like ""AND"" or ""OR"".Coronavirus infection is more likely to affect pregnant women. Respiratory infectious diseases have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse maternal obstetrical complications than the general population due to physiological changes occurred during pregnancy. None of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero, which may be due to a very low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in early maternal-fetal interface cells. Studies selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality by all authors' independently using the standard critical appraisal instruments of the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) [18] . The disagreements were resolved by consensus.The primary outcome variable of this study was the pregnancy outcomes observed, listed as follows: preterm birth (PTB; either before 37 or 34 weeks of gestation), preeclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, (pPROM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), miscarriage, maternal death, mode of delivery and other clinical feature, laboratory findings and coexisting disease. The secondary outcomes were the perinatal outcomes observed as listed: fetal distress, apgar score < 7 at 5 min, neonatal asphyxia, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), perinatal death, including both stillbirth, and neonatal death, evidence in utero transmission.The data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format, adapted from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), by three authors (KD, EA, and AG), independently extracting all necessary data using an excel spreadsheet form. Then the extracted data were merged for systematic analysis. Any disagreements during the data extraction were resolved through discussion and consensus. The main outcomes extracted from the study were: primary author, study design, publication year, country, patient demographics, maternal and perinatal outcome, and evidence of in utero transmission of coronavirus. All clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with coronavirus, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment options, and data on associated risk factors were extracted by the authors.Following data extraction, systematic review and metaanalysis were carried out using R software version 3.6.1 and STATA statistical software (version 13) with usercontributed commands for meta-analyses: metaprop, metan, metainf, metabias, and metareg [19] . The effect sizes and SEs of the studies were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled estimates of laboratory findings, other clinical features and coexisting diseases among patients with COVID-19 infection. A meta-analysis was also planned to assess the association of various comorbidities and laboratory findings with the severity of disease.The standard error for each original study was calculated using the binomial distribution formula. Evidence for statistical heterogeneity among reported prevalence was using the Cochrane Q-test and I 2 statics [20] . The pooled proportion was estimated by using the back-transform of the weighted mean of the transformed proportions for both the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model [21] . A significance level of P < 0.10 and I 2 > 50% was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity [22, 23] . A potential source of heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis [24] . Where statistical pooling was not possible, the findings were presented in a narrative form including tables and figures to aid in data presentation where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to weigh up the relative influence of each individual study on the pooled effect size using a user-written function, metainf. The presence of publication bias was assessed informally by visual inspection of funnel plots [25] . Point prevalence, as well as 95% confidence intervals, was presented in the forest plot format.Database searches identified a total of 879 articles. From these initial articles, 29 articles were excluded due to duplication. From the remaining 850 articles, 786 articles were excluded after review of their titles and abstracts confirmed nonrelevance to this review. Therefore, 64 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility based on the preset criteria, which resulted in the further exclusion of 25 articles primarily due to the outcome of the interest being not reported in the study. Ultimately, 39 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final review ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). In the current review, 39 articles with a total of 1316 pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed CoV [12, (Table 1) .From commonly reported laboratory findings, lymphocytopenia was the most frequently reported in the three coronavirus infections with prevalence ranged from 63 to 100%, followed by elevated C-reactive protein and leukopenia with prevalence ranged from 45 to 100% (Table 2) .The most common computed tomography imaging features in pregnant women infected with coronaviruses were ground-glass opacity followed by bilateral pneumonia with a prevalence of 65.8% and 57.9%, respectively (Table 3) . In this study, ribavirin and oseltamivir were the most commonly used antiviral therapy used for the treatment of viral pathogens among pregnant women infected with coronaviruses with a prevalence of 65.2% and 56.5%, while the most common antibiotic therapy used for the treatment of common bacterial coinfection was azithromycin with prevalence of 35%. In this study, hydroxychloroquine was the leading drug used by people infected with coronaviruses with a prevalence of 79.7%. From the total coronavirus-infected pregnant women, around 78.8% were treated with oxygen therapy while 18.1% were supported by mechanical ventilation ( Table 3 ).Out of 1316 pregnant women infected with CoV, 46.5% give birth at > 37 weeks of gestation, while the rates of PTB < 34 and < 37 weeks of gestation were 9.5% and 14.3%, respectively. Preeclampsia was reported among 5.9% of pregnant women, while the rate of miscarriage for CoV infection was 14.5%. pPROM and FGR were rated 9.2% and 2.8%, respectively. From the total CoVinfected pregnant women, 31.3% were admitted to ICU from which 2.7% were died. The prevalence of cesarean delivery was 56.9%, while 28.6% had undergone normal delivery. Fetal distress was reported in 26.5%, while neonatal asphyxia was reported in only 1.4% of neonates. Only, 1.2% of neonates had apgar score < 7 at 5 min. Neonate admitted to ICU was rated 11.3%, while the rate of perinatal death was 2.2%. In the current review, none of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero during the follow-up period ( Table 4 ). In our systematic review, different comorbidities that aggravate the infection were found among pregnant women infected with CoV. From the total CoV-infected pregnant women, the rate of gestational diabetes was 9.6%, while hypertension was reported in 8.5% of pregnant women infected with CoV. The rate of asthma in pregnant women infected with CoV was 5.5%, while cardiovascular disease and digestive disease rated 5.7% and 3.6%, respectively ( Table 4 ).In this meta-analysis, MERS-CoV was the most predominant causative agent of severe cases among infected pregnant women with a prevalence of 77% with 95% CI , followed by SARS-CoV rated 48% with 95% CI . According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 was the least causative agent of severe cases among the infectedRadiological finding pregnant women, which rated 25% with 95% CI [7-59] (Fig. 2) .Out of 39 eligible articles, 25 studies [12, reported information on infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 among a total of 1271 pregnancies. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among preterm birth at < 37 and 34 weeks of gestation was 14.3% and 8.9%, respectively, while 46.2% of pregnant women give birth at > 37 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia was reported among 5.7% of pregnant women with COVID-19. pPROM was reported in 8.9%, while the rate of fetal growth restriction was reported in 1.2%. In this study, miscarriage was rated 2.4%. ICUadmitted pregnant women were accounted for 28.5%, while the rate of maternal death was reported in 1.5%. The prevalence of cesarean delivery was 57% (Table 5) . Fetal distress was reported among 25%, while the rate of neonatal asphyxia was 1.6%. The prevalence of Apgar score < 7 at 5 min was 1.4%. The rate of newborns admitted to NICU was 11.6% in which perinatal death was reported among 2.9%. None of the studies reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus in utero during the follow-up period (Table 5) .Out of 35 eligible articles, seven studies [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] reported information on 12 pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV. The prevalence of preterm birth among pregnant women of < 34 weeks of gestation was 33.3%, while 80% of pregnant women give birth at > 37 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia was observed among 5.7% of pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV. ICU-admitted pregnant women accounted for 33.3%, while the rate of maternal death was reported to be 40%. The prevalence of pregnant women given birth by cesarean was 66.7%, while 16.7% of pregnant women underwent normal delivery. Perinatal death was reported among 33.3% of the newborns, while none of the studies reported fetal distress, apgar score < 7 at 5 min, neonatal asphyxia, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. None of the studies reported transmission of MERS-CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero during the follow-up period (Table 5) .Out of 35 eligible articles, seven studies [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] reported information on 33 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV. The prevalence of SARS-CoV among preterm birth < 37 and 34 weeks of gestation was 21.7% and 12%, respectively, while 38.5% of pregnant women give birth at > 37 weeks of gestation. pPROM was reported in 12.5%, while the rate of fetal growth restriction was reported in 12.5%. Miscarriage was reported among 38.1% of pregnant women. ICU admitted pregnant women were accounted for 54.5%, while the rate of maternal death was reported in 12.5%. The prevalence of pregnant women giving birth by cesarean was 50%, while 22.2% of pregnant women underwent normal delivery. The prevalence of fetal distress and perinatal death was 33.3% and 10%, respectively, while none of the studies reported apgar score < 7 at 5 min, neonatal asphyxia and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. None of the studies reported transmission of SARS-CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero during the follow-up period (Table 5) .Subgroup analysis was conducted to justify the cause of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis of the included studies showed that the possible cause of heterogeneity was a sample size difference, especially in SARS-CoV-2 (I 2 = 94%). The funnel plots suggest a publication bias for some of the study of the parameters (P < 0.02).We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the effect of CoV (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) infection on maternal and perinatal, and the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus from pregnant women to the fetus. The rapidly spreading nature of COVID-19 and previous CoV infections could have a significant effect on human health. Thus, attention should be given to pregnant women, and they should be included in preparedness and response plans. In previous outbreaks, clinicians did not volunteer to treat or vaccinate pregnant women because of concerns for fetal safety [64] . The pregnant state, with alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes due to a gravid uterus and slightly immunocompromised state may predispose patients to a more rapidly deteriorating clinical course and face a greater risk of harm if they get respiratory infections.In the current study, the predominant signs and symptoms of hospitalized pregnant women suffering from COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections were viral pneumonia, fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgia. The Centre for disease control listed these symptoms to be the leading clinical feature of patients infected with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses [65] . The high fever after delivery may have resulted from immunity reduction due to fatigue and blood loss in childbirth, anatomy of female genitalia, sweating during puerperium, and postpartum lactation. Once postpartum fever occurred, obstetricians and gynecologists should follow and perform a differential diagnosis to exclude breast swelling, mastitis, urinary tract infections, common colds, and reproductive tract infections must be focused on. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain were also observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. Gestational diabetes and hypertension were the most common coexisting disorders with a prevalence of 9.6% and 8.5%. More than half of the pregnant women infected with coronaviruses were treated by antiviral and antibiotic therapy.In our study, the most frequently reported laboratory findings was lymphocytopenia (66.1%), followed by elevated C-reactive protein marker (56.6%), leukopenia (48.3%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (34.8%). This is similar to previous studies reporting on COVID-19 and other CoV infections [66] [67] [68] [69] . Laboratory findings like leukopenia and lymphocytopenia were helpful to distinguish viral infections from common bacterial infections [70] . The most common computed tomography imaging features in pregnant women with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and bilateral pneumonia with a prevalence of 57.9% and 65.8%, respectively. The pathological basis of these changes could be due to inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial thickening, cell exudation, and hyaline membrane formation. The most common treatment options used were hydroxychloroquine (79.7%), ribavirin (65.2%), oseltamivir (56.5%) and azithromycin (35%) to treat common bacterial pathogens when secondary infections occurred and treat viral pathogens. Among CoVinfected pregnant women, oxygen therapy was 78.8%.Based on the findings of the present study, higher prevalence of COVID-19 and other CoV was reported among preterm birth < 37 weeks of gestation. According to some studies report, infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy can cause complications for both the mother and the fetus [59, 71] . This includes preeclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and miscarriage. Large numbers of CoV-infected pregnant women with severe cases were admitted to the intensive care unit which even There is much controversy relating to the possibility of in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. Multiple samples were obtained at the time of labor and delivery to test for the presence of coronavirus by qRT-PCR, including amniotic fluid aspirated from the vagina during labor, cord blood, and segments of the umbilical cord, fetal membranes, and placenta, neonatal nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, gastric aspirate and meconium samples tested negative for the coronaviruses, suggesting there was no evidence of vertical transmission in women who developed COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia in late pregnancy [12, 63, 72] . Studies conducted in London [73] reported a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pharyngeal swab sample 36 h after birth, it was subsequently confirmed that qRT-PCR testing of the placenta and cord blood was negative for SARS-CoV-2, it is believed that the mother or a family member transmitted the infection to the infant through close contact after delivery, not in utero through placenta [39, 74] .In the current study, the systematic testing procedures for coronavirus infection, including chest radiograph and serial RT-PCR assays with multiple clinical samples did not demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in the newborn. CoV antibody tests were performed with mother and newborn sera. In some mothers' , sera immunoglobulin G was detected by using serological tests. However, CoV antibodies for IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in none of the newborn's blood samples [55, 75] . Therefore, there is no evidence of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV from mother to newborn infants. This may be due to a very low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in early maternal to fetal interface cells [76] . The virus can be transmitted through close contact or droplets to a new born after birth [73] . Thus, mothers and their neonates should be taken care of in isolated rooms to prevent neonatal transmission and effective protection measures should be implemented during delivery and postdelivery care to prevent transmission of the virus from mothers to the newborn.Only English articles or reports were considered for this review. The small number of cases in some of the included studies, the study design, and the lack of standardized criteria were the major limitations of this systematic review. Additionally, there is a possibility that some patients were included in more than 1 report, although all authors independently reviewed all the included studies, carefully focusing on the different institutions reporting outcomes. We included case reports and case series, thus facing a higher risk of publication bias, which could affect the estimated outcome. Furthermore, lack of denominator in case series used in this review is the other major factor that affects the estimated outcome. Moreover, when focusing on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and particularly perinatal outcomes, reported data are intuitively limited to a very short-term followup period and thus infections that occurred proximate to the delivery. This has the potential to overestimate the magnitude of risks such as PTB and underestimate more longitudinal risks such as FGR. In some of the studies, we did not find standardized criteria and timing of delivery of pregnancies affected by CoV infection.In general, based on the published data collected, fever, cough, and myalgia were the most common clinical features, while the predominant abnormal laboratory findings reported were lymphocytopenia and C-reactive protein. Bilateral pneumonia and ground-glass opacity were the most common radiological abnormal findings. Oxygen therapy was the most common treatment option used while bacterial coinfection was treated by antibiotics therapy, and viral pathogen was treated by antiviral therapy. Among the coronavirus species, MERS-CoV was the leading cause of severe cases in infected pregnant women. Pregnant women infected with coronaviruses are at increased risk of adverse obstetrical outcomes, compared with the general population. The infection outcome was mainly associated with a relatively higher rate of cesarean delivery, preterm birth, intensive care unit admission, preeclampsia, miscarriage, fetal distress, and perinatal death. None of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero. This may be due to a very low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in early maternal-fetal interface cells as suggested by different experts.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-09-04",9

[3] [4] [5] Given the clinical and viral sequence homologue between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, it has recently been used for the treatment of severely infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 disease. 6 The transfusion of CS is associated with diminished viral load, serum cytokine response, length of hospital stays, and death. 7 One of the presumable explanations for this success is the presence of neutralizing antibodies (Nab) because an increment of virus-specific Nab titer and vanishing of viremia was observed. 6 Besides, the antibody response to some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 has a detrimental role, the state of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). It is not only been the most frequently mentioned challenge during infections but also in the area of antibody therapy or antibody-based vaccines. 8 Among antibody types, the presence of IgG antibodies to S and N protein is being used as a diagnostic and indicative of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9 Moreover, the high level of this antibody is correlated with worsen clinical outcome. 10 In contrast, the majority of patients who recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited a high level of neutralizing antibodies. 11 However, it is not clearly described whether high-level IgG is correlated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection or not. 12 As reported from a clinical trial, there are antibodies with or without ADE effect, although the classes or subclasses are not characterized. 13 Remarkably, the IgG response that comprises IgG2 mostly appeared lower activation of innate immune cells, such as neutrophil, and complement pathway. 14 However, the activation of these cells, and the corresponding hyper-production of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), was correlated to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) and death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 15 This indicates the induction of IgG2 may reduce the ADE.Furthermore, the class-switching of IgG2 is enhanced by IFN-γ. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is the frequent target for COVID-19 vaccines under different lines of clinical trials. 16 Therefore, S based vaccines with the IFN-γ encoding gene, along with ensuring the high level of IgG2 antibodies could have paramount importance for immune-related disease, including COVID-19. However, there is a lack of data on defining the role of IgG2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. In this review, we aimed to discuss the role of IgG2 in reducing the effect of ADE and its function towards modulating immune-pathologies associated with COVID-19 disease.Antibodies are serum proteins, capable of a bind and neutralize heterogeneous strains of a given pathogen with highly unstable immunogenicity. 17 In addition to the clearance of free virus and block new infection, they are also involved in the expedite of infected cell clearance, as observed in vivo trial for HIV infection. 18 This is also demonstrated in mouse model SARS-CoV, where antibody induces antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated lysis of infected cells mediated via interaction with phagocytes, such as macrophages. 19 Beyond this, antibodies are introduced in therapeutic era and effective for treatment of many infectious and non-infectious diseases, 20 discussed later in this review.The antibody therapies, including convalescent sera and immunoglobulin therapy, are not without drawbacks, and the most frequent scenario is an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Antibodies are supposed to control the spread and prevention of infection. Instead, preexisting antibodies augment the internalization of the virus into the host cells, which is an alternative way of immune-mediated viral infection, called ADE. Many viruses, including dengue, HIV, Ebola, and influenza A take advantage of ADE as a means of infecting host cells. The precise mechanism of ADE is yet undefined. The most frequently mentioned mechanism is linked to the binding of virus bound antibody to Fc receptors on the surface of immune cells, activates them, and also complement pathway. 21 ADE has also been observed in SARS-CoV infection particularly by antibodies against S protein. The Fc portion of anti-S antibodies have been shown to activate and infect immune cells, including monocytes, macrophage, and B cells via FcRs, which promote inflammation and tissue injury. 22 This mechanism of infection was independent of utilizing the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV -2. 23 These evidences indicate several factors would come into consideration to wipe out the effect of ADE while keeping antibodies ability to neutralize the virus and protects the host. These may include the concentration, avidity, affinity, and isotypes of the antibodies.It is well known that each isotype of antibodies has distinct effector functions. Generally, the IgG response that involves the IgG2 subclass is associated with a noninflammatory response. 14 Despite that IgG2 usually participates in protection against carbohydrate antigens like bacterial capsular polysaccharide, it is also involved in response to protein antigens. 24 Its effector function is largely mediated by activating the FcγRIIa (CD32) receptor, and the IgG deficiency has been linked to the susceptibility of some diseases, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections, 25 and the failure to develop immunity when vaccination for Hib. 26 Apart from the effect of antibody isotypes, genetic variation in FcRs can also affect the interaction of FcRs with IgG subclasses, and thereby alter the effector function to whether pathologic or immune protection. For instance, allelic polymorphisms in the FcγRIIa are associated with the sever course of SARS-CoV. 27 In addition to bacterial infections, the role of IgG2 has been also described in viral infections, such as HIV, where HIV infected children displayed selective deficiency of IgG2 with a normal level of total IgG. 28 The high level of IgG2 is very uncommon in HIV, as the class-switching is highly inhibited by the virus. 29 However, the high level of IgG2 antibodies to Gp41 was inversely correlated with HIV disease progression. 30 In SARS-CoV infection, a study showed that individuals with FcγRIIa that can bind only IgG2 have shown less severe as compared to individuals with FcγRIIa that bind to both IgG1 and IgG2. 27 Furthermore, although the antibodies' response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully elucidated, various studies reported the seroconversion of IgM and IgG, which reaches the peak level within 14 days of infection. 31 It remains to be determined that the presence of these antibodies have a protective role or not.The infection with SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by hyper-expression of cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IP-10, along with chemokines, such as IP-10, with a higher level in those who are severely ill. [32] [33] [34] Viral infections are usually mediated by Th1 response; however elevated Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10, are also reported in COVID-19 patients. 35 Consequently, the appearance of ""cytokine storm"", this is where cytokines are produced in higher amounts. The cytokine storm is linked to heightened inflammatory responses, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD), and even death. 15 Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 provokes the seroconversion for IgG and IgM in the majority of infected patients after 2 weeks of symptoms onset. 31 The antibodies are produced against the spike (S) followed by nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The high level of anti-N IgG is found from non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, while the anti-S IgG in patients who require ICU. 36 Also, the appearance of IgG on day 7 and stronger titer is correlated with delayed viral clearance and COVID-19 disease severity. 37, 38 This indicates there is a likelihood of ADE involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 39 In both SARS and MERS, pre-existing anti-S IgG antibodies, particularly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses shown to facilitate uptake of the virus, and infection of macrophages, monocytes, and B cells. These antibodies also activate complement via complement receptor and cause ADE, which was linked to the occurrence of cytokine storm. 40 It needs to be determined whether IgG subclasses have a determinantal or beneficial effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, followed by vaccination with immunodominant peptides has induced a combination of IgG antibodies with neutralization and ADE effects. Notably, from these antibodies, IgG2 exclusively belongs to only neutralization, whereas IgG1 and other subclasses were with both neutralization and ADE effects. 13 This indicates, unlike IgG1, IgG4, and IgG3, IgG2 response is related to the minimal effect of ADE.The production of IgG2 is enhanced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFNs are the crucial innate immune defense against viral infections, particularly in the early stages. 41 However, in cases of SARS and MERS, studies have demonstrated delayed expression and production of type I IFN, and thereby delay the overall host antiviral response. 42 In SARS-CoV-2, contradictory results are reported. The earlier study showed the low level of innate anti-viral defense, including the level of type I IFN, 43 while a recent study reported the hyperexpression of interferon stimulating genes (ISGs). 32 Further, a very low level of IFN-I is found in critically ill patients, 44 with a high viral load. More specifically, the variable pattern of IFN-α, low level of IFN-γ, and undetectable IFN-β and λ were observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. 34 Besides, early administration of IFN-I prevented lung inflammation in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. 45 In vitro, the greater sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to type I IFN was recorded, as compared to SARS-CoV. 46 At the cellular level, diminished frequency of IFN-γ + natural killer and CD8 T-cells is reported. 33 Despite the controversy, it seems clear that the lack of IFN-I has a great impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising the possibility that the early administration of IFN-I is valuable for infected patients.Due mainly to the high avidity and specificity, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been selected as an alternative therapeutic option, to CS therapy. Several mAbs are commercially available for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune, and infectious disease. The majority of these Abs are human IgG1 subclass. 20 In improving the safety, several efforts have been made to tailor the properties of mAbs, including modification or removal of Fc induced effectors, with an affinity similar to the whole mAb. 47 These efforts include the preparation of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and the Fc engineered antibodies. scFvs are small-sized and lack the Fc region, enabling in DovePress tissue penetration and rapid clearance from circulation, since the interaction with Fc receptors (like neonatal FcR) affects the half-life. Therefore, these fragments are not only targets but also fused to many molecules, such as drugs, radionuclides for cancer treatment, enzymes for improved drug delivery, and also viruses for gene therapy. 48 Currently, the use of a single or combination of mAb for COVID-19 is under the first phase of human trials. 49 Despite scFvs are less costly and flexible in use, the halflife is relatively fewer than Fc engineered mAbs. The Fc is engineered, in some time to enhance effector functions and increase the half-life. Another time, the reduction of functions, such as ADCC is required, along with half-life. 47 Among the Fc engineering to reduce effector functions, a cross-subclass approach that involves IgG2 to IgG4 resulted in undetectable complement-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in experimental models. 50, 51 Therefore, an antibody therapy that contains mAb of which its Fc is modified to reduce the effector functions and increased half-life, adverse consequences of the therapy, such as ADE, could be declined. Moreover, although IgG2 based therapy has not been applied for coronaviruses, seems it shares these features without modification and might be a preferable target, as mentioned in Figure 1 .Given the above shreds of evidence, one can assume that therapies targeted to IFN-γ and IgG2 might help harness the aggressive inflammatory reactions, such as SARS-CoV -2. Among the different approaches of vaccine designs, the subunit vaccine has a long history of success for viral infections, including the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine ImmunoTargets and Therapy 2020:9(rDNA). 52 Usually, designing of vaccine or immunotherapy anticipated in targeting the surface molecules limits the anchoring of microbes into cellular receptors. 53 Nowadays, vaccines for COVID-19 are under fast development, which is mainly based on the experiences of SARS and MERS vaccines. The majority of these targets S glycoprotein, and coffered better immunogenicity. 16 These include vectored recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5), virus-like nanoparticles, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, and only the receptorbinding domain (RBD) portion of S based vaccine. [53] [54] [55] The virus-like nanoparticle and Ad5 vaccines induced a high level of IgG antibodies after 35 and 28 days of vaccination, respectively. 53 Despite the debate in the optimization of S-glycoprotein whether to use full length or RBD region, and the progress is still on Phase I clinical, considerable efficacy has been recorded, which is primarily mediated by antibodies.The S glycoprotein, chemically composed of protein and carbohydrate, and B cells response to carbohydrate antigens usually render the class-switching of IgG2. 24 Compare to other subclasses, the IgG2 antibody has a lower affinity to FcγRIIa, which is expressed by neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil, monocytes, and dendritic cells. 56 Consequently, the low level of activation of these cells could be attributable to low inflammatory response than high activation. The high level of IgG2 antibodies produces low activation of the complement pathway, and inhibition of complement activation is correlated with the reduced pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, such as reduced viral load, neutrophilia in lungs, and reduced systemic inflammation. 57 Furthermore, protection from a disease has also been recorded, where there is higher production of IgG2 against the glycoprotein of Maedi-visna virus in sheep. 58 While, the immune complex of IgG4 that binds to FcγRIIa has shown to cause cytokine storm, in anti-CD28 IgG4 therapy. 59 In addition to focusing on the S region and targeting IgG, incorporating molecules with immune-potentiation outcomes might add extra value for the success of COVID-19 vaccines. For instance, insertion of the IFN-γ gene. It is well known that the class-switching of antibodies highly depends on the cytokine milieu. IFN-γ induces the class-switching of IgG2, at the same level of inhibition of IL-4 induced production of IgG1. 60 In a randomized clinical trial, the vaccination with rFPV that encoding HIV Gag-Pol and IFN-γ results in the production of IgG2 antibodies to P24 antigen, and these antibodies exhibited control of HIV replication in HIV patients. 61 Further, a in HIV clinical trial showed, the transfer of recombinant CD4-IgG2 antibody successfully reduced HIV viral load. 62 Similarly, in pig and human model of inflammation, IgG1 therapy with a hybrid Fc portion, which consists of sequences from human IgG2 and IgG4 considerably reduced the inflammatory response. 63 In a recent study, potent neutralizing antibodies are identified from SARS-CoV-2 recovered human donors, and the passive transfer establishes protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. 64 So, it may reasonable to consider IgG2 in designing not only antibody therapies but also vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.Overall, the effectiveness of clinical trials with vaccine or immunotherapy for COVID-19 may be enhanced through incorporating genes encoding IFN-γ, while keeping the high level of IgG2 antibody. More specifically, the vaccine-induced IgG2 antibody needs to be assessed in the process of clinical trials for S glycoprotein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The limited effector functions of IgG2 could improve the safety of the vaccine, by reducing ADE. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of anti-S IgG2 may contribute to the prophylaxis and/or recovery of COVID-19 patients. Although targeting the S glycoprotein has already been established, an experimental study on the enrichment of IgG2 class-switching by IFN-γ and/or other molecules is warranted when designing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.ADE, antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; FcγR-IIa, Fc gamma receptor II A; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IFN-γ, interferongamma; IgG, immunoglobulin G; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2.All authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether that is in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, or in all these areas; took part in drafting, revising orcritically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.ImmunoTargets and Therapy is an international, peer-reviewed open access journal focusing on the immunological basis of diseases, potential targets for immune based therapy and treatment protocols employed to improve patient management.

It is a highly infectious disease with severe respiratory symptoms in many cases that may lead to death. The World Health Organization (WHO) considered it a pandemic and published guide for all countries for protection and treatment with a changeable protocol according to the situation. 1, 2 The presence of the virus in body secretions such as saliva, nasal secretions and tears (eyes) is confirmed; however, its transmission through the conjunctiva is still under investigation, though its presence in the conjunctiva enforces the possibility of its transmission through the eye, especially to ophthalmologists. 3 Although great concern has been declared to COVID-19 infection acquired through ocular transmission, the underlying mechanism of this transmission has not currently been clarified. 4 Few previous studies have evaluated ophthalmological signs and symptoms in patients infected with SARS-CoV -1 and SARS-CoV-2. A few studies have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tear fluid. 5 Many ophthalmologists worldwide are infected during routine or emergency practice, as recorded by their health authorities. The infection may be due to eye route, droplets, breath or others. 6 The proximity between the ophthalmologist and the patient raises the chance of infection. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients' tears with or without ocular symptoms suggests contamination through the conjunctiva in the maneuvers needing intimate conjunctival evaluation or direct contact with the conjunctiva; however, the possibility of transmission by other routes is still present. 7, 8 Recommendations for ophthalmologists to have protective measures to avoid infections, emergency practice only, telemedicine for suitable cases, and strict personal protective equipment are recommended by the WHO and the American Academy of Ophthalmology AAO; otherwise, many ophthalmologists in the world could be infected with deficiency in ophthalmology health-care services affecting the population besides the fatal pandemic. 9, 10 The aim of this study was to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the conjunctival tears and secretions of positive confirmed patients.A case series study that included 28 positive COVID-19 patients confirmed with nasopharyngeal swab in the period 18-28 May 2020 at Sohag Tropical Medicine Hospital.Hospitalized patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 were examined using a portable slit lamp or by-side examination (more used) for ocular manifestations and then were recorded. Conjunctival swabs were taken and examined by (RT-PCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.Full ethical considerations were followed and comprehensive written informed consent was taken from all involved patients in this study. The present study adhered to the tenants of Helsinki Declaration and ethical board committee. The approval of our institution (Sohag Faculty of Medicine) was obtained with ethical committee number: IBR# S20-129.This study did not include children but only adult patients. The patients did not bear any expenses for the conjunctival swabs.Conjunctival swabs were taken after a time interval of 3 days after admission due to respiratory symptoms to ensure the presence of higher viral load levels to be detected by (RT-PCR). [11] [12] Personal protective equipment (PPE) used for tear film swabs was the same as personal protective equipment, which was used for handling Kit reagents, PPE included gloves, eye protection and lab coats. Conjunctival swabs were taken from samples of the inferior conjunctival sac 13 and collected by Virus specimen transport For Molecular and Culture Techniques (Sigma Virocult ® ) ( Figure 1A ) it was done through eversion of the lower eyelids by sterile cotton tips to explore the lower fornices of the eye. Topical anesthesia was not used, and the tips of the sterile sticks were placed into liquid Virocult ® medium. Sterile gloves were used and changed between patients to avoid contamination risk either for the samples or patients. Samples were put on ice and rapidly transmitted to the PCR laboratory. Virus specimen transport for molecular and culture techniques.Qualitative (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV -2 viral RNA 14, 15 RNA Extraction SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was extracted using a fully automated QIAcube instrument and using specific kits; Qiagen columns (QIAamp DSP Virus spin kit, cat. No. 61704, QIagen Inc.) ( Figure 1C The real-time cycler conditions were performed according to the following conditions: reverse transcription at 55°C for 10 min and then at 95°C for 2 min to activate the Taq enzyme (initial denaturation) followed by 45 amplification cycles. The cycle consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds, primer annealing and extension at 60°C for 60 seconds.The oligonucleotide primers and probe for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were selected from the orf1ab genome region. The supplied primer/probe mix was designed for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (probe labeled with FAM fluorophore) and the supplied genesig ® Easy RNA internal Extraction control (ICEspecific probe labeled with HEX fluorophore).The sensitivity of the Coronavirus test CE IVD genesig ® kit included detection of 0.58 copies/µL of COVID-19 viral RNA with a confidence ≥95%. This concentration therefore serves as the limit of detection of the kit. As regards the test specificity; this was assessed with in silico sequence comparison analyses and in vitro specimen testing. In silico analysis of the genesig ® (RT-PCR) Coronavirus (COVID-19) CE IVD design was found to detect all COVID-19 virus strains and exhibited no crossreactivity with non-COVID-19 species.Data were collected and recorded.A total of 28 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. (Figure 2A ), subconjunctival hemorrhage ( Figure 2B ) and conjunctival hyperemia ( Figure 2C ). General and chest manifestations, ranging from mild to severe manifestations (examined by intensive care and chest specialists) along with the presence of conjunctival manifestations and (RT-PCR) results are shown in (Table 1) The Coronaviridae virus family consists of enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand RNA genome that is capped and polyadenylated. 16 The serology of each type is characterized by a specific host range and genome sequence. The most pathogenic form of the types of coronaviruses is SARS-CoV, which causes life-threatening pneumonia. 17 The pandemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 resulted in the suspension or sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities considered non-urgent. There are currently littleshared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in ophthalmic operating rooms due little data about virus transmission through ocular secretions. 18 A few previous researches have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tear fluid in patients. 19 Our research suggests that COVID-19 patients, who have ocular manifestations or not, can shed RNA in their conjunctival secretions and tears. It is not related to the presence of the symptoms or signs either general or ocular.The results of the current study showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swabs of patients with COVID-19 in 28.5% of patients. Published reports have shown that RNA shedding can occur in asymptomatic patients, which may be a very dangerous source of infection for ophthalmologists and other people. 3 A previous study reported that unprotected eyes were associated with a high risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-1. 20 This result enforces our current results due to the similarity between the two viruses.In a study by Xia J et al, 21 they assessed the presence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in tears and conjunctival secretions of COVID-19-infected patients. Only two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from one patient with conjunctivitis and showed positive (RT-PCR) results, while fifty-eight samples from other patients were all negative.Moreover, in a study by Seah IYJ et al, 22 they assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by viral isolation and quantitative (RT-PCR) analysis in seventeen COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, their results showed that all samples (64 samples) showed negative results for SARS-CoV-2 on viral isolation and (RT-PCR).In previous studies, 3,20-22 the positive rate of the virus detected in the conjunctival sac did not exceed 10%, while in the present study, the positive rate was close to 30%. This can be interpreted due to several factors, such as differences in race, hygiene practices, 23 the weather such as humidity and ultraviolet exposure, or whether there is a possibility of virus mutation. Many studies showed there is a correlation between environmental factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, other studies did not support that. [24] [25] [26] so, further studies are needed in the future to confirm the results of the current study. In 2 case reports, 27,28 bilateral follicular conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 positive patient with positive ocular swabs were documented. These reports suggest that tears can be a potential source of infection early in the course of the disease and that the conjunctiva may sustain viral RNA replication for a longer period of time.Although RNA was detected in the conjunctival secretions, more researches are still needed to get rid of the logistic problems in specimen taking and RNA study of the conjunctiva of COVID-19 patients.In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 could be found through tears and conjunctival secretions in COVID-19 patients with or without conjunctivitis. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.(RT-PCR), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome.The article has not been presented in a meeting.

SA's public healthcare sector is government funded but under-resourced, supporting approximately 85% of the population. The private healthcare sector, paid through medical aid schemes and individuals is well-resourced, catering for the remaining 15% population. 10 News reports indicate that the private healthcare sector may accommodate COVID-19 patients from the public health sector at an agreed price. 11, 12 Background The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus resulted in an increased need for medical imaging services and stringent infection control practices. 19 Radiographers working through the SARS outbreak, experienced SARS as being stressful. Low staff morale, inadequate infection control and poor risk management skills were highlighted as contributing factors. However, after the outbreak, radiographers found the experience to be a valuable opportunity to reflect on their role as radiographers, radiography practice and professionalism. 19 Seventeen years later, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a similar impact on medical imaging services. Chest computed tomography (CT), lung ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chest radiographs, performed by radiographers, play a pivotal supportive role in the diagnosis, management and treatment of COVID-19. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] As a result, medical imaging departments had to introduce new work flow and operations. Measures included the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing and stringent equipment sanitization. Staff allocations were also amended to mitigate spread among staff while ensuring continued service. Infection of staff would mean that the workload on remaining staff would increase. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Besides these changes to the working environment, enforced lockdown protocols resulted in furloughs, loss of jobs, reduced work hours and children needing to be schooled at home. [32] [33] [34] Adjusting to this new way of work and life has resulted in emotional, physical, financial and mental stress. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The impact of these multitude of changes needs to be explored. Therefore, this study undertook to explore diagnostic radiographers' experience of COVID-19. The study was conducted in Gauteng, SA. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Method A qualitative approach using an open-ended online questionnaire was used to explore Gauteng's diagnostic radiographers' experiences of COVID-19. 40 Diagnostic radiographers (hereafter referred to as radiographers) employed in Gauteng, SA were purposively sampled. 40 Demographic data was obtained and answers to a single J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f question: ""How has your experience been during COVID-19?"" underwent thematic analysis. Radiographers' responses were read and reread to obtain a general sense of the information; the data was coded and categorised and then themes were generated.Due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing face to face interviews, telephonic or video calls could have been used, but considering changes to radiographers' work and home life, the option to have an online open-ended questionnaire was favoured.Asynchronous qualitative online, open-ended questionnaires are not commonly used for qualitative research 41 but were selected for use in this study so as not to burden participants in time-locked obligations. 42 Radiographers choosing to participate in the study could do so at any time they found suitable without being burdened by contact at a specific time. Also invitations to participate in the study asked radiographers to share their experiences in as little or as many words as they liked. Written responses allow for self-reflection and focused answers. 43 Measures of trustworthiness included member checking and reflexivity to ensure credibility. 40,44 Themes were shared with radiographers that participated in the study to establish if it portrayed the truth value of their experience of COVID-19. 40,44 The authors kept research diaries of their own to allow continuous reflection. 40, 44 Dependability and transferability of the study was ensured by a detailed description of results along with providing direct quotations from participants. 40,43,44 Confirmability of a study is ensured by an audit trail. 40,44 Questionnaire responses from the study is preserved to allow for independent auditing. 44 Ethical clearance and consent to conduct the study were obtained (REC-524-2020).Diagnostic radiographers were invited to participate in the study through email and messaging applications as well as through the head of radiology departments. Data collection continued until data saturation was achieved. Sixty radiographers from Gauteng's public and private sector responded to the questionnaire. Both sectors were represented in the study with 31 radiographers working in public hospitals, 27 working in private hospitals and the remaining 2 radiographers working in both public and private hospitals.The study information letter outlined the purpose of the study as well as provided the opportunity for radiographers to express their experiences of COVID-19 without The demographic data of participants is presented in Radiographers' responses to the question """"How has your experience been during COVID-19?"" were read and reread to obtain a general sense of the data. The data was then coded and categorised yielding three themes: New work flow and operations, effect on radiographer well-being and radiographer resilience.Medical imaging departments' operations were affected by the decrease in imaging referrals at the onset of the lockdown. 49 Even though it has been viewed as an opportunity to address ""overuse and overdiagnosis"" 50 , the reduction in imaging referrals, has resulted in some radiographers in the private sector experiencing pay cuts:J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ""…since the lockdown patients were advised not to come to the hospital unnecessarily and with that in private sector, we were affected economically. Less patient=less profit to the company then salaries we cut off"" R34Radiographers' experiences confirm the introduction of new work flow and operations as well as the need to conform to new changes. [26] [27] [28] [29] The quotes below convey radiographers' experiences of the changes: ""During this pandemic we've also had to work extended hours at the hospital (12 hour shifts for 7 days and then 7 days off which I feel also adds to the exhaustion."" R10 ""…So my experience has been okay and at times difficult as we divided ourselves into teams"" R7Comparably, worldwide medical imaging departments have adapted operations to mitigate cross-contamination and staff shortages. [26] [27] [28] However, an 84 hour work week as indicated by R10, despite the time off, constitutes prolonged working hours.Prolonged working hours raise concern of health and safety as well as increasing the risk of respiratory disease. 54, 55 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fRadiographers shared their experience of medical imaging departments implementing stringent infection control measures that affected work flow and operations. [26] [27] [28] 56 Their responses ranged from having access to sufficient PPE to lack of PPE; lack of disinfectants as well as delayed testing and provision of results. 60 Radiographers' experiences of infection control measures are shared through these direct quotes:""… At least we have PPE."" Radiographers routinely wear gloves and practice handwashing in daily practice however now continuous use of masks and face shields was described as ""stifling"" and as ""not being able to breathe properly"". 34 Radiographers describe being sad, terrified, confused, stressed, scared, exhausted, anxious, overwhelmed, frustrated, uncertain and panicked. Their ""roller coaster"" of mixed emotions has stirred up an ""emotional war"" draining them emotionally, physically, financially and mentally. [33] [34] [35] Seeing patients out of breath, deteriorate, being ventilated and dying; in the same way, seeing colleagues falling ill and some dying, take a toll on radiographer's mental health. Radiographer's mental health is marauded even further by not being able to see family and friends coupled with the anxiety of contracting and transmitting the disease. [33] [34] [35] There is also the notion that healthcare workers are not human and therefore should cope. 28 These descriptions are reflected in the following quotes: Yet some radiographers report being told that ""staff"" are overreacting. During the SARS epidemic radiographers were motivated through the crisis by reassurance. 57""I, for one know that at work, we were often told ""staff is overreacting"" so I fought this and I felt a lot of emotional and mental strain on myself"" R51 Not being considered frontline workers, a concern echoed by professional bodies impacts allocation of resources as well as radiographers' well-being: [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] ""It has been rather negative, as we do not get proper personal protective equipment (PPE), we are not recognized as Frontline workers, and we are not considered by our hospital."" R48 ""Very nerve wrecking. It's a learning curve so you have to be on guard all the time. Being a radiographer, you are essential but not considered total frontline. With everyone testing the waters it's difficult to have proper guidelines."" R15There was also concern about the volumes of COVID-19 information. Information overload coupled with misinformation and conspiracies results in psychological distress. 65, 66 ""At the beginning there was very limited factual information about the virus itself and an overload of information about different theories/conspiracies about covid-19 and this has in turn resulted in so much confusion and difficulty to find the path of how to deal with the situation and find a way forward.There were many arguments and different opinions of how one should go about doing things."" R51South African radiographers already work in stressful environments that is now exacerbated by COVID-19. 67 Despite the impact of changes and the burden on their well-being, experiences shared by radiographers reveal their ability to find the positives even in these anomalous times.These experiences indicate an initiation of strategies towards resilience.Radiographers in Gauteng, SA are exposed to the highest number of COVID J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","South Africa","abstract","2020-09-18",9

Africa had a slow progression of the disease at the beginning of the disease, earlier 2020, but the continent had rising cases in the middle of the year, 2020, with 895 696 confirmed cases and 16 713 deaths as of 10 th August, 2020. Malawi at this time of the year had recorded 5193 confirmed cases and 163 deaths (UNICEF Malawi, 2020b). The first three cases of COVID-19 were recorded on 2 nd April, 2020 (UNICEF Malawi, 2020a).Understanding disease space and time dynamics is important for the epidemiologists as with space distribution, the hot spot areas are marked for intervention. In addition, possible drivers of the epidemic in those hot spots are suggested for further scientific investigation. Regarding temporal distribution, times with high disease risk are also identified which gives crew to possible causes including, in particular, seasonal changes. A number of studies on spatial temporal distribution of COVID-19 have been conducted (Chen et Ye and Hu, 2020) . The majority of these though have used the geographical information system (GIS) technology as compared to statistical modelling using spatial temporal models. A few studies that have used the statistical approach to spatial temporal analysis to my knowledge are Gayawan et al (2020) who used the Possion hurdle model to take into account excess zero counts of COVID-19 cases, Briz-Redon and Serrano Aroca (2020) who used the separable random effects model with structured and unstructured area and time effects, and Chen et al (2020) who used the inseparable spatial temporal model. In addition, in Africa, spatial temporal analysis of COVID-19 cases has been limited (Gawayan et al, 2020; Arashi et al, 2020; Adeneknle et al, 2020) as of 9 th August. In Malawi, at the time of this study, no study on spatial temporal distribution of COVID-19 cases had been spotted. Only one study that focused on prediction of COVID-19 cases using mathematical models was seen (Kuunika, 2020) . The aim of this study was to determine the spatial temporal trends of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Malawi while using the spatial temporal statistical models. The objectives of the study were:• To establish the estimated or predicted risk trend by geographical location • To estimate the temporal risk trend of COVID-19 by geographical location.The study used the publicly available districts' COVID-19 confirmed daily cases data for Malawi which was extracted from the Malawi data portal website (https://malawi.opendataforafrica.org) after registering with the portal. The total population, population density, and percentage of people with running water data for each district were also extracted from the same data portal. The population size for each district was used as the expected number of people to be infected in each district. Population density and percentage of people with running water in each district were taken as covariates. Though the cases started to be recorded on 2 nd April, 2020, the extracted data for COVID-19 cases used for spatial temporal modelling in this study, only covered the period from 24 th June to 20 th August. This was the case, considering that COVID-19 daily cases for the districts were only available from 24 th June on the portal. The study period was divided into six weeks as follows: Descriptive analysis involved the time series plot of the cumulative confirmed cases and those who had died of COVID-19 for the whole country from the beginning of the epidemic to the time this study was conducted, that is, 20 th August, 2020. It also involved bivariate correlation of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their potential covariates, that is, population size, population density and percentage of people with running water in each district. The potential covariates would be selected for further multiple variable modelling if their p-values were less than 0.20. After the descriptive analysis, the multiple variable spatial temporal models were fitted in R using the Bayesian approach while using the integrated nested laplace approximations (INLA where it η is the predictor specified asσ , and the structured random effects were assigned the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) according to Besag (1991) , that is,. The weakness of model A is the linearity assumption on the effect of time on the relative risk of the disease. To take a more flexible approach on the effect of time, nonlinear spatial temporal models were also explored. The predictor, it η for the nonlinear spatial temporal model for the time effect is specified as follows:and let it be denoted by B. The i u and i v in the model are the area level unstructured and structured effects respectively as defined in (1), and t γ and t β are the unstructured and structured temporal effects. The unstructured time effects was modelled by the independent normal distribution with zero mean, that is, ) , 0 ( 2 λ σ γ N t and the structured temporal effects were assigned the first order random walk prior distribution defined as:A second order random walk was also explored in case the data would show a more pronounced linear trend. The second order random walk is defined as:The last term in (2), it δ , represents the interaction between area and time. Four forms of interaction between space and time are possible according to Knorr-Held (2000) . The first form of interaction assumes interaction between the unstructured region effect ( i u ) and the unstructured temporal effect ( t γ ) (denote it by model B 1), and in this case the interaction effect is assigned the independent normal distribution, that is,The second type of interaction, is the interaction of structured area effect ( i v ) and the unstructured temporal effect ( t γ ) (denote it by model B 2). This form of interaction assumes conditional intrinsic (CAR) distribution for the areas for each time independently from all the other times. The third is the interaction between unstructured area effect ( i u ) andThe prior for the random walk variance was the gamma (1, 0.0005). The intercept was assigned the default normal, N (0, 0). The model choice was by the deviance information criteria (DIC) as proposed by Spiegelhalter et al (2002) , where a smaller DIC means a better model in terms of fit and complexity. It is the sum of the measure of model fit, called the deviance denoted by D and the effective number of parameters denoted by D p . The selected model was then used to estimate the relative risk, it r . Figure 1 shows the graph of cumulative confirmed and dead cases of COVID-19 from the time the first case was reported to 20 th August, 2020. There were 5282 confirmed cases and 165 deceased cases as of 20 th August, 2020. Generally, there were low total cases of those who died of COVID-19 as compared to those who were confirmed. , p-value = 0.380), revealed lack of correlation. There was also no significant correlation between confirmed cases and percentage of people with running water in each district ( 000 . 0 = ρ , p-value = 0.998). Since the p-values of the correlation coefficients were more than 0.20, the significance level set to select potential covariates, the two covariates, population density and proportion of those with running water were dropped when fitting the spatial temporal models of the weekly confirmed cases of COVID-19.The study looked at a snap shot of spatial temporal distribution of COVID-19 in Malawi by focusing on the period, 24 th June to 20 th August, while using the inseparable statistical spatial temporal model. The use of inseparable model allowed the investigation of the joint or interaction effect of time and location on COVID-19 cases. The use of non-parametric model for time effect (RW2) also enabled the capturing of the subtle influences of time on the risk of contracting COVID-19.The other possible contributor to the observed rural city spatial gradient of COVID-19 risk in Malawi would be international exposure. In this case, cities have higher international exposure than the rural through international flights among others, which would mean more imported cases. Evidence of international exposure as a risk factor of COVID-19 transmission has been observed in Africa as a whole where countries with high international exposure like South Africa, Nigeria, Morroco, Egypt, and Algeria have had higher COVID-19 cases than their counterparts. International exposure as a fuel of COVID-19 transmission has also been documented in Brazil where it was found that cases increased with increase in international flights jetting into the country (Pequeno et al, 2020 Regarding the temporal distribution, the disease risk was increasing gently from week 1 to week 4 and increased sharply from week 4 to week 5 when it started to decline in most regions. The relative sharp increase in risk in week 4 and 5 may be attributed to the effects of post presidential general election which was held on 23 rd June, 2020. The unrestricted political rallies before the election might have caused a spike in COVID-19 risk thereafter. In addition, the rise in COVID-19 cases during this time would be attributed to the decreasing temperatures at this time of the year as this is the time of cold season. The decline of risk from week 5 to the last week may be due to the increasing temperatures as this time marks the beginning of hot season. Negative correlation between COVID-19 cases and temperature has been documented (Pequeno et al, 2020).The study did not go without weaknesses. The first weakness was that, due to the absence of population size for each area at each time point, the base population at risk for each area was assumed to constant across time which was not practically valid. The other weakness was that the study did not look at future predictions of COVID-19 risk beyond the specified period of the study to give an idea how the disease would progress thereafter. This would have important implications particularly on planning activities that had been brought to a halt by COVID-19 like education and football games. Nonetheless, the study gave an overview of the disease dynamics in both space and time in the specified time frame so as to identify hot spots in both space and time for further epidemiological investigations or interventions.The study found a significant effect of both location and time on COVID-19 risk and the effect of either of the two depended on the other, that is, interaction. The risk of COVID-19 for major cities was high compared to the rural districts and that over time, the risk for rural areas remained relatively lower than in cities. The risk of getting COVID-19 in almost all districts started to decline in the last week which was in August. The implications of the study are that future interventions to halt the disease transmission in case the disease repeats itself, should target the major cities like Blantyre, Zomba, Mangochi, Lilongwe and Mzuzu and that by time, attention should be paid to the month of June and July when it is very cold.","Malawi","first author","2020-09-14",9

COVID-19 and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): a spark that sets the forest alight?","The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic in early March 2020. The world was placed under lockdown and now, months after this intervention, the harsh reality of the social, economic and health impact of the disease is evident.It is clear that COVID-19 is not a simple viral pneumonia. A myriad of unusual pathophysiological, biochemical and haematological effects are being described. Of particular interest is the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and the renin angiotensin system (RAS) via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by the SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to cells. In the context of virally infected cells, this interaction could trigger and explain a number of the novel findings observed, including a fulminant immune response and coagulation abnormalities, which ultimately leads to multi organ failure and death in some individuals.The intricate RAS comprises a carefully balanced and controlled cascade of hormones and receptors involving multiple organ systems. The system is primarily responsible for blood pressure control by maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance and preserving systemic vascular resistance (1) . Numerous factors regulate the system, including an increase in the sodium concentration in the distal tubule of the nephron, a decrease in the glomerular afferent arteriole pressure, and the release of cardiac natriuretic peptide which plays an important role in the counter regulation of the system (1,2). Angiotensinogen, continuously released from the liver into the circulation, is cleaved to angiotensin I (AngI) by renin which is released from the kidney. The cascaded RAS ultimately results in the formation of angiotensin II (AngII) from AngI catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) located on vascular endothelium, and most abundantly found in lung tissue (1, 2) . AngII is the most active end product of the classic arm of the RAS system and acts mainly via angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptors located in the heart, vasculature, kidney, adrenal cortex, basal ganglia and the brainstem where it mediates vasoconstriction (See figure) . This is the so-called ""classical arm"" in the RAS.Earlier in the pathway, AngI is also converted to Ang (1-9) and AngII to Ang (1-7) by ACE2.Ang (1-7) primarily exerts effects on the MAS receptor and to a lesser degree also on AT2.When Ang (1-7) binds to MAS receptors, it causes vasodilation, natriuresis, diuresis, and also exerts anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. This arm of the pathway constitutes the so-called ""protective pathway"" of the RAS as the effects are believed to be physiologically favourable(2,3).The commonly used antihypertensives namely ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) act directly on the RAS as shown in figure 1 .The RAS appears to be important in a number of pathological processes. AngII/AT1 activation leads to a number of unfavorable effects, which include vasoconstriction and hypertension, cellular differentiation and growth, endothelial dysfunction, and the formation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) that may ultimately lead to organ damage (2) (3) (4) . The vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) is released when Ang (1-7) binds to MAS and AT2 receptors (5) . This is part of the protective arm of the RAS and possibly counteracts the vasoconstrictive effects of the classical arm. Additionally, aldosterone secretion, mediated by AngII/AT1 binding, also plays a central role in the establishment and development of inflammation and coagulation. More recently, AngII/AT1 activation, has been proposed as a contributor in the development of atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance in diabetic patients (6, 7) .In summary, the classic pathway of the RAS, namely AngII/AT1 receptor interaction, results not only in the well-known vasoconstrictive effects, but also a host of potentially detrimental effects on the endothelium, inflammation, and coagulation. AngII/AT2 and AngII/MAS receptor interactions act as a critical ""protective arm"", acting as an important counter-control mechanism to balance these effects (2) . ACE2 can therefore be considered a central component of the counter-RAS system in both the development of, and protection against disease.Studies now confirm that ACE2 is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2, and is the same mechanism found in the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (8-10). To fully understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19, it is important to understand the expression and function of ACE2.Studies are ongoing to establish the exact locations of ACE2 tissue expression, but currently it is accepted that the ACE2 receptor protein is found on the endothelium in various human organs, including the skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain as well as the oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, while ACE2 mRNA is found in almost every organ (11) . The most remarkable finding is the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine (11) . This is especially important when considering the pathogenesis and clinical picture of COVID-19 infected patients.Once a cell becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is internalised and the expression of ACE2 is downregulated. Therefore the beneficial degradation of AngII to the counterregulatory Ang (1-7) decreases, leading to unopposed AngII/AT1 effects(12), a theory supported by the finding of raised AngII levels in infected COVID-19 patients(12)(13).Currently, there is a lack of data on how SARS-CoV-2 and the RAS interact. We hypothesize that the RAS may be involved the pathophysiology of COVID-19 via activation of the classic pathway. The ubiquitous distribution of ACE2 in the endothelium could potentially allow for widespread of effects outside the lung once viraemia is established. In the context of a viral induced inflammation, this SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction with the potential loss of the RAS counter-regulatory protective arm, could theoretically result in a number of the observed clinical findings seen in COVID-19.A number of important epidemiological observations have been made in COVID-19 disease, especially in severe disease. Firstly, older people, males, hypertensives, diabetics and people who are overweight seem to be most at risk (14) (15) (16) while the pulmonary oedema, capillary leak and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) noted to develop with the infection appears to be associated with a raised Interleukin-6 and very high CRP levels (14) which is unusual for an early viral infection. Also, a hypercoagulable state is being increasingly recognised in severely ill patients (17, 18) . It is hypothetically possible, that many of these effects could be explained by ACE2 receptor loss and AngII/AT1 over activation, at least in the initial phases of the disease.Interestingly, the genes for the expression of the ACE2 receptor are located on the Xchromosome, which could account for an under-expression in males as males are hemizygous for the gene. The only copy of the gene is inherited from the mother, and will be expressed. In females, X-chromosome genes are expressed as mosaics. This means that in some tissues the ACE2 gene from one X-chromosome is expressed, and in some tissues the copy found on the other X-chromosome is expressed. Which copy of the gene is expressed, is determined early in development by X-inactivation (19) . Additionally it is plausible that ACE2 receptor numbers or function diminishes with age, placing older individuals at increased risk of ""classic arm"" activation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 (20) . Individual and genetic variation in ACE2 expression may also prove to be an as yet unexplored factor in progression to severe disease (19) .Using animal models, ACE2 was shown to be a critical receptor in the previous SARS infection even in animals, without which the virus was unable to gain entry into cells (21) . Once infected with SARS, mice showed markedly down-regulated ACE2 expression in the lungs, which appeared to be mediated by the mere binding of the virus to the receptor (21) . Rats with ACE2 genetically removed (knock-out rats), developed more severe ARDS when they were exposed to non-SARS lung damage (i.e. acid, endotoxin and peritonitis), compared to the wild type rats where ACE2 remain present (5) . The pathological findings in the knock-out rats included increased vascular permeability, lung oedema and neutrophil accumulation. Thus, ACE2 was shown to play a protective role in rat models of acute lung injury, while ACE, AngII and AT1 receptors (i.e. the ""classic pathway"" -refer to figure) were found to be lung injurypromoting (5, 22) . Similarly, in SARS infection, ACE2 and components of the protective RAS system appear to play a role in controlling the severity of lung damage, once inflammation is initiated (21) . If ACE2 was removed in mice, SARS Co-V spike protein alone (i.e. no other viral elements) increased AngII levels and worsened ARDS, implying a pathological mechanism even in the absence of viable virus. This effect was also found to be partially reversed by AT1 receptor blockade (21) . It is plausible, that the SARS-CoV infection-induced downregulation of ACE2 may play an early triggering role, in upstream progression to severe disease.Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) appear to exhibit a socalled cytokine storm. A massive overproduction of cytokines in response to exponential viral replication leads to epithelial and endothelial cell death with subsequent vascular leakage and the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (23) . This leads to downregulation of pulmonary ACE2, and subsequent dysfunction of the RAS, in turn leading to worsening systemic inflammation and vascular permeability, eventually leading to ARDS, multi organ failure and mortality (23) (24) (25) .The hypersecretion of cytokines may also have direct cardiovascular effects including the reduction of coronary blood flow, the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques and the formation of microthrombi (26) . Importantly Ang2/AT1 activation results in endothelial dysfunction, and in the context of a viral infection, increased endothelial signaling may be the catalyst for initiation of the coagulation cascade in certain individuals. The inflammatory response, with raised CRP and IL-6 levels have been shown to be hallmarks of disease in some COVID-19 patients, and these levels predict severity of disease (27) . It may be simplistic to ascribe these findings to one pathway, but as noted above, Ang2/AT1 working through the mechanism of increasing ROS and promoting inflammation, is able to increase both CRP and IL-6, thus in the context of a viral infection, ubiquitous Ang2/AT1 stimulation may have a multiplicative effect on inflammation within, or near the cell of infection.The formation of ROS results in the production of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tissue factor (TF), nuclear factor kappa B, Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), which may add to the state of overwhelming systemic inflammation, and hypercoagulability (28) .Many critically ill COVID-19 patients appear to develop an overwhelming hypercoagulable state leading to the formation of pulmonary emboli, venous thrombi and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (29, 30) . Increased aldosterone release, mediated by Ang II/AT1 may be associated with thrombotic events (31) . It is noted that AngII and aldosterone increase the expression of PAI-1, a major inhibitor of fibrinolysis in vivo, in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells (32) . Aldosterone release stimulated by AngII/AT1 activation, also upregulates protein-C receptors in human vascular endothelium (33) , and is strongly associated with a prothrombotic state (34) . of the patients which was associated with a decrease in ACE2 expression. They postulated that the downregulation of ACE2 was possibly a cytokine mediated process (10) .A large number of patients with severe COVID-19 disease are overweight (15, 16) .Interestingly, AngII is produced in adipose tissue (6) which may tip the balance to harm in overweight individuals Also, insulin has been shown to counteract the inflammatory effects of AngII (6) .Thus, insulin deficiency as in diabetes, may result in less opposed AngII inflammation. Further AngII itself, it said to play a role in insulin resistance(6) thus, it is possible that this could be a ""chicken or the egg"" situation in acute illness. This can possibly be attributed to an increase in AngII activity in tissue like skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and the pancreas where it alters glucose metabolism (6) . Furthermore, a strong relationship between aldosterone and the development of insulin resistance is described (6) . This is due to mineralocorticoid receptor activation by aldosterone, leading to an inhibitory effect on insulin signaling, increased uptake of glucose in adipocytes, skeletal muscle and vascular smooth muscle (6, 7) .If activation of the classic arm of the RAS is an early trigger to overwhelming disease, there may be possibilities for early intervention using readily available medications, to prevent progression to severe and overwhelming COVD-19 disease.The use of medication that may potentially block the classical pathway, or upregulate the protective arm of RAS in early disease, may be useful. Use of ACEi, ARBs and/or aldosterone blocking drugs, may assist in blocking some of these effects, especially in treatment naïve patients. However, this needs to be balanced against the risk of potential side-effects, and the theoretical risk of ACE2 upregulation which could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (36, 37) .Conversely, acutely stopping these medication in COVID-19 may pose the hypertensive patient at double risk, that of upregulated receptors with increased viral binding sites while acutely ceasing the RAS blocking effects of these drugs.The question of whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be withdrawn was addressed by a joint statement issued on 17 March 2020 that clearly stated that no evidence is currently available to support the notion that ACE inhibitors or ARBs were detrimental to patient outcome (38) . For now, treatment should therefore not be discontinued if a patients becomes infected with Covid-19.A number of the RAS components have been identified as possible treatment targets in COVID-19, especially given that AngII levels are increased in infected patients (39) . Soluble ACE2 receptors have been proposed as therapy for COVID-19 to ""mop-up"" virus, however may prove to be beneficial through their antagonistic effects on the RAS pathway (40) . Some studies advocate downregulation of ACE2 , but the concern is that it may lead to unopposed AngII/AT1 effects (41) . AngII Showed promise as a treatment modality, but is still in experimental phase (42) . Ang(1-7) has been shown to reduce the acute inflammatory response in animal models (43, 44) .Measuring ACE2, AngII and components of the RAS is unfortunately technically difficult, and analytes have short half-lives, making it impractical for routine use and are currently only available for experimental purposes. Using experimental treatments such as recombinant soluble ACE2 or, monitoring the effect ACEi and ARBs may have on the expression of ACE2 in individual patients to aid clinical decision making, is thus not possible at this stage (43) .In summary, this hypothesis of overactivation of RAS induced by SARS-CoV-2 may account for many of the epidemiological and unusual clinical findings observed in COVD-19 disease, including the hypertensive, inflammatory, endothelial and coagulation effects. In susceptible individuals, this is likely to play its biggest role in early disease, before ""the forest catches fire"".Clearly, this is not the only disease mechanism at play within severe COVID-19, with a myriad of other inflammatory cascades possibly involved. However, if correct, this hypothesis may provide a window of opportunity to prevent disease progression using readily available drugs, giving time for the natural host response to clear infection.It is too early to definitively advocate either for, or against therapies based on this hypothesis, and urgent research and data is needed to obtain sufficient evidence before any recommendations can be made in this regard.","South Africa","first author","2020-09-03",9

Pneumonia starts with severe acute respiratory infection symptoms and some cases developed acute respiratory distress syndrome with failure complications. On January 7, 2020, Chinese centre for disease control and prevention identified a new coronavirus .COVID-19 is a human coronavirus include in the gender beta coroanvirus group 2b, family coronaviridae. It is the third strain of virus of the coronavirus family (CoV), isolated in humans in the context of an epidemic after SARS-CoV in China (2002) and MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (2012) .Examination of the COVID-19 genome showed genetic similarity to SARS-CoV about 79.5%. Human to human transmission takes place by either respiratory droplets or close contacts. According to the world health organization, COVID-19 is a virus with unique characteristics that causes respiratory disease and which spreads via oral and nasal droplets (Kolifarhood et al. 2020 ).On March 2, the first case has been declared in Tunisia. Actually, COVID-19 is causing a disease representing a planetary problem for public health and negative impact on humanity (Boccaletti et al. 2020) .The objective of this paper is to propose a simple model to predict COVID-19 transmission using early data of the outbreak. Majority of epidemic transmission models are based on compartmental mathematical models dividing population in different interacting groups and assuming different rates of transmission between them. Solutions are conducted using integration of differential equations and principle of conservation (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . Population is generally assumed as a closed system, the probabilistic formalism of transmission between individuals of different groups leads to saturation and a population size effect on epidemic size and epidemic period. Models that are more sophisticated include also Monte Carlo numerical simulations for stochastic models and more realistic epidemic networks. See for example a review by House et al. (2013) and recent studies by Kim et al. (2020) , Liang (2020) and among several others for COVID-19 modelling.Epidemic networks and lattice methods have their origin in social science and computer science (see for example a review by Keeling and Eames 2005) . Lattice models are representation of an ordered network in which epidemic transmission is similar to a wave-like spread in regular grid representing connected individuals. Epidemic starts from an epicentre and spreads out in a roughly circular manner. Figure 1 illustrates an example in two dimensions. Lattice models are suitable for example for forest-fire models (Bak et al. 1990) where nodes represent trees that burn leaving empty sites. Keeling and Eames (2005) interpreted this representation as similar to epidemic transmission. This paper proposes, in this context, a phenomenological model of propagation and dissipation in analogy to elastic wave propagation and a size and temperature-dependent elastic damage material model (Ben Hassine et al. 2019; Limam et al. 2014) . The advantage of a formalism inspired from thermodynamics is that different effects emerge from principles.Wave propagation is particularly studied in biomechanical applications for example in evaluation of dental implant stability (Vayron et al. 2015) . In addition, elastic damage models are considered in geomechanics and biomechanics to model shock waves dissipation. For example, Nelms et al. (2017) applied a finite element elasto-plastic damage model in order to evaluate mechanical shock waves decay in cement microstructure. Fovargue et al. (2018) developed a model for kidney stone fragmentation in shock wave lithotripsy assuming elastic damage behaviour with reduction in the apparent Young modulus, in a context of thermodynamics of generalized standard materials behaviour (Lemaître and Chaboche 1978) . Non-local damage mechanics are particularly considered to model shock waves dissipation. For example, Lu et al. (2005) developed a non-local damage approach to model damage wave slow propagation in solids. Non-local damage approaches predict a size effect on macroscopic constitutive behaviour (Pijaudier-Cabot and Bazant 1987) . Size effect phenomenon was experimentally observed in biomechanics since the time of Galileo.Furthermore, Limam et al. (2014) and Ben Hassine et al. (2019) proposed that, for isotherm processes, a scaling law should be associated with specific entropy S depending on size N and that the specific free energy should be written = U − TS(N) . In fact, internal energy is extensive and specific internal energy U should be independent of N. On the contrary, entropy is non-additive at small scales and become additive as size N tends to infinity (Tsallis 2009 ). Irreversible isotherm processes assume equilibrium at successive states and allow heat transfer in agreement with Fourier law. For this isotherm case, specific free energy linearly decreases as temperature increases. This was confirmed experimentally. We can cite, for example, structural health monitoring related to concrete and composite structures (Wang et al. 2018; Moll et al. 2019 ).On the contrary, Carlioz et al. (2019) showed that material damage corresponding to high velocity process and to sudden and abrupt nature of a crack nucleation process is adiabatic rather than isothermal with temperature rising at crack tip during dynamic crack propagation due to heat accumulation at solid boundaries.In this paper, in the case of epidemic transmission context, isotherm open system hypothesis will be considered in analogy to isothermal damage process allowing heat transfer. Physicians who modelled epidemics spread using information entropy concept and epidemic thermodynamics, assumed this hypothesis. For example Koivu-Jolmaa and Annilaa (2018) proposed an isotherm natural process based on thermodynamics of open systems to predict Ebola virus transmission using statistical mechanics and analogy to chemical potentials. Tsallis and Tirnakli (2020) developed analytical model to predict COVID-19 transmission based on non-extensive Tsallis Entropy.The proposed scientific method proposed in this paper is developed in the same context of isotherm open systems considered for example by Koivu-Jolmaa and Annilaa (2018) and Tsallis and Tirnakli (2020) , but with a free energy postulated equal to the natural logarithm of active infected cases and written in the form U − TS(N) . The proposed approach can be viewed as part of epidemic physical models. It represents also a complement to compartmental mathematical models and complex network based on sophisticated approaches taking in to account real interaction between different groups and heterogeneous fields of motion and density depicted in real maps (Gomez et al. 2020 ). We adopt a method based on an empirical macroscopic description of epidemic spread inspired from mechanics and thermodynamics. It is noted that phenomena related to effects of ambient temperature or population size on COVID-19 epidemic transmission were recently reported in the literature. The proposed model is presented and explained in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the model is applied to study different effects including measures to restrict spread, effect of population density and size and effect of a parameter T similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics. Epidemic evolution in Tunisia is also analysed. We consider for comparison, data from national observer for new and emergent diseases (https ://www.onmne .tn) until June 12.We present also an ""Appendix"". Firstly, this appendix aims to present the considered mechanical model (Ben Hassine et al. 2019) . We present the simplified case of unidirectional behaviour, which is macroscopic, and size dependent. This model is therefore non-local in the sense of damage mechanic. Secondly, we present some phenomenological similarities between virus spread and mechanical wave spread. Finally, this appendix includes also a table with both, epidemiology and damage mechanics to list the similarities, parameters, Equations local or non-local and their interpretation.Consider first a simple mathematical model given by Eqs. (1) and (2). I n is the number of infected people on day n . Theses Equations correspond to epidemic theoretical free transmission in a population of size N defined in a finite roughly circular convex domain part of a perfect infinite ordered lattice of connected people and starting from an epicentre I 0 = 1 belonging to the domain. Population density is inversely proportional to the square of distance d as depicted in Fig. 1 . Coefficient C defined by Eq. (1) is considered as an intrinsic characteristic of population density and independent of population size. It is clear that it decreases when distance d increases which means that when population density decreases. It represents the number of transmission between every infected person at wave front to other persons. A theoretical free transmission in the lattice corresponds to the linear curve with a slope ln[C] in a semi-logarithmic scale as depicted in Fig. 2a , b for a domain representing, for example, a typical dense city with N = 12 Million and C = 1.62. In that case, population size N will be reached at n s = ln(N) ln(C) , on day 34; meanwhile epidemic will continue to propagate in the lattice outside the population domain, as the considered population is fixed but transmission to the outside was made possible by hypotheses.In reality transmission, process is dissipative and the linear curve of slope ln[C] corresponds only to early stage. It can be deduced, for example, from initial data curves fitting in a semi-logarithmic curve as shown in Fig. 2 . This coefficient should be reduced by measures imposed by governments including lockdown and quarantine. It is reduced also by population behaviour including social distancing, personal hygiene, for example by wearing a mask in fear of the spread of the virus. This is similar to the effect described by, for example, Kim et al. (2020) or Liang (2020) .This behaviour emerges naturally after first deaths inducing a disorder and long range interaction in the initial lattice of Fig. 1 , which means physically that entropy should increase.The idea of the proposed model can be highlighted when we made an empirical analogy of the linear curve as depicted in Fig. 2 with energy as function of time of elastic wave propagation in a rod obeying Hooke's law of elasticity and submitted to harmonic imposed power. Therefore, we defined by analogy free energy of the virus spread by = ln I n which gives a constant daily rate in the case of linear curve as depicted in Fig. 2 and defined by Eqs. (1) and (2).In reality, material behaviour as epidemic spread is dissipative and wave velocity will decrease due to material damage. In analogy to reduction in Young modulus of elasticity in damage mechanics (Kachanov 1958) , we should introduce a reduction in C in a semi-logarithmic scale. Therefore, we postulate the evolution model of infected cases I n on day n, given by Eqs. (3-7) , where T is a parameter similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics and where a first case is I 0 = 1.In order to give a physical sense to these Equations, we define first a free energy rate of the virus noted n+1 − n = Δ given by Eq. (8). In a thermodynamically consistent isotherm framework, Helmholtz free energy is defined by the rate Δ = ΔU − TΔS , where ΔU is internal energy rate and ΔS is entropy rate given, respectively, by Eqs. (9) and (10) in the case of virus spread analogy and identified from Eq. (8).(3)(4) D n = 0 for n ≤ 21 and D n = J n−21 J n+1 for n > 21(5) F n = 0 for n ≤ 21 and F n = J n N for n > 21(7) C(n) = C for n ≤ 21 and C(n) = CR for n > 21In order to consider lockdown and quarantine effect, C is decreased from day 22 and noted CR, a coefficient between 1 and C (Eq. 7). Equation (4) is introduced to model recovering or death from day 22 with parameter D n . This is justified by recent studies reporting that observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was between 8 and 37 days ). This means an average of 22 days corresponding to a first death. This means also different behaviours of governments and people for different time intervals n ≤ 21 and n > 21 before and after this event. Equations (4, 6 and 7) define different coefficients C and CR to distinguish between no measures before the event and measures taking after the event. Evolution law of damage defined by these Equations is independent of population size and temperature and can be considered as an intrinsic property of virus spread but dependent upon people density through coefficient C and measures taking through coefficient CR. C and CR are therefore depend on different cities or countries. Equations (3) to (7) were inspired using similarities with non-local damage behaviour as shown in Table 1 . As explained in the ""Appendix"" non-local damage predicts a size effect and local damage does not. In Table 1 , the particular case of local damage behaviour corresponding to T = 0 is also presented, where Eq. (11) is obtained from Eq. (3) using Eqs. (4) and (6). We can underline here that Eq. (11) is a conservation Equation eliminating recovered or deceased individuals from infected individuals to obtain only active infected cases with a delay of 22 days. This Equation is similar to Equations defined by compartmental models as for example SIR or SEIR models. Meanwhile, the advantage of the present physical approach is that some intrinsic characteristics of virus spreading are considered in the model, including local interaction between individuals leading to its transmission and non-local interactions leading to its dissipation due to an entropic effect as explained in analogy to the non-local damage model presented in the ""Appendix"".Its application with CR = 1.15 ignoring entropy dissipative effect which means with T = 0, leads to the trilinear curve presented in Fig. 2a, b where population size will be reached with an epidemic period n s = 89 days for the considered example in Fig. 2. Figure 2a shows also the theoretical case of an ideal lockdown with CR = 1 and T = 0. This leads to an epidemic period of 40 days due to a recovering rate higher than infection rate in that case with an epidemic peak of 11,200, reached on day 21 and independent of N. Evolution law of damage given by Eqs. (4, 6 and 7) is defined exclusively by C and CR and remains (10) ΔS = ln 1 + F n (11)independent of population size. This evolution law of damage induces a decreasing of internal energy rate defined by Eq. (9) which remains also independent of population size and temperature and equal to free energy rate when T = 0. Effects of T and N are rather due to entropy production. Similar hypothesis was considered for a damage evolution law as an intrinsic characteristic of the material independent of specimens size and temperature see Ben Hassine et al. (2019) and (Limam et al. (2014) . Equation (5) is introduced to consider population size effect, also from day 21. It is worth mentioning that the considered free energy is choosing with an entropy rate ΔS = ln 1 + F n , null before damage initiation (F n = 0 for (n ≤ 21)) and always positive, which means that entropy increases according to the second law of thermodynamics and contributes to dissipate free energy of the virus. Theoretical free transmission in an ordered lattice case given by Eqs. (1) and (2) can be obtained when considering CR = C, and T = 0, in analogy to absolute zero state in thermodynamics, where entropy effect vanishes. Parameter T should be understood as for example hygiene measures in the system which can be linked also to ultraviolet rays increasing with ambient temperature rising. When increased it contributes to increase entropy effect and consequently to decrease free energy rate and epidemic spread. This is in agreement with recent environment studies shown also through statistical analysis of data that transmission decreases as ambient temperature increases, see for example Prata et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2020) . Figure 2b shows an example applying the proposed model with N = 12 Million, C = 1.62, CR = 1.15 and T = 7. Introducing entropic effect, epidemic size is decreased with a peak of 79,000 infected cases and an epidemic period of 56 days. Parameters were chosen to give an order of epidemic comparable to a dense city like Wuhan (Liang 2020; ; . C was identified from the first slope of data using a regression analysis between day 8 and day 21. This choice of linear behaviour was not arbitrary. In fact, we assumed that virus spread similarly to material behaviour is linear at early stages of loading. Similarities between local elasticity and linear spread are depicted in Table 1 (""Appendix""). Figure 3 presents an example of the model applied first with N = 12Million, C = 1.62, CR = 1.15 and T = 7 in a Cartesian scale and then with the same parameters but more restricted measures traduced by a reduction in C on day 21 to CR = 1.1. It can be observed that CR = 1.1 describes stricter measures that induce a decreasing of epidemic size and slightly increase epidemic period. The maximum of positive cases Imax is decreased from 79,000 to 46,000. Figure 3 presents Free energy of the virus n = ln I n = n ln (C)Specific internal power proportional to Young modulus t ∝ E Free energy rate of the virus Δ n = n+1 − n n+1−n = ln also real data of infected active cases in Wuhan, China (Liang 2020; , until epidemic wave end on March 2020. Real data show that I max is equal to 57,900 cases, which means that CR is effectively between 1.1 and 1.15. It is observed also that the epidemic real period is larger than the predicted one. This can be explained by a possibility of a second epicentre with a shift in time and space from the first one. This can be confirmed also by the shift in the data curve shape. It can be noted here that the model assumes a unique epicentre. A superposition can be made to include the effect of a second epicentre. Figure 4 shows effect of population size N on infected cases in a Cartesian scale. C, CR and T are fixed and the size N is changed from 3 to 12 and 24 Million. It is deduced that when population size increases epidemic size and period increase, with respective maximums I max of 25,000, 79,000 and 128,000 reached, respectively, on days 30, 39 and 42with, respectively, epidemic periods of about 41, 56 and 60 days. When N increases the ratio (I max /N) decreases and, respectively, given by 0.83%, 0.66% and 0.53%. Figure 4 presents also real data of infected active cases in Wuhan, China. Comparison shows an agreement with data. Estimated population size in Wuhan is 11 Million. Figure 5 presents data in Cartesian scale in Tunisia until April 25. On this date, our ministry of health reported 38 deaths and 194 recovered cases. The model is depicted and reproduces actual data tendencies, considering C = 1.3 corresponding to initial data fitting in semi-logarithmic scale. It represents quarantine and lockdown effects thereafter with CR = 1.115.The model reproduces data tendencies with I max = 912 and an epidemic period of 92 days, which means an epidemic spread end at the beginning of June if the same measures are maintained. It is noted that a reduction in C from 1.62 to 1.3 induces a reduction in epidemic peak of about 50 times as deduced when comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 3 . Furthermore, it is noted in Fig. 5 that parameter T when changed from 7 to 25 slightly decreases epidemic. Furthermore, Fig. 6 presents updated real data until June 12. A good agreement is observed between data and the model.An evolution law of COVID-19 based on analogy with wave propagation in elastic solids and a non-local damage model is proposed. The key coefficient C is obtained by a linear fitting of initial slope of data in a semi-logarithmic scale between day 8 and day 21. Results are very sensitive to this parameter, considered as an intrinsic parameter of population density. For populations of a comparable size, but with coefficients, respectively, C = 1.3 and C = 1.62, results show that epidemic size can increase very fast. The second important parameter is CR. It traduces measures like lockdown and quarantine. When controlled, which means decreased, it decreases epidemic size.The low predicted epidemic size in Tunisia is essentially due to a low population density (C = 1.3) and strict restriction measures (CR = 1.115). Population density is inversely proportional to the square of distance d depicted in Fig. 1 which explains its important effect on transmission. Information exchange, democratization of access to knowledge and long-range non-local interaction between humans at a planetary level contribute to dissipate pandemic and help humanity to be prepared to a possibility of a second wave.The model was applied to unidirectional isotherm behaviour of concrete under quasi-static compression. It was validated using comparison with experimental tests. It was derived in a context of generalized standard behaviour of material verifying Clausius-Duhem inequality (Limam et al. 2014) . Constitutive macroscopic behaviour (Eq. 12) exhibits a size and ambient temperature effects on macroscopic strength and secant modulus of elasticity with decreasing as size and temperature increase. Consider a rod of length L and imposed displacements u(0) and u(L) at its boundaries.Macroscopic elastic damageable constitutive behaviour associating macroscopic stress L to macroscopic strain L = u(L)−u(0) L is given by Eq. (12).This macroscopic behaviour derives from a chosen specific free energy L given by Eq. (13) where D is damage parameter between 0 and 1, E is Young modulus and k is an increasing positive function with horizontal asymptote. A unique evolution law of damage parameter D as function of loading history was considered. This law is independent of the size L and absolute temperature. Evolution law of damage was considered as an intrinsic characteristic of material.It is important to note here that specific free energy was obtained through a second-order Taylor series development ln (1 + D) ≈ D − D 2 2 and can be written as follows:This specific free energy L = U − TS(L) was defined as function of a specific internal energy U and specific entropy S given, respectively, by Eqs. (15) and (16).Specific internal energy U is independent of L and internal energy is proportional to L; meanwhile specific entropy S(L) depends on L and is size dependent. This hypothesis is based on physical principles. For discrete physical systems with weak correlation between microstates, entropy associated with a given macro-state is not necessary additive at small sizes. However, it becomes additive for large sizes. This means also that specific entropy increases as function of system size and tends asymptotically to a constant for large sizes (Tsallis 2009 ).In Eq. (12), stress is the sum of tow components the first one is derived from the internal energy and given by Eq. (17). The second component is an entropic stress given by Eq. (18) Physicians state that entropic forces are long range (March's principle). This means that long-range non-local interactions should be defined in order to obtain macroscopically Eq. (18). Figure 1 is a simple representation drawn to understand phenomenologically virus spread.The key ideas to explain virus spread is that:1. Without exchange of information between individuals, virus is spreading by transmission or diffusion due to close contact. This means that transmission is a local phenomenon. This means also that persons represented by nodes in Fig. 1 are not informed about what happens far from them. 2. Long range exchange of information and interaction between persons induce a non-local entropic force opposite to virus spread in analogy to mechanical entropic stress given by Eq. (18). Dissipation of spread is therefore a non-local phenomenon. Table 1 presents, firstly, similarities between elastic wave propagation in a semi-infinite rod submitted to a constant power and free linear spread. Similarities are extended thereafter to shock wave propagation in a semi-infinite rod modelled as a non-local damage medium. Resolution of dynamics with non-local equations remains possible but complicated. The presented Equations are therefore phenomenological and macroscopic. ","Tunisia","abstract","2020-09-25",9

The virus was first discovered and reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which were later reported in other countries (1) . As at 30 April 2020, more than three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported globally with 217,769 deaths (2) . However, as of April 30, 2020, Nigeria had 1,932 confirmed, 319 discharged and 58 death cases of COVID-19 spreading across 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory FCT (3) .Nigeria reported first COVID-19 confirmed case on 27 February 2020, when an Italian citizen tested positive for the virus. Consequently, the government, like other governments of affected countries, implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the country. As of 20 March 2020, the Nigerian government restricted international travel on 15 high incidence countries namely; China, Italy, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, United States of America, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Austria (4). The temporary closure of schools was imposed on 20 March 2020 (5). Among others interventions including border restriction, workfrom-home arrangements for civil servants, restrictions of social and religious gatherings, wearing of facial masks, social distancing, states and national lockdowns were implemented on 30 March 2020.Following the emergence of COVID-19 and its global spread, numbers of studies have been conducted to examine statistical model of epidemiology data (6) . The COVID-19 cases were investigated using dynamic statistical techniques (7) , estimation of fatality rate of COVID-19 was studied (8) and, the transmission dynamics of the virus was examined (9) .Despite the rapid spread of the virus and continuous rising cases and deaths in the recent days especially in Nigeria, there is still lack of studies estimating the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the outbreak in timeline of the pandemic. The CFR is one J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the pivotal parameters required to understand the basic epidemiological features of the outbreak (10) . As a result, the present paper estimates the CFR of COVID-19 during the first weeks of first reported death of the pandemic in Nigeria through statistical regression analysis. The CFR represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease (11) . Hopefully, the estimated CFR could provide a better understanding of near future trends for successful control of the global COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.The data used in this work were obtained from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports, which have been publicly released on their websites (2) . The collected data include cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, which are essentials indicators for determining CFR of the epidemic.In this study, simple linear and polynomial regression models were used to estimate the CFR of COVID-19 epidemiologic data in Nigeria. In all cases, the cumulative number of confirmed cases termed as predictor variable while cumulative deaths a response variable of the model. The slope of the fitted line was considered as an estimate of the CFR, and the Confidence Interval (CI, 95%) of CFR was calculated from the standard error of the slope. In order to minimize variation in the course of estimation of the CFR in the initial stage of outbreak when no death occurred, the time since first reported death was used as the starting point of these models. The values of coefficient of determination ( 2 R value of 0.91-0.99) usually quantify a tight linear trend and could be as an effective parameter in estimating a good fit for the model (12) . Details of these models were provided in (13) . The expression of linear and polynomial regression model that were used in this study are respectively given in equation 1 and equation 2:where I is the intercept, S, S 1 , and S 2 are the respective slopes of the models.The first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported in Nigeria on 27 of February, imported by an Italian citizen. The first fatal death due to the global pandemic was reported on 23 of March 2020 (14) . As of 14 April 2020, Nigeria had 12 functional testing facilities in eight states, with a capacity to conduct a minimum of 1500 tests per day in Lagos state and 1000 tests per FCT and other states (15). Until 30 April 2020, the updated situation report by NCDC was given; 15,759 samples were tested, 1,932 confirmed cases, 319 discharge cases and 58 confirmed fatalities were reported in Nigeria. The highest daily number (204) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was reported. The new reported cases in Nigeria increased in a daily basis due to a series of factors, which would facilitate the spread of the virus. The factors may include inadequate of medical supplies, poor medical conditions (16) and scarcity of virus testing centers. Figure 1 displays COVID-19 spreading patterns since the confirmation of the first index. The figure suggests that there was a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases which may lead to gradual increase in deaths cases. Figure 2 shows the distribution patterns of the epidemic across the top 10 affected states. The selected states for this graph are Lagos, Kano, FCT, Gombe, Borno, Ogun, Edo, Katsina, Bauchi and Sokoto. The graph indicates that the distribution patterns of the epidemiological data could be skewed due to lack of adequate testing centers among other factors in the country. Furthermore, the epidemiological data in Table 1 suggests that Lagos state has the highest number of confirmed cases (50.52%), taking up more than half of the total number of confirmed cases in Nigeria, which indicates the availability of medical care and adequate testing centers in the state. But, Sokoto state, with 36 (1.86%) confirmed cases and number of deaths (4), had the highest mortality rate (11.11%) in Nigeria, this indicates an evidences of poor healthcare services in the state. Other states with the high mortality rates, as depicted in Figure 3 include Borno (9.09%), Edo (6.81%), Bauchi (5.26%) and Katsina (5.00%). Lack of quality healthcare and insufficient testing centers among other factors may be contributed to the regular rise in mortality rates of COVID-19 in these states. The derived results of the fitting models are shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4A gives the results obtained from linear regression model that estimated the CFR of COVID-19 as 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59 -3.80%) and 2 R value  of 0.90 with p-value<0.0001 for the time period since first reported death until 30 April 2020 in Nigeria. Figure 4B presents the results of polynomial model that estimated the CFR of COVID-19 for 3.0% (95% CI: 2.23 -3.42%) with value of coefficient of determination, 2 R value  of 0.93 and p-value<0.0001. For all the cases, the results indicate that in the initial stage of COVID-19, the reported confirmed cases and deaths were mostly satisfying both the linear and polynomial models based on linear regression models. Therefore, the estimated CFR in this study based on COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed deaths derived from both the linear and polynomial models could give better understandings of the epidemic in Nigeria. However, as shown in both figures, three different trends have shown gradual decreasing and increasing patterns at the initial stage of the graphs, which may affect the estimated results of the CFR and can be studied in future. The estimated CFR level of 0.03% in Nigeria will be maintained in the near future only if there are no significant changes in healthcare facilities, detection methods, continuous clinical treatments, and other factors. Government and relevant stakeholders should provide sufficient bed space and associated clinical care services in order to achieve a successful and effective control of COVID-19 in Nigeria. However, based on our estimate of the CI derived from polynomial regression model, the estimated CFR in Nigeria will be less than 0.3%, if the aforementioned factors will be improved.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China, the virus has been documented across the globe. As at 30 April 2020, Nigeria had 1,932 confirmed, 319 discharged and 58 death cases of COVID-19 across 34 states and the FCT. This paper showed the distribution patterns and estimates the CFR of COVID-19 epidemiological data of Nigeria during 44 days of outbreak since first reported death. Since the first pandemic death in Nigeria reported on March 18 th , we collected a 44 day epidemic data and computed CFR based on regression model. Compared to other mathematical models like the dynamic transmission model our model is straightforward and does not require complex parameter assumptions. Our findings suggest that the regression mode provides comprehensive estimation of CFR, which could be served as a threshold for successful control of COVID-19 in Nigeria, by studying the future trends of CFR.

How to account for this unprecedented reversal of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in Africa, initially delayed compared to other continents, then apparently contained and now difficult to control? In our opinion, at least two factors play a major role in the current spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa: the structural inadequacy of health systems and the serious deficiencies in the African approach to the response. We believe that political decision-makers must assume their responsibilities and inform their decisions on the basis of scientific facts, taking into account the specificities of our approaches to life, the only ones capable of containing fears and participating in the optimal management of crises and ultimately in the development of African nations. If Africa fails, the impact could be catastrophic not only from a health standpoint, but also from an economic standpoint and therefore from an overall human perspective. The great nations, like the great civilizations, know how to transform apparent challenges into undeniable opportunities to rise up. African scientists will similarly rise up, to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic.While Africa has long seemed paradoxically partly spared from the COVID-19 epidemic that is engulfing the rest of the planet, we are witnessing an upward surge in the dynamics of the epidemic across the continent. According to the African Center for Disease Prevention and Control (or Africa Centers for Disease Control, Africa CDC, headquartered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), the continent recorded on Thursday June 18 th , 2020 268,391 proven cases of COVID-19 and 7,217 overall deaths due to the disease. South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria are the countries most affected by the pandemic [1] . The upsurge in community contaminations now makes some experts fear the worst. How to account for this unprecedented reversal of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in Africa, initially delayed compared to other continents, then apparently contained and now difficult to control? In our opinion, at least two factors play a major role in the current spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa.The structural inadequacy of health systems: the fact that epidemics are more likely to occur in poor places with weak health systems does not help. The absence of hygiene or sanitation regulations or education, as well as the high density of urban African populations, are all factors that may increase the risk of epidemic spread. We note that some of the African countries which had set up containment measures are starting to lift them. If one acknowledges that these countries have carried out a relevant risk analysis, that does not provide them with the mastery of the dynamics of the epidemic, nor with the capacity to handle additional cases. There is already a lesson to be learned from the current crisis. The weakness of the health systems in Africa, with corollary an enormous amount of unmet needs for the user of the health sector. This has de facto negatively impacted on the preparation of African countries to face the new COVID-19. In addition, the strategic need to detect index cases of COVID-19 and to trace contact cases is weakened by the limited capacities for diagnostic tests in Africa [2] .The serious deficiencies in the African approach to the response: managing an unprecedented epidemic like that of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires multidisciplinary expertise, particularly in the medical as well as in the social sciences [3] . However, this expertise seems to have been largely lacking since the beginning of the epidemic in Africa. It is obvious that the under-involvement of African expertise in the COVID-19 crisis is more broadly part of the already well-recognized flight of African brains to other continents where their skills are better recognized and utilized. In other words, African expertise, although found in the diaspora, may have been largely lacking in Africa. Modern means of distance communication could have favored the recruitment of expatriate African experts in crisis management units, even if this approach has not been sufficiently explored. More generally, African expertise has been too infrequently included in operational decisionmaking teams [3] . Sometimes the genuine experts have not sufficiently been consulted. In any case, the combination of the relative scarcity of African expertise and its lack of sufficient mobilization have impoverished the management of the health crisis. Fortunately, international and even inter-African cooperation in health and the epidemic has enabled a more rational approach to managing the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, the subregional centers of competence around the African offices of the World Health Organization, or the African Center for Disease Prevention and Control with its headquarters within the African Union in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, brought in elements of enhanced expertise, particularly in training health partners about the COVID-19 epidemic, producing diagnostic tests and even supplying essential drugs to deal with the crisis [2] . In some countries, the traditional African pharmacopoeia has been used fully by large proportions of the population. International expertise has certainly helped manage technical aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, it has often been lacking to support political decisions around the management of the epidemic, remaining more in the more particularly technical fields than in the operational and strategic fields.The urgency of the doable for African scientific leadership: now, proposals must emerge to optimize Africa's responses to the challenge of COVID-19. Upstream and to stem the exodus of African human resources of high scientific level which weakens the African continent, it is a question of setting up an incentive framework for their development in Africa by bringing them the conditions of possibility of effective work. It is necessary to provide the necessary infrastructure, in particular in terms of laboratory resources, supported by suitable operating resources and trained and sufficient human resources. It is important to adopt a multidisciplinary approach as the facets of an epidemic like COVID-19 are both so many and unique. Thus, the biomedical sciences and the social sciences will be in the forefront, without forgetting the know-how resulting from the accumulated knowledge in the field of traditional African pharmacopoeia. The need to model epidemics, to predict future trends and to deviate from the deleterious trajectories, will require high level epidemiologist mathematicians, using powerful computing means. In the background, since scientific work does not blossom into autarky, it will be necessary to deepen and multiply intra-national and inter-African exchanges in all areas of medical and scientific knowledge. We believe that political decision-makers must assume their responsibilities and inform their decisions on the basis of scientific facts, taking into account the specificities of our approaches to life, the only ones capable of containing fears and participating in the optimal management of crisis and ultimately in the development of African nations. If Africa fails, the impact could be catastrophic not only from a health standpoint, but also from an economic standpoint and therefore from an overall human perspective. The great nations, like the great civilizations, know how to transform apparent challenges into undeniable opportunities to rise up. African scientists will similarly rise up, to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Cameroon","first author","2020-09-10",9

[1] . The article is well written, and I have three concerns as explained below.Firstly, the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with AKI is different in the text (i.e., 76.5%; 95% CI 61.0-89.0) from one reported in the authors' Figure 1 (i.e., 78.0%; 95% CI 63.0-90.0). The authors might need to clarify this discrepancy.Secondly, the authors mistakenly made a duplicate entry of the study by Chen et al. (2020) in the COVID-19 forest plot. This mistake resulted in a pooled AKI mortality rate of 78.0% (CI 63.0-90.0), I 2 = 97.1%, P < 0.0001, instead of 53.99% (CI 52.34-55.65), I 2 = 98.4%, P < 0.0001, had the authors sorted the duplicate-entry problem.Thirdly, the authors concluded the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with AKI from an otherwise a high heterogeneity of I 2 = 97.1%, P < 0.0001. This strongly impacts the reliability of the conclusion drawn [2] .I, on the other hand, reanalyzed authors' data and performed sensitivity analysis according to the Cochrane Library recommendation [3] [4, 5] . The nine remaining studies represented all-Asian Chinese hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and AKI. The newly obtained mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with AKI was 94.90% (CI 91.47-98.34), with nonstatistically significant heterogeneity, I 2 = 7.4%, P < 0.375, see Fig. 1 . Sensitivity analysis could not be conducted in MERS and SARS outcomes because of an insufficient number of studies.Authors' response to ""Joel Swai. Letter to the editor-Mortality rate of acute kidney injury in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis""We thank Dr. Joel Swai for the interest in our research letter. As the author pointed out, the reported results of mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is different from the text and Figure 1c in the original publication of our article [1] . The problem is that we mistakenly made a duplicate entry of the Chen et al. (2020) study while performing the COVID-19 forest plot. We have noticed this critical issue and sent the correct proof before the article publication; unfortunately, this mistake had not been accurately revised by the production team. We sincerely regret the inaccuracy may cause any inconvenience to the readers. However, there are no changes to the interpretation of the results, conclusions, and applications of our article. In details:1. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity among studies reporting AKI mortality in SARS (I 2 = 0.0%, P = 0.589) and MERS (I 2 = 0.0%, P = 0.758), but there was for COVID-19 infection (I 2 = 97.0%, P < 0.0001). 2. Figure 1c :In addition, our research letter aimed to overview the AKI mortality in patients with different coronaviruses, but the clinical heterogeneity between studies should be also noted. One of the important factors may be the racial difference between studies as Dr. Joel Swai noted. Even if the recent study from Fisher et al. indicated the races are not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients developing AKI [6] , future large meta-analyses may be suggested to explore the clinical impacts from different races in AKI mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Tanzania","first author","2020-09-11",9

Coronaviruses are a large family of RNA viruses that can cause a wide variety of diseases in animals and humans, from the common cold to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), [3] . Coronaviruses are divided into four genera according to phylogeny: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV [4] . Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in the 1960s in patients with cold [4] . Since then, six HCoVs have been discovered: 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [4, 5] . Similar to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus beta-CoV (betacoronavirus) [6] . On 7 January, Chinese researchers isolated the new SARS-CoV-2 from patients with pneumonia. From 13 January, the epidemic began to spread outside of China [7] and on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern [8] . As of 29 July 2020, WHO has reported 16 558 289 confirmed cases and 656 093 deaths worldwide [9] . On 14 February 2020, the first case of COVID-19 on the African continent was registered in Egypt [10] . Since then, the disease has spread to several other African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria was the first country to report a case of COVID-19 on 27 February 2020 [11] . Nowadays, all the countries of the sub-Saharan zone have been affected by the pandemic. As of 29 July 2020, Nigeria is the most affected country by the coronavirus pandemic in West Africa followed by Ghana [12] . Previous studies have shown the circulation of MERS-CoV in camels in some West African countries (Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali) [13, 14] . However, no case of HCoVs has been reported until the appearance of SARS-CoV-2. Although the African continent is, for the moment, less impacted than the rest of the world, it still faces the risk of a spread of COVID-19. Even though most African countries repeatedly face epidemics and health crises which allowed them to learn from past outbreaks, many gaps remain in the patient care systems of many countries. The WHO therefore 'fears Africa may not be able to face this pandemic, and calls on states to make their arrangements timely' [15] . The transmission and spread of viruses can be influenced by a number of factors, including climatic conditions (such as temperature and humidity), population density and the quality of medical care [16, 17] . In this study we have conducted a systematic review of the information available in the literature in order to provide an overview of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa and the impact of risk factors such as comorbidities, climatic conditions and demography on the pandemic. We focused our attention on Burkina Faso as it is one of the countries of West Africa with the most data available. Otherwise the way of life, the demography and the climate are comparable to most countries in West Africa.Transmission of coronavirus disease occurs mainly through the inhalation of infectious droplets and aerosols [19] and the incubation period is approximately 3-14 days. The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection is wide. It can range from an asymptomatic infection to a mild upper respiratory infection or even severe viral pneumonia that can lead to death [20, 21] . Seniors are most likely to develop severe forms [22] . Other non-specific symptoms have been reported, such as fever, cough, myalgia, dermatological damage, dyspnoea with or without diarrhoea and neurological manifestations such as hypogeusia and hyposmia were described [21, 23] . A hyperinflammatory phenomenon called 'cytokine storm' is thought to be involved in the occurrence of severe forms [24] . Cytokines are small proteins naturally produced by immune cells to promote ant-inflammatory reaction in order to protect the body from infection [25] . During SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an excess production of cytokine causing a hyperinflammatory reaction that can lead to death by cytokine shock [24] . All patients should be quarantined and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit is mandatory for the management of severe cases. Secondary bacterial infections can also occur, which can lead to pneumonia [26] . There is little data on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in West Africa. However, according to a study of 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria, no patient presented to hospital under critical conditions. In total, 75% were in moderately severe condition while 16% were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever (59%) and dry cough (44%). Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) were present in 19% of patients [27] .The epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 disease in West Africa is marked by a continuous increase in the numbers of confirmed cases with rather disparate situations ( Fig. 1a and b) [28] . After a first case notified on 27 February 2020 in Nigeria, West Africa, had on 29 July 2020, 131 049 cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 88 305 recoveries and 2102 deaths [12] . Nigeria is the most affected country in terms of registered death with 41 804 confirmed cases and 868 deaths followed by Ghana (34 406 confirmed cases and 168 deaths) and Cote d'Ivoire (15 713 confirmed cases and 98 deaths). Among the least affected countries we can cite Gambia (326 confirmed cases and 8 deaths), Togo (896 confirmed cases and 18 deaths) and Chad (926 confirmed cases and 75 deaths) ( Fig. 2a and b) [12] . If we analyse in more detail the situation in Burkina Faso, the first two cases were highlighted on 9 March 2020: a couple returning from France, precisely in the city of Mulhouse, where they participated in an evangelist event gathering several tens of thousands of people from 17 to 24 February 2020 and which constitutes the main cluster of COVID-19 in France. In this country young people under 15 are the least affected with only 14 confirmed cases (Fig. 3 ). Table 1 shows the death rate of SARS-CoV-2 by age group in Burkina Faso as of 21 June 2020. If we take the case of Nigeria, the most affected country in West Africa, a study described that 94% of patients had a recent travel history or contact with a confirmed case and 53% of patients were over 40 years old [27] . Another study reported a case fatality rate from COVID-19 of 2.8%. Lagos State was the most affected with more than 50% of positive cases. In a survey conducted among the population, only 29.0% would agree to be vaccinated if a vaccine against COVID-19 was available [29, 30] .In West Africa the number of confirmed cases is probably largely underestimated, given the limited means of diagnosis in some countries [31] . The diagnosis is based on reversetranscription (RT)-PCR using a nasopharyngeal swab. Two genes are targeted for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the ORF1 gene and the N gene [32] . However, there's approximately a false negative rate of 20% [33] .The low population density in West African countries could probably limit the spread of COVID-19. Indeed, with the exception of Nigeria (220 people/km 2 ), the population density of West African countries is relatively low (Burkina Faso: 72 people/km 2 , [34] [35] [36] . Nevertheless, the presence of large urban areas and highly populated capital is a factor favouring the spread of the disease. This is, for example, the case of Lagos in Nigeria with around 6871 people/km 2 [37] . Preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2The WHO encourages countries to carry out widespread testing, to apply social distancing and to respect barrier measures [38] . Also, the experiences of China and South Korea teach us that rapid and systematic detection of suspected cases, the wearing of masks, as well as studied containment and compliance with barrier rules (hand washing and social distancing) could help to significantly reduce the spread of the disease [39, 40] .In West Africa majority of governments have quickly taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the disease. Among these measures we can cite: (i) border closure; (ii) quarantine and self-containment of contacts of cases; (iii) dissemination of prevention messages calling on the population to wear a mask, to comply with barrier measures and social distancing; (iv) introduction of a curfew in certain countries (Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal, Niger and Guinea) and (v) closure of markets and places of worship.However, the population struggles to comply with certain measures such as the closing of shops and the travel limitations. In fact, 92.4% of people active in West Africa work in the informal sector as trading and businesses, transport and restoration. These jobs are not subject to any national legislation and are not subject to any social protection [41] . All these people are forced to go to work every day in order to support their families and in the absence of robust economic packages to help them to stay at home physical distancing measures are doomed to failure. Otherwise million people in West Africa lack access to clean water and communal water and sanitation facilities are not always accessible which makes certain hygiene measures recommended to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic difficult. For example, 63% of people in urban areas, or 258 million people, lack access to handwashing [42] . According to UNICEF data from 2017, the majority of people did not have basic handwashing facilities available at home. Only Ghana, Mali, Mauritania and Nigeria were above the global average of 60% of people with access to basic facilities. The situation was particularly bad in small countries such as Benin, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Togo where at least three-quarters of the population had no handwashing facility at home [43] . Quality masks are not always accessible to the population. Some countries (Senegal, Nigeria and Mali) have invested in the production and local distribution of masks [44] . However, the quality of these masks is often lacking. For example, in Benin buying a quality mask in pharmacies subsidised at 30 cents is still too expensive for some people. People then flock to masks sold on the street at half price, with a single layer of fabric and without any filter [45] . The average size of households in certain West Africa countries is estimated at 7.2 members per household which mean that several family generations live and interact under the same roof (concession) [46] . This makes it difficult to comply with self-containment and distancing measures. The difficulty in applying all these preventive measures could be a factor favouring the spread of the virus in these countries.The health situation in West African countries is difficult, in particular due to the extremely poor access of populations to health services. This weakness was exposed by the 2014/2015 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. This epidemic has revealed significant gaps in the capacity and preparedness to respond effectively to critical health events in affected countries [47] . In a country like Burkina Faso we have six university hospitals for around 20 244 079 inhabitants and one doctor for 12 000 inhabitants [48] . [49] . The hospital's capacity could quickly be exceeded. So, it is therefore necessary to anticipate the equipment of hospitals for the management of cases. Certain non-specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 such as fever and headache resemble that of malaria, hence the need for a differential diagnosis with malaria so as not to miss certain cases of SARS-CoV-2.Problematic of the management of asymptomatic cases In the strategy implemented to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there is the quarantine of contacts of cases. All people who have been in contact with a confirmed case are quarantined and followed up for 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks, everyone who develops symptoms is tested and managed; and anyone who does not show symptoms after 2 weeks is released from quarantine without being tested as is the case of Burkina Faso. Among these asymptomatic people out of quarantine, there could be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. The literature reports that people with asymptomatic forms of the disease can infect others and this transmission is estimated to be approximately 10% of transmission events [50] . This capacity for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic carriers could thus increase the risks of spread of the disease in the population. It should therefore be wise to test all contacts of cases without exception after quarantine but this need is faced with the limitation of diagnostic tests available. For example at the beginning of the epidemic, there was only one laboratory (National Influenza Reference Laboratory) for confirmation of the cases for all the Burkina Faso, located in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second city in the country, located 365 km from the capital. Today, four other laboratories have been equipped in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso to carry out diagnostic tests, thereby improving diagnostic capacities.Several studies in China and Italy tend to confirm that co-morbidities increase the risk of developing serious or even fatal forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection [51] [52] [53] . A study on 1099 patients with COVID-19 in China, reported that 173 patients suffering from severe forms had the following comorbidities: high blood pressure (23.7%), diabetes mellitus (16.2%), coronary heart disease (5.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (2.3%) [52] . In West Africa, the most common chronic diseases encountered in the population are diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure [54] . Diabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the WHO estimates, there will be a significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes in developing countries by 2025, which is expected to house 75% of the world's diabetic patients. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of adults over the age of 20 with a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m 2 increased from 28 million in 1980 to 127 million in 2015 [55, 56] . During this same period, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased considerably in Africa (3.1% in 1980 to 7.1% in 2014) which is higher than that in many European countries [55] . Although there are few data on the prevalence of diabetes in West Africa, these data indicate that it is an important problem to take into account regarding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the rate being 3% in Benin; in 6% Mauritania, 5% in Ivory Coast and 4.2% in Burkina Faso [57] [58] [59] .High blood pressure is defined as a systolic pressure of 140 mmHg or more or a diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or more [60] . The prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, and has become similar to that seen in high-income African countries [61, 62] . This prevalence varies between 16% and 40% among adults aged 18 and over; and exceeds 60% in people aged 65 and over in some studies [63, 64] . There are high proportions of people with high blood pressure who are unaware of their status (>70%), poor medication compliance (>80%) or of hypertensive patients who are not controlled under treatment (30-80%) [63] . The two co-morbidities mentioned above could lead to an increase in the number of severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 in West African during this pandemic. Also, many people in sub-Saharan Africa live with chronic pathologies without knowing it either through ignorance of the symptomatology or through lack of regular health check-ups. It would therefore be appropriate to strengthen the monitoring of people living with chronic pathologies during this period of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.There has not yet been any scientific evidence that people living with HIV are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing severe forms of the disease. However, HIV-infected people are at higher risk of cardiovascular and/or metabolic disorders, as a consequence of chronic immune activation and ARV drugs exposure. They are more likely to contract COVID-19 and develop severe forms. With the exception of Niger (0.3%), Burkina Faso has one of the lowest rates of people living with HIV in the West African sub region (0.7%). Ivory Coast has the highest rate with 2.6% followed by Togo with 2.3%, Ghana with 1.7%, Mali with 1.4% and Benin with 1% [65] .SARS-CoV appeared in China in Foshan, Guangdong province, in November 2002, while SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019 [66, 67] . In China, November and December are the coldest months of the year [68] . Low rainfall was also noted in these two regions during both of these periods of SARS outbreaks. Low temperatures generally constitute conditions favouring the circulation of viruses [68] . Cold accompanied by dry winds would be even more favourable to the survival of viruses compared to cold alone. Indeed, under these conditions, viral particles dried in the air, survive for a long time in the circulating air [69] [70] [71] . In addition, cold causes a decrease in immunity in humans, notably by reducing blood supply and therefore a decrease in the supply of immune cells to the nasal mucosa [72] . Low humidity would reduce the ability of cell lashes in the airways to remove viral particles [72] . It can also cause drying of the nasal mucus, thus weakening the nasal cavity; which will make the entire upper respiratory tract vulnerable to viral infection [68] . In a study of 100 Chinese cities, Wang et al.found that high temperature and high humidity significantly reduced transmission of SARS CoV-2 [73] .With the exception of the Mediterranean and South Africa, most countries on the African continent have a tropical climate. Temperatures, generally high, vary little throughout the year [74] . In the Sahelian zone the hottest season is between April and June and for the Guinean zone, it is between January and March [75] . During hot periods temperatures can reach 45°C in some areas; this is the case in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali [76] [77] [78] . These high heats could be a factor contributing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in these countries.The West African rainfall regime is linked to the seasonal movement of the intertropical convergence zone. The semi-arid zone, which essentially comprises the Sahelian and Sahelo-Saharan strip, is marked by a single rainy season between July and September. Further south, the alternation of two rainy seasons and two dry seasons marks the climate of the countries of the Gulf of Guinea [74] . These periods are also marked by an increase in humidity. The arrival of the rainy season in certain West Africa countries, moreover, will increase the humidity, which combined with heat could further reduce the spread of SARS CoV-2.West Africa's population is predominantly young. Out of a population estimated at 371 159 562 in 2017, over 64% are under the age of 24 (Fig. 4) [79, 80] . The youthfulness of the West Africa's population could be a factor limiting the occurrence of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 infection in China and Italy supports the hypothesis that the age factor plays an important role in the occurrence of severe forms of the disease [22] . The fatality rate higher in Italy than in China could be explained in particular by the fact that the Italian population is one of the oldest in the world with approximately 22% of the population aged 65 and over [81] . This could contribute, in part, to the high case fatality rate compared to other countries. In the African context, intrafamily transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to the fact that several families and several generations live and interact under the same compound. In addition, the youngest live with the oldest within the extended family unit, making the risk of contamination of the elderly by the young higher.Although the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in West Africa is relatively slow compared to European, North American or Asian countries, vigilance must remain. West Africa has already registered more than 131 049 cases confirmed by PCR with 2102 deaths. This figure, however, falls far short of those recorded by European countries such as France, Spain, UK and Italy. The West African's population way of life and the large number of people working in the informal sector make it difficult to apply preventive measures, namely physical distancing and confinement. In order to be able to effectively combat the spread of the virus, it is essential to develop a strategy based on the protection of people at risk, namely the elderly and people living with chronic diseases. Mass screening targeting mainly people at risk and their entourage would allow early detection of cases and quarantine to breaking the chain of transmission and protecting the more vulnerable ones. A local production of protective masks could also be an alternative to the shortage of masks that the world is currently facing. Experiences from past epidemics (such as Ebola, dengue, yellow fever and Lassa fever) have increased laboratory and surveillance capabilities across the African continent which allows West Africa to be better prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Burkina Faso, the epidemic of Ebola virus disease has led to the creation of a national reference laboratory for viral haemorrhagic fevers and the training of several health workers in the management of epidemics. It is to be hoped that this epidemic will boost care and detection capacities in the near future.","Burkina Faso","abstract","2020-09-14",9

Due to the fact of the dynamic nature of the pandemic, more and continuous epidemiological models are needed for forecasting. Second, to analyze the impact of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using GCMR to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible.Despite the importance of forecasting the possible trajectory of the pandemic, as far as we know, the studies conducting predictions of cases and deaths in Egypt are still parsimonious and not timely updated to reflect the most recent situation. Saba and Elsheikh (2020) forecasted the possible number of cases in Egypt using statistical and artificial intelligence methods namely; Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Artificial Neural Networks. The study utilized the reported cases from 1 March to 9 May 2020 to forecast one month ahead until 8 June 2020. An increase of 280% in cases was estimated during May 2020. Similarly, El-Ghitany (2020) conducted a short-term prediction for the epidemic situation in Egypt based on data from February 14 until April 18, 2020. The researcher applied the exponential growth rate model to forecast the daily cases from 19 April to 6 June. The results implicated that by late May, infections are expected to reach more than 20,000 then starts to decline. In their study, Elmousalami and Hassanien (2020) provided daily forecasting models of Covid-19 cases by means of different time series models such as moving average (MA), weighted moving average, and single exponential smoothing. The results forecasted that the number of confirmed cases in Egypt would be doubled up to 4-folds in April. That is, they suggested that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in Egypt.Additionally, Anwar and AbdelHafez (2020) foreseen the expectant timing of coronavirus peak in Egypt. They employed the epidemic online calculator tool, which apply the Susceptible, Exposed, Infective and Removed model. In their study, the daily reports for the period 14 February to 11 May 2020 was utilized. The results indicated the number of hospitalized cases is predicted to reach a peak of 20,126 in the middle of June. While, a total of 12,303 deaths was expected. The research also claimed that the quarantine restrictions should be kept until the end of June 2020. Likewise, Tachy Health team applied a three-compartmental Susceptible-Infected-Recovered/Removed time-dependent epidemiological model, to examine the epidemic curve in four Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries namely; Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria. For Egypt, the results anticipated a probable peak 6 June 2020 assuming that 5% of the population is susceptible, reproduction number of 2.6 and a 1/14 recovery rate. Another two scenarios were to reach the highest number of infections at 18 June or 16 July based on different assumptions. However, no studies was found that made use of GCMR in Egypt.This section provides real-time actual data about the confirmed cases and death of Covid-19 in Egypt since the outbreak of the virus on mid-February 2020 until mid-September 2020. In addition, a track of Egyptians mobility and infections is presented.Obviously Egypt has experienced a long list of closures and policies aimed at encouraging citizens to stay at home. Consequently, the levels of mobility changed starting from 12 March 2020 when the government started imposing some restrictions such as schools and universities closing. At that time, the reported cases were 7 solely. Following, a night-time curfew has been imposed since March 24, 2020. Additionally, the Ministry of Awqaf [Endowment] declared the closure of the mosques and the places of worship nationwide until further notice. Figure 3 depicts how mobility to diferent destinations has altered in terms of percentage change from baseline. 3/2/2020 3/12/2020 3/22/2020 4/1/2020 4/11/2020 4/21/2020 5/1/2020 5/11/2020 5/21/2020 5/31/2020 6/10/2020 6/20/2020 6/30/2020 7/10/2020 7/20/2020 7/30/2020 8/9/2020 8/19/2020 8/29/2020 9/8/2020As mentioned earlier, the highest number of infections taken place at the second half of June. Notably, ten days prior to this latter date, movement to retail and recreational outlets and parks was 2% and 6% higher on average than its counterpart was at the first weeks of June. At the same time, the number of people staying home has dropped. Foundationally, visits to grocery shops and pharmacies started to increase starting from the beginning of June marking a possible reason that individuals embarked on applying self-isolation at homes following the Egyptian Health Minister Treatment protocol.Modeling and forecasting daily number of cases and deaths can help the health system provide services for the infected individuals and provide an insight for policy makers to design protective measures. Consequently, the econometric models could be of help in forecasting trajectories of the pandemic. In this study, both ARIMA model and ARDL model are employed to predict dailyconfirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19.Speaking of the utilized data, a total number of 192 days (from March 2, 2020 to September 8, 2020) were used to develop the ARIMA and ARDL models of new cases and deaths. The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) reports the official data regarding Covid-19 on a daily basis for instance, daily-confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths, as well as the total figures.In 2020, Google released GCMR for many countries including Egypt. These reports aim to give vision about the changes in response to the different policies aimed at alleviating Covid-19 consequences. The reports provide mobility alternations over time across different sets of places such as; retail and recreation covering visits to restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, museums, libraries and movie theaters, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations including subway stops and bus and train stations, workplaces, and residential places with respect to a baseline (Google LLC).In other words, the dataset highlights the percent change in visits to different categories of places. It depicts how the frequency and/or length of visits to categorized places change compared to baseline days. The baseline day corresponds to the median value from the 5-week period Jan 3 -Feb 6, 2020 (Ibid). Using this data one can assess the effect of mobility patterns on the spread of Covid-19.According to Lauer, et al. (2020) , the median incubation duration is 5.1 days (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. As a result, it is to be expected that any changes in mobility will have a lagged effect on detecting the new infections. Consequently, lagged values of the mobility elements and indicators are estimated by means of time series models.Number of new cases (NCases) and new deaths (NDeaths) on daily basis are used in the estimation as dependent variables in two different models to be forecasted over two months (9 September -7 November). Additionally, six independent variablesrepresent mobility alternations -are included in the econometric model of daily cases while onenew infections -is used for the deaths model.The ARIMA (p,d,q) model includes an autoregressive (AR) model and a MA model where p denotes the number of autoregressive terms, d the number of times the series has to be differenced before it becomes stationary, and q the number of moving average terms. The chief tools in identifying the parameters of the model are the ACF, the Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF) and the resulting correlograms. Having chosen a particular ARIMA model, and having estimated its parameters, the next step is checking whether the chosen model fits the data reasonably well. All the models that passes the residual tests should be compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). The model which has the least AIC is selected as the best model. Afterwards, the forecasting step based on the previously best-fit model is carried out.Until the beginning of the 1990s, static regression dominated the literature. It assumed that all the variables in the model are stationary. It has been proved that the macroeconomic data are mostly non-stationary; therefore, the OLS estimator does not produce reliable estimates and the regression tends to be spurious. Researchers use differenced variables in the model to obtain stationary variables, but in this case important information related to the long-run analysis is lost.The co-integration approach is very attractive since it retains the long-run relations and obtains highly consistent parameters in the long run (Stock, 1987) . However, there are integration and cointegration restrictions that the models have to overcome in order to apply this approach. Firstly, the ADF test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979 ) is used to examine the stationarity status of the variables in the different models. Pesaran, et al. (2001) proposed the ARDL approach of co-integration which can be applied and yields consistent estimates of the long-run parameters irrespective of whether the underlying variables are I(0), or I(1), or a combination of them. In addition, the ARDL approach permits different number of lags for each regressor to capture the data generation process in a general to specific framework (Feridun, 2009 ). The Monte Carlo results indicate that the ARDL approach works properly even when the model has endogenous regressors; the standard errors of the estimated coefficients are standard normal, therefore the standard critical values can be used and the diagnostic tests can be performed to evaluate the statistical performance of the models (Song, et al., 2009 ).where p, q, m, n, s, v, u are the optimal lags of level of the regressors: LnNCasest-i, Groceryt, Parkst, Recreationt, Resedentialt, Transitt, and Workplacest respectively, ∆ is the first difference operator, and σ 0 is a drift component. The left hand side of Equation (1) is the natural log of new cases (LnNCasest). The right hand side of the equation represents the explanatory variables in one lag in level, and in differences with the optimal lags for each variable; the independent variables represent six different measures of mobility alternations over time across different sets of places in Egypt. The parameters σ si correspond to the short-run relations, whereas and θ s correspond to the long-run relations; ϵ t is random errors.The Wald or F-statistic is used to test the joint significance of lagged levels of the variables in the UECM, and determine the existence of the long-run equilibrium under the null hypothesis of no co-integration (H 0 : = θ 1 = θ 2 = θ 3 = θ 4 = θ 5 = θ 6 = 0) against the alternative that a long-run relation exists (H 1 : ρ ≠ θ 1 ≠ θ 2 ≠ θ 3 ≠ θ 4 ≠ θ 5 ≠ θ 6 ≠ 0) in Equation (1). However, as discussed by Pesaran, et al. (2001) , both statistics have no standard distribution, irrespective of whether the regressors are purely I(0), purely I(1) or mutually co-integrated. Therefore, Pesaran, et al. (2001) computed two types of asymptotic critical values for a given significance level in the case of including and excluding trend. The first type assumes that all the variables are I(1), and the other assumes that all the variables are I(0). If the computed Wald or F-statistics exceed the upper critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected and the underlying variables are co-integrated. If the Wald or F-statistics are below the lower critical value, the null cannot be rejected and the variables are not co-integrated. Finally, if the Wald or F-statistic values lies between the two bounds, the test is inconclusive.Once a long-run relationship has been established by the bounds test, the long-run relations can be estimated as = − . Since j represents the independent variables in Equation (1), are the long-run coefficients of the different independent variables in the equation.Finally, the models have to undergo several statistical checking such as autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and stability test in order to ascertain their statistical reliability to be used in forecasting.An ex-post forecast (after the event forecast) is a forecast that is run in past periods for which actual values of the new cases and new deaths, in addition to the explanatory variables are available. The comparison of ex-post forecasts between different methods of estimation allows researchers to decide which method generates the best forecast, and therefore it can be used to produce ex-ante (before the event) forecasts (Nosier, 2012) . Ex-post forecasting in the present study aims to evaluate the forecasting performance of the ARDL co-integration estimates and ARIMA (p d q) estimates for comparison.The ARDL and ARIMA methods are re-estimated for the new cases and new deaths of Covid-19 models using daily data for the period from 2 nd of March to 25 th of August 2020. The estimated parameters are used to generate dynamic, ex-post forecasting over 14 days for the period (26 th of August -8 th of September 2020) for the two estimated models. Dynamic forecasting calculates dynamic, multi-step forecasts starting from the first period in the forecast sample. In dynamic forecasting, previously forecasted values for the lagged dependent variables are used in generating forecasts of the current value. This choice will be available for our models, since the estimated equation contains dynamic components, such as lagged dependent variables and ARIMA terms.The appropriate method of forecasting is chosen as the method, which has the least forecasting errors according to the forecasting error criteria, such as Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Mean Absolute Errors (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (SMAPE).Forecasting errors are defined as the differences between the actual and forecasted value over the period of the forecasting horizon, which are defined as:where LnNCases t is the actual value of the natural log of new cases in time t, LnNCasesF t is the forecasted value of the natural log of new cases in time t, is the forecasting errors in time t. In theory, for a well specified model, it is expected that the forecasting error has a mean of zero over a certain forecasting horizon. However, very small forecasting errors can be obtained even if the models are not well specified as a result of the existence of positive and negative forecasting error values, which cancel each other out. To solve this problem, measures of forecasting errors accuracy have been improved and the errors of Equation (2) transformed either to squared values ( 2 ) as in the RMSE in Equation (3), or to absolute values | | as in the MAE in Equation (4) (Song, et al., 2009) .In the present study, the three measures are used to compare forecasting accuracy between different methods for the same model, whereas the MAPE is used to compare forecasting accuracy even across the two models. Moreover, Lewis (1982) suggested the following interpretation of the resulting MAPE values: Less than 10% is highly accurate forecasts, 10%-20% is a good forecasting, 20%-25% is a reasonable forecasting, 50% or more is an inaccurate forecasting (Lewis 1982 , quoted in Tideswell, et al., 2001 ).Ex-ante forecasting is very important for decision-making for both the private and public sectors. Generating accurate and valid forecasts requires well specified, theoretically consistent and statistically robust econometric methods (Nosier, 2012) .Statistical diagnostics and stability tests should be performed to examine the validity of the estimated ARIMA and ARDL in forecasting the future new cases and deaths of Covid-19 in Egypt. Moreover, ex-post forecasting comparison is implemented to select the preferred method for each model. The picked best-fit models are utilized to forecast daily cases and deaths for 60 days using the whole time span of 192 days. A longer forecast horizon would result in increasing errors of the forecast variables, resulting in lack of robustness and accuracy of the econometric forecast (Lee, 2005) .In this section, the results of the estimated ARIMA and ARDL models are presented and discussed. Diagnostic tests are performed to the resulting estimates. If the used methods overcome the diagnostic and stability tests, we proceed by using the fitted models in generating ex-post and exante forecasting of daily cases and deaths in Egypt over a period of two months from the 9 th of September to the 7 th of November as stated before.In addition, ARIMA (1, 1, 4) is used to forecast the number of new deaths, as it is proved to have the best specification using the AIC, as shown by Figure 4 (B) . The model is significant at the 1% level of significance, however, it has weak explanatory power (R 2 = 0.29). The residuals have no first order autocorrelation according to DW statistic (2.05). However, using ARCH test, the residuals are heteroscedastic (F-statistic = 8.514, p-value=0.004). Finally, the model is stable (Fstatistic of RESET test=0.391, p-value=0.533). Therefore, the ARIMA model has no econometric problems, except for heteroscedasticity.Solving for the problem of heteroscedasticity in the two models; ARIMA-ARCH model is utilized to obtain homoscedastic residuals. Both ARIMA and ARIMA-ARCH models are utilized in the ex-post forecasting to choose the highest forecasting accuracy models, which have the lowest forecasting errors. .700.705.710.715.720.725.730.735The results of the ADF unit root tests are reported in Table 1 . At the 5% level of significance, the results indicate that LnNCasest is non-stationary, but stationary in first differences, I(1) variables, according to the appropriate trend-specification. All the other variables in the two models are found to be stationary variables, I(0). However, we proceed by estimating the co-integration relation of the two models, since we use the ARDL technique which permits a co-integration relationship to exist irrespective of whether variables have the same integrating order or not. The null hypothesis of no co-integration is rejected in the two models, indicating that there is a cointegration relation at the 1% level of significance for the two models over the period of the study. Therefore, we can proceed by estimating the long-run relationships between these variables. Note: The critical value of F is calculated at 6 independent variables in the Cases' model, and one independent variable in the Deaths' model. Constant without time trend is included in both models.Having determined the best ARDL specification for the two models and the long-run cointegration relation is detected, long-run steady-state parameters were estimated and examined statistically in the two models as illustrated in Table 3 .The models perform reasonably. The adjusted R 2 is very strong in both models, indicating strong explanatory power and the diagnostic tests indicate no statistical problems, except for heteroscedasticity in the new deaths' model. White-Hinkley (HC1) heteroscedasticity consistent standard errors and covariance is used to control the problem of heteroscedasticity in this model. Moreover, the two models are stable. Therefore, forecasting using these models can be performed accurately.For the cases' model, all the long-run coefficients are significant at the 1% level of significancebut the residential variable is not significant -indicating that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. As expected, a 1% increase in visits to grocery and pharmacy places, recreation areas, and workplaces compared with the base line is associated with higher incidence of Covid-19 by 14%, 30%, and 21% respectively at the 1% level of significance. However, the long-run coefficients of parks and transit have an unexpected negative sign. In the deaths' model, an increase in new cases by 1% tends to increase the new deaths by 0.72% on average in the long run.Speaking of the daily new cases, as illustrated before, ARIMA (4, 2, 1) was chosen as the best-fit model among other specifications. Regarding ARDL models, based on the same criterion, Dynamic ARDL (10, 3, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1) was selected as the best model. Concerning the daily deaths, the selected model is ARIMA (1, 1, 4) while Dynamic ARDL (9, 0) was picked. ARIMA-ARCH method for new cases and deaths models is also estimated and evaluated to treat the problem of heteroscedasticity in the ARIMA models.The performance of the chosen models of daily cases and deaths respectively are compared using different measures of forecasting error accuracy. Table 4 shows the forecast error of these models in terms of RMSE, MAE, MAPE and SMAPE over the period of 14 days.The graphical investigation confirms the latter results. Figure 6 and Figure 7 compare the results of the preceding methods for the ex-post period (26 August -8 September), and illustrate that ARIMA model provides the closest results to the actual data for daily cases, whereas Dynamic ARDL is the closest to the actual daily deaths. 8/26/2020 8/27/2020 8/28/2020 8/29/2020 8/30/2020 8/31/2020 9/1/2020 9/2/2020 9/3/2020 9/4/2020 9/5/2020 9/6/2020 9/7/2020 9/8/2020To generate ex-ante forecasting using econometric methods, the future values of the explanatory variables have to be forecasted first. The ARIMA method is used to forecast the future values of the explanatory variables of the two models before proceeding to forecasting the values of new cases and deaths. Table 5 illustrates the predicted values of infections and deaths at the end of each month of the forecasting horizon using different forecasting methods for each model for comparison. First, the outcomes of the selected methods of forecasting for the anticipated daily cases for 60 days (9 September-7 November) are depicted in Figure 8 . 8/27/2020 8/28/2020 8/29/2020 8/30/2020 8/31/2020 9/1/2020 9/2/2020 9/3/2020 9/4/2020 9/5/2020 9/6/2020 9/7/2020 9/8/2020According to Dynamic ARDL, the daily cases soar continually up to the end of the forecasting period to reach millions of cases. Caution needed when interpreting the latter results since the future values of the mobility variables are estimated without any restrictions on the full capacity of the different mobility places over time. Therefore, the increasing rate of movements to these places increases the number of new cases strongly as well.Although more data and information are needed, econometric models can be useful in predicting confirmed infections and deaths as well as future pandemic spread rates if the spread of the virus does not change very oddly. Undoubtedly, it is globally well known that this virus is new and has the potential to be highly transmissible in addition to growing fears of a powerful second wave. This ability may influence all expectations, but to our knowledge and time of estimation these models are among the best and most recent.Regarding the current situation in Egypt, the last month has witnessed the rise of the infection rate by 0.29% whilst the death rate has fallen by 0.27% and the recovery rate has increased by 23.54%. Obviously, this is due to the serious early list of closures and policies imposed by the Egyptian government which aimed at encouraging citizens to stay at home to stop the spread of infections.Chiefly, the results of the utilized models conclude that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly. As expected, an increase in mobility related to grocery and pharmacy places, recreational outlets, and workplaces by 1% is associated with higher incidence of Covid-19 by 14%, 30%, and 21% respectively. Therefore, the spread of Covid-19 is caused by increasing mobility, especially recreation places such as restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries and movie theaters, in addition to workplaces. Moreover, the spread of Covid-19 by 1% more tends to increase the possibility of deaths by 0.72% on average in the long run.Ex-post forecasting is performed for a period of two weeks (26 August -8 September) using both time series and econometric techniques to choose the most accurate forecast for each model to be used in the ex-ante forecasting of the new cases and new deaths models. ARIMA is the best for the new cases model, while Dynamic ARDL is the best for the new deaths model. Results of other forecasts, which obtained using different techniques, are also shown for comparison.Even if the pessimistic Scenario is less likely to occur according to our forecasting accuracy measures, policy makers have to put it into consideration for best control of the epidemic.Since the future of Covid-19 depends on the decisions made in addition to community engagement practices among others, countries should plan and be ready for any scenario. To maintain the expected trajectory of the pandemic in Egypt, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. Regarding the community role, social distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. In some countries such as England, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Norway, a 1-meter distance is recommended while, Germany and Spain endorsed a 1.5 meter and a 2-meter space is advised in Japan and South Korea (Han, et al., 2020) . Besides, following the declared health precautions and rules to ensure that infection is avoided or transmitted is 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 substantial. Consequently, maintaining good hygiene is of great importance, that is, wearing masks everywhere, frequently washing hands and staying home in case of being sick. It should also be noted that it is possible that this expected pattern will change, but this depends on the actions of the people that facilitate the work of the health system in each country.Speaking of the role of the government, plans of re-imposing lockdown are recommended, upon setting certain epidemiological threshold. To put it another way, some governments have marked 50 new cases per 100,000 residents per state for 7 continuous days as the threshold for re-closing. It is also recommended continuing working from home for those who are more vulnerable to infection while promoting distancing and hygiene rules for workers who will be physically present at workplaces. For the purpose of preventing more infections to happen, it is recommended to enhance the effective find, test, trace, isolate, and support systems. Hence, temperature checking needs to be generalized before entering different places in addition to using the sterilization gates.As a trial to prevent predicted deaths or to deal with possible second wave of infections especially following reopening, a support to the Egyptian health-system is crucial. That is increasing the number of hospitals equipped with intensive care units and ventilators for patients. Additionally, providing protective equipment for the medical sector staff and health-care workers.Moreover, it is advised to continue restricting flights from severely infected countries. While screening individuals coming from other countries and quarantine measures are essential to pick potential infections and prevent more transmission. Regarding internal mobility, additional trains and buses can be recommended to run to alleviate overcrowding, especially at peak times. Equally important is keeping restrictions on all different social gatherings to limit the further spread of the virus.These recommended strategies should support Egypt in stopping viral spread of the virus and avoid returning to full lockdown.","Egypt","first author","2020-09-30",9

Association of human ABO blood group types with many diseases is known from as early as 1950 th [5] and was recently reviewed by Liumbruno and Franchini [6] . For instance, individuals with non-O blood groups were more prone to develop coronary heart diseases and venous thromboembolism as compare to O blood type [7] . Another Malaysian group conducted a study to correlate between ABO blood group types with probabilities to develop diabetes mellitus, the study concluded that people with ""A"" and ""O"" group were with least chances of having diabetes [8] . ABO blood groups' susceptibilities to the different types of cancers were also studied. Individuals with B blood groups were found to have the least risk of gastrointestinal, colorectal, stomach, and bladder cancer [9] . Several studies have also reported close associations between ABO blood types and susceptibility to malaria contraction. Individuals with blood group ""A"" are highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection whereas blood group ""O"" is providing protection against severe malaria, the mechanism of this protection is based on the rosette formation phenomenon [10] . The same noticeable selectivity of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the malaria parasite with the ABO blood group system is proved to apply to SARS-COV-2. In which ""O"" blood people were with the least susceptibility to the virus infection whereas ""A"" blood type is with the highest risk [11, 12] . In Sudan several hematological studies were conducted at different states, to find the blood group dissemination pattern among populations, in which the ""O"" blood type was the dominant, followed by ""A"", then ""B"", and finally ""AB"" with slight differences among these studies [13, 14] . So far, there is no systematic study that has been done in the country to correlate between COVID-19 infection and the population's blood group types, therefore, in this study, we have investigated the possible correlation between blood groups and the acquisition of COVID-19. In addition, factors such as the previous infection with malaria, sex, age, diseases such as diabetes and hypertension as well as the number of symptoms suffered were also studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Sudan in specific and Africa in general, to correlate between ABO blood system and COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Statistical analysis: data were statistically analyzed using Statistical Packaged for Social Science (SPSS) Version-20. The significance of the results was investigated using one-tailed z-test at significance level P= 0.001, two-tailed binary logistic regression. One Way ANOVA test was used for the analysis of variance.Ethical consideration: All patients who participated in this questionnaire were informed about the aim and objectives of the study and they were agreed to participate. The ethical approval for the individuals who participated as control was obtained from the ethical committee of Omdurman Maternity Hospital.Among the 557 COVID-19 participants 234 (42%) were males whereas 323 (58%) were females; with female more likely to get COVID- 19 The dissemination of the blood group types among the participants' patients is shown in Table 1 ; 241 patients (43%) of the total study population were of ""O"" blood group (O+ve 39%, O-ve 4.5%). 180 patients (32%) were of A blood group (A+ve 30.9%, A-ve 1.4%). 102 patients (18.3%) had ""B"" blood group (B+ve 16.5%, B-ve 1.8%), and finally 34 patients (6.1%) of AB blood group (AB+ve 5.6%, AB-ve 0.5%). The susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is correlated to A +ve blood group (OR = 1.316, 95% CI 0.782 -2.215, P 0.05 = 0.008). questionnaire copies were filled online and submitted, of which 8 were improperly filled and therefore, excluded from the study.The gender ratio in the Sudan population is disaggregated into almost 1:1 males to females, however, based on the current study the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be more towards the females than the males, (1.4: 1). In surveyed 125 countries, areas, and territories, UNWOMEN reported that 54% of men were more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection than women [15] . The current results are also contradictory to the study performed in India in which male patients (76%) were significantly higher than the females (24%) [16] , whereas in China, the prevalence of the disease among both genders was of equal proportion, however, the mortality rate was more in men than women [17, 18] . Since this study was meant to explore the prevalence, no data about the mortality rate among genders were collected. Analysis of the demographic data of the 557 COVID-19 patients reported in this article revealed that around 86% of patients were between the ages of 19 -45 years, which indicates that most of those who got COVID-19 infection were in the working age. Of the 557 patients who filled the questionnaire only 22 (4%) were above 56 years. These results are similar to the one conducted in India [16] . Another study conducted in Italy revealed that the older ages are more susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection [19] . Since the only available continuous variable within the dataset is the age, we have performed One Way ANOVA test to correlate between the age and the patients' blood groups which has resulted in an insignificant correlation between these two factors (mean sample age= 32.7 years, α=0.05).It's worth mentioning that since this study was conducted online, older ages in a country like Sudan, are least exposed to the smartphone technologies, hence these results might not truly reflect a correct estimate for those seniors who contracted the disease.The region falls in the malaria-endemic zones (MEAs) is known with the lowest COVID-19 cases as compared to the countries that fall outside this zone [20] [21] [22] . MEAs remain a matter of scientific debate in justification of this limited spread [20] . In Sudan, the 1 st case of coronavirus was reported in the mid of February 2019, although the population doesn't follow strict social distancing instructed by medical regulations [23] , only around 12.5 thousands cases of COVID-19 were officially recorded after 6 months of the onset of the disease in Sudan. Reports that correlate the low incidences of COVID-19 cases in this zone with malaria infection are accumulating. Some hypotheses were already put forward to explain the reduced rate of COVID-19 rates in the MEAs. Thoughts like weather, environmental factors, and previous exposure to malaria drugs like hydroxychloroquine were discussed [20, 21, 24] . This relation was further supported by several in-common characters between the two diseases. Firstly both malaria and COVID-19 are observed to be interlinked with ABO blood group system, in which the ""O"" blood group is protected against the severe progression of the diseases, whereas blood group ""A"" is highly susceptible to infections. Secondly the use of anti-malaria drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, and recently artemisinin as potential choices for COVID-19 treatment [25] . Thirdly the finding that besides the use of the ACE2 receptor SARS-COV-2 could also invade cells through the interaction of spike protein with the CD147 receptor, a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f receptor that is used by the Plasmodium falciparum to cause malaria. Moreover, the nano-lipidMetadichol which inhibits SARS-COV-2 could equally suppress the Plasmodium falciparum from entering the erythrocytes [26, 27] . It was previously observed that the interaction between the virus glycoprotein (spike) and the host receptor is mediated by the virus' spike protein segment S1A of the domain S1 is a sialic acid-binding lectin that recognizes the sialic acid receptor on the host cell surface [28] . While Silva-Filho et al have hypothesized that the sialic acid-containing host receptors ACE2 and CD147 as the target for the spike agglutinin [29] . SARS-COV-2 through spike protein-basigin/CD147 interaction [30] . Blood groups have routinely been related to many ailments such as coronary heart diseases, cancer, and diabetes [8, 31] . A few articles have already been published testing for the relation between COVID-19 and the ABO blood group system [32, 33] . Studies have observed the susceptibility of ""A"" blood group individuals to SARS-COV-2 infection, whereas individuals with ""O"" blood group are protected against the severe progression of the disease. The current study didn't deviate from this concept, however, interestingly our study indicates that ""A"" blood group with the positive rhesus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f factor but not the negative one is more prone to contract the disease as compared to the control (P= 0.0008 ), the same applies to the individuals with AB+ve but not AB-ve. On the other hand, ""O"" positive but not ""O"" negative is shown statistically significant reduced number infections'tendency as compared to control (P=0.0006 ). Whereas no blood group effect was noticed with B blood group individuals. Testing the possible relation between the blood type and the asymptomatic patients gave insignificant results (not shown) which indicates that the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is only associated with the blood group rather than the symptoms [12] . Furthermore, the study corroborated that individuals with ""A"" Rh-positive but not Rh-negative are more vulnerable to contract the disease, whereas ""O"" Rh-positive rather than ""O"" Rhnegative is least exposed to severe symptoms of the pandemic. Though some of the data presented in this article replicate the Chinese findings, it remains unique with respect to the Rh factor, the variability of symptoms, and the gender infection profile. Moreover, since the Sudanese population is dominated by the ""O"" Rh-positive group this study might justify the low COVID-19 spreading rate in the country. Individuals with the blood group, ""A"" should observe maximum precaution to protect themselves against acquiring the infection, while this study shouldn't be considered by ""O"" blood carriers are a guarantee that would shield them from the disease, they must still be cautious to avoid increasing risk of infection [12] .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Sudan","abstract","2020-09-22",9

During the Wuhan epidemic in China, some cases of children under one year of age have been described [7] . e epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in China has shown that the average age of the patients was 51 years. e morbidity rate varied according to age where patients under 10 years of age represented 1% and those between 10 and 19 years of age represented also 1% of the 72,314 cases in Wuhan. e low number of cases among children and the high frequency of mild clinical symptoms deserve to be investigated [7] . Many risk factors for COVID-19 have been described in the literature, among which older age, asthma, and cardiovascular illnesses contribute significantly [3-5, 8, 9] to the disease. However, the impact of other factors including malnutrition in particular in low-income countries remains unknown. erefore, we aim to report a fatal case of COVID-19 in an eight-month-old infant with severe acute malnutrition at the Amirou Boubacar Diallo national hospital (HNABD) of Niamey, Niger.An eight-month-old male child presented with fever, diarrhoea, and difficulty in breathing was admitted to the paediatric ward of the Amirou Boubacar Diallo national hospital (HNABD) of Niamey. e mother of the child had fever and shortness of breath approximately four weeks prior to admission and subsequently died. Upon clinical examination, the child was lethargic with dehydration but without shock or cyanosis, and he weighed 5 kg and was 78 cm in height. e weight-for-height index was less than three Zscore, which corresponds to those with severe acute malnutrition. He had tachypnoea with a respiratory rate of 56 cycles/min, tachycardia at 148 heartbeats per minute, and temperature of 38.5°C. Oxygen saturation, measured with a pulse oximeter (SpO 2 ), was 90% in ambient air. e pulmonary examination revealed moderate respiratory distress with chest indrawing. Auscultation showed bronchial rales in the right pulmonary system, and the abdomen was flexible with moderate hepatomegaly.Based on clinical findings, the epidemic context of COVID-19, and the circumstances of the mother's death, there was a high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a result of which a nasal swab was taken immediately and sent to the Centre de Recherche Médicale et Sanitaire (CERMES), a National Reference Laboratory for respiratory viruses. Virological analysis was conducted using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). e blood count was normal, the plasma test was negative, and blood glucose was 1.42 g/L. e renal function and blood ion gram were normal. e chest X-ray showed features of pneumonic consolidation in the right lung ( Figure 1 ). Treatment started immediately with oxygen therapy at 1 l/min, and a combination of ceftriaxone (75 mg/kg/day) and gentamycin (3 mg/kg/day) was instituted. Finally, dietary support was provided with therapeutic milk using a feeding tube.e clinical course was marked by severe respiratory distress and the gradual decrease of SpO 2 , despite oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, the child died 48 hours following admission. e laboratory diagnosis confirmed an infection by SARS-CoV-2 a few hours after the child's death.is clinical case recounts a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in an eight-month-old infant with severe acute malnutrition. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a case of COVID-19 was noticed in an infant with severe acute malnutrition in Niger. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR by the CERMES of Niamey from nasal swab.COVID-19 lower respiratory tract infections are rare and often milder among children in general and infants in particular [7] . erefore, the presence of comorbidity could play an important role in its occurrence [4, 5] . In the study of Shekerdemian et al., the majority of affected children had comorbidities [10] . In this observation, it was a severe acute malnutrition. Malnourished children have an increased susceptibility to infections compared with normally nourished children due to immune system deficiency [11] . Malnutrition is therefore a susceptibility factor for COVID-19 infection. In Niger where malnutrition is common, special attention should be paid to children. Pneumonia is also one of the common infectious complications with these children. However, given the higher risk of clinical severity, monitoring is also recommended. e source of infection for children in most cases is within their family [4-7, 10, 12] . e child's infection could have occurred from his late mother who developed all related symptoms, although laboratory testing was not carried out.COVID-19 clinical data among children are limited. In the cases reported among infants, the infection was relatively uncomplicated [6] . Symptoms were generally less severe than for adults with variables symptoms like fever, dry cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea or vomiting [3, 6] .is clinical case initially presented anorexia and diarrhoea for two weeks. Malnutrition may have induced deficiency of the immune system, resulting in the severity and subsequent fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the radiological level, frosted glass is also the predominant sign in paediatric population. e ""halo"" sign, corresponding to a nodular opacity surrounded by a crown of frosted glass, is more frequently found with children than adults [3, [12] [13] [14] .Case management is difficult in the context of limited personnel and equipment resources. Protection and isolation measures must be scrupulously applied in order to limit the spread of the virus and monitoring is recommended to detect and manage cases. Adequate hydration as well as sufficient calorie intake must be provided [6] . In the absence of an effective vaccine and specific treatment available, it is essential to strengthen COVID-19 diagnosis as early as possible. is is a first clinical case that documents the comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe acute malnutrition. e limitations to the management of this case were due to the mother's missing COVID-19 infection status.SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare in children but presents with a variety of symptoms. e history of contact with a suspected case should lead to a request for laboratory confirmation, especially if there is comorbidity. In the absence of a vaccine and specific treatment, early diagnosis will result in better management of patients and therefore limit the spread of the infection.e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.SA, MML, and SA wrote the manuscript; KM, MAD, GM, DB, LA, and EAO managed the patient; SIA and IML read and corrected the manuscript.","Niger","abstract","2020-09-24",9

Results: Among the 118 pediatricians eligible for the survey, 101 responded (85.6%) of whom 61.2% were women. The pediatric outpatient consultations dropped significantly from 60.4% of pediatricians seeing more than 30 patients per week before the pandemic to 9.9% during the pandemic (p < 0.000). According to the occupancy rate of hospitalization beds, 45.5% of pediatricians reported having 76-100% of pediatric hospitalization beds occupied per week before the pandemic but no pediatrician reported a similar rate during the pandemic (p < 0.000). There was a significant increase in the use of telehealth, ranging from no pediatrician using telehealth ""very frequently"" before the pandemic to 23.8% using it during the pandemic (p < 0.000). Most of the pediatricians had at their disposal surgical masks (96%), care gloves (80.2%), hydroalcoholic gel (99.0%), and soap and water (86.1%). For the management of children, 90.1% and 71.3% of pediatricians experienced difficulties accessing COVID-19 PCR and chloroquine, respectively, and 74.3% declared difficulties for proper isolation of patients. More than half (65.3%) of the pediatricians interviewed were ""very afraid"" or ""extremely afraid"" of being infected with SARS-Cov-2, respectively, 45.5% and 19.8%. The most frequent reasons included fear of infecting their relatives (85.1%) and of developing a severe form of the disease (43.6%). The reluctance to consult health services expressed by the parents was due to: fear of being infected when leaving their home and especially in the health facility (96%), strict compliance with confinement (30.7%), and financial difficulties of families (13.9%). Conclusion: This work highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the clinical activity of Cameroonian pediatricians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in the use of health facilities, which probably has a negative impact on children's overall level of health. Although the preventive measures explain this drop in attendance at health facilities, the parents' fear of being infected when leaving the house was the predominant reason likely to explain this drop in attendance at health facilities. This could constitute an axis for developing messages to parents to encourage a gradual return to child health services.In December 2019, an increasing number of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, a city in central China with a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) rapidly identified as the causative agent [1] [2] [3] . On February 11, 2020, Although children are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms compared with adults, the pandemic has brought other issues such as the missing out on vaccinations due to postponement of campaigns and interruptions in routine immunization [7] [8] [9] .In Cameroon, a significant drop in the number of visits to health facilities was observed with a decrease in consultations and pediatric hospitalizations among others. The purpose of this survey was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical activity of pediatricians in Cameroon. The questionnaire asked about sociodemographic data of the respondents: gender, age,year of start of practice as pediatrician, mode and city of practice. A second section was devoted to the description of daily practice before the pandemic and questioned the number of consultations per week, the number of hospital beds available, as well as their occupancy rate on the one hand and the use of telehealth on the other hand. A third section was dedicated to collecting the information cited above, but this time during the pandemic. The fourth section asked the participants about their treatment approach for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 children. A fifth section was dedicated to the evaluation of the availability of personal protective equipment and devices as well as their use before and during the pandemic and the last point evaluated the pediatricians' fear of being infected and the main reasons for this fear as well as the main reasons stated by parents for postponing visits to health facilities during the pandemic.The data were collected via the Excel sheet automatically generated by GoogleForms and exported for analysis in SPSS version 23 software.Among the 128 pediatricians registered in the ""Information SOCAPED"" WhatsApp group, 118 were eligible to respond to the questionnaire, 10 were excluded for the following reasons: one duplicate, one pediatric resident, two general practitioners, four practicing out of Page 5 of 21 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 the country, two retired from active practice. Finally, 101 pediatricians responded to the questionnaire giving a response rate of 85.6%. Women were the most represented in the profession 62 (61.2%) compared with men 39 (38.6%), giving a sex ratio of 0.6. The mean age of Cameroonian pediatricians was 46.9 ± 9.5 years, while the mean years of practice experience was 11.9 ± 8.7 years. The majority of participants were primary care pediatricians 60 (59.4%), having a mixed practice both in the hospital and in private practice for 50 (49.5%) of them and located essentially in Yaoundé 49 (48.5%) and in Douala 43 (42.6%).Regarding the work environment of pediatricians, the majority 50 (49.5%) reported working in health facilities with more than 30 hospitalization beds available. The rest of the respondents reported a number of beds varying from 1 to 10 beds, 11 to 20 beds, and 21 to 30 beds in 15.8%, 9%, and of cases 16.8%, respectively. Nine pediatricians (8.9%) did not have any bed for hospitalization in their health facility (Table 1 ).Concerning the pediatric outpatient consultations, 61 pediatricians (60.4%) reported seeing more than 30 patients per week before the COVID-19 pandemic as compared with 10 (9.9%) consulting more than 30 children per week during the 4 weeks preceding the survey (p < 0.000). According to the occupancy rate of hospitalization beds, 46 pediatricians (45.5%) reported having 76-100% of pediatric hospitalization beds occupied per week before the COVID-19 pandemic. No pediatrician recorded such a high rate during the 4 weeks precedingWith 118 pediatricians practicing in Cameroon in 2020 for an estimated population of more than 25 million inhabitants, Cameroon has 0.47 pediatricians per 100,000 population. This rate is similar to that of other African countries (0.03-0.8 per 100,000 population) but lower than European figures (11-86 pediatricians per 100,000 population in the UK and Germany) [10] . The female predominance in the profession has been reported in other studies [11] . This survey showed that the majority of pediatricians (91.0%) practice in Douala and Yaoundé, resulting in an uneven distribution of pediatric care offered in the rest of the country. to the best of our knowledge, not yet been described [12] . This decrease in attendance at health immunizations, but also on curative care. Children treated for chronic conditions, for example, could miss follow-up appointments, could experience treatment breaks that may lead to a deterioration in their state of health. Another aspect of this drop in attendance could be delayed consultations and late management of childhood illnesses. Finally, in our sociocultural context, there could be a higher risk that parents of sick children more frequently use alternatives such as advice from pharmacists or, even worse, street drugs, traditional medicine, or prayers to treat their children.Regarding the use of telehealth, our survey shows a significant increase in the use of telehealth by the pediatricians during the pandemic. In the developing world and particularly in Africa, the use of telehealth is still sporadic [13] . In Cameroon, very little is known about this healthcare modality [14] . Even in the United States, before the COVID-19 outbreak, many health systems and especially pediatricians had low rates of telehealth utilization for routine care [15, 16] . The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all healthcare systems, hospitals, and clinics to rapidly implement telehealth services [17] . In Cameroon, to the best of our knowledge, active telemedicine networks are scarce. Pediatricians consider telehealth to be a real need, which is simply exacerbated by the restrictive measures imposed by the pandemic. While it is true that there are limits to telehealth, it could be very useful in keeping in touch with patients and families and in continuing to follow up and disseminate prevention messages.Half of the pediatricians surveyed (53.5%) stated that they would administer a treatment for COVID-19-positive children even if they are asymptomatic. Although there is no scientific evidence to reject the decision to treat an asymptomatic child presenting with a positive COVID-19 PCR result, this decision should take into account several conditions [18] . This work highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the activity of Cameroonian pediatricians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, pediatricians have recorded a very significant drop in the use of health facilities, the respecting of preventive measures (especially strict confinement) being one of the reasons to explain this situation, which probably has a negative impact on the overall health of children. Moreover, the parents' fear of being infected when leaving the house to visit a health facility was the main potential reason explaining this drop in attendance at health facilities and could constitute an axis for developing messages to parents to encourage a gradual return to child health services. The survey also evokes the difficulties linked to personal protective equipment, access to diagnostic and treatment means, as well as the pediatricians' fear vis-à-vis the pandemic.

The disease has since spread across many countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global pandemic in February 2020 [3] .Over 5,590,358 cases of COVID-19 infections have been confirmed globally and over 347,907 mortalities have since been recorded globally [4] . During the time this study was being conducted, the most affected countries were China, Italy, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the USA [5] .

As the pandemic began to take its toll on Africa, it's devastating impact was anticipated [6, 7] .In Zambia, the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on 18 th March 2020, and since then, the number of confirmed cases has been increasing steadily [8] . In order to curb the spread of the disease, a scalable national response has seen the activation of a public health emergency response mechanism spearheaded by the Ministry of Health through the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) [9] . Key activities in this response include enhancing disease surveillance, health human resource capital development, case detection and management in designated public healthcare facilities, restrictions on social gatherings and non-essential travel, disease prevention, and health promotion among other strategies [9] .The rate at which the disease was spreading globally, WHO feared that most health systems would be strained particularly in Africa, and thus there was a need for a multisectoral action to find containment solutions. One of the key sectors to consider as part of the solutions was the community pharmacies [10] . According to the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce at community and hospital pharmacies and clinical biology laboratories are capable of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus disease, advising the public, and supporting the efficient management of infection by healthcare systems.Community pharmacists were usually the first points of contact for members of the community seeking primary health care services and access to medicines and pharmaceutical products in Zambia [11, 12] . With cases of COVID-19 on the rise in Zambia, there was an urgent need for health system managers to enhance the national response by maximising the use of currently available health workforce and resources. It is therefore vital at this time of the pandemic that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and fully utilise any unrealised potential among healthcare providers across the continuum of care. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services [13] .Community pharmacists, therefore, need to position themselves to not only provide pharmaceutical services but further prevent the spread of the virus thereby contributing greatly to combating the pandemic in Zambia. As a starting point, we assessed the preparedness of pharmacists serving in the community retail pharmacy sector to participate in the frontline national response to COVID-19 in Zambia. Specifically, we determined their knowledge about COVID-19, technical guidelines for case detection, and screening, including availability and use of PPE in the pharmacy. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies, and policymakers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19. This information could help inform health system managers' future decisions and considerations about prudent use of the available health workforce, restructuring of existing health services, and response strategies by ZNPHI and other state actors involved in the response to public health emergencies such as COVID-19.This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey involving community pharmacists providing pharmaceutical services in retail pharmacy outlets across Zambia. This study was conducted among community pharmacists because they are among the first point of contact with patients in the communities.The sample size was purposive and included all community pharmacists in registered pharmacies as at close of 2019. The total number of registered pharmacies in the country was obtained from Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority (ZAMRA) at the time of this study was 393 [19] . As per statutory requirements, each registered community retail pharmacy is managed by a registered pharmacist. The response rate was 300 out of 393 giving a percentage response rate of 76.3%.An online questionnaire with closed-ended questions was sent to selected community pharmacists using Google forms. The questionnaire was pre-tested by administering it to 10 community pharmacists in Lusaka and it was validated for consistency. The questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data on participants' knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, prevention strategies, national recommended screening and testing protocols, level of preparedness to participate in the frontline, and use of personal protective equipment.Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23. Frequencies and proportions were used to describe the data. The findings were presented in form of tables.Ethical approval was granted by the University of Zambia Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (UNZAHSREC) with an Ethics Approval of Protocol ID Number 20203101007.Among the 300 community pharmacists that responded, the majority (97%, n=291) adequately knew the common signs and symptoms of COVID-19, 83% (n=249) knew the national guidelines for COVID-19 screening criteria, and 93% (n=279) were aware that a suspected case of COVID-19 presenting to the pharmacy needed to be alerted to the Ministry of Health or the national response team. Only 59% (n=177) knew they also needed to self-isolate and self-report should they experience symptoms of COVID-19 (Table 2) . About 76% (n=228) indicated the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the pharmacy while 85% (n=255) stated that PPE was insufficient in their pharmacies (Table 3) . Generally, preventive measures were being implemented in community pharmacies ( Table 4 ). The majority (87%, n=261) were able to provide initial screening and referral of suspected cases of COVID-19. Overall, community pharmacists were prepared to participate in the frontline fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia (Table 5 ). However, PPE was inadequate in the majority of the community pharmacies.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health disaster that started in China and spread to the rest of the world [20] . In curbing this public health problem, the FIP has made several recommendations that community pharmacists can utilize [10]. This study focussed on the knowledge and preparedness of community pharmacists in the fight against COVID-19 as frontline workers.It is therefore prudent for health authorities to consider ways in which community pharmacists can be effectively utilised in the public health response to COVID-19. This will ensure that access to medicines by communities is maintained in the continuum of care during this difficult time.Pharmacists in Zambia being highly knowledgeable and capable could be key partners in the multisectoral fight against the spread of COVID-19 infection as recommended by the FIP and WHO [10, 17, 21] . With the health system in Zambia already strained just like in many African countries, community pharmacists could offer screening, testing, and referral services for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. This is also in tandem with other research that reported the role of pharmacists in public health emergencies such as COVID-19 [22] . Also, during this pandemic, pharmacists should be allowed to test and treat certain conditions and perform certain acts independently of a physician such as supplying medication for chronic illnesses like HIV, asthma, hypertension, and diabetes without requesting clients for a prescription [23] . Such legislation would reduce the burden on healthcare facilities and primary care providers, nurses, and physicians as well as patients, especially those living in remote and rural areas [18] .Community pharmacists, being the first contact point for patients in communities, were at a greater risk of contracting the virus due to inadequate PPE and infection control. Though generally available, PPE was limited mainly to surgical masks and gloves. Pharmacies lacked protective gowns, foot protective wear, and eye-protective goggles. Pharmacists reported frequent hand washing especially after attending to clients, using alcohol-based hand rubs or hand sanitizers, and wearing surgical face masks. They did not, however, wear gloves, restrict the use of phones and swab swiping machines which could be routes of infection transmission.Social distance was practised despite a good number of them not having labelled the floor. Those that had labelled the floor used the recommended minimum distance of 1 metre. Similarly, Putt stated that in the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were pumping out much more volume with much less support, including proper PPE.Sheppard and Thomas stated that, with the emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic, there was a need for healthcare providers to reinforce behaviours that limited the spread of the pandemic which included social distancing and remaining in the homes whenever possible [15] .They further stated that community pharmacists could reinforce mitigation behaviours by applying the health belief model (HBM) [15] . FIP also charges that community pharmacists had a key role in preventing the spread of the 2019-CoV virus [10]. They were charged with key responsibilities of informing, advising, and educating the community and maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products [17] .Given the preparedness and willingness of community pharmacists, governments have the opportunity to include them in risk communication and community engagement. Community pharmacists are frontline workers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic because they interact face-to-face with patients in the provision of pharmaceutical services [25] . In most cases, community pharmacists may not be seen as healthcare professionals despite their importance in the provision of healthcare services [26]. Putt stressed out that pharmacists were more essential than most people thought [16] . He pointed out that pharmacists were working on the front lines to ensure patient while putting themselves at risk every single day [16] . In Taiwan, as a result of the pressure that was mounting up due to COVID-19, the government had to allow all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies to have access to patients' travel history in order to curb the spread of the deadly infection [14] . Cadogan and Hughes have also stressed out the need to incorporate community pharmacists as they had a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic.They noted that the scope of community pharmacy practice varied considerably across countries, hence there was a need to examine ways in which the profession could assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services [13] .and educating the community while maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products [17, 27] . Community education plays a vital role in the prevention and curbing of diseases such as COVID-19 [28, 29] . Community pharmacists are ready to deal with COVID-19 based on their awareness and roles [30] . Therefore, community pharmacy practice should be strengthened and utilized in the fight against COVID-19.This study is the first study conducted in Zambia on the knowledge and preparedness of community pharmacists as frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, from literature, it is among the few studies realizing the importance of community pharmacists as cardinal practitioners in the fight against COVID-19. The study was conducted country-wide in Zambia, this means that the results can be generalized to represent all community pharmacists registered and practicing in Zambia.If these findings are taken into consideration, they would help address the workforce gaps by enabling community pharmacists to actively participate in the frontline national response to COVID-19. This also presents as an opportunity to scale up screening and detection of possible COVID-19 cases and there would be continued pharmaceutical care services through the supply of medicines to clients who may not have an opportunity to access medical care.This was an online-based cross-sectional survey that utilised a structured questionnaire. The structured questionnaire may lead to a form of bias and hence affect the study findings. This study cannot be generalized among hospital pharmacists as it only focussed on community pharmacists.We ask ourselves certain questions: What are the psychological impacts of COVID-19 among community pharmacists? Will the Ministry of Health engage community pharmacists as frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19? Therefore, these questions remain unanswered and will thus form the basis of future research with regards to pharmacists and COVID-19.• COVID-19 affects everyone and requires a multisectoral approach in order to curb it • Community pharmacists are the first point of contact with members of the community that require access pharmaceutical services• Community pharmacists must be empowered to work as frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19• Community pharmacists must be prepared to fight COVID-19Acknowledgements: We would like to thank all the community pharmacists who participated in this survey.All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Funding: This study received no external funding.Authors' contributions: All authors conceptualized and designed the study.

Following its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the disease was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 th March 2020 and has since become a major disruptor of health systems and life in general (WHO, 2020a (WHO, , 2020b . As of September 2020, there have been over 24 million confirmed cases, including almost 850,000 deaths globally (WHO, 2020b) . This has come on the heels of significant gains in global maternal mortality where there has been a 50% reduction in deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth over the past two decades. In 2017, the WHO estimated that there were 295,000 maternal deaths worldwide (WHO et al., 2019) . However, modelled estimates from a study published early on in the COVID-19 pandemic predicted that between 8·3 and 38·6% increase in maternal deaths should be expected per month across 118 countries (Roberton et al., 2020) . Such increments do not bring countries any closer to achieving the global consensus target for the next decade of reducing maternal mortality ratio to 70 per 100,000 live births (United Nations, 2016) .Nigeria accounts for 25% of the global maternal deaths, with 512 maternal deaths reported per 100,000 live births (National Population Commission and ICF International, 2019; WHO et al., 2019) . Approximately 60% of maternal deaths in the country occur either during delivery (intrapartum) or six-week period after delivery (post-partum), with the leading causes of deaths being bleeding, high blood pressure, and infection in pregnancy (Merdad and Ali, 2018) . Access to skilled health personnel to provide skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care (EmOC) have been shown to reduce maternal mortality by as much as 50% and stillbirths by between 45 and 75% (Paxton et al., 2005) . However, while multiple factors contribute to limiting access to these essential maternity services, one key barrier that has been widely documented is the cost of service utilization (WHO et al., 2019) . In Africa, almost all women (97%) are delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) or caesarean delivery (CD), which can be elective (planned) or emergency (Bailey et al., 2017) . Guidelines have been published on how both SVD and CD should be provided to pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Nigeria in line with global guidance . However, do these revamped services, which are deemed essential to be maintained even during the pandemic (WHO, 2020c) , come at an additional cost to women?The 2020 World Health Statistics Report showed that 15.1% of the Nigerian population has household expenditure on health which is more than 10% of their total household expenditure or income, a benchmark used to define catastrophic health expenditure (WHO, 2020d) . This estimate is more than twice the rate in the WHO Africa region (7.3%) (WHO, 2020d) . Before the advent of COVID-19, there were already established concerns with access to skilled health personnel and EmOC for the poorest women, who account for about three-quarters of maternal deaths (GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators, 2016 . Many families were shown to be shouldering maternal health service utilization costs beyond their capabilities, with transgenerational ramifications (Miller and Belizán, 2015) . However, the many indirect effects of COVID-19 which had been previsioned including the disruption of health systems and the consequences of the lockdown measures implemented by many countries across the globe (Roberton et al., 2020) , including Nigeria, brings a need to focus on the cost of utilizing essential maternity services in the middle of the pandemic. This is particularly critical for areas that have been most severely affected. Lagos is the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria with over 18,255 laboratory-confirmed and 202 deaths, compared to the national average of 1,480 cases and 28 deaths, as of 4 th September 2020 (NCDC, 2020a) . The objective of this study is to identify and assess out-of-pocket (OOP) cost for access and utilization of maternity services for childbirth amongst pregnant women with COVID-19 in Lagos, Nigeria.LUTH is an 800 bedded tertiary referral hospital which provides health services to the over 20 million population of Lagos State (United Nations, 2019) and residents of surrounding states. Annually, the obstetrics and gynaecology department manages over 2,000 deliveries, including referrals from other secondary hospitals in the state. LUTH managed the first pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 in Nigeria. The hospital subsequently put together a multidisciplinary team of obstetricians, anaesthetists, neonatologists, nurses, psychiatrists and infectious disease control experts to provide care for these women (Ishola, 2020; Makwe et al., 2020) .For our study, the inclusion criterion was pregnant women with COVID-19 who delivered at LUTH, either by SVD or CD at term or near term. Pregnant women who delivered outside the hospital and were subsequently admitted for management of complications post-delivery, those admitted into private wards and those exempted from paying user fees were excluded. The reason for excluding these groups was that their fees to utilize care would not be the most reflective of the general population. Women were only approached after their discharge from hospital to ensure that cost of care could be fully captured. All nine pregnant women recruited for the study had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were managed in LUTH between 1 st April 2020 and 31 st August 2020.Leveraging guidance from a recently published systematic review on cost of utilising maternal health services in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Banke-Thomas et al., 2020), we collected data on direct cost components spent within the facility (during admission), outside the facility (household), opportunity (loss of productivity) costs and any other relevant costs that women claimed to spend for their care. All of these made up total cost of service utilization. We noted any exemptions and donations that reduced the cost paid by women for service utilization.Facility-based costs included cost paid for hospital admission, service fee, medicines, diagnostics, medical supplies and food. In capturing these costs, we separated facility-based costs related to the obstetric care of the women from those of their COVID-19 care. A detailed review of patient financial account records in the hospital was used to capture all facility-based costs. For this facility-based cost data, a verification process of double-checking was put in place to ensure there were no errors. For comparison, we collected data on the standard facility-based cost of SVD and CD for booked (registered) and un-booked (unregistered) pregnant women pre-COVID-19 as well as cost of the same services for pregnant women who presented during the COVID-19 pandemic but were not infected with COVID-19 from hospital financial records.Household costs were those spent on transportation to and from the facility as well as the cost of childcare while on admission. Opportunity costs included loss of productivity of the caregiver who supported the woman during her admission as well as women who are self-employed and were not making any income while on admission. For this, we collected data on the monthly income of self-employed women and all the caregivers of women who were physically present to support them while on admission. In addition, we collected data on any other costs as reported by the women. In cases in which the woman could not recollect cost that was spent while on admission, she asked her husband/relatives who supported her while on admission to fill in the gaps. A pre-tested online tool was administered to women to collect the relevant household, indirect and other cost data. For this, this cost of travel was deemed to be to and from the facility. For costs related to childcare and loss of productivity, the consensus principle of allocation known as the full absorption cost principle was applied, ensuring that only the included cost was allocated to services based on actual utilization (Mogyorosy and Smith, 2005) . To achieve this, we only included a pro-rated cost of the typical monthly cost related to the number of days that the women spent on admission.Participation in the study was entirely voluntary and written informed consent was obtained from each participant who agreed to take part with no financial incentive offered. Since the study was conducted after discharge, participation or otherwise had no bearing on their care. Women were also informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Also, anonymity of patients was maintained in reporting study findings. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTHHREC/EREV/0520/24).The age of pregnant women with COVID-19 who presented at the hospital was from 22 to 40 years, with a median age of 33 years. All nine women were married and had attained tertiary education. Six of the women were employed, one self-employed and the remaining two were unemployed. The spouses of all 9 women were gainfully employed.Of the nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 included in the study, two remained symptomatic while on admission presenting with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the other seven were asymptomatic until discharge. In terms of the obstetric characteristics of the included women, their expected gestational age (EGA) ranged from 33 to 40 weeks. Seven of the nine women presented with no obstetric complications during the index pregnancy, one woman presented with high blood pressure in pregnancy (preeclampsia) and another with bleeding due to abruption of the placenta. For mode of delivery, there were eight CDs (Case 1-8). Five cases were done as an elective (Case 1-5), and the other three were emergency (Cases 6-8). All CDs were done under spinal anaesthesia. Case 9 was the only patient who gave birth via SVD [ Table 1 ].For facility-based costs, the hospital management exempted all COVID-19 patients from paying the service fee, ward admission and feeding, in line with the Federal Government's directive for the management of COVID-19. In addition, laboratory confirmation for COVID-19 by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test was free, including the serial testing required by the patient until they were confirmed negative. Furthermore, with support from the Federal Government, international agencies, some Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), charities, and philanthropic personnel, some personnel protective equipment (PPE) including N95 masks, protective gowns, gloves, face shields and aprons were made available to skilled health personnel to support safe provision of care, at no cost to the women.For the costs still required, the woman who had SVD paid a total of US$228 (N87,750). Cost of additional personal protective equipment (PPE) required for their care was the major cost driver (50%). This was followed by supplies (20%) and obstetric diagnostics (17%). For ELCD, facility-based cost ranged from US$749 (N287,950) to US$1,109 (N426,685), with a median cost of US$903 (N347,495). Major cost drivers for ELCD were PPE (50%), medicines (28%), and medical supplies (14%). Excluding the cost of additional supplemental oxygen required by women who had severe COVID-19 symptoms, EMCD cost from US$719 (N276,445) to US$1,517 (N583,478). The major cost drivers were medicines (35%), PPE (32%), and diagnostics (18%). Based on severity of COVID-19 symptoms, cost ranged from US$228 (N87,750) for a woman with mild disease who was on admission for four days and gave birth via SVD to US$2,939 (N1,130,498) paid by a woman who had severe COVID-19 symptoms requiring additional supplemental oxygen extra-operatively while on admission. For this latter case (Case 7), the woman also had to pay for additional investigations required to manage the ARDS, including chest x-ray and arterial blood gases. For this case, medical oxygen required to manage severe COVID-19 symptoms was the major cost driver (48%), followed by medicines (20%), and medical supplies (14%) [ Table 1 ].Despite the cost exemptions, there are significant cost differences between facility-based cost paid by pregnant women with COVID-19 and those paid in the pre-COVID-19 era when all pregnant women were required to pay a service fee and ward admission. During the pandemic, the cost of SVD has more than doubled the cost paid by a booked pregnant woman pre-COVID (US$113 (N43,400). For CD, excluding medical oxygen, the average facility-based cost of all eight CD patients (US$984 (N364,551)) is about 2.5 times more than what women paid pre-COVID (US$384 (N147,660)) [ Table 1 and Table 2 ].[Insert Table 3] [Insert Supplementary Data: Scenario testing for exemptions and donations influencing out-of-pocket costs]This study was conducted to identify and assess the out-of-pocket cost of childbirth services for women in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are paying significantly higher fees for SVD and CD, despite cost exemptions on certain cost components that have been instituted. The major driver in this increased cost of utilization relates to the PPEs required for care of patients infected with mild COVID-19. Medical oxygen is the major cost driver when pregnant women present with severe COVID-19 and require long admission in the hospital.Regarding facility-based cost of utilising care, we found that pregnant women with COVID-19 are paying as much as US$228 (N87,750) for SVD when they have mild COVID-19 and US$2,939 (N1,130,498) for EMCD when they present with severe COVID-19. In a 2020 systematic review, authors reported that the median cost of utilising SVD across LMICs was US$40 in a public hospital while CD was US$178 in public hospitals (Banke-Thomas et al., 2020) . Our findings suggest that COVID-19 pregnant women are paying six times more for SVD and as much as 16 times more if they have severe COVID-19 and require CD. As per the same 2020 systematic review (Banke-Thomas et al., 2020), the facility-based cost being estimated for SVD is almost equal to the highest cost reported for private hospital SVD use in Nepal of US$295 . Similarly, our mean facility-based cost for CD for pregnant women with COVID-19 of US$1,132 is over twice the highest cost for the same service in private hospitals in India (US$497) after transport and opportunity costs have been excluded (Banke- Thomas et al., 2020) . This finding is particularly concerning, especially as most women receive care from public hospitals, which are viewed as a cornerstone for achieving universal health coverage in LMICs (Sachs, 2012) .It is established that tertiary hospitals like LUTH are significantly more expensive for care compared to secondary and primary facilities, mostly because of the specialist expertise that is concentrated therein (Banke- Thomas et al., 2020) . However, it is important to keep in mind that the standard cost for an unbooked patient managed in LUTH pre-COVID (US$464 [ Table 2 ]) is still less than the maximum obtainable cost reported for another Nigerian teaching hospital (US$667) in 2013, as per published peer-reviewed literature (Adamu et al., 2013) , though it is deemed exorbitant by many Nigerian women (Wright et al., 2017) . In our study, pregnant women with COVID-19 are paying as much as two times more for SVD and three times more facility-based costs for CD when compared to the pre-COVID era. This is despite the governmentmandated cost exemptions on certain cost components that have been instituted and the donations that have been received to support care provision (Alagboso and Abubakar, 2020; Igomu, 2020b; Naeche, 2020) . The major driver in this increased cost of utilization for SVD and ELCD relates to the PPEs required for care of patients infected with COVID-19. Yet, our findings show that pregnant women are not even being required to pay for all the PPE that is used to support their care. This emergence of PPEs as major cost drivers (as much as 50%) is concerning. Previously, though cost drivers varied by country, most reported that medicines and supplies, transport, and lodging were the major cost drivers that women had to tackle to access care (Banke-Thomas et al., 2020) . However, there is also the emergence of medical oxygen as the major cost driver (as much as 48%) in the severe cases that require long hospital admission. This is despite the fact that it is the second most important component of the COVID-19 care package (Stein et al., 2020) .For the other cost components, median transport costs to and from the hospital of US$10 reported in our study is higher than has been reported in Tanzania (US$0.09) but significantly lower than US$51 reported in Bangladesh (Afsana, 2004; Kruk et al., 2008) . Estimates of the loss of productivity for time spent by the caregiver in our study were significantly higher than what has been reported in the literature before COVID. In our study, opportunity costs ranged from US$243 to US$572, while in the literature, adjusted estimates ranging from US$3 in Lao PDR for SVD (Douangvichit et al., 2012) to US$89 for caesarean delivery in Nepal have been reported (Acharya, 2016) . It is difficult to explain this finding. It might be the case that the partners in our study make greater losses for not working while providing care, because their jobs are more lucrative than the Lao PDR and Nepal study. Another plausible reason may be that the pregnant women with COVID-19 in our study had to stay longer on admission, and as such, their partners had to stay longer away from work.There are clear policy implications of our study findings. Pre-COVID-19, cost of utilising delivery services was already deemed as exorbitant for women. In a 2013 Nigerian study, the authors found that the mean total expenditure for childbirth including facility-based and household costs (US$246.30 (N39,400)) was more than the monthly family income for 94.6% of respondents (Adamu et al., 2013) . However, our study now shows that the financial burden is even significantly higher for pregnant women with COVID-19. It is particularly important to highlight that service fees have been excluded for pregnant women with COVID-19. However, such exemptions sometimes do not go far enough (Kruk et al., 2008) , especially if they are going to be replaced by new costs like PPE and medical oxygen.Pre-COVID-19, health care providers had some form of PPE to protect them when providing services, albeit not as many as is required for adequate and safe care today. Indeed, demand now by far outstrips supply globally (Burki, 2020) , with 60% of health care workers reporting that they have not had access to sufficient PPE to keep them safe while providing care to pregnant women (Semaan et al., 2020) . With such gaps in the PPE supply chain, costs are passed to women as shown in our study. This increases the risk of catastrophic health expenditure. Providers, more so those in LMICs, who are facing greater shortages and had huge budget constraints even pre-COVID, need to explore more innovative ways to source PPEs without passing the burden unto pregnant women (Green et al., 2020) . Indeed, at the beginning of the pandemic, the cost of PPEs was cheaper, but this has now skyrocketed with the price of surgical masks having increased sixfold, N95 respirators by threefold, and surgical gowns have doubled (Burki, 2020) . While government-led strategies such as loosening import regulations and commandeering business to accelerate supply have been recommended (Livingston et al., 2020) , there is a case for the government to scale up local manufacturers to explore PPE production at reduced rates (Olatunbosun, 2020) . Also, negotiations with sellers, while offering incentives for reduced costs and regulation of sell-on costs will help to drive down the cost and reduce excessive mark-ups being passed on to pregnant women. As a strategy for preparing for future pandemics, it is important to use data to work out actual PPE needs and stockpile PPEs, minimizing the risk of costs being transferred to women.In the pre-COVID era, there was mixed evidence on the effectiveness of user fee removal. While some suggest it leads to increase in utilization of facilities for delivery (Witter et al., 2010) , others have submitted that it can increase the workload for the already overworked health workforce and result in supply gaps of medicines and supplies for pregnant women (Gilson and McIntyre, 2005) . However, these are uniquely challenging times when reduced economic activity and the need for stay at home with children who are not able to go to school means many women and their partners may not be able to afford user fees that they would have normally been able to afford or at least sourced from somewhere. It should be noted that the women in our study were all educated and they and/or their partners were employed, yet, as our results showed, they benefited between 32 and 62% of subsidies in facility-based costs. With 40% of the population living below the poverty line (US$360 (N137, 400) per year) (Varrella, 2020 ), many will not be able to afford these increased service utilisation of the COVID-19 era, without these donations and exemptions (Alagboso and Abubakar, 2020; Igomu, 2020b; Naeche, 2020) . Indeed, there might be a case for a comprehensive fee exemption policy, as was done by the state government in Gbagada General Hospital, where pregnant women did not have to pay a cent in facility-based costs (James, 2020) . However, it is not known how long this can be sustained, with the government spending as much as (US$260 (N100,000)) and (US$2,604 (N1,000,000)) per day on off-setting bills of patients with COVID-19 (Adediran, 2020) . Similarly, how long can donations last?Another key issue lies within the community, where there is a real fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital and as such women do not actually want to have their babies in the hospital (Semaan et al., 2020) . There are also curfews, lockdowns, and transport restrictions which women need to navigate to reach health services (Oneko, 2020; Semaan et al., 2020) . Adding a financial barrier to this would only further disenfranchise women and allow them to even more rationally explain why they do not want to access skilled care in a facility, COVID-19 positive or otherwise. In any case, if COVID-19 truly becomes the ""new normal"" as is often said, costs of maternity services for childbirth may yet still go up for all pregnant women with some experts already proposing the need for universal testing of pregnant women for COVID-19 and a lower threshold for admitting pregnant women to hospital and intensive care unit (Breslin et al., 2020; Silveira Campos and Caldas, 2020) . This and any other additional costs may cause pregnant women to delay careseeking, putting them at a greater risk of otherwise preventable obstetric complications Kyei-Nimakoh et al., 2017) . Indeed, as these costs still need to be paid, the COVID-19 pandemic might be the perfect opportunity to drive advocacy for more enrolment in the National Health Insurance Scheme, which has only 2.1% of women of reproductive age group in Nigeria registered on it (Aregbeshola and Khan, 2018) .With such prohibitive costs associated with care of pregnant women with COVID-19, our findings suggest that the age-old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" might have substantial cost savings implication for pregnant women and indeed for LMIC governments who are still choosing to bear the cost of service utilization. While current guidance proposes telemedicine as a platform to provide ante-natal care (ANC) for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 , scaling this up to include all pregnant women requiring ANC while counselling them to minimize risk of infection around them might help forestall additional cost required to manage COVID-19 in pregnancy. However, this should not be applied as a one-size-fits-all solution, especially for high-risk pregnancies, who need to be seen physically, and those who do not have 'smart' phones' enabled with telemedicine capacity (Green et al., 2020) .In many LMICs, including Nigeria, hard-won gains were already being made with reducing catastrophic health expenditure for pregnant women, realising universal health coverage and improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. However, COVID-19 has disrupted the normal, necessitating new thinking to protect these gains (Graham et al., 2020) . Cost of utilizing maternity services for childbirth have increased and are likely to remain significantly high for women if exemptions being offered by governments become unaffordable, donations reduce or new requirements for universal testing have a chargeable fee. If COVID-19 becomes the new normal, then there will be many more pregnant women with COVID-19, including many who cannot afford the huge costs of care. Urgent measures are needed to ensure that women and their families are not being locked out of the health system. ","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-23",9

Corresponding Author","The 2019/2020 coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic. The virus, a viral infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 as now spread across the world, and almost all the countries are battling with the virus 2, 3 . Governments and medical officials are also trying their best to curb the spread as much as possible 4 .The virus is transmitted by aerosols that could remain suspended in the air for many minutes after coughing or sneezing or via close personal contact, such as by touching or shaking hands with an infected person. These viruses may also spread when people touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then their mouth, nose, or eyes. Moreover, it can remain viable for a few days on multiple surfaces 5, 6 .People with comorbidities and males older than 60 years are assumed to be at the risk of the virus 7 .However, all population is at the risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their demographic composition.The epidemic has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern on 31st January 2020, and on 11th March of the same year, WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic 4, 8 . As of 2nd May 2020, over 3.3 million cases and 330,000 deaths have been reported in all the continents 9 , and these cases are still growing.Gilbert and colleagues' modelling study of the risk of COVID-19 importation from China indicates that the ability of African countries to manage the local transmission of the virus after importation hinges on implementing stringent measures of detection, prevention, and control 10 . The country with the secondhighest import risk ranking was Nigeria, with moderate capacity but high vulnerability and potentially significantly larger populations that are exposed to inefficacy health systems 3 .However, Nigeria demonstrated its ability through intensifying its preparedness against COVID-19 importation, drawing on recent successes in controlling polio and Ebola epidemics 10 . The first reported case of the novel virus was imported into Nigeria in February 2020 by an Italian citizen. 10 The number which currently stood at 2170 reported cases and 68 deaths 9 . Without a vaccine in hand, it seems that the virus can only be slowed by extreme behavioral change and societal coordination 2 .A study in Italy concluded that most demographic groups believed and followed health measures 17 ; also, a sentiment study conducted in India on lockdown showed that the embossed sentiment was positive. Even though there were negativity, fear, disgust, and sadness about the lockdown 4 . Due to the high cost of complete isolation and healthcare, compliance with recommendations to strategically reduce contact is likely to be higher 15 .The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a severe impact on public health. Lockdown measures included travel restrictions, the mandatory closure of schools, nonessential commercial activities, and industries. People were asked to stay at home and socially isolate themselves to prevent being infected 18 . These measures are necessary to fight the novel coronavirus disease. Although effective in preventing the uncontrolled spreading of COVID-19, these measures can negatively affect mental health 19 , and relaxation will almost certainly trigger a further epidemic wave of deaths 20 .Social separation or quarantine of non-infected persons for an extended period may have adverse effects, such as loneliness, a rise in fear and anxiety and also, mental health consequences [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 21 . Studies in the past related to another family of coronavirus have also been linked to anxiety, depression, and psychological challenges as an aftermath effect of previous outbreaks 22 . Fear of the unknown raises anxiety levels in healthy individuals as well as those with pre-existing mental health conditions 23 .There has been a global rise recently in the spread of misinformation that has plagued the scientific community and the public. The public health crisis emerging due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) is also now beginning to feel the effects of misinformation 24 .The current novel coronavirus outbreak has spread around the world as such strategic dissemination of accurate and efficient public health messages by the Government and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) through the internet or television is strong potential to alleviate unnecessary fear 2, 5, 27 .Limited studies have been able to link how compliance with the prescribed recommendation, source of information, and lock psychological impact can either inflate or deflate the propagation of COVID-19.Thus, this study examined the compliance level to COVID-19 prescribed recommendations, the psychological implications of lockdown, and the source of information on COVID-19 among Nigeria social media users.The main objective of this study was to examine adherence to prescribed recommendations, lockdown psychological impact & source of information among Nigeria social media users.This cross-sectional survey used a Google-based, anonymous online questionnaire to gather data from respondents via social media platforms such as Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter.On these platforms, the google based questionnaire was shared among Nigeria social media users to participate. A snowball sampling technique was adopted to involve more Nigerians who are social media users and are residing in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic by telling those who were first sent the external google based questionnaire link to kindly share with their contacts. This unidentified online survey was conducted for one month within Nigeria social media users from 1 April to 31st May 2020, and we had 1,131 who participated in the online survey.The online google based questionnaire elicited socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, educational attainment, professional history of the respondents, while dependent variables such as compliance to prescribed recommendations, the psychological impact of lockdown, and source of information during the lockdown among Nigeria social media users.This section of the study summarizes the variables used in the study. Respondent age, gender or sex of the respondents, educational level, and professional background variables were used as explanatory variables. The dependent variables were recommendation compliance, feeling regarding COVID-19 pandemic, and respondents' adaptation. Recommendation compliance refers to whether respondents comply with the country's ministry of health recommendations.Feeling regarding the COVID-19 pandemic refers to the respondent's feelings concerning stress.Respondents were asked about their opinions regarding the COVID-19 epidemic; those that reported nervous/anxious, fear, angry, lonely, and bored were coded stressed while those that said just fine, happy, and relaxed/optimistic were coded not stressed.Respondent's adaptation refers to comping strategies used by respondents. Respondents were coded adapting well if respondents engaged in positive activities like watching television, reading books/magazines, volunteering, work from home, etc. while respondent was coded not adapting well if they engaged in harmful activities like fighting with everyone, talking to themselves, having problem sleeping, etc.Using Stata 14 tools, the data collected from the Nigeria social media were analysed. The findings were described in table and figure formats, using frequencies and percentages to explain specific variables of the sample population. Further, chi-square analysis was conducted to predict the influence of sociodemographic factors with the outcome variables. Results with a p-value < 0.05 were significant predictors in the bi-variate analysis.The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria.Participants' permission was sought before filling out the online google based questionnaire. Those who refused were not permitted to participate. All those who agreed to participate in the survey were granted access. Table 1 is a socio-demographic sample of respondents. The table revealed that more than 77 percent of respondents were between the ages of 18 to 39, while the remainder were between the ages of 40 and above. Sex reveals 42.1% were male, and 57.9% were female. The table shows that respondents who were well educated were 52%, this means 5 out of every 10 (52.0%) had a bachelor's degree, 28.7% had a master's degree, 8.6% had a Ph.D., 5.4% had a high school certificate and only 0.3% had no formal education. out of every respondent reported that they follow the country ministry of health recommendations.Six out of every ten respondents reported that they were stressed, and about four reported that they were not stressed. Concerning coping and adaptation during the lockdown, 83.7% reported that they are adapting well by watching TV/movies, spending time with family, reading books/magazines, and working from home.shows that about 8 out of every ten respondents in 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 age group categoriesIt is crucial to know how people are adapting to their various environments in this strange period.Findings show that respondents who are young and active were adjusting well. This may be because they have the energy to engage in different activities. Also, young people are the best with technology, with the internet they can relate with their friends in any part of the world. Concerning education, the study shows that more educated persons were adapting well. This is because they are more knowledgeable and can easily understand the situation compared to those with no formal education. The respondent background was not another variable explore on adaptation in this study. The finding shows that respondents with science/medical background are more likely to adapt well because of their awareness of preventive measures, treatment of diseases, and they can administer and recommend drugs.The study also assesses the psychological impact of lockdown on respondents concerning whether they are stressed or not. The finding shows about 63% reported that they are confirmed, which is more common among respondents within the age group of 18-29, 30-39,40-49, and 50-59 years. This may be because most of them are breadwinner/head of their family that needs to cater to many things for the household. Also, this is the active/working-age group in which many of their activities have been affected by the lockdown.Source of information is another crucial variable to look at during this period because it is critical to know the medium to use when there is a need to disseminate information in terms of reach out. Finding from this study shows that the majority get updates about COVID-19 from social media.The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Ethical approval: Participants' permission was sought before filling out the online google based questionnaire.

Though many countries rely on those mitigation measures which help to slow the spread of the pandemic [7] , scientists are actively engaged in efforts to understand the epidemiology of the disease. Modelling novel coronavirus disease has then become of extreme importance. Many researchers around the world have studied the patterns of Covid-19 pandemic and several mathematical, computational, clinical and examination studies have been put forward for modelling, prediction, treatment and control of the disease [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . This growing interest of scientists has resulted in a deluge of studies predicting the dynamics of Covid-19, and summarizing trends in these studies is necessary. Some studies (e.g. [8, 17] ) reported the difficulty of current models to accurately predict the Covid-19 pandemic. [17] showed that non-identifiability in model calibration using data on confirmed cases is a main source of large variation in model predictions. Other studies [8, 18, 19] have raised the issues of data quality that is necessary for accurate predictions. The type of models used could also affect the accuracy of predictions [11, 20] .Here we conducted a systematic and critical review of studies published between January 1st and June 30th 2020 on Covid-19 to (1) summarize trends in the modelling techniques used to predict Covid-19 cases and deaths, and (2) assess the reliability of predictions of Covid-19 cases and deaths.The overarching goal is to determine and discuss to what extent studies accurately predict cases and deaths and whether some differences exist among modelling techniques.The bibliographies of retrieved studies as well as bibliographies of current reviews and texts were searched for additional relevant studies. The studies included are those related to Covid-19 and are model-based. All studies that did not include a model were excluded as were non-English language studies. We followed the PRISMA flowchart (see Figure 1 ) for studies screening and selection for the review. From an initial list of 2170 studies, 148 were finally included in the review ( Figure 1 ).For each of the 148 papers selected, the data extracted were: the country of the study, the published or unpublished status of the study, the time period covered by the data (in days), the topics addressed in the study, the modelling techniques used, the predicted values of the cumulative number of cases, the predicted values of the cumulative number of deaths, the date at which the predicted values will be observed, and the uncertainty parameters (95% CI or 95% CrI). The data analyses considered three aspects. The first aspect was related to publication status of the study (published or preprint), geographical coverage (continents and number of countries covered per continent) and topics addressed in the studies; we used count and relative frequencies to describe this trend. The second aspect was related to the modelling techniques and was also addressed using count and relative frequencies after grouping modelling techniques in relatively similar groups. The third aspect was the reliability of the predictions made by studies. For this, we used four parameters; the first is the ratio between the value predicted and the actually observed value on the day on which the prediction was made. A value close to 1 indicates that the prediction was correct.Values less or larger than one indicate underestimation or overestimation, respectively. The second parameter is the ratio between the amplitude of the uncertainty parameter and the central value.From the selected studies, twenty predicted the cumulative cases for the coming days and 68 predictions were made (Figure 6-a) ). The ratio between the predicted value and the observed value was calculated as a criterion for the correctness of the predictions. We found that the predicted values were higher than the observed values for 41.18% of the estimations (28 of the 68) and lower than the observed values for 58.82% remaining estimations (40 of the 68). Only 11 studies (46 estimations) predicted values that actually departed from the values observed in the future (ratio of the predicted value to the observed value less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2). The time periods (expressed as number of days) covered by the data used in the selected studies were considered.From Figure 6 -b, the ratio of predicted to actually observed values decreases as the number of days since the first case was reported increases (Linear regression analysis: β=-0.124 ; p=0.002).Six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths with in total 9 predictions. For 33.3% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. Two of the nine predictions made a prediction that underestimated the actual number of deaths while four overestimated it (Figure 9-a) . Moreover, it appears that the more data used to make the estimates cover a large period of time, the more precise the estimates tend to be, although this is statistically significant only at the 10% threshold (Linear regression Analysis: β=-0.030; p-value= 0.0945) (Figure 9-b) . Figure 9 -b meanwhile indicated that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. The novel coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) is causing devastating demographic, social, and economic damage globally. Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic [7] . This situation induces a demand to the mathematical epidemiologist community [38] for revealing models of outbreak dynamics, which have not only explanatory but also a predictive potential while the outbreak is in an active phase. These models are aimed at the fast estimations of the future Covid-19 impact on the population, measures required from the public health system and effectiveness of different control measures [39] . A wide-range of models were used; some were extremely simple models while others are more sophisticated. Most studies focused on compartmental models, SIR and SEIR models, to estimate the transmission dynamics and make predictions about the future growth of the pandemic. We found that a SIR model performs better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data though [19] suggested that simpler models may provide less valid forecasts because they cannot capture complex and unobserved human mixing patterns and other time varying characteristics of infectious disease spread. Our finding is in line with that of [17] who reported that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. The models used included also statistical models, Bayesian models, Artificial Intelligence based model and Hybrid models [7, 16, 40, 41, 42] .The studies included in this review focused more on the prediction of the cumulative number of cases than the deaths caused by Covid-19. The models used for predicting the dynamics of the Covid-19 were mainly compartmental (SIR and SEIR models) and statistical (Linear regression model, time series model, growth models). We did not find evidence for difference across models while some predicted values far exceed true values. However, our findings should be considered with caution as for the reviewed studies, the number of estimations were not fairly distributed across models. The simplest SIR model is used to predict diseases in which individuals can obtain permanent immunity after infection and is only applicable when there is a non-drug prevention intervention [18] . This model has shown better predictive performance relatively to the SEIR model for number of cases forecasting. Our findings are contrary to that of [18] which argued that the estimated numbers of infected people far exceed reported cases in the available literature which used the SIR model and suggest more the use of complex models. Bayesian models were also used by [16, 43] . Though AI based models were used in few studies of our review, it is shown by [44] that the ongoing development in AI has significantly improved prediction, and forecasting for the Covid-19 pandemic. However, some factors could explain the departure of predictions from actually observed data. Estimates that emerge from modelling studies are only as good as the validity of the epidemiological or statistical models used, the extent and accuracy of the assumptions made and, perhaps most importantly, the quality of the data to which models are calibrated. Early in an epidemic, the quality of data on infections, deaths, tests, and other factors often are limited by under-detection or inconsistent detection of cases, reporting delays, and poor documentation, all of which affect the quality of any model output [19] . In the particular case of Covid-19, [8] argued that the fact that some people only experience mild symptoms and that even the best health system can only detect and treat those presenting to facilities also means that the available data on 'confirmed' cases represents only a fraction of the true picture of the pandemic. Additionally, the key to establish a reliable model is to track the epidemic dynamics and release the clinical information and epidemiological data in a timely manner. However, official data are often uncertain because medical resources are limited. The available data only reports confirmed cases in hospitals and ignores infected people who do not have access to medical services. This makes it difficult to accurately predict the course of the epidemic [18, 17] . Moreover, regarding the problem of data quality, especially in developing countries, though we assume that data are collected in real time and adequately in developed countries, this is undoubtedly not the case in underdeveloped countries that do not have the means for doing so. [8] , when forecasting cumulative cases, new infections, and mortality due to Covid-19 in Africa found their work further complicated because in Africa, data on key covariates are either lacking or when they exist, they tend to be biased or derived from other global covariate-based modelling exercises. For example, for a growth models at a growth phase of the epidemic, the fact that for 3 -4 consecutive days no case was reported (often in week-end and 1-2 days after) is not consistent and will certainly introduce bias in predictions.Another factor that might contribute to the estimations biases is that models are often built on strong assumptions [18] that may not hold. Models may capture aspects of epidemics effectively while neglecting to account for other factors, such as the accuracy of diagnostic tests; whether immunity will wane quickly; if reinfection could occur; or population characteristics, such as age distribution, percentage of older adults with co-morbidities, and risk factors (e.g., smoking, exposure to air pollution) [19] . Additionally, predictions were made in some studies considering scenarios about control measures that do not always match with the reality on the ground. Then the predictions are prone to biases. In most of the studies, parameters estimated from data collected in the first affected countries such as China were used to derive estimates of parameters in other countries [45] even though it is unlikely that epidemics follow identical paths in all regions of the world [19] . An additional point that might also explain the departure of predictions from values actually observed is linked to the fact that predictions are among others intended to guide public health policies for controlling spread of epidemics. As such, based on the predictions, different control measures might have been taken which might have allowed to considerably reduce the number of cases, and hence the observed values, resulting in a ""false"" overestimation appreciation.Considering process variability can be particularly important when populations are small or certain events are very rare [21] . Stochastic models makes it possible to take into account several factors and lead to a more realistic research. [47] studied the effects of the environment on the spread of Covid-19 using stochastic mathematical model. Modelling studies have contributed vital insights into the Covid-19 pandemic, and will undoubtedly continue to do so [19] although modelling and predicting the epidemiology and trajectory of a disease such as Covid-19 is a challenging exercise [8] . However, mathematicians and statisticians should be rigorous in their methodology in order to provide robust and reliable results based on which appropriate and optimal management strategies to contain the disease efficiently would be made.Using modelling techniques to predict the course of Covid-19 is important to effectively guide public health policy-making. Nevertheless, ensuring that predictions are accurate and correct is necessary to optimize the allocation of the limited resources available, especially in poor countries. Based on the sample of 148 papers analyzed, we showed that compartmental and statistical growth and time series are so far the most used modelling techniques to predict Covid-19 dynamics.Predictions largely exceed the observed values although some predictions (65.21% for cumulative number of cases and 33% for deaths) were close to observed values. We also showed that predictions based on larger dataset (i.e. larger period) were more precise and correct than predictions based on smaller dataset. Ensuring identifiability in model calibrations, data quality, and larger period should provide better confidence in predictions.KVS acknowledges the support of the Wallonie-Bruxelles International Post-doctoral Fellowship for Excellence, Belgium (Fellowship N°SUB/2019/443681).

This means that data on wellness constructs in direct relation to employee performance should be described.The raw data files consist of the following supplementary files, namely the dataset in both an Excel sheet (file 1) and the questionnaire in MS Word (file 2). The Data described in this article was collected in April of 2020 through an online survey. This was due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed by the South African government which restricted human interaction and handling of paper-based surveys. The data is illustrated through Fig 1, COVID- Data was gathered through the survey method. A conceptual model based on physical wellness, psychological wellness, intellectual wellness, intellectual wellness, emotional wellness, social wellness and employee performance was developed. The abovementioned constructs were empirically tested to establish their effect on the spread of COVID-19 in a public space such as a municipality. An online survey method was considered an appropriate data collection method because it allows for the collection of standardised data that permits the researcher to produce information for answering the how, who, what and when questions regarding the subject matter. Furthermore, it is imperative to note that the researchers engaged in the data preparation process. According to Aaker, Kumar and Day [2] , data preparation is regarded as a process of converting data from a questionnaire into a format that can be analysed. Furthermore, there are four phases of data preparation, namely data editing, coding, capturing and cleaning [2, 3] . These phases were employed to ensure that the data collected is complete and ready for analysing. After checking for missing values and outliers in the data, the researchers proceeded in assessing the reliability of test results. A total of 340 usable questionnaires were returned for analysis. In order to analyse data, Smart PLS and SPSS software were utlised for hypotheses testing and to generate the statistics for the respondent profile. SPSS was calculated the mean, standard deviation and Cronbach's alpha values while Smart PLS generated the composite reliability, average variance extracted and factor loading values.The PLS estimation path coefficients values as well as the item loadings for the research construct are shown in Figure 2 . The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet worksheet was used to enter all data and draw conclusions from the data obtained. The Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) and the Smart PLS software for structural equation modelling (SEM) technique were used to code data and to run the statistical analysis [1] . Moreover, Smart PLS supports both exploratory and confirmatory research; it is robust to deviations for multivariate normal distributions and is good for a small sample size [1] .This data article followed all ethical standards for carrying out research. Permission to collect data was obtained from the administration of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Ethical benchmarks of scholastic research were adhered to, which incorporate, in addition to other things, protecting the identities of respondents and guaranteeing secrecy of accumulated data obtained from respondents.The data provides implications for research, practice and policy. Comprehension of factors that could potentially reduce the spread of Covid-19 could aid in generating important insights needed for decision-making. For instance, the highest path coefficient indicated 0.363 was attributed on the nexus between social wellness and reduction of covid-19 transmission at a municipality. Policy can be guided by data from this research to implement best practices. Existing and future practical guidelines could utilize insights generated from data on physical wellness, psychological wellness, intellectual wellness, emotional wellness, social wellness and employee performance.","South Africa","abstract","2020-09-12",9

The pandemic is causing a global health and socio-economic crisis and is the major problem encountered after the second global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. Following its first report in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 almost reached all over the world. 3 It was at the beginning identified as an outbreak of cases of pneumonia with an unexplained cause in China. It was first informed to the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019. 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) stated Coronavirus disease 2019 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The etiology for Coronavirus disease 2019 is a newly identified virus called SARS-CoV-2. 5 Individuals infected with the virus can transmit to a healthy person mainly through droplets discharged from the nose and mouth. 6 So far, no one has identified specific vaccination or medicine for the disease. 7 According to the latest data, around 18,854,287 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 708,639 associated deaths of all ages have been reported from 215 countries as of August 7,2020. 8 At the earlier outsets of Covid-19 pandemics, children were believed to have mild COVID-19. 9 However, at later time children seriously affected with COVID-19 have appeared to be seen. 10 One study in USA reported nearly 5.7% of pediatric patients have been admitted in hospitals. 11 Another study conducted among children admitted in ICU in USA showed that nearly 69% of children were critically ill and 38% who were in ICU required ventilation. 12 Infants appeared to be affected more seriously than older children. Nearly 11% of infants had serious cases compared to 3% of ages 16 and older. 13 In contrast to adults, fewer children were reported to encounter critical illness and admission. Earlier data from china reported nearly 2.4% children with COVID-19 were aged 19 or younger. Besides, only 0.2% pediatrics encountered life threatening complication in contrast with 6.1% overall. 11 Similarly, other studies from the USA supported the risk of life threatening complication in children is lower than adults. Hospitalization rate appeared to rise as the age increases. Among children less than 19 years old, only 2-3% of them were hospitalized when more than 31% of patients older than 85 years were hospitalized. 14 Furthermore, about 6% of children have been reported to have a critical illness, compared to 18.5% of adults. 15 The age-specific fatality ratio appeared to rise from 0.1% in children aged ≤19 years to approximately 80% in adults aged ≥60 years. 16 Following treatment children typically recovered within 3 to 4 days. 11 Different studies have attempted to characterize the manifestation of COVID-19 disease in children. 17 However, the clinical presentation of COVID-19 exclusively in children has not yet been extensively studied. Even the available study showed contradicting findings. For instance, a study from China suggests that children with COVID-19 might have different symptoms than adults. 13 On the contrary, another study reported that COVID-19 has similar manifestation both in children and adults. 18 This contradicting finding showed how far extensive research is required to enrich the body of knowledge regarding COVID-19 characteristics in children. Thus, this review of existing literature was conducted with the hope to provide an insight into the disease in children. Hence, readers can refer to this review to increase their awareness.There have been seven corona virus species infecting human being. In 1965s the first coronavirus that infect human being was recognized. The seventh type of newly identified coronavirus is known as SARS-CoV-2. 19 Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped, RNA viruses with a crown-like appearance. Genera of corona viruses have been categorized into four: Deltacoronavirus (deltaCoV), Gammacoronavirus (gammaCoV), Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV), and Betacoronavirus (betaCoV). 20 Coronaviruses are involved in human. They can infect, gastrointestinal, respiratory, central nervous system, and hepatic of human and vertebrate's diseases. 21 SARS-CoV-2 goes to βCoVs, however SARS-CoV-2 is different from other viruses belonging to βCoVs. 22 Bats and rodents have been suspected as the source of βCoVs . The virus has four main structural proteins, namely core nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E), membrane (M) glycoprotein, and spike (S) glycoprotein. 23 (see Figure 1 ). Among them, S proteins (S1 and S2 subunits) has the most important function in viral attachment, fusion, and entry into cells. 24Mucous membranes of the respiratory tract are the way through which SARS-CoV-2 might get to the lung. From the lung, the virus enters into the blood circulation and reach different organs. 25 SARS-CoV-2 may use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host cell receptor to get in and cause infection in humans. This receptor is found widely in various organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the lung, heart, and kidney. These organs are targets of SARS-CoV-2. 26 Pathophysiology mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been linked to the function of the nonstructural proteins and structural proteins.The replication process of SARS-CoV-2 follows five steps: (i) binding to receptor, (ii) fusion in to host cell, (iii) RNA translation, (iv) viral maturation, and (v) bud out. 27 The spike protein of coronavirus, S1 substructure facilitates the virus attachment with receptors whereas S2 substructure help cell membrane integration. 28 After the virus binds with the host cell, S protein will undergo conformational change by a host cell serine protease called TMPRSS2 which leads to viral entry through the process of endocytosis. 29 Following the viral entry into the cells, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm. Then from the released RNA structural proteins and polyproteins will be synthesized, finally the reproduced virus will be released out. 30 Viral entry and cell infection stimulate the body's immune reaction. In response to the antigen, the inflammatory process is initiated by antigen-presenting cells. After the antigen (virus) is presented, T cells will identify the virus. 31 In reaction to antigen presentation, both cell mediated and antibody mediated immune responses will be stimulated. The immune response is mediated by T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. T helper cells (i.e. CD8+ and CD4+) predominantly play the fight against the virus. The CD4+ initiate B lymphocytes to produce antigen-targeted antibodies, while the cytotoxic cells (CD8+) attack viral diseased cells. 32 The fact that most infected children experience mild symptoms and have a better prognosis continuous to hold. 33, 34 Although the reason is not yet clear, several theories have been proposed to explain it. One of the likely reasons is that children are thought to have fewer ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in their nasal tissue than adults. These receptors help the virus entry in to host body. That is the reason why pneumonia and ARDS is not common in kids with COVID-19 compared to adults. 35 Another possible explanation is tied to immune response, overzealous pulmonary inflammatory mediators, termed as cytokine storm is rare in children. An exaggerated immune response may end up in extreme inflammation, thereby eventually causing more severe damage. Children, with immature immune systems, appear to be less capable of mounting cytokine storms suggesting why children do not seem to be getting severely ill. 36 It has also been suggested that early childhood vaccines provide some protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in children. Studies have suggested that, in contrast to adult vaccines can protect children from acquiring COVID-19 disease. 37 The overall pathogenesis is indicated in Figure 2 .Children of all ages can be affected by COVID-19 disease. 38 They may show symptoms within 2-14 days after being infected by SARS-CoV-2. 39 The symptoms have been reported to be milder than adults. 40 Male children constitute a greater proportion than females. 41 A study conducted on children with COVID-19 delineated a spectrum of clinical appearances from no symptom to sever condition. The manifestation can be categorized in to five stage depending on the severity of clinical progression: (i) the initial characteristics is no apparent clinical signs, (ii) minor clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, myalgia, fatigue (iii) subclinical pneumonia, (iv) Severe pneumonia characterized with hypoxia, dyspnea and 13 The clinical feature in children is somehow different from adults. The most common symptom is fever, like in adults, but the incidents of productive cough, vomiting, and diarrhea are much higher than in adults. 42 Unlike adults, dry cough and phlegm are not the most common symptoms. 43 Children rarely progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome than adults. 44 Although children have milder symptoms compared to adults, it is important however to note the clinical feature in children may progress to critical condition. 45 COVID-19 in young infants often has an unexplained fever along with mild respiratory symptoms. 46 The most frequently profiled symptoms for children are cough and fever. 10, 11 In a study that evaluated 171 children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, the most common reported symptoms were: fever (41.5%), cough 48.5%), and pharyngeal erythema (46.2%). 47 Recently, a systematic review that identified 131 studies comprising 7780 pediatric patients across 26 countries indicated, most common clinical manifestations. They reported that the frequently encountered symptoms are rhinorrhea (20.0%), fever (59.1%), myalgia/fatigue (18.7%), and cough (55.9%). 44 Some children presented with mild or often ignored symptoms such as nasal congestion, nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 48, 49 Rash was also documented as infrequent sign among children with COVID-19. Dyspnea or hypoxemia and, sign and symptoms of multi-organ failure were rarely described. 18 Moreover, ARDS and pneumothorax were indicated in children with COVID-19 very rarely. 50The viral antigen (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid) is identified using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The preferred sample comes from nasopharyngeal swab. The American CDC recommends the swab must be introduced into the nostril and left inside for some seconds. Soon after sample collection, the sample has to be kept in sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. Samples have to be kept at 2-8°C for about 72 hours after collection. 51 The virus can also be detected in stool, sputum, urine, and blood. 52 Based on current data, a consistently similar result of laboratory findings has not yet been reported in children. The laboratory result varies with the severity of COVID-19 disease. 53 It has been noted that in the early time following the disease onset, either normal or decreased white blood cell count and marginally elevated lymphocyte count have been observed. The majority of patients have normal neutrophil counts. 54, 55 Severe cases may be accompanied by; increased serum inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, and interleukin-6 and progressively decreased lymphocyte. 44, 56 Table 1 summarizes the laboratory changes observed in mild and sever cases of COVID-19 in children Myoglobin, muscle and hepatic enzymes appeared to rise in kids. Increased CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rates have also been reported. 57 On the other hand, an observational cohort study from China reported that elevated creatine kinase, decreased lymphocytes, leucopenia, and elevated procalcitonin are typical abnormal laboratory results among children with COVID-19. 58 The laboratory report in children is somehow different from adults. 43 In contrast to adults, the white blood cell counts of children were all normal, with decreased neutrophil counts and increased lymphocyte counts. The value of PCT showed no difference between children and adults, however, an elevated level of CRP and IL-6 was shown in adults, but not in children. Children have higher level of LDH compared to adults. 43 The comparison of characteristics of laboratory result in children and adults is summarized in Table 2 .So far, studies reported that children appear to be less affected by this new coronavirus. But the report showed this rare case my cause several life-threatening complications. Children under 18 years of age with COVID-19, 5.7-20% were hospitalized compared 10-33% adults aged 18-64 years. Besides, 0.58-2.0% children were admitted to an ICU compared to 1.4-4.5% adults. Children aged <1 year accounted for the highest percentage 15-62% of hospitalization among pediatric patients with COVID-19. 11 A syndrome called pediatric inflammatory multisystem disorder which is associated with COVID-19 has been reported widely. The syndrome appears four to six weeks after infection and manifested by high fever, low blood pressure, and abdominal pain. 59 Some children have experienced kidney injury, The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health concern. Research is progressing at an unprecedented speed. Our knowledge regarding the disease in children is evolving from time-to-time. Despite fewer children with COVID-19 have been reported, they are more at risk than adults to be infected with the virus. In most cases, clinical manifestation of the disease in children is not clearly specific and often mild or asymptomatic. Severe conditions, such as life-threatening complications and death associated with the disease have rarely been reported. On top of that, the presentation of COVID-19 disease in children is not intensely studied. An intense investigation of the clinical presentation in children is very important.Ethical approval was obtained from the College of Health Science, Mizan Tepi University Ethical Review Board.

One of the most critical issues related to the COVID-19 is the high spread rate, millions of people have been infected around the world, and hundreds of thousands of deaths till now had been recorded. Patients suffered from different symptoms like fever, dry cough, and fatigue which is mild in about 80% of cases, but the severity of the case may progress to develop a respiratory distress or respiratory failure and hence the need for intensive care unit (ICU) will be increased [1] . The severity of the disease is related to age and comorbidities of the infected subjects; the elderly are severely affected with the need for ICU [2] . The severity of symptoms is also related to its duration, for mild cases, symptoms may last for 2 weeks while for the severe cases it ranges from 3 to 6 weeks [3] . Direct contact to confirmed cases is the main way by which the disease transfer among people because the SARS-COV-2 is transmitted through exhaled air and aerosol [4] .Diagnosis of COVID-19 is done through polymer chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography (CT) scan, and blood test [5] . For mild cases, supportive treatment is the only choice including antibiotics, vitamins, trace elements, and antipyretics, while those with respiratory distress, the oxygen therapy with or without mechanical ventilation should be introduced and individualized according to each case [6] . A lot of medications were included in clinical trials to act as antiviral but there are no clear results to indicate the confirmed effect for any of the investigated medications [7] [8] [9] . In addition to symptomatic therapy, corticosteroids as an anti-inflammatory could play a vital role in severe cases [10] . Most of the infected patients have recovered from the disease, this recovery could be confirmed by another PCR or by the absence of the symptoms for several days. However, many cases have suffered from different symptoms after recovery from the disease which are different from COVID-19 symptoms [11] . Post recovery manifestations were also studied after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) attack in 2003 reflecting many symptoms experienced by studied subjects such as fatigue, myalgia, depression, and weakness [12] . Some of these manifestations were chronic and lasted for a long time which required long term monitoring [12] . In addition to the previouslyThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved mentioned mild symptoms, a mild hypoactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was reported by Leow et al [13] . Hence the current study aims to investigate the post-COVID-19 manifestation to demonstrate the different symptoms or signs that appeared on subjects after recovery from the disease, also to link these symptoms with several factors (age, weight, disease severity, or other comorbidities).Recovered Egyptian subjects from COVID-19 received a questionnaire aimed to collect data related to their post-COVID-19 manifestations. This questionnaire was divided into several parts starting from subjects' demographic data (age, gender, height, smoking, and weight), then data about the The study involved 287 recovered COVID-19 subjects, 103 of them were males and 184 females.Age of involved subjects expressed as Mean ± SD was 32.3 ± 8.5 and ages ranged from 20 to 60 yearsThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved old. Mean ± SD weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were 77 ± 16.4, 162.9 ± 15.3, and 28.5 ± 5.2 respectively. Percent of smokers among male subjects was 27.2 %, while all females were nonsmokers. Regarding other diseases, 70.7 % of all subjects have no known history of other illnesses, while 7.7 % have hypertension and 5.2 % were diabetic. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms was divided into three categories, first is the mild cases that were isolated at home and they expressed 80.2 %, the second category was the moderate cases that received oxygen therapy and they represent 14.9 %, the third category was the severe cases that required ICU admission and this category represent a small percent (4. The severity of COVID-19 was related to age and comorbidities as shown in figure 1 . Also, the severity of post-COVID-19 manifestations was related to the severity of COVID-19 ( Figure 2 ).Post COVID-19 manifestations were recorded for about 90 % of the recovered subjects, with a wide range of symptoms and conditions that varied from a low-critical symptom like a headache to more critical conditions such as stroke, renal failure, and pulmonary fibrosis. Post viral infection syndrome was previously reported after SARS [12, 13] . Follow up for 4 years showed that chronic fatigue and psychiatric conditions continued to be clinically significant among subjects survived from SARS infection [14] . Hence, mental health morbidities management should be optimized through a multidisciplinary approach combined with long-term rehabilitation. Regarding COVID-19 survivors,This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved each subject reported one or more manifestations, those manifestations persisted with all subjects for more than 20 days from the last negative PCR. The severity of COVID-19 was classified into three categories as follow; mild cases that had controllable symptoms and have been treated at home without the need for oxygen therapy, moderate cases which suffered from difficult breathing and needed oxygen therapy at home, and severe cases that had been hospitalized and needed ICU. The relation between age, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 showed a strong link between the presence of other comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 [15] . Also increasing age was related to increased severity of the disease course [16] . Most of the reported manifestations were mild reversible symptoms that could be relieved without medical interventions such as fatigue and headache which could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. Other mild symptoms like joint and muscle pain were also reported by many subjects and it could be classified as mild manifestations. It was noted that many manifestations are related to the central nervous system such as continuous headache, migraine, depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Few percent of subjects have suffered from critical complications such as stroke, myocarditis, renal failure, and pulmonary fibrosis which could be reversible and required extra investigation. Regarding obesity as a factor affecting disease severity or post disease symptoms, it was shown that the majority of subjects were overweight or obese but there is no significant effect on the severity grade or type of post-COVID-19 symptoms. The manifestation of post-COVID-19 that have been recorded during this study could be classified as mild or critical, the critical manifestations are those affecting organ functions such as pulmonary fibrosis, renal failure, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and stroke. There was a relationship between the severity of post-COVID-19 manifestations and the severity of the disease, the severe cases expressed high severity manifestations compared with those suffering from mild condition [11] .Hence, the severity of manifestations is also related to the age and comorbidities of the involved subjects. All cases with severe manifestations have confirmed their diagnosis through laboratory investigations and imaging procedures such as CT scan for diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. The most-reported manifestation for this study was fatigue which also reported by Tansey et al. after SARS in 2003 [17] . Fatigue persisted with recovered subjects from SARS for several months, as subjects were monitored every 3 months, more than 50 % of subjects were suffering from fatigue each time [17] . Another study followed up SARS subjects for 4 years to evaluate the percent of chronic Accepted Article fatigue in those subjects and they found that about 40.3 % suffered from chronic fatigue [14] . In addition to fatigue, neuropsychiatric symptoms were documented for a large percent of COVID-19 subjects, also this finding could be consistent with Lara et al. finding after monitoring neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impaired subjects whose were infected For subjects recovered from COVID-19, negative PCR is not the end of patient monitoring, continuous and long-term monitoring of the subjects is recommended for evaluation of post-COVID-19 manifestation, and early intervention with the critical signs. Also, the need for continuous counseling with the subjects is very important not only for maintaining good adherence to the medications, but also for detection of early warning signs of developing serious manifestations.Adherence to medications has a beneficial effect on patient's outcomes [23] .Most of the subjects recovered from COVID-19 experienced several manifestations after the last negative PCR which could be mild symptoms such as fatigue, headache, or more critical manifestations like pulmonary fibrosis, stroke, and myocarditis. The most reported symptoms wereThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved fatigue, anxiety, joint pain, and headache. The severity of post-COVID-19 manifestations was correlated to the severity of the infection which also was related to the presence of comorbidities. The post-COVID-19 manifestation is largely similar to the post-SARS syndrome.

Characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic is an acknowledgment that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) outbreak, which started in the Hubei province of China in 2019, has now spread to all continents, affecting most countries around the world with differential impacts and peculiarities [1, 2] .Coronaviruses have the largest known genomes (up to 32 kb) among +RNA viruses, and they encode four structural and sixteen nonstructural proteins [3] . The nonstructural proteins (nsp) consist of all the enzymatic activities that are imperative for viral replication, mostly associated with RNA replication [3, 4] . Structurally, the SARS-CoV-2 genome also encodes an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex consisting of the nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12; the RNA capping machinery which also constitute the nsp10, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16; and finally additional enzymes such as proteases (the nsp3 PLpro and the nsp5 3CLpro) which cleave viral polyproteins and/or impede innate immunity [5] [6] [7] .The four structural proteins together with the viral +RNA genome and the envelope constitute the virion [5, 8] . The matrix (M), small envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins are embedded within the lipid envelope [6, 9] . The fourth structural protein, the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), physically links the envelope to the +RNA genome. It consists of an N-terminal (NTD) and a C-terminal (CTD) domain [10, 11] . Both domains are capable of RNA binding. In addition, the CTD serves as a dimerization domain and binds the matrix protein forming the physical link between the+ RNA genome and the envelope [12] . The SARS N protein has also been shown to modulate the host intracellular machinery and plays regulatory roles during the viral life cycle [5] [6] [7] . In light of the genomic similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is reasonable to expect the N protein to function in a similar way [10] . All the SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential drug and vaccine targets, and a detailed understanding of their functions is therefore of utmost importance. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus N (SARS-CoV N) protein packages the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly [5] [6] [7] . It is a protein with multifarious activities. Furthermore, the N protein is frequently used in vaccine development and serological assays [13] . At present, few reports focus on the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and there is an urgent need for an updated understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Majorly, the vaccine therapeutic experiments are highly centered on the spike or entire protein, but we are focusing mainly on the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein which is a protein subset of the virus.Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein. The protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was retrieved in a FASTA format from the NCBI repository with the accession numbers: Wuhan, China (GenBank ID: QHD43423.2). The X-ray crystal structure of the nucleocapsid protein was also retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB: 6m3m). The retrieved structure was subjected to a structural alignment to ascertain the level of homology and probable mutations that have occurred over time during viral replication among the coronavirus family. Bootstrap value and other default parameters were used to fabricate the alignment. The physiochemical properties of the protein sequence were assessed and biocomputed via an online tool ProtParam [14] (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).Linear and Discontinuous Epitopes. The nucleocapsid sequence was analyzed with a view to recognize the antigenic regions that were achieved by predicting epitopic peptides. The promising antigenic linear B cell epitopes were predicted using the BepiPred server from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) database [15] . BepiPred-2.0 is based on a random forest algorithm trained on epitopes annotated from antibody-antigen protein structures [15] . About 12-15 mers (residues) were assumed to bind to the MHC groove. Other criteria such as antigenicity, surface accessibility, flexibility, and hydrophobicity were considered as part of the profiling process of the antigenic B cell linear epitopes. For antigenicity testing, these epitopes were subjected to the VaxiJen 2.0 server at a threshold of 0.6 [16] . The next stage of screening was the prediction of the discontinuous epitopes which are folded in conformation aiding in the antibody recognition of denatured antigens. The ElliPro server (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) was adopted for this purpose, while PyMOL was utilized to examine the positions of forecast epitopes on the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [17] .Helper T Lymphocyte (HTL) Epitopes. The CTL epitopes were predicted using the IEDB MHC I binding prediction algorithms (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci). This method integrates the prediction of epitopes restricted to a large number of MHC I alleles and proteasomal C-terminal cleavage, using artificial neural network application. For better predictive accuracy, other software such as artificial neural network (ANN), stabilized matrix method (SMM), MHC-binding energy covariance matrix (SMMPMBEC), NetMHCpan, pickpocket, and NetMHCpan were adopted for this purpose. To predict the HTL cell epitopes, the MHC II binding prediction tool (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/) found in the IEDB database was adopted. The antigenic properties of the epitopes were studied using the VaxiJen 2.0 server set at a threshold of 0.6. The peptide toxicity predicted from the ToxinPred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/), allergenicity predicted from AllergenFP 1.0, and digestion predicted from the Protein Digest server were all considered in selecting the final epitopes.and HLA-A 0201 Allele for Molecular Docking. The molecular docking of the antigenic epitopic peptides was conducted with the alleles they were mostly restricted to, which was HLA-A 0201. The protein structure of the allele was retrieved from the protein data bank with the identifier PDB: 4U6Y, while the predicted peptide 3D structures were modeled via the PEP-FOLD server at the RPBS Mobyle portal. The best models provided by the server were chosen for the docking study. The HawkDock Server was employed for the docking process. It combines ATTRACT for global macromolecular docking and HawkRank for scoring.The three-dimensional model of the conjugated antigenic vaccine was predicted using the I-TASSER server which generates a 3D model of the query sequence by multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulation [18] . The I-TASSER online server was selected for its availability, composite approach of modeling, and performance in CASP competition. The quality of generated 3D models was checked by Z score, and the best model is selected for further consideration. The functional analogs were ranked 2Journal of Immunology Research based on the TM-score, RMSD, sequence identity, and coverage of the structure alignment. The quality of the predicted model was determined by C-score (confidence score) which is ranged as −5 to 2. The obtained 3D model of the conjugated antigenic vaccine and the human Toll-like receptor-5 PDB structures were aligned employing the TM-align [19] , a quick and accurate structural alignment tool for two protein structures of unknown equivalence. An optimal superposition of the two structures built on the detected alignment, as well as the TM-score value which scales the structural similarity, will be returned. TM-score has the value in (0,1), where 1 indicates a perfect match between two structures.Model. The confirmation of the selected 3D model predicted by I-TASSER was further validated by the Ramachandran plot. RAMPAGE and MolProbity [20] online servers were employed for the estimation of selected 3D model quality. It can begin from either the C-alpha trace, main-chain model, or full-atomic model. The Ramachandran plot obtained from RAMPAGE describes a good quality model that has over 70% residues in the most favored region. The plot analysis was able to show the allowed and disallowed dihedral angles psi (ψ) and phi (ϕ) of an amino acid which is calculated based on the van der Waal radius of the side chain. The corresponding percentage value of both the allowed and disallowed regions of the separate plots of glycine and proline residues of the modeled structure was generated. Qualitative evaluation of 3D models was employed by ProSA [21] . ProSA specifically faces the needs confronted in the authentication of protein structures acquired from X-ray analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and hypothetical estimations.Protein-Protein Docking of the Peptide Vaccine and the Human Toll-Like Receptor-5 (TLR5). In this study, molecular docking analysis between the vaccine and the human Tolllike receptor-5 was performed using the ClusPro 2.2 protein-protein interaction online server [22] . The shape complementarity and minimal binding energy of the Tolllike receptor-5 with predicted conjugated antigenic vaccine model obtained from I-TASSER is determined by the cluster scores for the lowest binding energy prediction, calculated using the following formula [23] :Here, repulsive, attractive, and electrostatic as well as interactions extracted from the decoys as the reference state are considered for structure-based pairwise potential calculation in docking [22] . The best PDB conformation was subjected to the Prodigy server to ascertain the binding free energy of the protein complex.Simulations. The interacting complex between the vaccine and the Toll-like receptor (PDB: 3J0A) was thoroughly accessed based on the existing coordinates between the docked protein complex. Parame-ters considered were the deformability, B factor, and eigenvalues associated with the normal mode which represents the motion stiffness. The lower the eigenvalue, the easier the deformation. The covariance matrix was also considered for the simulation. It indicates the coupling between the pairs of residues. The correlation matrix is computed using the Cα Cartesian coordinates [24] .A codon optimization was conducted to ascertain the maximum expression of the vaccine in the host. This was done with the aim of boosting the vaccine translational rate in E. coli K12. Restriction enzyme cleavage sites, prokaryote ribosomal binding site, and finally rho-independent transcription termination were all avoided during the option selection. Codon adaptation index (CAI) value and GC content of the adapted sequence was obtained and compared with the ideal range. The obtained refined nucleotide was cloned into the pET28a D315A vector.The protein structure consists of 4 side chains as shown, which suggests a plausible model for RNA binding (Figure 1 ). A structural alignment was performed to ascertain the level of conservancy across the coronavirus NP, while the SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6m3m) was maintained as the reference protein.Sequence similarity search and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) were adopted for this purpose. The MSA of the 14 homologous proteins to 6m3m was generated with a BLAST search against the PDBAA database. Across the sequence alignment, the various mutations including deletions supersede the conserved regions of the amino residues ( Figure 2 ).In summary, the alignment construct was less conserved, signifying the rapid rate of mutations that has acted on the protein during viral replications. The protein identification Helices are represented in squiggles, while beta strands with arrows and turns with TT letters. Solvent accessibility is rendered by a first bar below the sequence (blue is accessible, cyan is intermediate, and white is buried) and hydropathy by a second bar below (pink is hydrophobic, white is neutral, and cyan is hydrophilic). Bottom letters and symbols depict crystallographicity. Alignments in red represent conserved regions, yellow highlights the regions that tend towards monomorphism, while white is regions that are highly mutated. The dotted segments are the sequence deletions. 4 Journal of Immunology Research Table 1 ). Also, results of the solvent accessibility and hydropathy of the N NTD of coronaviruses show that most of the regions on the sequence have high solvent accessibility and are hydrophilic, properties which make the N NTD a likely antigenic target.Utilizing the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, Emini surface accessibility, and Chou and Fasman beta turn predictions, regions with viable antigenic properties were predicted. This scale was able to show the favorable regions across the protein that are potentially antigenic (Figures 3(a)-3(e) ). A total of four antigenic B cell epitopes was predicted. These epitopes had a safe physiochemical property such as the absence of peptide toxicity and lesser allergenicity, making it safe for vaccine production. Three of the selected epitopes had 100% across the antigen. Based on the conservancy across the antigen and the allergenicity, only RIRGGDGKMKDL and AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG were selected as the final promising antigenic B cell linear epitopes (Table 1) . These epitopes were mapped out from the protein structure (Figure 4(a) ). Based on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (PDB: 6m3m), the discontinuous epitopes were predicted considering their propensity scores. The identified denatured antigens by the neutralizing antibody are highlighted (Figures 4(b) -4(f)). Journal of Immunology ResearchThe residues are juxtaposed enabling the antibody to recognize the 3D dimensional structure. The chain D component of the protein had the highest denatured antigens with a total of 81 residues, followed by chains B, C, and A, in that hierar-chical order as the number of residues and their respective rank scores are ranked ( Table 2) . A higher propensity score of 0.745 means that only 25% of the D-chain residues are nonepitope residues predicted as part of the epitope. Also, 3.3. The CTL and HTL Epitopes. Two nonallergenic and nontoxic cytotoxic epitopes, with a viable antigenic property, were selected. The epitopes are GMSRIGMEV and LTYT-GAIKL (Table 3 ). For the helper T cell epitopes, three were selected based on their conservancy score of 100%, nonallergenic attributes, and their respective antigenic properties ( Table 4 ). Few of the peptides, regardless of their antigenic nature, had an allergenic property capable of inducing a harmful autoimmune response. The promiscuity of the chosen peptides was also evaluated by considering the number of MHC-I and MHC-II alleles they are putatively restricted to.3.4. Molecular Docking of HLA-Epitope Interaction with the MHC-I Molecule. Both peptides ""GMSRIGMEV and LTYT-GAIKL"" bind, respectively, to their restricted HLA molecules. Both epitopic peptides were highly restricted to several MHC-I molecules. In the case of HLA-A 0201, the binding free energy of GMSRIGMEV with the MHC-I antigen-binding groove Journal of Immunology Research an immunoadjuvant to boost the antigenicity of the vaccine construct was excluded. The addition of polyhistidine residues at the C-terminal of the vaccine helps to convey increased purity to the recombinant protein and may contain specified epitopes that can be recognized by an antibody fragment, thereby increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of the peptide vaccine.The molecular weight of the vaccine was 8558.93 Da, and the biocomputed theoretical pI was 9.98, with an estimated half-life of 30 hours. The instability index was 30.09, signifying that the protein is stable (>40 signifies instability). The aliphatic index is computed to be 78.85, with a GRAVY score of -0.281, signifying its hydrophilic nature. The atomic composition of the vaccine is 376 carbon, 603 hydrogen, 115 nitrogen, 104 oxygen, and 5 sulfur, thereby giving rise to the chemical formula C 376 H 603 N 115 O 104 S 5, with a total of 1203 atoms. The extinction coefficient at a wavelength of 280 nm was 2980 M -1 cm -1 . The intrinsic vaccine solubility at a neutral pH 7 revealed the hydrophilic and hydrophobic core of the vaccine construct ( Figure 6 ).The predicted model of the vaccine and its three-dimensional coordinate file was successfully obtained from I-TASSER (Figure 7(a) ). The results obtained from the server includes the predicted secondary structure with a confidence score ranging from 0 to 9, predicted solvent accessibility, functional analogs protein, and binding site residues. The best model was selected with a C-score of -1.39, TM-score of 0:54 ± 0:15, and RMSD at 6:3 ± 3:8 Å.Ramachandran plots of the predicted model were obtained to verify the stereochemical parameters of the protein structure. The Ramachandran plot showed 69.7% residues in most favored regions and 26.3% residues in additional allowed regions, i.e., the total of 96% residues in allowed regions which indicates a good quality model (Figure 7(b) ); this was also attested to by the MolProbity Ramachandran plot which also showed 96.6% residues in allowed regions which also confirmed the quality of the predicted model (Figure 7(c) ).the Toll-Like Receptor-5. A preliminary docking preparation was conducted by aligning the vaccine construct with the Toll-like receptor to ascertain if both complexes are likely to interact. The TM alignment score obtained was 0.35240, which shows the likelihood of both proteins interacting with stable conformation. The docking structure of the human Toll-like receptor-5 binding with peptide vaccine fragment 13 Journal of Immunology Research was finally obtained. A conformational change occurs in the Toll-like receptor-5 protein after binding with the antigenic peptide (Figure 8) , with a binding energy of -8.6 kcal/mol. The interface residue contacts characterizing both protein interactions include the following: charged-charged was 7, charged-polar was 6, charged-apolar was 11, polar-polar was set at 0, polar-apolar was 7, and finally, apolar-apolar was 20. The noninteracting charged surface was 20.26%, while the noninteracting apolar surface was 42. 3.10. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The interaction between the peptide vaccine and the Toll-like receptor was scrutinized to check for their protein stability and deformation. This analysis relies on the associated coordinates of the docked protein complex (Figures 9(a)-9(d) ). The eigenvalue found for the complex was 2.871961e-06. The low eigenvalue for the complex signifies easier deformation of the complex, indicating that the docking analysis between the vaccine and the TLR5 will activate immune cascades for destroying the viral antigens.3.11. Codon Optimization and In Silico Cloning. The length of the optimized vaccine codon sequence was 234 nucleotides. The GC content of the improved cDNA sequence was 54.27%, which still falls within the recommended range of 30-70%, for effective translational efficiency. The codon adaptive index was calculated as 1.0, falling within the range of 0.8-1.0, signifying the effective expression of the vaccine construct in the E. coli. EagI-NotI and SAlI sites were subsequently cloned into the pET28a D315A vector. The estimated length of the clone was 6.954 kbp ( Figure 10 ).The menace of the coronavirus pandemic on global health has made imperative the development of safe, stable, and effective vaccines against it. Currently, most vaccine designs against the SARS-COV-2 virus are targeted against the viral antigenic proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) either as whole inactivated or attenuated viruses because of its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies to block virus-receptor interaction and neutralize the viral infection of cells [25, 26] . Unlike the spike protein that induces high neutralizing antibodies which are incapable of inducing long-lasting protection against the virus, the nucleocapsid protein does not elicit neutralizing antibodies but may induce specific antibody 14 Journal of Immunology Research and cellular immune responses [7, 27] . This was the primary focus of this research in predicting antigenic peptides as potential vaccine candidates that would provide a longlasting cellular immunity against the virus. Also, the N protein is more conserved and induces long-lived memory T cells in humans, features that make it a potent vaccine candidate [27] [28] [29] [30] . In this study, we explored the potentials of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein RNA binding domain as a subcomponent vaccine candidate which could induce protective immunity against the SARS-COV-2 virus. Observations from previous studies have shown the conservation level and immunogenic properties of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. According to their reports, the N protein as a vaccine target has specific advantages over the spike, because of its conservancy, resulting in less mutation of the epitope sequence [31] . Our structural alignments corroborate that the N protein is moderately conserved (Figure 2 ). This could be attributed to the mutation of the N protein sequence in the coronavirus family. Dawood reported a moderate mutation of the N protein of coronaviruses [31] . This is indicative that the SARS-COV-2 virus may have originated from mutations within the family as has been previously suggested [32] .The humoral immune response plays a clear role in vaccine-mediated defense against infections given their role in maintaining memory cells, prolonged survival, and sentinel against reinfection [33] . Subcomponent vaccines that are capable of focusing the humoral immune response on specific antigenic epitopes can be predicted to be crucial and most beneficial in inducing specific antibodies and long-lived memory immune cells. Here, we predicted 2 viable antigenic regions using diverse investigation tools and processes for the calculation of the B cell linear epitopes. These 2 regions (one a dodecapeptide and the other a pentadecapeptide) were selected based on their conservancy, high antigenicity, nontoxicity, and nonallergenic properties. Due to findings from the diverse investigation tools employed, we report that our identified epitopes can elicit humoral immunity. This is in consonance with previous studies [34, 35] who reported the ability of the SARS-COV N protein to elicit N-specific humoral immune response in vitro. Also, the discontinuous B cell epitope prediction, which is amino acid residues that were brought into close proximity within the folded protein structure [36] , revealed that the chain D component of the protein had the highest propensity score. This is important because antibody binding is not just determined by the linear peptide segment but is also influenced by adjacent surface regions [37, 38] .The outcome of disease infection in humans is usually a factor of the strength of the immune response mounted against the infectious agent, and this is usually orchestrated by MHC molecules of the cellular immune system [32] . While B cells recognize epitopes on the surface of the infectious agent, T cells recognize epitopes on MHCs. Two subpopulations of T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes) are involved in epitope recognition, and while CD8+ CTLs recognize antigens presented on MHC class I, CD4+ HTLs recognize antigens on MHC class II. Also, CD4+ HTLs play a vital role in coordinating both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [39] [40] [41] . The two CTLs (C 2 and C 3 ) were selected due to their high antigenicity among the four identified epitopes. The three HTL epitopes (H 2 , H 4 , and H 6 ) were selected based on their nonallergenicity and high antigenicity. Even though other epitopes had higher antigenicity scores, they were however found to be allergenic, able to elicit a harmful autoimmune response. Therefore, they were not selected.Interestingly, a recent study predicted some T cell epitopes which can be recognized by MHC class II CD4+ HTL alleles of the Asian and Asia-Pacific region populations [32] . While they considered only the MHC class II epitopes, we considered both MHC class I and II epitopes in our study. Also, no HTL epitope was identified in their nucleocapsid protein; however, we report that two CTL and three HTL epitopes with high antigenicity and absence of allergenicity were identified on the nucleocapsid protein N terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-COV-2. Also similar to our study, Wang et al. predicted 4 strong antigenic sites and synthesized 2 strong immunogenic peptides on the N protein of SARS-CoV, of which one of our predicted peptides falls within the synthesized peptides showing medium-strong immunogenicity [42] . However, our study also revealed epitopes which have not been reported earlier. This indicates that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the coronaviruses with diverse potent epitopes for vaccine development.We examined the interaction of the designed vaccine with TLR5 using molecular docking analysis. The binding interfaces between the TLR5 and the peptide vaccine consisted of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Also, the relative binding free energies of the vaccine-TLR5 complex suggests that the linking of the peptide vaccine construct to the receptor elicits conformational changes that favor stimulation of the TLR5 immune molecules and indicate a favorable protein-protein interaction of our vaccine construct with the innate immune receptor. Similarly, the result of the molecular simulation analysis to examine for stability and deformation in the interaction between the vaccine and the TLR5 complex found a low eigenvalue for the complex indicating easier deformation of the complex. This implies that the docking analysis between the vaccine and the TLR5 will activate immune cascades for destroying the viral antigens. We therefore report that the in silico epitopebased vaccine construct targeting the SARS-COV-2 N protein N-terminal RNA binding domain shows prospects as a potent, safe, and effective candidate with high antigenic properties and a balanced immune response operating through both innate and adaptive pathways.For in vitro and in vivo studies to fully validate this research, selected antigenic and nonallergenic peptides that were predicted from this in silico simulation can be synthesized and tested to corroborate our preliminary results.The lack of an effective therapeutic candidate against the novel coronavirus has created a huge task for biomedical researchers to seek research approaches for overcoming the pandemic. This study was designed in furtherance of steps towards vaccine development. We used the primary amino acid sequence of the SARS-COV-2 to design a subcomponent peptide vaccine construct. The vaccine construct has both adaptive (B and T cell) epitopes and a favorable interaction with the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) (via TLR5) of the innate immune system. Each of the predicted epitopes has antigenic properties in the absence of allergenic properties. Generally, this study applied a series of immunoinformatic tools to predict a safe, stable, and effective peptide vaccine that may fight against the SARS-COV-2 viral infection. However, we propose experimental validations to prove this computational work.Data are available upon request and may be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Supplementary ","Nigeria","first author","2020-09-17",9

Although the WHO claimed that only 5% of infected patients might require critical care [1] , the rationing of resources has been the standard adopted worldwide [2] [3] [4] . In Morocco, the number of cases was rising, as reported in data published by the WHO [5] ; thus, the government declared a state of emergency on the 20 th of March. In the medical community, elective surgeries, and nonemergent cases were postponed. However, cases of severe trauma are time-consuming and require a certain amount of human and technical resources. The clinical presentation may guide through complex operative procedures. Exposed bones and tendons may require full vascularized coverage provided only by flaps to restore volume and function with a cosmetically acceptable result. In settings where flap surgery is not possible due to technical or environmental factors, trauma teams need to find out ways to minimize the procedure without adding on the morbidity to the patient. In our Department, we used in the past a negative domestic pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to convert limited cases needing flap coverage into skin graft coverage with good results [6] . We applied the same procedure to this more severe case of crush and degloving injury, because of the requirements of the moment. We report in this article the results achieved using this domestic NPWT to downplay the reconstructive ladder, as an example of our adaptability during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.A 17-year-old male patient sustained a road traffic accident (truck and bicycle collision) on the 16 th of March 2020. He presented with blunt abdominal trauma, a crush, and degloving injury to the left buttock, thigh, and perineal regions ( Figure 1 ). We performed a diverting colostomy to prevent faeces contamination of the wound. Necrotic tissues, including skin and muscles as the Gluteus Maximus, the Gluteus Medius, the Tensor Fascia Lata, some muscles of the posterior compartment of the left thigh, and part of the Vastus Lateralis were all excised (Figure 2 A). Due to the extent of the defect associated with the sacral bone and coccyx exposition, a free latissimus dorsi (LD) and an anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap were indicated. Unfortunately, before we reached a local acceptable inflammation state for the reconstruction, we got into a state of emergency in which the government gave stay-at-home instruction. The medical staff was instructed to use medical resources efficiently. The anaesthesia team was busy dealing or planning critical care for COVID-19 patients. There was a limited room left for surgery of the magnitude of a double-free flap in our centre at this time. We decided to manage the patient according to our previous experience in using negative pressure wound therapy [6] . Multiple surgical debridements were necessary to remove all the necrotic tissues. Then, the wound was covered with gauze, sealed with transparent dressings, and connected to a wall suction under a pressure of 200 mmHg (Figure 2 B) . We could manage to get a seal of around 90% using the tips described by Amouzou et al. [7] . The dressing was changed every three days under sedation. A granulation tissue appeared within 17 consecutive days of this therapy (Figure 2 C) . The patient presented local colonization of the wound by an Imipenem resistant Pseudomonas spp. Acinetobacter baumanii sensitive only to the quinolone family; a split-thickness skin graft was performed to resurface all the raw areas in a onestage surgery (Figure 3 A) . On top of the graft, we applied the domestic NPWT again; however, with a lower suction pressure (150mmHg). An intravenous (IV) colicine and ciprofloxacin were given to the patient as an adjunct to the coverage surgery. The graft take was 95% (Figure 3 B, C) . The patient was discharged on the 25 th of April 2020 (day 39). He was reviewed in the outpatient department every 4 to 5 days for wound care and physiotherapy. He was ambulating with a double walking cane. We acknowledged to him that some other procedures might be needed when the COVID-19´s crisis will be over should bulkier coverage still be required. The patient and his mother gave their consent to use the medical records for a scientific publication.In this case, we have achieved an adequate wound healing for a complex defect that primarily required multiple complicated procedures. We moved from microsurgery down to skin graft in a span of 17 days. The serial debridement that preceded the use of the domestic NPWT has been conducted to remove all necrotic tissues, thus allowing granulation tissue to proliferate and avoid infection. Converting microsurgery into a low magnitude surgery as a skin graft is what we learned from this case. In China, where the COVID-19 has been reported for the first time, similar measures have been in use. For instance, in burn centres, surgeries were minimized, outpatient care was promoted, and telemedicine was widely used for the diagnosis and care of patients [8] . The goal was to take care of the patient as efficiently as possible while minimizing physical contact. In our case, our goal was to reduce the use of technical and human resources in a potentially resourcescarce environment where all attention is given to the COVID-19 at the expense of other cases such as the trauma cases. The reconstruction of the traumatic defect of the gluteal area is challenging and not well codified in the literature [9] . The indications are mostly based on traditional flaps used for resurfacing pressure injuries at this location. The use of free flaps, although exceptional in pressure injury settings, may be required for deep extended defects due to trauma or after excision of cancer [9, 10] . The use of the Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy has been reported by Masami et al. [10] on a defect that was less extended than the one we treated in this patient. These authors achieved granulation tissue and coverage with a skin graft. However, in the long term, they were obliged to excise the skin graft and cover the defect with an ALT free flap as the wound was presenting with frequent ulcerations [10] . Frequently used flaps for such defects include the LD flap, the ALT flap, the scapular, used alone or in combination [9, 10] . In our case, the commercial VAC was available, but the patient could not afford it. Therefore, our cheap NPWT was the best choice in this particular patient. The injury pattern guided the decision of the double flap. Although we obtained a wound healing that was acceptable for ambulation and physiotherapy, an unstable scar may occur, prompting the use of free flaps in the future, something the patient was acknowledged.The COVID-19 pandemic is giving us an unprecedented challenge in dealing with technical and human resources. The domestic negative pressure wound therapy is a simple and versatile tool in all settings with available wall suction. African medical teams are reputed to possess the capabilities to adapt to exceptionally limited resources to achieve great results. The adaptive strengths required during the current pandemic can be exploited even beyond the COVID-19´s crisis and enrich our decision-making process.AEH, KSA designed, made the conception of the study and contributed in drafting the article.

As the world is gradually easing the lockdown measures to reopen the economy, the search for potent drugs and possible vaccines against this virus is pivotal. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE-2) causes pneumocytes damage. In response to this process, the pneumocytes release specific proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-a). The persistence of this process leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Schett et al., 2020) . So far, the antiviral drug remdesivir was shown to benefit patients with COVID-19 in a large randomized, controlled clinical trial. This drug was reported to shorten the amount of time that patients might need to spend in hospital but did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality rate (Beigel et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2020) . Dex, an anti-inflammatory drug is recently considered for treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 (Horby et al., 2020) . Similar to a natural hormone produced by the adrenal gland, it is classified as glucocorticosteroid. Also known as Decadron, Dex was considered a major breakthrough based on a recent randomized control trial in the United Kingdom. Based on the mode of action, cortisol binds to the glucocorticoid receptor to stimulate the production of antiinflammatory proteins thereby suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines causing lung damage. In a press release for the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial on 16 June 2020, Dex was recommended for use in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms. Dex reduced deaths by approximately 33% in patients requiring ventilation and by 20% in those requiring oxygen (Healthcare, 2020) . Studies show that Dex has been used to reduce inflammation in a wide range of conditions, including inflammatory disorders and certain cancers (Hollander, 1960; Stoll, 1960) . The WHO has added this compound on the Model List of Essential Medicines since 1977 in multiple formulations, and is currently off-patent and commonly available in most countries (Organization WH, 1977; Villar et al., 2020) . In the attempt to develop novel antiviral drugs against this infection, different strategies have been combined. Both experimental and computational approaches have been recently reported with the aim of identifying potent therapeutic agents (Elfiky, 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Enayatkhani et al., 2020; Enmozhi et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020) . Possible drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently under active investigation. These targets include; the Human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) proteins, membrane glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid, tumor necrosis factor receptor type 6, toll-like receptor 3, surface glycoprotein (spike glycoprotein), Interleukin-6 receptor subunit a (IL-6RA), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Sorbera et al., 2020) .Interleukin 6 receptor is a class I cytokine receptor for IL-6. The complex of this receptor with signal transducer subunit is essential for proper function. The complex is involved in immune response regulation, acute-phase reaction and hematopoiesis (Tanaka et al., 2014) . The respiratory tract infection by SARS-CoV-2 results in mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Suppression of inflammation in inflammatory diseases can be achieved by inhibiting IL-6 activity. Additionally, based on the biological and the pathological roles of IL-6 in various diseases, it was anticipated that IL-6 targeting would constitute a novel treatment strategy for various immune-mediated diseases (Liuzzi et al., 2005; Nemeth et al., 2004; Nishimoto et al., 2005) . Molecules capable of binding to the receptor subunit of IL-6 may render the receptor inactive and may potentially attenuate pulmonary inflammation in patients with Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses. The open reading frame ORF 1ab encodes the overlapping polyproteins (pp1a, pp1ab) and are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) by Mpro and the papain-like protease (Chen et al., 2020) . Due to the crucial role of Mpro in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA, it is considered as an essential drug target (Boopathi et al., 2020) . Currently, research efforts focus on the identification of potential inhibitors of this target (Zhavoronkov et al., 2020) . Specifically, Mittal et al. (2020) identified potential molecules against COVID-19 main protease through structure-guided virtual screening approach using anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes. Jin et al. (2020) also studied the crystal structure of the Mpro in relation to specific inhibitors.Dexamethasone was initially developed as a glucocorticoid receptor-specific agonist (CGTP Collaborators, 2013) and was used to determine the first glucocorticoid receptor-ligand binding domain structure (Bledsoe et al., 2002) . However, dexamethasone was later shown to also be a potent mineralocorticoid receptor ligand in a functional reporter gene assay (Rupprecht et al., 1993) . The X-ray structure of mineralocorticoid receptor in complex with dexamethasone is similar to the corresponding glucocorticoid receptor-Dex structure. Also, the relationship between Dex and glucocorticoid were previously studied in neuroprogenitor cells in the hippocampus of rat pups (Sze et al., 2013) , human monocyte cell line THP-1 (Bo et al., 2006) , human lens epithelial cells (Gupta & Wagner, 2005) , and in human ovarian carcinoma cell line 3AO (Xu et al., 2003) . These studies suggest that Dex effects are mediated through glucocorticoid receptors. Additionally, the ligand binding mechanism in steroid receptors was studied by Edman et al. (2015) using glucocorticoid and solved the crystal structure using Dex as its inhibitor. This interaction was therefore considered as the reference complex and the co-crystalized ligand was regarded as control in the optimization of molecular docking protocol.Among other questions yet unanswered about the clinical use of Dex, the ideal dose and possible interactions against SARS-CoV-2 targets remain unclear. In order to investigate the mechanism of interactions between Dex and SARS-CoV-2 possible targets, this study examined the binding interaction of Dex in comparison with glucocorticoid in order to provide insight at both atomic and molecular level using computational approach.The entire computational analysis was carried out using the Schrodinger suite (2020-2) using the Maestro v12.4 version packages including LigPrep, Protein preparation, Glide XP docking, grid generation, free energy calculations, ADME toxicity, and MD simulations. Linux was used as the operating systemThe receptors employed in this study include: (a) Glucocorticoid receptor in complex with Dex (Edman et al., 2015) (PDB ID: 4UDC); (b) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro bound to potent broad-spectrum non-covalent inhibitor X77 (A taxonomicallydriven approach to development of potent, broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus main protease including SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Mesecar, A.D. (To be published)). (PDB ID: 6W63); (c) Human IL-6 (Somers et al., 1997) (PDB ID: 1ALU). Dex (decardron) structure was retrieved from PubChem at https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ as the ligand (compound CID: 5743).The Schrodinger QikProp module (Release S. 4, 2017) and the AdmetSAR web-based tool (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/ admetsar1/predict) were used to analyze the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of Dex, respectively. For toxicity, the Ames toxicity, carcinogenic properties, acute oral toxicity, and rat acute toxicity were predicted.LigPrep module in Schrodinger was used to prepare the 3Dstructure of Dex. The ligand preparation process consists of a series of steps that perform conversions, apply corrections to the structures, generate variations on the structures, eliminate unwanted structures, and optimize the structures. The downloaded SD format from PubChem was converted to Maestro format using the command line 'sdconvert'. Before the minimization of the 3D structure, hydrogen atoms were added using 'applyhtreat'. Charged groups were neutralized before the generation of the ionization state by 'neutralizer' and 'ionizer'. Prior to docking, low-energy ring conformation was generated ('ring_conf') and the geometries of the generated structure was optimized by 'bmin' (Release S. 2, 2017). The force field used in the minimization of Dex is the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations known as OPLS_2005.Protein preparation module in Schrodinger was used to prepare the receptors for Dex: human IL-6, glucocorticoid receptor, and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which were retrieved from protein data bank with the PDB IDs: 1ALU, 4UDC and 6W63, respectively. Prior to molecular modeling calculations, these proteins were subjected to protein preparation wizard in order to add hydrogen atoms, remove alternate conformation, correct missing or incorrectly specified residues, remove HetAtoms from the protein structure, correct missing or incorrectly specified residues amongst others.Protein-ligand interactions study was performed between Dex and the aforementioned receptors. The binding pockets on the receptors were generated using the receptor grid generation module with either their co-crystalized ligands or specific coordinates. For 4UDC and 6W63, the co-crystalized ligands Dex and X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) were used to generate the grids by selecting the atoms of the ligands respectively. The docking grid of the active site of 1ALU was identified using the PDB file of the coordinates. This site provides information about the area around the active site (coordinates x, y and z). The receptor grid box resolution was positioned at coordinates À0.35 (xaxis), 74.13 (y-axis), and 350.16 (z-axis). Furthermore, the box length was maintained at 10 Å for x, y and z. Docking of Dex to the respective receptors was carried out using the Glide ligand docking tool in Maestro v12.4. (Release S. 4. , 2015) . Docking and calculations were performed in the extra precision (XP) mode of Glide and XP visualizer.The prime MM-GBSA was used to generate the energy properties of the ligand, receptor, and complex structures as well as energy differences relating to strain. (Hayes & Archontis, 2012; Li et al., 2011) . In this study, only the binding energies of ligand docked complexes were recorded.Prior to simulation, the docked complexes were prepared using the system builder module in Maestro v12.4. MD simulations were carried out using the Desmond software. The optimized potentials for the liquid simulations OPLS-2005 force field were used in this system to determine the receptors interactions with Dex, which was solvated with the simple point charged (TIP-3P) water model (Blessy & Sharmila, 2015; Jorgensen et al., 1983) . The orthorhombic water box was used to create a 10 Å buffer region between the atoms on the receptors and box sides. The volume of the box was minimized and the overall charge of the system was neutralized by adding Na þ . The temperature and pressure were kept constant at 300 Kelvin and 1.01325 bar using Nose-Hoover thermostat (Hoover, 1985) and Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat methods. The simulations were performed using NPT ensemble by considering number of atoms, pressure and timescale and the simulation time at 50 nanoseconds. The MD results were analyzed by simulation interactions diagram module and MS-MD trajectory analysis. (Figure 1 ) and three targets involved in Covid-19; Glucocorticoid receptor, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and IL-6 receptors was investigated in silico through molecular docking analysis and simulation. The ADME and toxicological properties of Dex were analyzed by QikProp and AdmetSAR web-based tools, respectively. The physicochemical and biological properties of Dex (Tables 1 and 2) analyzed included the molecular weight, hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, lipophilicity, number of rotatable bond, topological polar surface area, ames toxicity, carcinogens, acute oral toxicity, and rat acute toxicity. This analysis is crucial for analyzing the efficacy of molecules. All the parameters were within the ROF cut-off range for the test compound (Dex) and showed no violation of the Lipinski's rule of five and Veber rules (Table 1) and presents no bystander toxicity effects (Table 2) .Molecular docking approach identifies suitable drug molecules for the target of interest (Roy et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2011; Subhani et al., 2015; Vijayakumar et al., 2018) . The docking result shows the potential of Dex to bind within the receptor pockets or active sites ( Figure 2 ) and the hydrogen bond interactions within specified distances (Figures 3  and 4) . The amino acid residues of the receptors crucial to binding Dex within specific distances (H-bond distance values) are depicted in Figure 4 . Furthermore, the docking scores of the complexes were also generated (Table 3) . To specify the nature of the receptor-Dex interactions, the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Boltzmann surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations were carried out using the complexes as input in Prime module. The result of the binding energies of the complexes are given in Table 3 . Glucocorticoid receptor was predicted to be notably more preferable for binding of Dex with corresponding binding free energy of À147.48 kcal/mol for Dex, being lower compared with the binding energies for Mpro and IL-6 which was À66.45 and À53.03 kcal/mol, respectively.In this computational analysis, glucocorticoid receptor complexed with Dex had the highest docking score (À14.3) than other Mpro/IL-6-Dex complexes (À6.7 and À3.6 for Mpro and IL-6 respectively). Furthermore, based on specific interactions, ASN564, THR739, GLN642, and ARG611 in the glucocorticoid receptor were involved in hydrogen bonding with the atoms of Dex. Three amino acid residues (ASN142, GLU166, and CYS44) in the Mpro active site were involved in boding with Dex atoms. IL-6 also interacted with three residues (GLN175, ASP34, and LEU33) which were hydrogen bonded with Dex atoms in its binding pocket. However, Dex showed a better binding affinity for Mpro than the other receptors based on the distances of the interacting atoms in the active site. Overall, Dex showed good measurable binding affinities for the receptors residues. The binding affinities were indicative of the ligand's contribution to the flexibility for the targets. The present study also showed the H-bond distances and their contacts types for Dex.The MD simulation was performed for the three receptors (glucocorticoid receptor, Mpro, and IL-6) and Dex complexes to evaluate the structural stability and constancy by Desmond in Maestro v12.4 software. The simulation process for these complexes were computed for 50 ns. For human IL-6 (1ALU), Glucocorticoid receptor complex (4UDC), and Mpro complex (6W63) with Dex, the simulation processes were built with solvent model predefined as TIP-3P. The boundary conditions were adjusted with a box shape 'orthorhombic' and the box size calculation method 'buffer' with a minimized box volume. Ion replacement was recalculated by adding Na þ to neutralize the environment. The system builder was concluded by adding 0.15 M salt concentration (salt positive ion: Na þ and salt negative ion: Cl -) ( Figures 5(A) , 6(A), and 7(A)). The RMSD plot of human Interleukin-6 complex was stable within the first 12 ns of simulation and deviated for a certain period of time (14-25 ns) and attained equilibrium at 25 ns ( Figure 5(B) ). The RMSF was computed to include ligand contact as presented in Figure 5 (C). The simulation of glucocorticoid receptor complex with Dex was at equilibrium from the beginning and throughout the simulation period of 50 ns (Figure 6 (B), (C)). Initially, the RMSD plot of Mpro complex showed that the complex deviated for a certain period and attained equilibrium at 40 ns. Subsequently, it remained stable throughout the simulation time for up to 50 ns (Figure 7(B) , (C)). Protein interactions with Dex were monitored throughout the simulation. These interactions were categorized by type and summarized, as shown in the plot above ( Figures 5(D) , 6(D), and 7(D)). Protein-ligand interactions (or 'contacts') are categorized into four types: Hydrogen Bonds, Hydrophobic, Ionic and Water Bridges. The stacked bar charts were normalized over the course of the trajectory. Notably, for glucocorticoid receptor- Dex complex, THR739 and GLN642 present interaction fragments above 0.75 suggesting that over 75% of the simulation time hydrogen bond is maintained with Dex. ASN564 residue showed multiple contacts of same subtype with Dex (above 1.75).There are currently approximately 14 million global cases of COVID-19 and more than 500, 000 mortality rates (as at 23rd July 2020), yet there is no treatment that is specific for the disease. To keep the economy afloat, lockdown restrictions are being reduced, and this might cause another wave of COVID-19 infections and transmissions. Treatment so far, has been through repurposed anti-viral drugs such as chloroquine and its analogues, remdesivir, and currently an antiinflammatory agent Dex. Although, they show promise in fighting against the disease, some are over-shadowed by their bystander effects (Healthcare, 2020) . Dex have a long history in prevention of chronic lung infections in premature babies, and have been shown to bind to glucocorticoid receptor to induce its functions. Given its immunosuppressant properties, surprisingly Dex reduced of mortality of severe COVID-19 patients who requires oxygen and those on ventilators (Healthcare, 2020; Isidori et al., 2020; Sze et al., 2013) . Khan and Htar (2020) reported the computational study of Dex against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in relation to remdesivir and reported that Dex interacted with a high affinity to the same sites of the SARS-COV-2 Mpro than remdesivir. Nayeem and Reddy (2020) also evaluated the binding capacity of Dex and Umifenovir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via molecular dynamic studies using Gromacs with OPLS-AA force field and concluded that Dex is more effective when compared to Umifenovir in binding SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In this study, the effect of Dex was investigated against three targets associated with Covid-19 infections to determine the drug's mode of action at both atomic and molecular levels and to further provide insight into its use as anti-COVID-19. The three targets namely glucocorticoid receptor, Mpro, and IL-6 are composed of 186, 280, and 336 amino acids with resolutions of 1.90, 2.50, and 2.10 Å, respectively. Dex and the three targets were prepared using LigPrep and protein preparation wizard, respectively. The outputs were further minimized using the force field OPLS_2005 and were used for molecular docking calculations. Currently, there are no known drug that is safe and effective against COVID-19. However, the possible drug target in this virus is the Mpro, an enzyme responsible for gene expression and replication of the virus. This enzyme has been labeled an attractive target for drug discovery (Xue et al., 2008) . The Mpro has over 11 cleavage sites on the replicase 1ab polyprotein that is approximately 780 kDa, inhibition of the protease activity would prevent viral replication. Also, because there are no known human protease with similar cleavage specificity, the inhibitor of the Mpro is less likely to be toxic . The molecular docking study showed the potential of Dex to bind the receptor cavity of Mpro with specific interactions. The Mpro-Dex complex produced ligand docking scores with three H-bonds and their distance values and the consequent glide energy. Dex was also docked into the active site of glucocorticoid receptor in order to evaluate the binding interaction in relation to other two receptors. In glucocorticoid receptor-Dex complex, four hydrogen atoms were observed between the interacting atoms of Dex and ASN564, THR739, GLN642, and ARG611 amino acid residues in the binding cavity of the receptor. Additionally, the complex produced a dock score and binding energy of À14.3 and À147.48 kcal/mol, respectively. Previous study has reported the mediation of glucocorticoid receptor by Dex in pancreatic cancer (Liu et al., 2017) . Several experimental studies have demonstrated the induction of resistance to chemotherapy by glucocorticoids in solid tumors (Herr & Pfitzenmaier, 2006; Volden & Conzen, 2013; Zhang et al., 2006) . The third receptor (IL-6), is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of cellular processes (Boulanger et al., 2003) , and modulation of immune responses and acute immune reaction (Dowton et al., 1991; Eaves et al., 1991; Matsuda et al., 1989) . Dysregulation of IL-6 or its receptor IL-6R correlates closely with cancer, inflammation diseases or autoimmune diseases (Hideshima et al., 2004; Nishimoto et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs causes acute respiratory syndrome which in turn activates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Suppression of inflammation can be achieved by inhibiting the activities of IL-6. Molecules that inhibit the IL-6RA would inactivate IL-6R and further decrease the inflammation of the lung tissue in individuals with COVID-19 (Conti et al., 2020; Mahmud-Al-Rafat et al., 2019; .Drug discovery is a crucial aspect of research in which simulations can drive experiments (Borhani & Shaw, 2012; Durrant & McCammon, 2011) . Recent advances in structural biology have led to structures for many key drug discovery targets. Fully exploiting the power of structure-based drug design requires taking the dynamic properties of proteins into account (Hollingsworth & Dror, 2018) . Simulations have proven valuable in deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. MD was used to capture the behavior of Dex and potential SARS-CoV-2 targets in full atomic detail and at very fine temporal resolution.The RMSD of the backbone of the targets were used to evaluate the stability of the systems. This parameter is a measure of how much the protein targets changes with respect to the initial structure over the course of the simulation (structural distance between coordinates). The results of the RMSD of the Dex-targets were studied using 50 ns trajectories. The RMSD behavior of the complex in each system did not deviate drastically over the simulation testing period studied. The RMSD values of the system observed in this study was within the range of 2.25 À 3.6 Å. This range of value is a measure of how much the targets conformation changed with respect to Dex. RMSD around 1.0 À 3.0 Å is acceptable for small and globular proteins and changes much larger than 3.0 Å, however, shows that the target proteins underwent conformational changes during the simulation. It was also observed that the simulation converged and a stabilized RMSD values were seen at a fixed value (40 À 50 ns) in all the systems. This shows that the systems equilibrated and the simulation time was enough for rigorous analysis. The binding pose of Dex to glucocorticoid receptor seems to be stable throughout the MD simulation times (50 ns), maintaining complexation and hydrogen bonding for Dex as well as hydrophobic contacts with preferred partners on glucocorticoid receptor. The characterization of the local fluctuation of the targets was carried out using the RMSF in order to compare the time average representation per residue fluctuations representing the flexibility of each residue. The results show that the complexes maintained a reasonable stability in aqueous medium. For glucocorticoid-Dex, the residues around 25 and 250 fluctuated much more and these regions correspond to the terminal regions of glucocorticoid. In the Mpro-Dex system, only the residues at the N-terminal and C-terminal fluctuated the most. The system for IL-6-Dex fluctuated the most among the three systems. Additionally, the residues around 110 in the IL-6 (around 4.8 Å) were involved in larger fluctuation within the system and with respect to other systems. Secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta strands are usually more rigid than unstructured part of a protein and thus will fluctuate less. Hydrogen Bonds and their properties play a significant role in ligand binding specifically in drug design due to their strong influence on drug specificity, metabolization and adsorption. Hydrogen bonds between a protein and a ligand can be further broken down into four subtypes: backbone acceptor; backbone donor; side-chain acceptor; side-chain donor. These bonds stabilize the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins which are formed by alpha helix, beta sheets, turns and loops. The current geometric criteria for protein-ligand H-bond in this study is a distance of 2.5 Å between the donor and acceptor atom. These contacts are one of the most important contributions to protein-ligand interactions governed by changes in entropy and enthalpy (Klebe & B€ ohm, 1997) .Similarly, but less stable, Dex maintained complexation, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic contacts with Mpro and IL-6 specific residues. Other contacts observed in this study (SARS-CoV-2 potential targets and Dex interactions) include hydrophobic interaction, ionic contact, and salt bridges. Hydrophobic contacts include p-Cation; p-p; and other, non-specific interactions. These contacts are important for the folding of proteins keeping them stable, biologically active, and reduce the undesirable interactions with water. The importance of ionic contact was also observed due to their potent electrostatic attractions. In the hydrophobic interior of proteins, ionic bonds may approach the strength of covalent bonds making them crucial for stability (Pace et al., 2014) . Water bridges are hydrogen-bonded protein-ligand interactions mediated by a water molecule. In the simulation study, the hydrogen-bond geometry of the water bridges is slightly relaxed from the standard H-bond interactions.Based on the hydrogen bond contact and other interactions between the complexes during molecular docking study and simulation, five atoms of Dex were involved in the binding interactions with the receptors. These atoms may be significant and constant with other targets. Specifically, Dex interacted with the amino acid residues in the binding sites of the studied receptors through hydrogen bonding using three molecules of its hydroxyl groups at positions 12, 23, and 28 and additional oxygen atoms at position 10 and 25. During simulations, the hydrogen bonding observed in the docking analysis was stable and constantly in contact with glucocorticoid. GLN 642 was hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of Dex at position 12 (hydrogen bond donor). This residue was in contact with Dex for about half the entire time of contact during simulation. ASN564 retained the hydrogen interaction in the binding domain and the hydroxyl group at position 21 and 28 of Dex throughout the entire simulation time. Although the hydrogen bond interaction between ARG611 and the oxygen atom at position 10 of Dex were highly unstable, water bridges were observed for about 50% of the entire simulation time. The interactions in the IL-6 system were totally unstable as the hydrogen interactions observed between the ASP34, GLN175, and LEU33 and the hydroxyl groups at position 12, 23, and 28, respectively, were replaced with residues GLU55, MET6, GLN12, and LYS 129 using both hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and water bridges throughout the simulation period. For Mpro system, all the target residues were stable and constantly in contact with Dex's oxygen atoms at position 10 (CYS44), and two hydroxyl groups at position 12 (ASN142), and 28 (GLU166). The contact observation therefore shows that glucocorticoid and Mpro systems of Dex are more stable than the IL-6-Dex system.Given the strong interactions with Dex and its atoms in close contact with the amino acid residues in the binding pockets of the receptors, conformational changes could be induced which may affect binding interaction and lead to receptors inactivation. The role and expression of glucocorticoid receptor in COVID-19 is still elusive. Drugs that function as glucocorticoid mediators, either as agonists or antagonists, are used in many sections of therapeutic activities (Rathnayake & Weerasinghe, 2018) . This data suggest that it is possible that Dex might interact with receptors other than glucocorticoid receptor to alleviate COVID-19. Taking note that the immune system plays an important role in the fight against COVID-19, the use of corticosteroids in the initial stages was previously discouraged. However, the current finding does suggest that this drug might be favorable in patients with severe COVID-19. The current clinical studies on Dex is expected to share insights on its mechanisms, and possibly identify the targets and validate if Dex use is only effective in severe cases and not the early stages. Currently, it is not clear whether Dex binds to host or the virus receptors but based on this study, the possibility of the drug binding to either of the two exists.This study shows that the binding of Dex to the studied targets (Mpro, glucocorticoid, and IL-6 receptors) could prevent the synthesis and attenuate pulmonary inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19. The statistics indicates that the strength of binding energies of Dex to glucocorticoid and Mpro is stronger than IL-6. Furthermore, the elucidation of the detailed mechanism of interaction between Dex and these receptors will further enable rational design of highly effective inhibitory molecules for SARS-CoV-2 targets.The mode of interaction with other molecules and effective dosage of Dex can further be investigated experimentally to ascertain its biological fitness. Other reported SARS-CoV-2 targets such as Protein Kinase Ca type which mediate lung endothelial injury and Basigin (CD147) which mediates viral entry into host cells can be explored for therapeutic development against COVID-19 using Dex.","South Africa","first author","2020-09-14",9

As countries adjust their public health measures, it is imperative that the most vulnerable members of the society are protected and supported. 1 Sex workers belong to the vulnerable and key populations in Africa who are highly stigmatized, criminalized, and marginalized. 2 Sex work in Africa has always been surrounded by controversies and debates concerning its cultural, legal, and social frameworks. With the stigma and criminalization of the trade in Africa, sex workers have often had their rights infringed upon, including limited access to healthcare services and legal services. 3, 4 Measure Evaluation 5 reported that social stigma, gender-based violence, and discriminatory policies including criminalization of all lifestyles of key populations hinder their access to care and treatment. These groups are hard to reach with health interventions and behavioral change interventions because they are often mobile and ""hidden."" 5 In the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this at-risk group is made even more vulnerable and further pushed to the farthest margins as it affects this group disproportionately. 6 It is also worrisome that as the economic threat of COVID-19 continues to increase and the population are pushed to more difficulties, there could be a surge of sex workers, further posing challenges to COVID-19 containment efforts.Sex workers in Africa are among the communities suffering the most because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as lockdown and police crackdowns leave millions without income. 7 They are being forgotten in government responses to the COVID-19 crisis and are finding themselves unable to provide for themselves and their families, thereby increasing their vulnerability. 6 In addition, sex workers are also facing harsh business conditions such as low pay for their services, as the number of clients becomes very low. 8, 9 Because of relative collapse of their industry, some sex workers are unable to afford rent or alternative forms of shelter, making them further vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. 10 Sex workers do not also have access to employment insurance or many of the recent governments' emergency support and rent assistance for citizens, 11 and because of the cultural criminalization of sex work in Africa, they are not entitled to various COVID-19 social services and safety net. They are also often denied help, further reiterating poverty, inequality, and marginalization among this group. 12 For instance, governments in Botswana and South Africa provided relief packages to most of their citizens, sex workers were mostly excluded, and, as such, nongovernmental organizations had to step up to render assistance to this population. 13 Sex workers in Nigeria and Uganda have also reported on how exclusion from government safety net has forced them back to sex work amid COVID-19. 8 Because of the nature of sex work, physical distancing and other precautionary measures are impossible to observe, further compromising COVID-19 response.Sex workers in Africa are often exposed to violence, rape, and all sorts of physical abuse. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there has also been a spike in violence faced by sex workers, from clients, police, and even community members who blame them for spreading the disease. 2 With criminalization of sex work in Africa, sex workers are therefore more exposed to punitive measures to enforce COVID-19 regulations. Increased policing and curfew can expose them to more violence, abuse, and harassment. 6 Furthermore, sex workers have always been at a higher risk of contracting and spreading infectious disease such as HIV. Many studies have noted that HIV prevalence among sex workers is more than 10-to 20-fold higher than that in the general population. 3, 4 However, in recent times, empowerment and education of sex workers have been proven to help curb the spread of HIV. 14 Availability of antiretroviral treatment to those living with HIV and education on safe sex practices such as condom use to reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted illnesses have gone a long way to reduce the prevalence of the disease. 15 COVID-19 threatens the achievements made as access to health services and HIV treatment and prevention services are made difficult because of the pandemic. Many sex workers complain of limited access to health services as well as dwindled condom supply. 16 It is therefore not impossible that the hard-won achievements in HIV response in Africa could be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. More so, mental health problems among African sex workers are likely to also be ensued from anxiety over income, food, and housing, alongside concerns about infection and danger from continuing to work in the absence of sexual and social protection. 17 They are becoming increasingly worried about their health, 18 and those living with HIV are greatly concerned that their prior condition, with its negative effects on their immune system, will make them especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 and may worsen their health. 10 With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for the UN Development Program, UN member states all pledged to ensure ""no one will be left behind"" and to ""endeavor to reach the furthest behind first."" 19 This could not be more important than now as sex workers as a part of the population are left behind in COVID-19 response in Africa. The framework proposed three approaches to ""examine the disadvantages people face, to empower those who are left behind, and to enact inclusive farsighted and progressive sustainable development goals."" 19 It is also of point to note that there is no universal health coverage without every aspect of the population being reached and that includes even those in the farthest margins. Therefore, it is essential that for African states to achieve COVID-19 control and healthy communities, all aspects of the population must be covered, including the vulnerable groups. As Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), stated: ""Human rights law mandates that human rights are inalienable, universal, interdependent, and indivisible,"" therefore ""ensuring that this is a reality for all-especially the most vulnerable among us-is not only essential during this pandemic but will also build the resilient communities we need to emerge from it."" 6 Efforts need to be made by governments across Africa toward decriminalization of sex work, continuing education, and empowerment of sex workers. Support from the African governments even during this pandemic period will go a long way toward sex workers' integration and inclusion into the society.Involving communities in social protection schemes, health services, and information dissemination will enable sex workers and other key populations to protect their health during this pandemic. 20 The WHO 21 reported that eliminating sexual violence against sex workers could lead to 20% reduction in new HIV infection. Therefore, access to HIV treatment and prevention or to vital services addressing domestic or other forms of violence is crucial. 21 High levels of stigma and discrimination toward sex workers could also make contact tracing challenging and limit access to COVID-19 testing. Stigma remains an important issue for a large proportion of sex workers-when they seek timely professional help, openly disclose their sex work identity, and seek comprehensive healthcare services in Africa. 22 Addressing stigma is certainly crucial for connecting marginalized sex workers to vital health services, including antiretroviral therapy for those living with HIV. 23 This becomes imperative amid this ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. Distribution of hand sanitizers, soaps, condoms, and personal protective equipment, including the utilization of person-centered services to address needs associated with mental health, drug use, physical and sexual violence, and sexual and reproductive health, including HIV treatment, remains pertinent among the vulnerable groups including sex workers. 1 This further reinforces the need for unique COVID-19 response in Africa as previously reported by Lucero-Prisno et al. 24 It is important that the African government should ensure collective and inclusive response in the fight against COVID-19. Everyone is not safe, until all is safe.","Nigeria","first author","2020-09-15",9

Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones.. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.Keywords: Single Cell Sequencing; COVID-19; Obesity; shared immunogenetics; immunologic switch; beneficial inflammation; deleterious inflammationSince the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2), the scientific community has been pushing the current boundaries of virology, in search of a widely anticipated breakthrough. The novel virus, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for more than 18 million infections and 700,000 deaths worldwide, is still ongoing. With the race for a vaccine intensifying, unraveling the reasons behind the variable immune response in COVID-19 patients has taken the research field by storm. Interestingly, COVID-19 patients show symptoms that are highly variable in intensity and severity, ranging from asymptomatic cases to hospitalization and intensive care treatment. (Kim & Kim, 2020) Researchers are striving to establish correlations between comorbid conditions and the exaggerated immune response to COVID-19, which often leads to poor prognosis. The possible genetic correlation that links the immune response to COVID-19 and obesity, proposes a new era in genetic testing and precision medicine that can drastically improve outcomes for patients with severe COVID-19.ScRNA-seq (Single cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing) focuses on the analysis of individual cells, instead of bulk cell populations, and can lead to a more insightful characterization of local microenvironments than traditional sequencing methods. (Hwang et al., 2018) The first goal of this review is to elucidate the various benefits added by single cell sequencing to the current understanding of COVID-19 infection including; (1) the specific tropism of certain tissues, (2) the immunologic response that characterizes mild, moderate, and severe infection, (3) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the likelihood of infection in certain subgroups of patients, namely, the elderly, obese, as well as the protective effect of female gender in severe forms of infection.Second, we hypothesize that the inflammatory and immune mechanisms in response to COVID-19 are similar to those involved in the generalized inflammatory state of obese individuals, putting them at a greater risk of hospitalization and poor disease outcome. In this review, we analyze findings on the immune response to COVID-19 and correlate it to the activation of innate immunity in obesity, aiming to establish guidelines for predicting the genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19.Three proteins have been related to the cellular entry and activation of SARS-CoV-2, namely ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2), TMPRS2 (Transmembrane Protease 2), and Furin.Studies based on the profiling of ACE2, TMPRS2, and Furin mRNA (Messenger Ribonucleic acid) and protein expression, proposed multiple tissue cells as potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus, including cells from almost every important human system. It was previously thought that lung expression of ACE2 receptors is the highest, being the most heavily involved organ.However, emerging evidence pointed to a discrepancy between the level of expression of such key proteins, and tissue involvement. Moreover, a mismatch was often found between both levels. The adrenal gland expresses little mRNA but showed a median level of ACE2 protein, while other tissues, such as the heart muscle and adipose tissue, showed a high level of expression of mRNA, but undetectable protein levels. Protein expression detection in situ is hence necessary beside mRNA expression analysis. (Heialy et al., 2020) Although the lungs are the most severely impacted organs in COVID-19, the degree of expression of the three key proteins was found to be low. Alveolar Type 2 cells, alternatively known as type 2 pneumocytes, were the only lung cells to express the Furin and ACE2, while other cells have been found with undetectable levels of ACE2. However, the lung endothelial cells were noted to highly express both ACE2 and Furin. This further demonstrates the vascular inflammatory origin and microthrombi induced damage causing the SARS-CoV-2manifestations. An example of this is the identification of endotheliitis in postmortem samples from COVID patients and further explains the mounting rise of the use of blood thinners to treat them. (Braun & Sauter, 2019; Xu et al., 2020) Alternatively, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was found to be the most expressive organ of the three key proteins, raising the awareness of the GIT being a potential reservoir for the disease.Further claims have been made, albeit controversially, to the potential viability of COVID viral particles in the environment, enough for the possibility of faeco-oral transmission. Several studies not only noted the prolonged viral shedding from the gastrointestinal tract beyond that of the respiratory systems for up to 5 weeks, but also the perseverance of rectal swabs farther than nasopharyngeal swabs. Studies have also reported the often-underestimated associated diarrhea with regards to its onset (1-8 weeks after the onset of COVID), duration (1-14 days), severity (up to 9 bowel movements per day), and nature (34.3% watery diarrhea). The prognosis of SARS-made that the origin of COVID's pulmonary manifestations is a ramification of the gastrointestinal system's involvement. This is thought to be due to the communication of their microflora and to the role of the GIT in increasing the inflammatory cytokines responsible for inflammatory lung damage, owing to its high expression of ACE2 and Furin. (Gu et al., 2020; Samanta et al., 2020) A final finding is the high expression of Furin in the placenta. This goes in agreement with the results of the systematic review by our working group. We analyzed the pregnancy outcomes of more than 1700 pregnant mothers infected with COVID-19 and found out that placental abnormalities with subsequent fetal hypoxia are the most frequently encountered complication in pregnancies complicated by COVID-19. (Abdelmassih et al., 2020) II-Striking similarity of Lung milieu in severe COVID-19 and adipose tissue changes in obesity Liao et al compared the cellular immune response in mild and severe COVID-19 cases. The study, using single cell sequencing of RNA (scRNA-seq) analysis, compared the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from three cases with moderate infection and six cases with severe COVID-19. (Liao et al., 2020) To date, there is no single study describing the specific cellular changes by single cell sequencing occurring in the lung milieu of obese COVID-19 patients compared to lean subjects. However, it is well established that obesity is characterized by an overactive innate immunity, which stems from nutrient overload and results in a hyper-inflammatory state. This low-grade inflammation extends over a number of organs involved in energy homeostasis including the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, and skeletal muscles. (Saltiel & Olefsky, 2017) . Of the brilliantly complex and intertwined inflammatory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanisms, surprisingly, there is an intriguing similarity between the immune cellular landscape occurring in the lung milieu of severe COVID-19 patients, and the immune cellular alterations occurring in the adipose tissue.Macrophages manifest distinct phenotypes according to the organs in which they reside. They also flexibly switch their character to adapt to changing environments. One of the commonest interchanges of the macrophage phenotype is between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2(regulatory) macrophage phenotypes.A comparison of macrophage subphenotypes in the lung milieu in severe COVID-19 patients has revealed that the expressed macrophages showed predominant features of M1 macrophages with high Forward Scatter (FSC) closer to that seen in M1. Though very similar to the M1 phenotype, the macrophage phenotype encountered in severe cases of COVID-19, also shows some features of M2 macrophages such as the expression of Proliferated Activated Receptor gamma agonists (PPARγ). (Halaney et al., 2015) .It was previously widely accepted that macrophage switching in obese states occurs in favor of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages until Castoldi et al outlined the presence of a third phenotype sharing features of both types. This third phenotype mimics the one found in the lung microenvironment in COVID-19, which is also sensitive to inhibition by PPAR γ agonists as suggested by Ciavarella et al. (Ciavarella, Motta, Valente, & Pasquarelli, 2020) . The balance of pro-versus anti-inflammatory activation determines the protective versus the deleterious impact on the host.The persistence of M1-like macrophages in severe COVID-19 not only increases short term J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mortality, but can also lead to long term complications due to delayed recovery of affected tissues. Rodriguez and colleagues profiled the course of resolving versus persistent inflammation, with special reference to IL-1 (Interleukin 1) family molecules. An independent single cell mRNA analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells during early recovery of COVID-19 infection revealed an increased ratio and level of classical CD14++ (Cluster of differentiation) IL-1β+ monocytes. It is worth mentioning that those receptors are another evidence of macrophage polarization toward M1 macrophages in COVID-19. (Rodriguez et al.,Of the different macrophage subtypes, lung Alveolar Macrophages (AMs), which harbor Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 (FABP4), constitute the majority of the macrophage population in lungs under physiological conditions (Hussell & Bell, 2014) . Patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms showed this profile, while severe COVID-19 patients showed an almost total loss of lung AMs.In addition, the loss of lung AMs in severe COVID-19 patients was accompanied by an overpopulation of monocyte-derived macrophages expressing Ficolin-1 (FCN-1), and profibrotic macrophages with increased cellular levels of Osteopontin (SPP1+).Such profibrotic macrophages express a number of chemokine ligands (CCL/CXCL), and Interleukins (IL) (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), which makes them heavily involved in an exaggerated deleterious inflammatory reaction.The combined effect of FABP4 depletion and FCN1+ overexpression in severe COVID-19 cases leads to the deterioration of lung function (Liao et al., 2020) As mentioned earlier, Liao and colleagues (Bourgonje et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Z. Zhou et al., 2020) outlined the cellular changes that are encountered in the microenvironment of severe COVID-19 cases, which are linked to a higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). In their series, they also demonstrated the upregulation of several genes linked to cellular entry or cytokine expression in severe COVID-19 cases.In the previous section, two of those genes were overexpressed by lung macrophages, namely FCN-1 and SPPN. The latter two genes were also linked to the augmented inflammation seen in the adipose tissue of obese individuals.In this section, we attempt to elucidate the genes involved in severe COVID-19 worst clinical picture, surprisingly most of these genes are also implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and its complications as follows:IL-6 is the chemokine mediating the cytokine storm in COVID-19; its levels have been suggested by our working group to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 cases. IL-6 was also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f found to be elevated in plasma and adipose tissue in obesity. The role of IL-6 in obesity has been suggested to be partially protective. IL-6 overexpression in skeletal muscle stimulates energy expenditure and reduces food intake and its low levels lead to obesity and insulin resistance.Exercise is important to control weight gain since, as a myokine, IL-6 is secreted by contracting muscle and is elevated two to threefold in the circulation during exercise (exercise-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue). (de Glisezinski et al., 2003) Xiong and colleagues demonstrated an important role for Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) in the lung milieu of severe COVID-19 cases. MCP-1 plays a role in the previously explained macrophage phenotypic polarization. It is also known as an insulin responsive gene.Additionally, in vivo studies proved that MCP-1 is excessively expressed in mice with obesity in comparison with lean controls, and that white adipose tissue is an essential source of MCP-1. (Cranford et al., 2016; Deshmane et al., 2009) One of the major hallmarks of macrophages is their heterogeneity, which is reflected by their specialized function in a particular microenvironment. Besides their heterogeneity, macrophages are known to display remarkable plasticity. In response to different micro-environmental stimuli, a fully differentiated macrophage can adopt a polarized phenotype with specific functional characteristics. As mentioned earlier, the classic phenotypic switching of macrophages from M1 to M2, and the reverse, is mainly driven through a cross-talk of paracrine mediators, namely Chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2). A statistically vital correlation was found between CCR2 expression in monocytes with body weight and fat mass, and also with insulin and HOMA IR.The affiliation of CCR2 expression with insulin resistance has been previously noticed in subjects having more developed metabolic disorder, where higher monocyte CCR2 expression The occurrence of low-grade inflammation in obesity has been considered for years as a therapeutic target to improve various aspects of obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance. However, there is recent evidence that this low-grade inflammation is rather beneficial. Aging was also found to increase the expression of genes related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility which further explains their increased susceptibility to COVID-19. (Zheng et al., 2020) These changes bring to mind the immunotype 1 response seen in cases with severe COVID-19 infection.Gender is a risk factor for higher severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, independent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn conclusion, single cell sequencing has led to more understanding of several aspects in the context of COVID-19. One of the unleashed mechanisms is the relative independence of organ involvement to ACE2 concentration in such organs; Furin seems a better predictor of organ involvement. Furin affinity also seems to be the key differentiating factor between mild and severe strains of the virus. Moreover, there seem to be two distinct immune responses to COVID-19; a deleterious type 1 response and a beneficial type reaction. Type 1 response is characterized by an extremist phenotypic switch of macrophages towards M1, dysfunctional dendritic cells with inefficient antigen presentation, and uncontrolled proliferation of CD 8 cells,with resulting exhaustion and depletion of its effector function. Surprisingly, obesity, old age, male gender, and African American race seem to have a likelihood to develop this immunotype 1 response due to complex interplay between genetic and endocrinal factors, thus, explaining the higher mortality observed in such subgroups. The establishment of guidelines for a predictive genetic test is a huge milestone in precision medicine concerning COVID-19 and can surely lead to more efficient and tailored treatment protocols. Also developing treatments that can reprogram the immune response from type 2 to type 1 response in COVID-19, such as leptin sensitizers, can be a game-changer in the prognosis of affected cases.Abbreviations: FBP4: Fatty acid binding protein 4, FCN1: Ficollin, SPP1: Osteopontin, --: Decreased, ++: Increased (Liao et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020) -ScRNA-seq focuses on the analysis of individual cells, instead of bulk cell populations, and can lead to a more insightful characterization of local microenvironments -ScRNA-seq unleashed that tissue tropism in COVID-19 is not solely determinant by ACE2 distribution but rather by Furin -ScRNA-seq in COVID-19 revealed two distinct types of immunologic reactions, deleterious type 1 characterized by inefficient antigen presentation, decreased memory B cells, imbalance between M1 and M2 macrophages and T cell exhaustion, and beneficial type 2 reaction which exactly the reverse of the type 1.-The immunotype 1 reaction is intriguingly similar to the immune landscape seen in obese individuals when leptin resistance sets in -This might indicate that the use of leptin sensitizers to induce an immunologic switch from immunotype 1 to immunotype 2 can greatly improve the outcome of COVID-19 cases.-ScRNA-seq was also able to unveil the disparity between aggressive and milder strains of SARS-CoV-2, which are mainly related to their affinity to cellular activation by Furin -The applications of ScRNA-seq may help to anticipate cases at higher risk of severe COVID-19 at their earliest encounter J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Egypt","abstract","2020-09-24",9

As the epicenter of transmission moved from East Asia to West Asia and Europe and then to North America, there was speculation as to the likely impact of the pandemic on the African continent with its young populations, infectious disease burden, undernutrition and fragile health infrastructure. However, as health systems and economies of high-income countries strained, the reported burden of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths in Africa remained low (2) . Even today, other than for South Africa, this remains true throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The question is whether this is the result of lower risk due to demographic structure (young age (3)) or cross-reacting immunity (e.g. pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive T cells (4)) a low reproduction number from imposed interventions (such as school closures and lockdowns (5)) or environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity (6)), or under-reporting. The reason this remains a conundrum is, at least in part, a paucity of good quality data to reveal the probable extent of SARS-CoV-2 spread in African populations.Following the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Kenya on 13th March 2020, the Kenyan Government moved rapidly, closing international borders, schools, restaurants, bars and nightclubs, banning meetings and social gathering and imposing a dusk to dawn curfew and movement restrictions in the two major city counties, Nairobi and Mombasa, considered epidemic hotspots at the time (7) . The major concerns from unmitigated spread were a limited surge capacity of the Kenyan health system (8) and groups of the Kenyan population identified as potentially highly vulnerable to infection and/or severe disease (9) . Throughout the months of April, May and into June 2020 few people in Kenya were reported SARS-CoV-2 test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or severely diseased or dying with COVID-19 as the established cause (10) . There followed a relaxation of some measures in June and July including opening of restaurants and places of worship and the removal of travel restrictions into and out of Mombasa and Nairobi counties. As of 10 th August 2020, there have been 23,873 laboratory-confirmed positive swab tests out of over 320,000 tests, and 391 deaths with a positive test result in Kenya. This should be compared with the 200-250,000 cases and 30-40,000 deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 for similar sized countries in Europe (France, Italy, UK) at equivalent months into their epidemics.The reason for this apparently low level of COVID-19 disease in Kenya is unknown, and non-reporting is a potential explanation. However, two pieces of information suggest an explanation that SARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively with a smaller proportion than expected having severe disease. First, a regionally-stratified seroprevalence study of 3098Kenyan blood donors sampled between May and June reported a national estimate of 5.2%(adjusted to reflect the population distribution by age, sex and region) (11) . Seroprevalence was higher in Nairobi (8.5%) and Mombasa (9.3%). These levels of seropositivity are comparable to those reported in May in the UK (12) , April/May in Spain (13) , and March/April in some US cities (14) , where in contrast to Kenya, high numbers of PCRpositive cases, hospitalizations and deaths have also been reported. Second, early in August 2020, we noticed that test-positive PCR cases were declining in Mombasa, the second largest city in Kenya. This went counter to evidence of increased mixing, and hence reproduction potential, arising from Google Mobility data for Mombasa showing a steady reversion in mobility towards pre-COVID-19 intervention levels from early April (Fig. S1 ).We developed a simple SEIR compartmental mechanistic and data-driven transmission model for Kenya, which integrates three sources of longitudinal data: national time series PCR tests, the Kenyan serological survey and Google mobility behavioural data (15). Our aim is to derive a coherent picture of SARS-COV-2 epidemiology in Kenya and reveal the historic and future patterns of spread across the country and by county. This approach allows us to generate a crude estimate of infection-to-fatality ratio (IFRcrude) between estimated infections and observed deaths with a positive test result; reported deaths are not used as primary data for inference, but rather as a validation data set for model predictive accuracy (see supporting information for description of model validation).As at 10 th August 2020, a substantial proportion of PCR positive tests have been samples from the capital Nairobi (10,575 positive tests), and Kenya's second largest city, Mombasa, has reported the next highest number of PCR positive tests (1, 962) . We find that the rate of new infections peaked on May 31st 2020 (CI May 25th -June 15th) in Mombasa and July 10th 2020 (CI July 2nd -July 19th) in Nairobi, and is now declining (Fig. 1H,G) . The model suggests that the PCR test and serology data can be explained by the initial presence of <10 infected individuals in Mombasa and <50 in Nairobi on 21st February, three weeks before the first reported case in Kenya. Thereafter, growth of transmission was rapid in both counties.There remains a possibility of future increase in transmission if population mobility continues to rise, if population mixing patterns alter leading to changed risk heterogeneity or if immunity is short lived, leading to a rebound in reported cases. It is possible that nonantibody mechanisms of immunity (for instance T cells (3)) also contribute to apparent herd immunity at low serological prevalence.The fitted IFRcrude values for both Nairobi (IFRcrude = 0.014% (CI: 0.010%-0.023%) ) andMombasa (IFRcrude = 0.02% (CI:0.014%-0.028%)) are substantially lower than the ageadjusted IFR expected for Kenya under full ascertainment (IFRverity = 0.26%; (19) and supporting information). This is a crude observational value for the infection to fatality ratio, since we do not currently have an estimate of the reporting bias of deaths of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our estimate of IFRcrude potentially reflects lower detection in Kenya compared to China, as well as any lower mortality risk due to fewer comorbidities. We extended our model-based inference to each of the 47 counties in Kenya (see dataset S1Because of the lag between infection and the observability of the infected person (whether by swab PCR test, serology test, or death), we estimate that both daily PCR positive test detections and daily observed deaths attributed to COVID-19 across all of Kenya were peaking in early August 2020. Accessing complete data on hospitalisation rates in Kenya has been challenging. However, sentinel clinical surveillance from county hospitals suggests a modest increase in adult admissions trending towards pre-COVID numbers in June and July 2020 but, on average, lower than observed counts from at a similar period in 2018 and 2019 (20). Our prediction is that rates of new PCR positive tests and deaths attributed to COVID-19 will enter a long-tailed decline from August 2020 onwards; that is, the rate of epidemic decline will be less steep than the rapid growth phase as the decrease in the main cities is partially off-set by growth in the rest of Kenya (Fig. 3 B&C) . It is likely hospitalisation incidence will follow a similar trend to the infection and death rates. By fitting an IFRcrude value for each county in Kenya, we expect that by the end of December 2020 less than 1000 deaths in Kenya will be cumulatively attributed to COVID-19 (Fig. 3C ). It should be noted that our projections are based on an assumption that the PCR testing rate in Kenya is either increasing or flat in each county, if the testing rate declines then we expect the rate of PCR positive tests to decline even more steeply than predicted in this study.Our modelling analysis provides a coherent account of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Kenya.Tables S1Dataset S1-S6We use three daily time series as sources of data to infer model parameters for each Kenyan county:• PCR positive swab samples by collection date, ( + ) , denoting the number of observed on day n in county c. The county-specific time series of PCR positive swabs was derived from the Kenya linelist by identifying cases with reported PCR positive swabs in that county by their date of sample collection (or lab confirmation date if collection date was not available). We excluded positive swabs that were traced either at entry into Kenya or due to being a contact of an identified case, so as to focus on Kenyan population surveillance.• Numbers of sero-positive ( + ) , and sero-negative ( − ) , blood samples collected from regional centres of the Kenyan National Blood Transfusion Service (KNBS) on day n originating from county c.• Daily estimates of relative human mobility , compared to a baseline of the same date in the previous year (2019) derived from Google mobility trends (15).• Deaths with a positive PCR-confirmed test by date of death for each county, ( + ) .The ( + ) , time-series ran between 13th March and 10th August, however we removed data from 7th until 10th August because of delay between the sample date and the positive swab test being confirmed and added to the Kenyan linelist. The ( + ) , and ( − ) , data was collected in May and June. Residual blood samples for serology were obtained from regular blood donors attending 4 regional KNBTS centres (Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret and Kisumu). The study methodology is fully described in Uyoga et al (11) .We assumed that changes in trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya were due to changes in the underlying population mobility. In particular, by changing frequency of indoor congregations. Therefore, we calculated , as the average change in baseline mobility over the ""retail and recreation"", ""grocery and pharmacy"", ""transit stations"", and, ""workplaces"" settings (Google defined categories), and also over the week prior to day n, in order to average over weekend effects. Due to incomplete data, and the likely bias introduced by using a mobility estimate derived from smartphone users in predicting the mobility of semi-rural populations outside of the major urban conurbations in Kenya, we consider only three areas: Nairobi, Mombasa and the pan-Kenyan aggregate (Fig. S1 ).The rate of infectious contacts per infectious individual, , was given as the time-varying instantaneous reproductive number ( ), that is the number of secondary cases per infected individual assuming both a fully susceptible population and the time-varying mobility rate being fixed at time t (26), rescaled by the recovery rate from infection ( ). The instantaneous reproductive number for a county was assumed to change daily proportional to the change in the mobility rate:when t was in day n.The ""area"" of the county was Nairobi or Mombasa for those counties, otherwise the Pan-Kenyan mobility estimate was used. The baseline reproductive number 0 was inferred for each county.The model dynamics are given as differential equations for susceptible ( ( )), latently infected ( ( )), actively infectious ( ( )), recovered/immune ( ( )), and, cumulative infections ( ( )),All variables and parameters are described in table S1. The transmission model was initialised on 21st February for each county, 21 days before the first confirmed positive test swab and the first day of available Google mobility data with initial state ( − (0) − (0), (0), (0),0,0), where , (0) and (0) were treated as target parameters for inference.Equation (2) implies the effective (instantaneous) reproductive, that is the instantaneous reproductive ratio where the reduction in susceptibility is also accounted for: = ( )/( ).The underlying transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not observed, rather we have access to PCR positive swab tests and serological tests (positive and negative) aggregated by date and county. Therefore, we developed an observation model that connects unobserved daily transmission rates, which depend on the unknown transmission parameters, to a likelihood of the observed test data. The observation model itself had two unknown parameters per county: the mean detection rate per PCR-detectable individual per day by swab testing, and the clustering factor of these detections. By defining a likelihood-based observation model we gained access to modern techniques in Bayesian inference to infer both the unknown parameters of the underlying transmission process and the unknown parameters of the observation process.The number of people who would test positive, either as PCR positive or as sero-converted, on each day n depended on: 1) the rate of new incidence on each day s < n, and, 2) the probability that someone who was infected on day s is detectable = − days later. The daily numbers of new incidence ( ) on each day n predicted by the transmission model was,The probability that an infected individual would be determined as having been infected days after infection by either a PCR test or a serology test was denoted, respectively, ( ) and ( ). The maximum sensitivity of the PCR test in a typical Kenyan setting was part of our inference methodology (see below), therefore we treated ( ) as being 0 for the first 5 days post-infection (the mean time between infection and symptoms for symptomatic cases (27)) and then was fitted to data on diagnostic accuracy given in Zhou et al (17), the fitted functional form for PCR-detectability more than 5 days after infection was:Where was the tail distribution function of a Gamma distribution with fitted shape parameter � = 18.4 and fitted scale parameter � = 1.1. This aligns with Zhou et al that the median period to become PCR undetectable after symptoms was 20 days (CI 17-24 days) (17). The lag between symptoms and maximum detectability by serological assays has been reported as 21 days in a recent metastudy of reported diagnostic sensitivities (28). We assumed that, given an additional 5 day lag after infection, the sensitivity of the serological assay increased linearly from 0 at infection to a maximum of 82.5% (11) over 26 days, ( ) = 0.825 /26 for 0 < < 26 days, ( ) = 0.825 for ≥ 26 days.The number of people in the county who would test positive on each day, with a PCR test ( + ) , and/or a serology test ( + ) , is, therefore,where was the midpoint of day n.The total number of swab samples collected, including negative tests, on each day was not available. The total number of tests performed in coastal counties which were referred to the KWTRP laboratory for PCR was available, and showed considerable variation per day (see Fig S3 for total swab tests per day in Mombasa referred to KWTRP). Moreover, there was variation in the setting at which the swab test was collected, e.g. at hospital, from a walk-up testing facility etc, as the focus of Kenyan public health teams has shifted over the course of the epidemic. Therefore, there was a high degree of variability in the detection probability per PCR-detectable infected individual per day. To account for the high variability in detection, we modelled the distribution of PCR positive swab tests collected on each day using a negative binomial distribution,Where was the mean detection rate per PCR-detectable, per day. Hence, is the expected number of positive swab tests that would be sampled on day n, given ( + ) PCRdetectable infected individuals, and was the clustering coefficient 1 for the sampling process: = 0 recovers a Poisson distribution for the number of positive swab tests collected each day, > 0 allowed the model to infer much greater variance in daily positive than expected from a Poisson distribution (29). It should be noted that the parameter effectively absorbs swab sample biasing, either for or against selecting individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, amongst the swab tested subjects along with the sensitivity of the PCR test as performed in realistic situations.The number of donor blood samples tested by day of sample collection was available, however, the reported uncertainty in the maximum sensitivity of serology assay was fairly high: the posterior mean sensitivity was 82.5% (credible interval 69.6-91.2%; (11) ). The posterior uncertainty in the serological sensitivity influenced the confidence the inference method placed on the serological sample data; if the test sensitivity was known to high precision we would treat each days serological samples as a binomial draw from an underlying proportion of seroconverted individuals given by equation (4) . Given that the sensitivity of the serological assay was itself an uncertain factor we fitted the posterior uncertainty in the testing sensitivity to a beta distribution: ∼ ( � = 33.6,̂= 7.13). This implied that the appropriate observation model for the number of positive serological samples on day n (( + ) ), out of the total number of serological samples being collected on day n, , = ( + ) + ( − ) , was a Betabinomial distribution,The observation model gives the following log-likelihood function for the unknown parameters = ( , ) given the sampling data for a county, = {( + ) , ( − ) , ( + ) } =1,2,... :Where and are, respectively, the probability mass functions for the negative binomial and beta-binomial distributions, as described in the observation model subsection. The first day where samples were included in the log-likelihood calculation was 12th April, due to testing being even more irregular before that date (Fig. S2) , and the last day was 6th August, due to right-censoring of samples collected on 7th-10th August appearing in the linelist dated 10th August.We divided the Kenyan counties into two groups: those counties with and without serology samples. The availability of serology data was highly important for this study because without serology data, the detection rate was not identifiable jointly with and the initial conditions using weak priors. Therefore, we inferred unknown parameters in the counties with serology data using weak priors (priors described below), whereas for counties without serology data we used strong priors based on the posterior distribution of the counties that had serology data (method described below). There were two exceptions to the county grouping: Kajiado county, which has no attributed serology samples but a substantial number of PCR-positives, and was added to group of counties fitted using weak priors, and West Pokot county, which had some serology data but small numbers of PCR-positives, and was added to the group using strong priors.The prior distributions for 0 , , and were the same for each county using weak priors: 0 ∼ ( � = 2, � = 2.5/2), ∼ ( � = 2,̂= 1), ∼ ( � = 3, � = 0.5/3). These priors reflect weak confidence that: 1) the fundamental 0 value in Kenya would be similar to that seen in the early Chinese epidemic, 2) the most apriori likely value of was 1, thus recovering the standard homogeneous SEIR model, and 3) that the daily detected PCRpositive swab data would be moderately overdispersed compared to a Poisson distribution. The prior distributions for and the initial numbers of infected (0) + (0) in counties with weak priors differed by county:The choice of weak priors for the counties with serology data was informed by estimates of urban density, and reflect our belief that the epidemic in Kenya was seeded by international travel to both Nairobi and Mombasa international airports and that there was apriori likely to be a higher number of infected individuals in Nairobi and Mombasa on February 21st. Our prior belief about mean detection rate was informed by openly available testing rate data for Kenya (31) (Fig. S3) , which was likely to be mainly concentrated around Nairobi, available data on testing rate in Mombasa (Fig. S2) and a weak belief that detection elsewhere would be about half as effective as in Mombasa.The prior distributions for all parameters for counties without serology data were much stronger, reflecting that in the absence of significant amounts of data, we expected these counties to have similar parameters to other Kenyan counties. To create the strong priors we pooled the posterior parameter draws of exemplar counties, and then projected this multivariate empirical distribution onto a collection of independent marginal distributions by applying maximum likelihood to each set of parameters (each parameter was assumed to have a Gamma marginal distribution except , which was assumed to have a Beta marginal distribution. Therefore, inference in the counties without serology penalised against drawing parameters that were outside the univariate credible intervals of their exemplar county. The exemplars used were:• Isiolo and Nakuru counties. Exemplar counties were Kajiado and Machakos.• Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo Marakwet, Embu, Kakamega, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Mandera, Meru, Murang'a, Nandi, Nyandarua, Samburu and Tharaka Nithi, West Pokot counties. Exemplar counties were Homa bay, Tana River, Turkana, and Wajir counties. The choice of exemplar counties was based on Kajiado and Machakos containing a mixture of urban and rural dwelling broadly similar to Isiolo and Nakuru counties. Whereas, the other Kenyan counties lacking serology data were predominantly rural. Therefore, we used a mixture of four rural exemplar counties distributed over the country. for each county using the NUTS-HMC sampler implemented by the Julia language package dynamicHMC.jl. Solving the likelihood function for a proposed value of involved solving the ODE system (2), we used the highly performant DifferentialEquations.jl package for ODE solutions (33). The HMC method required a log-likelihood gradient, , which, for our use-case of a small ODE system with a low number of parameters, was most efficiently supplied by forward-mode automatic differentiation (34) implemented by the package ForwardDiff.jl.The MCMC chain converged for each county (all MCMC chains and MCMC diagnostics can be accessed through the linked open code repository). The posterior mean (and 95% Cis) for each parameter, as well as date of maximum infection rate and estimated county-specific IFR, can be found in supplementary Data S1. West Pokot county (1 positive PCR-confirmed test and 2/17 positive serology samples) was an outlier in the analysis in that the inference converged on a posterior mean estimate of 0 which was less than one.The parameter draws from the posterior distribution defined the uncertainty in our model nowcasts and forecasts for each county, since the underlying transmission model was deterministic. Therefore, posterior distributions for epidemic quantities were created by simulating the epidemic for each ( ) , = 1,2, . . . ,10 4 posterior draws, for example the draws from the distribution of day of peak infection rate were,The central estimate is the posterior mean, [ | ] = 1 10 4 ∑ ( ) , and the 95% credible intervals were the 2.5% and 97.5% empirical quantiles of the draws from the day of peak. This approach was used through-out the main document. It should be noted that for the daily positive PCR tests we showed both the posterior mean and CIs for the mean daily detection rate of new PCR-postive swab tests, [ | ] , and the posterior prediction interval, [( + ) | ] (see equation (7)). The two quantities have the same posterior average, but ( + ) | has substantially higher variance since it includes both uncertainty in the parameter estimates and the fundamental variance in the observed daily detection of positive swab tests.The commonly used infection fatality ratio (IFR) by age estimates from Verity et al (19), weighted by the Kenyan population distribution given by the 2019 census, implied a basic IFR prediction in Kenya of = 0.264%; that is 264 deaths per 10,000 infections. This assumed an uniform attack rate across age-groups in Kenya.We used the posterior predictions of the underlying daily infections in Kenya counties to infer a crude infection fatality ratio ( ) for each Kenyan county. The lag between infection and death, for those infected individuals who die, was defined as the convolution between three time duration distributions:1. The duration of time between infection and symptoms (days), which we assumed was distributed ( � = 1.644, � = 0.363) (27). 2. The duration of time between initial symptoms and severe symptoms (days), sufficient to seek hospitalisation, which we assumed was distributed (1,5) (35). 3. The duration of time between severe symptoms and death estimated from UK hospital data (36). This was an empirical distribution with mass function . We discretized the first two distributions to give probability mass functions for the number of days between infection and symptoms, and for the number of days between symptom onset and severe symptom onset. The probability mass function for the (discrete) number of days between infection and death, for those who died, , was given as a discrete convolution over these probability mass functions:( ) = * * ( ) for the probability that death occurs days after infection.The most likely lag between infection and death was 14 days, however, the distribution was fairly heavy-tailed with mean lag between infection and death 19 days (Fig. S4) .The conditionality on is given to emphasise that the number of infections per day depended on the unknown parameters for the county. Using | ∼ (̂= 1/ ) as a weak prior for each of the county specific estimates of the crude IFR observed in Kenya, conditional on a realization of , we found that the posterior mean estimator took a simple form (see Posterior distribution of crude infection fatality ratio in supplementary text below):Similar to equation (11) Model refinement to account for increased test rate at the capitalThe publicly available ourworldindata.org coronavirus dataset (31) showed that the daily number of tests in Kenya increased from 29th March at an approximate rate of 1.6% per day relative to the overall mean tests per day (mean 2482 tests per day in Kenya between 29th March -3rd August; Fig. S3 ). This increase in testing was not reflected in increased testing at KWTRP testing laboratory (Fig. S2) , therefore, we hypothesised that the increased rate of testing in Kenya was being driven by increased testing in Nairobi and the surrounding counties of Kajiado, Kiambu and Machakos. To test this hypothesis we considered an alternate model for detection where is calendar day dependent:The baseline mean detection rate remained the target of inference. The same period for inference (12th April -6th August) was used.Incorporating the increased testing rate into the inference model improved the model information criteria relative to the basic hypothesis that mean detection rate had been constant since 12th April. This was observed using two different model information scores: the popular in-sample Bayesian model fit score, Deviance information criterion (DIC; (16)) defined as, and the out-of-sample log predictive density (LPD; (16)) for deaths. The LPD for a model was defined as,In this study, we have used a number of parameter symbols that are also the most commonly used symbols for various common parametric distributions. Moreover, these parametric distributions are used in the underlying analysis frequently with their distribution parameters defined as functions of underlying transmission model states. To reduce misunderstanding reserve symbols with ""hats"" as referring to the parameters of a parametric distribution and use ""="" to refer to the value of the parameter. Find below the choice of parametrization for the parametric distributions used in the study:• Exponential distribution.(̂= ), with mean . • Gamma distribution. Γ( � = , � = ), with shape parameter � and scale parameter � .• Negative binomial distribution.(̂= , � = ), with mean ̂ and clustering factor (inverse dispersion parameter) �.• Beta distribution.( � = ,̂= ), with shape parameters �,̂ (mean �/( � +̂)). • Beta-binomial distribution.( � = ,̂= , � = ), with number of draws � , marginal probability per draw , and ""total-count"" � (see (30) for details of this slightly unusual parameterization).• Poisson distribution.Here we give details of the posterior distribution of . It is well known that the exponential distribution is a conjugate prior to the mean of a Poisson distribution; that is that given a model where data ∼ (̂= )for = 1, . . . , , and a prior ∼ (� = 1/ 0 ), then the posterior distribution of is gamma distributed with an analytical solution: | ∼ ( � = 1 + ∑ , � = 1/( 0 + )).We demonstrate that the posterior crude infection fatality ratio, conditional on some fixed value of the parameters , | ( + ) 1 , . . . , ( + ) , , and with the prior distribution | ∼ (̂= 1/ 0 ) is also gamma distributed. This holds despite the mean number of deaths changing daily, and the posterior distribution only depends on the total number of observed deaths and the cumulative number of time delayed infections. First, we define the time delayed infections on each day using the lag distribution [equation (12) ], � = ∑ ( − ) < . We define the total time delayed infections, ̃= ∑̃, and the total deaths, + = ∑ ( + ) .Then, after cancelling terms, the posterior distribution of | given the daily deaths is,By identifying the denominator as the ( + ) ℎ moment of an exponential distribution we arrive at,The right hand side of this expression is the density function of a ( � = + + 1,","Kenya","abstract","2020-09-03",9

Corresponding authors","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has rapidly spread all over the world leading to thousands of deaths, hospitalizations, and far-reaching economic and social disruptions (Guo et al., 2020) . COVID-19 disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019 (Wu et al., 2020) . Fever and cough are the most common symptoms of the infection. other symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, muscle ache, headache, chest pain, diarrhea, hemoptysis, sputum production, rhinorrhea, nausea and vomiting, sore throat, confusion, diarrhea, and anorexia (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . The virus has caused more than 24 million infections and 824,000 deaths worldwide with massive social disruption and far-reaching economic effects as at the end of August 2020 (WHO, 2020).Transmission of SARS-CoV2 is from person to person through respiratory droplets due to coughing and sneezing and airborne aerosols. The disease can also spread through touching infected surfaces and via the fecal-oral route (Lotfi et al., 2020) . Clinical signs of COVID-19 disease appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus and include fever, sore throat, cough, headache, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle pain, chills, repeated shaking with chills, and new loss of taste or smell Sahin et al., 2020) .Testing is key in the fight against COVID-19 disease and is vital for the reopening of economies.The gold standard for COVID-19 testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (WHO, 2020) . Whereas RT-PCR produces accurate and reproducible results, it requires highly specialized, expensive, and advanced bulky equipment which cannot be used in the field or in a point of care setting. It is also slow, and requires highly trained scientists.The antigen/antibody tests for COVID-19 overcome many of the challenges of the RT-PCR tests since they are faster to conduct, cheaper, do not require expensive and bulky equipment, and can be conducted in the field or at a point of care setting by non-scientists. However, the antigen antibody tests are not very reliable and have a lower accuracy rate (Deeks et al., 2020) . Therefore, there is need for a test that provides the convenience and ease of the antigen/ antibody test but with the accuracy and reliability of the RT-PCR test.We have optimized an RPA assay for the detection of SARS-CoV2 for use in the field and in rural settings and tested its applicability at a field station in Kigali, Rwanda. The assay leverages on the power of recombinase polymerase amplification and lateral flow detection to provide a method for the rapid detection of the SARS CoV2 in an accurate, simple, and affordable manner.Unlike the RT-PCR test, isothermal amplification with detection on a lateral flow device does not require expensive equipment, is portable and easy to perform, and can be done in the field or in a point of care setting. It does not require highly trained scientists, is portable, versatile, and does not require stable electricity (Daher et al., 2016) . The optimized RPA assay was compared against the LightMix RT-PCR test (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as the 'gold standard'.To determine the best regions to target for efficient primer design, BLAST analysis was performed and the percent sequence identity between the SARS CoV2 sequences and other coronavirus sequences determined (table S 1). Primers were designed using Primer3 Plus software to flank the Orf3b and Orf8/8b regions since this exhibit the lowest homology between SARS CoV2 and other coronaviruses (Untergasser et al., 2012) . This helped maximize the specificity of the test assay. Additional primers targeted at the S1 region were designed (figure 1-9).The rationale behind the design of S1 primers is that the S precursor protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be proteolytically cleaved into S1 (685 aa) and S2 (588 aa) subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). The S2 protein is well conserved among SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares 99% identity with that of bat SARS-CoVs. In contrast, the S1 subunit consists of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus entry into sensitive cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The S1Primer design was based on best practice with regard to GC content and clamps and other basic requirements but optimized for length as is needed for RPA probes. Length optimization ensured that all primers lengths were between 18-35 with amplicon sizes ranging from 80-400bp. All forward primers relating to have unmodified 5' ends and all reverse primers have a biotin moiety conjoined at their 5' ends (Li et al., 2019) . The primer pairs amplify S1 region of SARS-CoV2.1877 ACTTACTCCTACTTGGCGTGTTTATTCTACAG The S1 probe consisted of a 5' end labeled with dioxigenin (DIG), an internal abasic THF residue, and a 3' spacer region and is homologous to a region of the amplified S1 sequence.Figure 7: SARS-CoV2 S1 region probe ORF3 and orf8a/b probes consisted of a 5' end labeled with fluorescein amidites (FAM), an internal abasic THF residue, and a 3' spacer region and is homologous to a region of the amplified ORF3a/ORF8a/b sequence. RT-PCR was conducted on Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the LightMix RT-PCR test kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) . The thermal cycling condition was 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 55 °C for 1 minute. Negative controls (no template) were incorporated into each set of reactions. Cycle threshold (ct) values higher than 40 were considered to be negative results.The TwistAmp nfo Kit (TANFO02KIT; TwistDX, Maidenhead, UK) was used to perform the reactions in a final volume of 48 μl. The reaction mix was prepared in a 1.5 ml tube. The master mix comprised of 2.1 μl of 10 μM forward primer, 2.1 μl of 10. 2 μl M reverse primer, TwistAmp® nfo probe (0.6ul), 27.5 μl of the rehydration buffer, 2.5 μl of SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, UK), and 2 μl of RNase H (ThermoFisher, UK). RNA template (1ul) and water up to 10 μl was added to the mastermix and thorough mixing done. The reaction mix was added to a TwistAmp® nfo reaction and mixed by pipetting. 2.5 μl of 280mM Magnesium Acetate (MgOAc) was added to the reaction and the reaction started by mixing.The FAM-sequence-biotin amplicons were detected on a PCRD lateral flow cassette (Abingdon forming on the cassette: line 1 positive for S1 and line 3 which is the control line.The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97 (table 2). The same samples were tested again using a second round of the RPA assay to determine whether the similar results would be obtained. 11/ 13 samples that had tested positive in the first RPA assay turned positive suggesting a reproducibility rate of 84% while one of the samples that had tested positive in the first round assay turned negative for the second time. All the 14 samples that were negative in the first RPA assay also tested negative again, suggesting a reproducibility rate of 100% for negative samples.In this study, we have shown that the RPA assay has a sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of ~93% compared to the gold standard RT-PCR test when used in the detection of the SARS-CoV2 virus from nasopharyngeal swabs. The gold standard was the LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes. The LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and RdRp gene tests are based on amplification of a 76 bp long fragment from a conserved region in the SARS-CoV2 E gene and of the RdRp gene respectively followed by detection using FAM-labelled hydrolysis probes. The sensitivity and specificity of the LightMix® E-gene kit has been validated by several researchers (Corman et al., 2020; Roche, 2020) . Findings show that this test has high specificity and sensitivity, does not show cross reactions with common pathogens, is rapid with fewer verification requirements, and is widely deployed (Yip et al., 2020; PHE, 2020) . Based on this, the LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit was an appropriate gold standard to use for comparison during the RPA validation.The overall sensitivity of the RPA assay was 93.3%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 92.9%, and the negative likelihood ratio 0.067 compared to the gold standard. A systematic review of RT-PCR tests revealed that initial false-negative RT-PCR results occur in 54% of all COVID-19 tests and that the sensitivity of these tests ranges from 71-98% (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Broughton et al (2020) described an RPA-based method for detection of SARS-CoV2 using CRISPR/Cas-12 and reported a PPV of 95% and 100% NPV compared to the conventional RT-PCR assay (Broughton et al., 2020) . Thus, our RPA assay compares well with available RT-PCR tests and the CRISPR/Cas12 test.Reproducibility was 100% for samples that had initially tested negative and 84% for those that had initially tested positive discounting possible anomalies in the lab testing process for the RPA assay.Even though RT-PCR tests such as the gold standard used in this study have received positive reviews (Corman et al., 2020) , these tests can also detect other sarbecoviruses including bat SARS-related coronaviruses and SARS-CoV and is not only specific for SARS-CoV-2 in spite of the fact that they are designed around well conserved regions (Corman et al., 2020) . This means that they are primarily suited for initial screening with the requirement of further confirmatory testing. This non-specificity can be attributed to the significant homology that's shared between the E envelope of SARS-CoV2 and other coronaviruses (Yip et al., 2020) . In contrast, our assay utilized primer-probe pairs for the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein which is less homologous to the glycoprotein of other coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV2 E gene shares 100% and 95% homology with Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and SARS-CoV E genes respectively. Homology between SARS-CoV2ORF3b, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV2 is 32%. Homology between SARS-CoV2 ORF8 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV2 is 94% and 40% respectively while that between SARS-CoV2, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV is 70%. This reduced similarity together with relatively longer primers and probes helps to overcome the weakness of the conventional RT-PCR tests with regard to detection of other sarbecoviruses.Mutations in the S, ORF3a, and ORF8 comprise approximately 10%, 6%, and 1.5% of all mutations (van Dorp et al., 2020) .From the foregoing, there are 3 conclusions. First, the S1 primers in our RPA assays were designed to span positions 1847 to 1877 (forward) and 1997 to 2029 (reverse) of the S gene.These are, to the best of our knowledge, outside the range of S gene mutations so far described.Regarding the concentration of the RNA used in the RPA assay, most of the samples had a concentration below 3 ng/ul. This demonstrates that the RPA assay is very powerful and can detect very small concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 virus and compares well with the minimum RNA concentration required for RT-PCR tests.Due to financial limitations, only 49 samples were tested, optimization of reaction temperatures and MgOAc concentrations was not done, ORF3a and ORF8a/b probes were not tested, and the absolute limit of detection of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs for RPA testing could not be determined.We have shown here that RPA can be applied successfully for the detection of SARS-CoV2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs. However, further optimization of the reaction temperature and MgOAc concentration is required. Other recommendations include determination of detection limit, testing of crude extracts in place of pure extracts, and multiplexing of S1 and ORF primers and probes in one reaction for double detection of virus as the second step of validation. Findings suggest that sputum is more sensitive than nasal swabs for SARS-Cov2 detection (Yang et al., 2020) . Since the RPA assay requires minimal RNA concentrations, it is suggested that crude sputum samples be trialed in place of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs since the latter also are invasive and uncomfortable and false negatives have been linked to incorrect collection of nasal swabs.Finally, further validation studies using a larger sample size needs to be conducted.","Rwanda","abstract","2020-09-18",9

On 7 January 2020, the Chinese authorities identified and announced a novel type of coronavirus as the cause of the disease [2] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [3] and a few days later announced the official name of the virus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [4] . COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the WHO.The first case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was confirmed on 27 February 2020. The case was a 44-year old Italian citizen who arrived Nigeria through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, on a flight via Milan, Italy [5] . This index case led to the activation of COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Operation Centers (PHEOC) at national and sub-national levels, with associated active case finding via contact tracing. By 9 March 2020, 217 contacts were linked to this index case [5] , out of which 136 (63.0%) were under follow-up, with one contact confirmed positive [6] . The 14-day follow-up for contacts of the index case ended on 12 March 2020. During this period, two additional unlinked cases were reported in Nigeria. In addition, 42 suspected cases were identified across seven states in Nigeria namely the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Edo, Kano, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers and Yobe [5] .Since the confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in Nigeria, cases and deaths have risen steadily in the country, although the government has implemented public health interventionse.g. advocacy for physical distancing, complete and partial lockdown, and ban on large public gatherings including at churches and mosquesto contain or mitigate spread. As of 6 June 2020, 35 (out of 36) states, plus the FCT, have reported at least one confirmed COVID-19 case. A descriptive analysis of the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities and outcomes of the first 32 COVID-19 patients admitted to Mainland Hospital in Lagos State, Nigeria, found that two-thirds of patients were male, and the mean age was 38.1 years [7] . This early analysis however is insufficient to provide a national overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) coordinates the public health response to COVID-19 in the country. Through NCDC's surveillance and laboratory network as well as coordination of state PHEOCs, epidemiological information on COVID-19 cases are captured into a real-time networked platform called Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS). This forms the basis for the release of daily situation reports for COVID-19 on NCDC COVID-19 microsite [8] . By 6 June, thousands of individual records with laboratory diagnosis contained on SORMAS offered opportunities to expand and explore country-specific epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from the onset of the outbreak. This study aims to provide the initial descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 in Nigeria, with emphasis on the disease magnitude and patterns in terms of person, place and time.We conducted a retrospective analysis of Nigeria surveillance data between 27 February and 6 June 2020. Nigeria is administratively divided into 36 states plus the FCT, which are zoned across six geopolitical areas: South-South; South-West; South-East; North-East; North-West and North-Central. During the study period, 36 states plus FCT had reported confirmed COVID-19 cases; all states were actively monitoring for cases through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system (IDSR) system [9] .SORMAS, an open-source real-time electronic health surveillance database, was the primary data source for this study. In 2017, NCDC adopted SORMAS as its primary digital surveillance platform for implementing the IDSR system [9] , and customised it for the surveillance of priority diseases of public health importance in Nigeria. As part of the country's preparedness activities, a COVID-19 module was developed and added to SORMAS in January 2020. All the surveillance data generated through SORMAS is owned by NCDC, processed and stored in a central server at the NCDC headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria.The study population was persons investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and captured on SORMAS during the study period. Samples were collected from suspect cases in line with the NCDC case definitions (which were in turn derived from WHO case definitions) in Table 1 [10] . However, these guidelines were not strictly adhered to as samples were also collected from some asymptomatic cases and contacts of cases. Trained healthcare personnel (and rapid response team members) investigated suspected COVID-19 cases, completed a detailed case investigation form (CIF) and collected a minimum of one nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and one oropharyngeal swab using synthetic fibre swabs with plastic shafts. Collected specimens were triplepackaged and aseptically transported in viral transport media, under appropriate temperature conditions (2-4°C) to a designated NCDC-certified laboratory in the country, usually based on proximity. Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 was done by Residential setting c Residential setting of each person tested for COVID-19 was based on the population size and administrative/ legal criteria for the reporting Local Government Areas (LGA) as recorded by field staff, in line with common classification of urban and rural classification in Nigeria [12] . For example, an LGA was classified as urban if 'any one' of the following criteria was met: (1) State capital; (2) an estimated population size of ⩾20 000; (3) >75% of its population is engaged in non-agricultural occupations; (4) availability of infrastructure, good transportation system and a broad array of economic, social and recreational activities.Health facility Health facility refers to the type of facility each person tested for COVID-19 visited prior to diagnosis or was identified for diagnosis. Because it was listed on SORMAS without specific categorisation into health facility type, we utilised the Nigeria Health Facility Registry (HFR) of the Federal Ministry of Health [13] to identify each health facility type so as to minimise misclassification errors. The HFR has details of all the registered health facilities in Nigeria including the State, LGA, facility level (primary, secondary and tertiary) and ownership type (private and public). Overall, each health facility was defined either as primary, secondary, or tertiary facility; health facilities that could not be identified in the registry were treated as unknown.Education completed Classified as a categorical variable in line with the Nigerian educational system: No formal education; nursery/ primary; secondary and tertiary/post-secondary. However, given the peculiar nature of the Almajiranci/ Quranic educational system in Nigeria, they were classified under a separate category termed 'alternative' education.Classified as a categorical variable as follows: Pupil/student; child; housewife; trader/business; health professional (e.g. nurse, clinician, laboratorian etc.); animal-related work (e.g. butcher and hunter); farmer; religious/traditional leaders; transporter and other.Travel history Classified as local, international and no travel in the last 14 days prior to diagnosis.Clinical signs and symptoms Defined relative to 14 days before sample collection and classified as binary: yes/no. Examples of clinical variables include fever (defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5°C or higher), cough, difficulty breathing, diarrhoea, headache among others.Quarantine location Defined as a binary variable: formal institution (e.g. health facility) and informal institution (e.g. home).Time from symptom onset to diagnosis Defined as the time difference between the dates of sample collection and self-reported symptom onset among symptomatic COVID-19 cases only.(Continued ) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in accordance with the WHO interim guidelines [11] . In addition to clinical samples, information on patients' sociodemographic characteristics, signs and symptoms in the 14 days prior to diagnosis, laboratory findings and clinical outcome as detailed in the national CIF was captured on SORMAS. Surveillance and laboratory data were submitted by trained data collectors (i.e. healthcare personnel) in real time to the NCDC through the SORMAS platform (configured on mobile devices (e.g. tablets and smartphones) and laptops) by each reporting State Epidemiologist and testing laboratory, respectively. All laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were managed according to the NCDC case management protocol [10] , while adherence to infection prevention and control measures for both health workers and patient was ensured. Testing for COVID-19 during this study period is free of charge in Nigeria.De-identified data were retrieved from SORMAS. COVID-19 classifications (suspect, probable and confirmed case) were entered by trained data collectors as per the NCDC case definitions [10] . Data management and definitions of key study variables are presented in Table 1 . The missing indicator approach was used to address missing data.The primary outcome variables for this study were cumulative incidence (CI) and case fatality (CF). CI was defined as the ratio of COVID-19 cases in a defined area to the estimated population of that area. Based on a national average growth rate of 3.2%, CI for each reporting state was calculated using the projected Nigerian population of 2020 from the 2006 national census and was multiplied by 100 000 for ease of interpretation. CF was defined as the proportion of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 who died during the study period, expressed as a percentage (%). Both CI and CF were calculated for Nigeria and for each state separately.Binary/categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages (%), normally distributed continuous variables by means and standard deviations (S.D.), and non-normally distributed continuous variables by medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Pearson χ 2 test was used to assess how the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between COVID-19 cases (confirmed cases vs. non-cases) and clinical outcome (alive vs. dead). A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried out in STATA version 13 (Stata Corp. LP, College Station, TX, United States of America). The report of this study was structured in accordance with the STROBE statement.The study protocol was approved by the Nigeria National Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC/01/01/2007-22/06/2020).Between 27 February and 6 June 2020, 60 839 records were entered in the COVID-19 SORMAS database in Nigeria, these were classified as follows: 18 790 suspected cases (30.9%), 73 probable cases (0.1%), 12 289 confirmed cases (20.2%), 28 637 non-cases (47.1%) and 1050 non-classified cases (1.7%). This study focuses on individuals with definitive diagnostic classification (40 926): confirmed cases (n = 12 289) and non-cases (n = 28 637). The daily incidence of cases is shown in the epicurve in Figure 1 . Males (65.8%) constituted a higher proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases than females (31.6%) (Fig. 2) . The mean (S.D.) age of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 37.1 (15.7) years, with the highest proportion of these cases recorded among persons aged 31-40 years (25.5%) and 21-30 years (21.0%) ( Table 2) . Despite the high proportion of confirmed cases with missing information on education (53.1%), 30.6% reported completing tertiary Time from sample collection to arrival in the laboratory Defined as the time difference between the dates of sample arrival in the laboratory and sample collection; it was treated as a continuous variable.Defined as the time difference between sample collection and the date diagnostic test was ready (including sample collection, transportation, collection and diagnosis at the laboratory); it was also treated as a continuous variable.a Initially, some of the returnees from abroad were tested for COVID-19 even in the absence of symptoms. b For confirmed asymptomatic cases, period of contact was measured as the 2 days before, through the 14 days after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation; for symptomatic cases, it was presumably 2 days before symptom onset through 14 days after. c For more information on the criteria for urban/rural classification in Nigeria, see [12] . d All negative values following the subtraction of date variables were dropped.education, followed by secondary school certificate holders at 8.6%. For confirmed cases with occupation information available, 9.3% were healthcare workers, while pupil/students and traders accounted for 6.7% each. The proportion of confirmed cases who reported history of travel 14 days prior to diagnosis was generally low, with local and international travels at 4.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Sixty-six per cent (8150/12 289) of confirmed COVID-19cases were asymptomatic in the 14 days prior to diagnosis. Among confirmed COVID-19 cases with symptoms (n = 4139; 33.7%), fever (56.4%) and cough (55.5%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. Other symptoms commonly reported among confirmed COVID-19 cases were runny nose (23.8%), sore throat (19.8%), difficulty in breathing (18.6%), headache (14.1%), diarrhoea (7.9%), nausea (7.5%), vomiting (5.5%) Table 3 ). Of these, cough (72.6%), fever (64.6%) and difficulty in breathing (51.4%) were the most commonly recorded signs and symptoms. Other common symptoms recorded at diagnosis were sore throat (16.5%), runny nose (15.1) and vomiting (12.3%). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and case fatality in Nigeria, 27 February-6 June 2020The overall CI of COVID-19 infection and CF in Nigeria during the study period was 5.6 per 100 000 population and 2.8%, respectively (Table 5 ). Lagos State (39.9 per 100 000), followed by the FCT (19.4 per 100 000), recorded the highest CI in Nigeria during this study period. Other States with CI higher than the national figure include Edo (8.6 per 100 000), Kano (6.8 per 100 000), Ogun (5.9 per 100 000) and Gombe (5.7 per 100 000). Regarding CF across the various Figure 3 . b Percentages in some instances may be greater than 100.0% due to rounding up. c Only for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases with records of clinical outcome: survivor (n = 1366), dead (n = 212), and total (n = 1578). d 692 total records were used for the assessment of temperature. †P-value <0.05; ‡ P-value <0.001; NS = P-value not statistically significant (i.e. >0.05). Φ: P-value from t-test was <0.0001; mean difference was 19.9 years.We have provided a description of the first national epidemiology of COVID-19 cases and associated clinical features and outcomes for Nigeria. There were 12 289 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 28 637 non-cases in 35 states plus the FCT in Nigeria between 27 February and 6 June 2020. During this period, there were 342 deaths, a CI of 5.6 per 100 000 and a CF of 2.8% overall.After South Africa, Nigeria is the second most-affected African country in terms of recorded confirmed COVID-19 cases and death as of 7 June 2020 [14] . However, the CI of COVID-19 in Nigeria during the study period, at 5.6 per 100 000 population, is substantially lower than in some non-African countries at a similar stage in their epidemic. For example, about three months after the first confirmed case in the United States, CI was 119⋅6 per 100 000 population, far more than that of Nigeria's; with Minnesota, the State with the lowest CI, having a CI of 20.6 per 100 000 population [15] . Additionally, many European countries reached a CI of at least 4.0 confirmed cases per 100 000 population over a period of less than 1 month [16] . A possible reason for lower CI in Nigeria could be due to a relatively low testing capacity in the country as compared to the US and European countries.There was substantial variability in COVID-19 incidence among the states in Nigeria. The heterogeneity in CIs within Nigeria could be attributable, in part, to international travels as indicated by the figures recorded by Lagos State (39.9 per 100 000) and the FCT (19.4 per 100 000) with the two major international airports in the country. Another possible explanation might be due to variations in the estimated population of states in Nigeria, with smaller population recording a higher CI and vice-versa. For example, Ekiti State (3 655 663 population) and Enugu State (4 926 955 population) each recorded 29 confirmed COVID-19 cases during this study period; but the latter recorded a lower CI (0.6 per 100 000 population) than the former (0.8 per 100 000). Moreover, all the Nigerian states did not have a similar testing capacity during the study period, and this might have contributed to the observed findings in terms of the numerator figures for calculating CIs. Similarly, the CF of 2.8% in this study is lower than several other countries which have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a wide range of CFs among non-African countries (from 0.1% in Singapore to 16 .2% in Belgium [17] ) and in African countries (from 0.0% in Uganda to 8.2% in Chad) during this study period [14] . Nigeria's observed CF of 2.8% is on the lower end of the range reported outside and within Africa, but higher than the 2.4% (3210 deaths/133 119 confirmed cases) recorded for the entire Africa as of 7 June 2020 [14] . The variation in CF in Nigeria could be an indication of varying health system capacity and preparedness across the country. An unpublished study indicates that Lagos Statewith the highest CI but a CF of 1.3%invested substantially in case management of COVID-19 patients as part of its preparedness activities. The overall CF in Nigeria could be partly due to its much younger population compared to the United States and most countries in Europe [18] ; similar trends in deaths by age from COVID-19 have been reported in China [19] . Just as cases are potentially underestimated due to inadequate testing, it is likely that deaths from COVID-19 are also underestimated, especially in places like Kano, which reported significant increases in deaths in April [20] .In contrast to deaths from COVID-19, a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases was recorded among economically active age groups, suggesting potential role of socio-economic or workrelated activities rather than immunological capacity. Children under 5 years of age and those aged 5-13 years, respectively, accounted for 1.7% and 3.9% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this study. These findings are comparable to those from a recent global systematic review [21] . Although it remains unclear why children are less affected by COVID-19 than older individuals, evidence suggests differences in immune system function [22] . The higher infection rate among males in this study corresponds to evidence reported in the WHO African region, where males in the 31-39 and 40-49 age groups accounted for 62% of 5178 recorded cases [14] . Outside Africa, early findings of the clinical characteristics of 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, reported males to have accounted for 30 (73.0%) of the cases [23] . A study in Italy also reported male preponderance [24] . A combination of genetic and physiological factors has been hypothesised as possible explanations for the potential male bias. For example, the wider distribution of SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), in male over females has been postulated [25] . In a patriarchal system such as seen in Nigeria, men are more likely to engage in economic activities outside of the household and potentially become more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women. While this may be more feasible during a controlled economy, such as that seen during the suspension of non-essential economic activities in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria, it may not be applicable when socio-economic activities are functional. This is because women are increasingly partaking in the workforce in Nigeria, such that the traditional trends of 'male breadwinner and female family support' are fast eroding [26] . The median length of stay of 111 patients with COVID-19 in hospital in this study was 19 days, which is within the range outside of China (4-21 days), but comparatively lower than that from China (4-53 days) [27] . In general, differences in the length of hospital stay may be attributable to variations in criteria for admission and discharge across different countries as well as timing within the pandemic [27] . Early diagnosis is fundamental for effective management of COVID-19 cases; thus, a median turnaround time of 2 (1-4) days for laboratory diagnosis as noted in the current study seems impressive, and possibly an indication of ongoing measures being championed by the NCDC to strengthen molecular diagnostic capacity in Nigeria. However, we lacked information on when laboratory test was received by a COVID-19 suspected case, as turnaround time only included the time from sample collection to availability of result.The symptomatic status of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this analysis is noteworthy, as over half of them were asymptomatic at testing. A scoping review of the literature found that between 5% and 80% of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic [28] , placing the 66% in the current study closer to the maximum range. It is possible that the case investigation approach adopted during testing might have underestimated symptoms: patients were initially asked whether they were symptomatic and probed about individual symptoms only if they answered in the affirmative. Stigma associated with COVID-19in Nigeria might contribute to people not reporting symptoms when they get tested [29] . Furthermore, it is possible for asymptomatic status at diagnosis to change in the course of an illness, in which case such persons could be better classified as presymptomatic cases, so the proportion of truly asymptomatic cases cannot be described by these data. Nevertheless, this scenario could pose a challenge to community surveillance activities and implementation of public health interventions (e.g. quarantine and isolation). Thus, the possibility of COVID-19 transmission by asymptomatic cases in Nigeria needs to be explored and addressed, both in terms of research and community risk communication activities.The most common signs and symptoms among symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases in the 14 days prior to diagnosis were fever (56.4%) and cough (55.5%). This trend is similar to that recorded in a recent systematic review of the literature for China [30] ; however, while fatigue was the third most frequently recorded symptom in China, its frequency was low in our study at 5.2%. Similarly, cough, fever and difficulty in breathing, in that order, were the most commonly recorded symptoms at diagnosis among persons who died from COVID-19 infection. The common occurrence of difficulty in breathing in deceased patients has been identified as a major driver of adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients [31] . Although relatively small in proportion due to late recording during the study period, loss of smell and loss of taste among confirmed COVID-19 cases in this study are consistent with available evidence [32] . However, being a descriptive study, these data do not have the capacity to establish a causal association between observed clinical symptoms and COVID-19 infection or death. Thus, a follow-up study aimed at exploring these associations is recommended. It is also worth noting that the fever which is one of the common symptoms noted in this study is often common in endemic febrile illnesses in Nigeria including malaria, Lassa fever and yellow fever. As such, in the case of a co-infection, misclassification of illnesses is likely if symptoms alone are used for COVID-19 case definitions [33] . The symptomatic and geographic convergence of COVID-19 and common febrile diseases in Nigeria therefore requires continuous strengthening of definitive diagnostic approaches in the country. About 9% of COVID-19 infections occurred in healthcare workers during this study period. COVID-19 infection among health workers is of prominent public health importance as it could potentially enhance disease transmission [34] and further weaken a health system that already struggles with insufficient human resources for health.This study has provided the first national epidemiological evidence on COVID-19 in Nigeria, necessary for public health planning and health system strengthening. However, this study is limited by the substantial proportion of missing data within some of the sociodemographic (e.g. residential setting and health facility) and clinical (e.g. malaise, pharyngeal exudate, rapid breathing, loss of smell and taste) variables studied. The late addition of loss of smell and taste to the CIF in Nigeria may partly explain why data recorders were not accustomed to capturing them. The high proportion of missing data on some key indicators has prompted a systemic effort to improve the quality of SORMAS data, and a dedicated Data Quality Improvement Project (DQIP) was initiated in April to improve completeness of key variables to above 90%.In conclusion, this study has provided an early insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Evidence from this study, such as the high proportion of cases among the active age group and high proportion of asymptomatic cases at diagnosis, will be useful for policymakers and stakeholders in the health and other sectors in contextualising public health planning and response as well as for scientific activities in the country. Such measures could include intensifying NPIs at work and commercial places where this age group is mostly found, and adapting case finding protocols to include routine testing of asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-11",9

As of 20 th September 2020, over 30 million cases and close to 1 million deaths have been recorded globally, with Brazil, India and the United States of America accounting for about 50% of the cases. 1 For the same period, 1.2 million cases and over 30, 000 deaths were reported from Africa, with the highest numbers from South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia and Nigeria. 2Since the Semann et al (2020) study, the WHO has produced guidelines for managing COVID-19 and for maintaining essential health services and these have been adopted by many countries in sub-Saharan Africa or similar ones produced to strengthen the responsiveness of their health system. 3 The guidelines contains key recommendations to optimise health force capacity, including recruitment, repurposing within the limits of training and skills, redistributing roles among health workers while keeping health workers safe and providing mental and psychosocial support. It is unclear to what extent these guidelines have been implemented in health facilities and how this has affected health provider perception of their facility readiness to manage COVID-19. Other studies assessing preparedness to manage COVID-19 assessed health workers knowledge, attitude and practice, but did not explore the complex interaction between fear, anxiety, stress, support systems and health facility preparedness. 11-13The objective of this study was to assess the preparedness of the health system in Lagos State, Nigeria for the COVID-19 outbreak based on the perception of RMNH providers, and to determine what factors (work-related stress, training, support and coping strategies/support mechanisms, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and guidelines, attendance for RMNH services) significantly predict this. It is expected that this study will generate context-specific data to improve the responsiveness of the health system for RMNH services and to minimise predicted adverse impact of the pandemic.Lagos State is the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, located in the South-western region with an estimated population of over 20 million mostly urban residents and an annual growth rate of 3.2%. 14 The total fertility rate in the state is between 3.4 and 4.2 (national average 5.3), 86.4% of women used a skilled health provider for antenatal care ANC (national average 67%) and between 61 and 77% of women have health facility birth (national average 39%). 8 Health is provided via health facilities owned by the Federal Government (Teaching hospitals and Federal Medical Centres), state government (state specialist, teaching and general hospitals), local government (primary health care facilities) and private/faith-based health care facilities. There are 306 primary healthcare centres, 27 registered general hospitals, 4, 421 private hospitals/specialist clinics/labs/diagnostic centres, and 5 tertiary health facilities. Most of these facilities provide RMNH services. 15A pretested self-administered online questionnaire with six sections and 33 questions was used. Section 1 of the survey tool used contained study information and consent, and a question to confirm the provision of care in RMNH since March 2020. Section 2 collected demographic data such as gender, age group, professional cadre, type of facility and information on a management role if any. Section 3 collected information on the impact of COVID-19 on the availability and provision of RMNH services since March 2020, and reasons for these. Two of the sections had sub-scales for workrelated stress and work-related burnout. Section 4 had six COVID-19 work-related stress questions, with four questions on a sub-scale with options 1 (not at all) to 5 (always/to a very high degree). Section 5 had seven COVID 19 work-related burnout questions, on a sub-scale with options 1 (never/almost never/to very low degree) to 5 (always/to a very high degree). The burnout questions were from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), a validated questionnaire with three sub-dimensions: Personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout. The three separate parts of the CBI questionnaire were designed to be applied in different domains. 16 Section 6 had eight questions on support and stress coping systems/mechanisms and overall perception of health facility readiness with options from 0 (unprepared to manage COVID-19 cases) to 5 (extremely well prepared to manage COVID-19 cases). In all, the data collection tool used in this study had 24 independent variables (17 categorical and 7 ordinal).As part of the questionnaire development process, we analysed the reliability and internal consistency of both scales in the questionnaire using Cronbach alpha coefficient and the interitem correlation. Both scales have less than 10 questions, so a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.5 and inter-item correlation of 0.2-0.4 was acceptable. Any item in each subscale that adversely affected the Cronbach alpha coefficient was not included in the ordinal regression analysis.Four of the included independent variables were recoded so that the reference category or ordinal scale was appropriate: Availability of training on stress coping mechanism (unsure=0, No=1, Yes=2), concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines (extremely concerned=1, Unconcerned=5), worry about community discrimination/ stigma (extremely worried=1, Not worried=5), RMNH services unavailable at any time since March 2020 (Unsure=0, No=1, Yes=2).We performed a descriptive analysis of independent variables: gender, age, professional cadre, facility type and management role and summarised outputs by frequency table, and cross-tabulation (facility type by the availability of RMNH services since March 2020, work colleague tested positive to COVID-19, off work due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19, work colleague COVID-19 related death, had COVID-19 training, availability of COVID-19 guidelines, availability of protocols for staff exposed to COVID-19 case and awareness of COVID-19 priority testing in a health facility). We used charts to describe the reasons for unavailability of, and reduced attendance for RMNH services between March and July 2020, as well as the frequency of coping/support mechanisms at health facilities. We also described the concern of health care workers about being infected at work, infecting family and friends, community stigmatisation/discrimination, availability of PPE and feeling of burnout.We performed an ordinal regression analysis with health care worker perception of COVID-19 health facility preparedness (1-not prepared to 5-extremely well prepared) as the outcome or dependent variable and independent or predictor variables. We used the SPSS PLUM logistic regression and general linear models (GLM) programs for the We assessed multicollinearity by calculating variance inflation factors (VIF). VIF values greater than 5 are of concern and 10 will suggest the presence of multicollinearity. 17 We only included variables with VIF below 5 in the final logistic regression analysis.We provided study information and frequently asked questions to all participants. Participants were required to consent to the study before completing the survey, they were free to withdraw their consent at any time. All incomplete surveys were excluded from the analysis. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Three hundred and sixty-three health workers in Lagos state responded to the invitation to participate in the study, but 70.5% (256) were eligible to participate because they provided RMNH services since March 2020. All eligible participants consented to and completed the survey.Reliability of sub-scales in the questionnaire Both sub-scales in the questionnaire were found to be reliable and internally consistent. The stress scale had 4 items, the Cronbach's alpha was 0.743, the inter-item correlation 0.425, and the corrected item-total correlation for each item was above 0.4. The work-burnout scale had 7 items, we reverse coded one negative item on the scale (B04: energy for family and friends), the Cronbach's alpha was 0.869, the inter-item correlation 0.470, and the corrected item-total correlation for each item was above 0.038.The perceived contributions to reduced attendance for RMNH care where these services were available were similar to the reasons for non-availability of these services reported above. The two most common predominant contributions to reduced availability of RMNH services were community fear of infection from health facilities (47.6% or 49) and movement restrictions (47.6% or 49). Reduced availability of drugs and supplies and diversion of resources to treat COVID-19 patients were not considered by the HCPs to have affected the availability of RMNH services (Figure 2 ). About 88% (226) of RMNH care providers did not feel their health facility was sufficiently prepared. Eighty-seven per cent (117) and 91.7% (55) of all respondents from state secondary health facilities and federal government tertiary health facilities respectively reported that their facilities were not sufficiently prepared to manage COVID-19 cases. (Table 2) Concern about being infected at work, infecting family and friends, community stigmatisation/discrimination, availability of PPE and feeling of burnout Forty per cent (104) of respondents were moderately or extremely worried about community stigmatisation or discrimination as a result of their potential exposure to COVID-19 cases in their facilities and 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, since the COVID-19 outbreak. Sixty-six per cent (158), 70.4% (180) and 84% (205) of respondents were moderately or extremely concerned about being infected at work, exposing family members and friends to COVID-19, and availability of PPE and related guidelines at work respectively. Support systems to cope with providing care during the pandemic Most of the respondents (74.2% or 190) had received training on how to respond to COVID-19 and 83.2% (213) had guidelines for providing RMNH services during the pandemic 67.6% (173) but only 49.6% (127) were aware of any priority COVID-19 testing for health workers (Table 2) .Of the 24 independent variables, thirteen independent variables (3 ordinal and 10 nominal) included in the regression analysis have VIFs less than 5, we conclude that there is no high correlation between the independent variables included in the ordinal regression analysis. The null hypothesis states that the location parameters or slope coefficients are the same across response categories, therefore lines of the same slope are parallel. The -2 loglikelihood of the null hypothesis is 576.102, for the general model 530.554, X 2 45.548, DF=72, p=0.994. Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis and the proportional odds assumption of our model holds.Of the two hundred and fifty-six RMNH service providers respondents, most worked in public-owned health facilities (91%), were female (72%), nurse/midwives (35%), non-specialist medical doctors (40%) and had both management and clinical roles (64%). About 35% of respondents reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some point betweenMarch 2020 and July 2020, mostly in the tertiary public hospitals. Less than a third of RMNH workers were off work due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and this was a lot more in secondary and tertiary public-owned hospitals, compared to primary health care and faith-based/private owned health facilities. Most of the respondents who work in secondary and tertiary hospitals reported that a colleague had tested positive for COVID-19 compared to those who work in primary care or faith-based/NGO hospitals. Almost three-quarters of respondents reported that COVID-19Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of facility preparedness after controlling for the independent variables, explaining up to 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and the level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively) .We set out to investigate the determinants of perceived health facility preparedness, using ordinal regression analysis controlling for known risk factors for work-related stress, burnout, personal preparedness (COVID-19 training) andinstitutional preparedness (availability of relevant guidelines, PPE, staff support systems).About 88% (226) of RMNH health workers did not feel their health facility was sufficiently prepared, the availability of PPE and related guidelines and satisfactory communication from HF management were significant determinants of this.Similar results were reported from one study earlier in the pandemic. In a cross-sectional study conducted in Jordan conducted in March 2020 that included only frontline medical doctors treating COVID-19 cases, doctors having institutional protocols for dealing with COVID 19 cases and those with sustained availability of PPE reported higher scores of self preparedness to manage COVID-19 cases. 20 Following the publication of WHO guidelines to support the maintenance of essential health services in the context of COVID-19, we expected different results 4 months into the pandemic.Our results may suggest that the WHO guidelines for maintaining essential health services have not been fully implemented or is not having an impact on the perceived preparedness of the HFs to manage COVID-19 cases and maintain essential health services. The link between, concern for PPE availability and communication from HF management regarding COVID-19 guidelines was evident from the ordinal regression analysis, and underscores the importance of caring for the carers, during a large disease outbreak. Generally, the knowledge of Nigeria health workers on COVID-19 has increased over time, but they need to be continually briefed and informed, covering not only up to date clinical management but also covering recognition, management and support strategies for work-related stress and burnout. 24 The consequences of not taking action are huge, with health worker stress, burnout, and psychological problems associated with COVID-19, being some reported in our study. This is a wake-up call for health system planners. While the room to implement such individual-led coping mechanisms must be provided, including praying/meditation rooms, the role of institutional support for frontline health workers should not be minimised. Institutional-led interventions such as psychological first aid to all health workers, adequate workforce planning, regular debriefing, stress and burnout surveillance, access to psychologists and counsellors, clear and consistent communication have been recommended to minimise the risk of stress and burnout during such outbreaks. 21, 26, 27 Some of these interventions were reported as available by over half of the respondents, there may be room for improvement to proactively plan and consistently implement them in all health facilities during such outbreaks.There are key strengths of note in our study, this was the first to go beyond just reporting levels of preparedness to understanding the determinants of health worker perception of HF preparedness and mechanisms that they use to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the earlier studies on preparedness to manage COVID-19 we explored the interaction between determinants of preparedness that included known risk factors of health worker stress and factors that can improve preparedness using ordinal regression analysis. Our study was conducted in a COVID-19 safe way (online survey), most respondents were in management and clinical roles and were front line health workers, thus increasing the validity of the results.However, our study is not without limitations, Our sample was relatively small (256) for the size of the health workforce but was more than the minimum sample size of 240 required for ordinal regression analysis based on the recommendation of Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013) of a minimum sample for ordinal regression analysis of 10 observations per independent variable. 30 Also faith-based/private owned health facilities were under-represented (less than 10% all response) but over 85% of health facilities in Lagos are privately owned. 15 Other studies have reported a preference for privately owned health facilities for childbirth by about 50% of women irrespective of social class. 31,32 Therefore, our study may not be representative of the preparedness of private health facilities from the perspective of health workers and a similar study with a large sample of private and faith-based facilities is needed to understand this.HFs to provide quality care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Similar studies are needed to evaluate the perception of preparedness in private health facilities, including the perspective of women and their carers, this is important to improve overall health system preparedness during an outbreak and for quality improvement. Full implementation of the WHO operational guidance for maintaining essential health services for the COVID-19 context should be prioritised, including monitoring of recommendations for optimising the health workforce for a satisfactory level of health facility preparedness during this pandemic.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-25",9

Nevertheless, strengthening the role of autopsy in clinical practice may help clinicians to more quickly address clinical questions associated with highly infectious outbreaks.Keywords: COVID-19, Autopsy, Sub-Saharan Africa, Forensic, PandemicSignificant outbreaks like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continue to reveal the capacity gap in autopsy practice, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Autopsy studies have proven to be a crucial tool in identifying and explaining diseases that were missed antemortem, during clinical care (1) . Autopsy studies are still widely regarded as a gold standard in the determination of the cause of death (2, 3) . This pathology speciality has contributed to providing answers to past infectious outbreaks such as the viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by hantavirus and Ebola virus in Central and East Africa in the late 1990s (4, 5) . However, despite its significant role, health systems in SSA still assign a lower priority to autopsy and forensic practice. Systematic examination of a dead body during autopsy is generally performed for two purposes:1. To gain an understanding of the nature of disease processes that amount to the cause of death (clinical autopsy).2. To serve as a forensic investigation tool aimed at serving evidence to courts of law in settling legal cases (medico-legal autopsy) (6) .While autopsy practice is slowly growing in the SSA, most of the few reported cases are medico-legal. Clinical autopsy in most hospitals in SSA is still not a routine practice (7) . to be recognized as a feedback mechanism tool for clinical practitioners, and to serve as a system of checks and balances in day-to-day clinical practice. Overall, enhancing clinical autopsy practice has potential to provide positive feedback in the form of increased medical knowledge that will help clinicians improve patient management and reduce mortality during highly infectious outbreaks.The author has no financial or personal interests to report.

Most of the entire world has remained in lock-down following the pandemic onset in Wuhan, China, and subsequent global spread in early 2020 [2] . Despite its devastating effect on healthcare system with over 400,000 deaths reported so far, there is yet no definite cure or vaccine [3] . Infection with the novel virus which usually presents with fever, cough and difficulty breathing, is therefore mostly managed symptomatically, with prevention as key thrust for control of its spread [1, 3] . Unfortunately, many healthcare systems are already getting overwhelmed, with increasing paucity of isolation centres, treatment facilities and trained personnel [4] . Unlike other regions and continents of the world, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has had much fewer cases, as well as reported much less mortality from the pandemic [3] . However, while there appears to be a plateauing or slowing of the trend in much of the Western world, many countries in SSA are experiencing resurgence and rapid rise in new cases [1, 3] . This trend may be worse, especially with poor planning of ease of lock down and resumption of social and other activities in densely populated countries, including Nigeria [5] . Increased risk of disease spread may have higher impact on at-risk groups including healthcare workers, who are at the frontline in control of the pandemic [5] [6] [7] . Their practice of preventive measures is therefore key to prevention of loss of skilled personnel, who are essential to sustenance of prevention effort [7] .In many developing countries, rural settlements constitute larger proportion of the population compared with urban cities [8] . Due to lack of skilled health personnel in most rural health facilities, community health workers are often left as the frontline personnel with the most direct and frequent contact with grassroots community members [9] . They are key to dissemination of information required for adoption of appropriate preventive behaviour by the vast majority of the population. Many developing country health care systems may therefore have to depend on CHOs for control of disease spread [9] . However, considering the novel nature of COVID-19 and the curriculum of training of CHOs, their capacity as front liners in the practice of preventive measures, as well as dissemination of health information may be in doubt [10] . This study was therefore aimed at assessing level of knowledge and practice of COVID-19 preventive measures among CHOs comprising community health extension workers (CHEWs) and community health officers (CHOs) in rural settlements in Cross River State, southern Nigeria.Study design and population: this study was conducted using cross-sectional descriptive design. Study area was Yala Local Government Area (LGA) in northern senatorial district of Cross River State, southern Nigeria. The LGA comprised fourteen (14) wards and eighty one (81) health facilities. Study population was community health workers comprising community health extension workers (CHEW) and community health officers (CHO). This globally recognized group of healthcare professional, were established and technically designed to reach out to, and provide basic preventive health services to community members at grassroots level [11] .Sampling and instrument: total enumeration was carried out, with recruitment of all CHWs from these facilities in all but one of these wards, which was excluded due to on-going communal clashes during the study period. Self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain quantitative data on knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention.The structured questionnaire comprised three sections. Section 1 assessed sociodemographic and occupational characteristics of respondents. Section 2 comprised 15-items which assessed knowledge of COVID-19 epidemiology, virology, preventive measures and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Section 3 assessed practice of preventive measures, including use of face mask, gloves, and hand hygiene. Responses given as 'Always' and 'Almost always' were considered regular practice, while 'Sometimes', 'Rarely' and 'Never', were considered not regular practice of preventive measures. Pretesting of the questionnaire was conducted among CHWs in similar socio-demographic setting, with Crombach's alpha of 0.83 before use for data collection.Data analysis: data entry and analysis were done using SPSS version 21.0. Each correct response to knowledge question contributed one unit to the total score which was converted to percentage. A score of 50% or greater was considered satisfactory for this cadre of health professionals. Practice of each of the preventive measures was graded as regular for those with always and almost always, and non-regular for those with sometimes, occasional or rarely. Independent t-test was used as inferential statistics to assess factors associated with regular practice of these measures. P-value was set at 0.05.Ethical considerations: ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of Cross River State Ministry of Health, Calabar. Written consent was obtained from respondents before data collection.Sociodemographic characteristics: complete data was obtained from eighty-six respondents with response rate of 100% and female: male ratio of 1: 0.62. Mean age was 36.3±8.9 years (18-54 years). Most subjects were within 21-40 years old, CHEW, and had worked for 10 years or less, comprising 68.6% (n=59), 82.6% (n=71), and 59.3% (n=51), respectively ( Table 1) . Table 2 shows frequency distribution of correct responses to each of the questions in each of the sections of knowledge of COVID-19. Overall, questions with relatively higher frequency of correct responses were main mode of transmission and method of COVID-19 prevention in hospital setting, comprising 67.4% (n=58) and 61.6% (n=53), respectively. Questions with lower frequency of correct response were correct sequence of putting on, and removing personal protective equipment (PPE), comprising 5.8% (n=5) and 8.1% (n=7), respectively. Mean total knowledge score was 28.14±12.8% ranging from 6.7% to 53.3%. Most respondents comprising 80.2% (n=69), had scores within 10% to 39% (Table 3) . Mean scores for knowledge of basic virology and epidemiology, knowledge of COVID-19 prevention, and knowledge of use of PPE were 38.8±18.5%, 25.8±18.6% and 19.8±9.9, respectively. Less than one-tenth of respondents comprising 9.3% (n=8), had total knowledge score of at least 50%. Most subjects comprising 66.2% (n=57), 61.6% (n=53) and 74.4% (n=64), had scores within 40-60% for knowledge of basic virology and epidemiology, 20% or less for both knowledge of COVID-19 prevention, and use of PPE, respectively.Practice of preventive measures: regular practice (comprising always and most times) of use of face mask, goggles, gloves, and hand hygiene was found to be 50% (n=43), 12.8% (n=11), 30.2% (n=26), and 56.4% (n=48), respectively (Table 4 ). Approximately two-thirds of respondents comprising 67.4% (n=58), had rarely or never used goggles or face shield when in contact with suspected cases of COVID-19 infection. Table 5 shows factors associated with practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. Age and duration of practice were not found to be associated with practice of each of the preventive measures. For each of the preventive measures, mean scores for total as well as each of the sections of knowledge, were found to be higher among respondents with regular compared with non-regular practice, though this differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05).This study was aimed at assessing level of knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention among community health workers in a sub-Saharan African setting. This is perhaps one of few studies conducted among health workers that have frequent contact with community members in rural developing country settings [12, 13] . There was significantly higher proportion of female compared with male CHWs. Perhaps there may be more interest and enrolment into the training program by females compared with males. Yet, this difference in proportion is key, considering need for more male healthcare workers providing services in potentially rough terrain of most developing country rural settings. Features of rough terrain may include difficult access to residents in hard-to-reach settings, increasing insecurity amidst wave of kidnapping and rape, poor rural road networks [14, 15] . Disproportionate gender distribution of CHWs in favor of female, may therefore be impairing their capacity for wider reach of rural residents.Mean age of respondents was 36.3 years and over two-thirds were within 40 years of age. This suggest relatively younger population rural healthcare workers compared with medical doctors and nurses, who usually require longer years of skilled training. Young population of CHWs may be beneficial in being in the frontline of COVID-19 prevention, considering older age being associated with higher risk of chronic diseases and mortality from the infection [16] . In other words, the relatively young age population of CHWs is favorably suitable for COVID-19 prevention. Younger age also affords the opportunity for longer duration of provision of skilled services before retirement. This potential benefit is also observable in finding most respondents (59.3%) having had 10 or less years duration of practice experience. Yet, this benefit of young age will be fully harnessed, only if their capacities are sufficiently built to provide more effective services [10] .Mean knowledge score of 28.14% ranging from 6.7% to 53.3%, and less than one-tenth having at least 50%, suggest unacceptably low level of knowledge of COVID-19 among CHWs in the study setting. Adequate knowledge is essential for provision of effective health education, including correction of existing myths and misconceptions about COVID-19 pandemic [17] . Unbelief in its existence, as well conspiracy-driven ignorance about the means of disease spread and prevention, requires urgent correction via evidence-based behaviour change communication (BCC) of known facts about COVID-19 [18, 19 ]. Unfortunately, this low level of knowledge suggests poor capacity for delivery of correct information to rural residents in developing country settings. This is key, considering that providers of BCC must be trustworthy in quality of information provided, in other to enable compliance with effort at ensuring practice of preventive measures [20] . Low level of knowledge may be attributable to novel nature of the virus, as well as potentially much focus on capacity building of other healthcare workers, with relative neglect of CHWs in developing countries [10] . This finding may also suggest lack of effective framework for continuing education among this essential group of grassroots-oriented healthcare professionals.Regular practice was found to be poor for each of the preventive measures assessed. Poor practice may be attributable to lack of facilities and resources for practice of these measures. This position is supported by finding use of face mask and hand washing as more commonly practiced preventive measure. These resources are perhaps more readily available and cost-effective, compared with goggles, face shield and gloves. Nevertheless, generally poor practice of these preventive measures by CHWs, increases their risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 infection. Unfortunately, infected CHWs may remain asymptomatic and unaware of their status [21] , especially considering abysmally low level of testing in the study area [22] . These HCWs may therefore constitute a nidus for infection and disease spread in rural settings. Coverage of potential area for disease spread may be much wider, considering that Cross River State represents much portion of the easternmost border of Nigeria, with significant land border with neighboring Cameroon in East Africa. Therefore disease acquisition from and spread to East Africa via apparently porous borders, may occur via poor practice of preventive measures by CHWs in Cross River State. Current state of humanitarian crises with massive influx of refugees into the state due to political unrest in neighboring Cameroon, may be contributing significantly to the challenge of providing effective disease control [23] .Another key finding in this study was higher level of knowledge of use of PPE scores, among subjects with regular compared with non-regular practice of hand washing. Though this relationship was not statistically significant, it may have some degree of clinical significance (p=0.07). Also, considering that this relationship was found only for hand washing, it may suggest effect of potentially easier availability of facilities and opportunities for hand hygiene (soap and water), compared with other preventive measures in resource-constrained settings. Yet, proper and consistent hand washing is necessary but not sufficient measure for containment of spread of COVID-19 infection [24] . Therefore, respondents in the study were still at high risk of contracting and spreading the infection to their contacts.Community health workers have poor level of knowledge and practice of measures aimed at controlling spread of COVID-19 infection. Their capacity building through training workshops and effective continuing education program are urgently needed. Curriculum for training of CHWs may also need to be reviewed or upgraded, to lay much emphasis on infectious disease prevention and control especially at grassroots level. Further research in other settings using larger sample size is also recommended.• Due to shortage of health personnel, community health workers are key to health education, especially at grassroots level in rural developing country settings; • Community health workers also provide basic healthcare services, especially to residents in hard-to-reach rural settings.River State was poor; • There is poor practice of COVID-19 prevention among community health workers in rural Cross River State; • There is urgent need for capacity building of community health workers towards essential health service provision especially during this critical period of the pandemic.There authors declare no competing interests.OO: conceptualized the work, drafted the proposal and wrote the initial manuscript.

At the early period of this millennium, the outbreak of SARS was reported in China, followed by the resurgence of Ebola in the mid-millennium in Guinea, after its earlier occurrence in 1976 in South Sudan and DR Congo. Unexpectedly, the year 2020 was ushered in with a historical novel virus (COVID-19) pandemic [1] , in a manner that the world has never witnessed before. The human-to-human transmission rates of the virus are not only alarming and worrisome but also, the respiratory dysfunction and unwavering deaths it caused have risen global concerns. Hence, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 , by WHO [2, 3] after having initially recognized it as a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)"" on January 30, 2020. While several measures have been executed to either halt the ravaging impacts of the novel virus or minimize them significantly, the option of lockdown seems to be mostly adopted globally. With Nigeria facing the most challenging stage of COVID-19 virus, the government adopted the lockdown as a measure to address the situation. However, the economic consequence of this decision forced the government to make an unconditional turnaround in easing the lockdown despite calls from practitioners and health organizations on the frontline to review the decision painstakingly considering the danger to the lives of the populace. More so, there are mixed feelings that the decision to ease the lockdown gradually may further aggravate the current situations of COVID-19 in the country while others perceive the opposite. To enhance adequate decision on whether to revise the phased lifting of lockdown or not, there is need for empirical justification in the light of the country. Consequently, this study seeks to fill this lacuna by assessing the impacts of the gradual easing of lockdown in Nigeria on the daily cases of COVID-19 and the ensuing effects on the healthcare system. It aims to answer the question of whether the country was ready for the easing up of the lockdown or not before embarking on it in the light of the global practice and standards. We employ the daily situation data on reported cases of COVID-19 to explicate the implications of the lockdown lifting in Nigeria using both qualitative and descriptive statistics. The study is particularly motivated by the urgency of need to inform policymakers and the government on the pending danger of an unplanned phased lifting of lockdown, which contravenes medical standards at the local and international fora.According to daily situation reports, six months after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China, the novel virus has infected over 12,000,000 people in 216 countries, linked to the death of almost 570,288, while about 7, 814,689 recovered from the infection [4, 1] . The inability of medical personnel, and international health organizations on the frontline to provide globally acceptable vaccine or drugs for curtailing the ravaging impacts of the novel virus prompted the inevitable option of lockdowns globally. The declaration of lockdown in over 100 countries since April 2020 becomes an inevitable and tough decision to make despite the associated fears of unwanted macroeconomic shocks that could be triggered by the lockdown.The prime aim of lockdown is to flatten the COVID-19 curve through a persistent reduction in the confirmed cases, and ensuring that infected persons quickly recovered from the virus.During lockdowns, people are expected to stay at home. Also, location of contacts such as schools, universities, hotels, clubs, and religious houses are closed, social gatherings involving above 20 people are prohibited and economic activities involving physical interaction are halted [1, 5] . The impacts of the novel virus are nothing but highly overwhelming in Nigeria since the index case was confirmed on 27 February 2020.Following the global practice, a nationwide lockdown was thus announced in Nigeria on 30March 2020 with immediate effects in three states of the Federation namely: Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja. This was further extended for two weeks with the inclusion of Kano on 27 April 2020. The lockdown in the country saw a dragging record of new cases, which are mostly attributed to interstate movements in the form of community transmission. However, the unbearable economic consequences of the lockdown in the country prompted the government to announce a phased and gradual easing of the lockdown in FCT, Lagos, and Ogun with effective on 5 May 2020. Since then, the reported cases of COVID-19 have returned to its usual exponential rates in the country. For instance, the daily cases reported for the first day of the easing out on Monday, May 4, 2020, stood at 245, which are the highest since the index case in the country [6] .Although, the decision on easing of lockdown is not out of place as many countries have adopted the practice, the move is taken after full consideration of the guidelines stipulated by WHO for every country seeking partial or full reopening of the economy. These guidelines are elicited in the next section.According to the media briefing on COVID-19 of WHO on 19 April 2020, all nations seeking to reopen the economy either partially or fully must follow six steps. These steps are presented in Figure 1 below. First, there should be a total assurance that the transmission is well under control which involves both individual and community transmission channels.Second, there is a crucial need to ensure the health system is at its full capacities to detect, test, isolate, and treat every reported case and trace the associated contacts. Third, the major health facilities centers, and nursing homes should be capable of minimizing the pandemic.Fourth, conscious plans and implementations should be in place to prevent infection transmission in workplaces, schools, houses of worship, and other essential places. Fifth, adequate plans should be in place to ensure the risks of COVID-19 importation are well monitored. Sixth, aggressive education, engagement, and empowerment in the light of the ""new norm"" should be taken as a priority [7] .The above steps are not fully in place in Nigeria despite the call for easing of the lockdown.The economic implications of the novel virus mostly drive the decision to embark on phasing out the lockdown. The phases of the lockdown are exposited in section three below.Phase One: As of July 15, 2020, Nigeria has completed two phases of its gradual easing of the COVID-19 lockdown and edging towards completing the third phase. The first phase of i. Modification of the nationwide curfew from the initial 8 pm -6 am to 10 pm -4 am daily. The curfew however does not apply to journalists and healthcare workers.ii. Banks are now to resume their normal operations.iii. Work to resume in government offices on Mondays through Fridays from 9 am to 2 pm.iv.Interstate movement remains restricted. However, essential services, agricultural produce, manufactured goods, and petroleum products are exempted.v. The ban on airports to remain for both domestic and international travel with the exemption for emergency flights. There is intending consideration for reopening airports for domestic flights by June 21, 2020, provided all modalities be met.vi. Kano State to begin phase one of eased lockdown.vii. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory in public settings.viii. Hand washing/sanitizing practices are required for individuals and organizations.ix. There is a ban on gatherings of above 20 people outside of the workplace.x. Religious places to resume worshipping under the guidance of the PTF and State governments.Phase Three: The phase three of the easing of lockdown in Nigeria was announced on 30June 2020 following the approval of the 5th interim report of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 by the Nigerian President. This phase is expected to last for four weeks from Tuesday, June 30 to Monday 27 July 2020. Few modifications were made on phase two which include the reopening of airports for local flights ""based on close monitoring"", resumption of schools for returning students in secondary schools with the graduating set to resume first, and the lifting of the ban on interstate travels. More so, the hours for the nationwide curfew were maintained from 10 pm to 4 am while the use of facemasks in public places also remains mandatory and now punishable by law [9] . reported, which are the highest since the first incidence of the novel virus in the country.Since then, the cases have continued to increase sporadically with over 600 cases being repeatedly recorded. Figure 6 The analysis of the ongoing situation in the Nigerian health system amidst the reported cases of COVID-19 indicates that the six criteria enlisted by WHO for countries to consider before lifting the lockdown have not been duly adhered to. In particular, there are still challenges revolving around issues like transmission control, diagnostic testing, contact-tracing, curtailing outbreak risks, and educating the populace. It, therefore, becomes imperative that, until these issues are addressed, the easing of lockdown will continue to compound the dailyconfirmed cases and possibly the death cases. Consequently, we call on the government to swing into action in respect of the following. of great concern, which calls for urgent intervention of the federal government [10] .2) Increase test capacity: One of the challenges embattling the healthcare system in combating COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is the low level of test capacity despite the weeklong of lockdown. Following WHO guidelines, the need for quick response in ensuring testing capacity is sacrosanct before considering easing lockdown. The situation in Nigeria is a paradox of the reality because, as of July 15, 2020, the aggregate number of tests conducted still stands at 199,016 [11] . This figure is far below that of South Africa, which has conducted 2,278,127 tests, Morocco, 924,695;and Ghana, 336,093 [4] . This is a great setback for a country with the most population density.3) Intensive orientation and education: the emergence and increasing trend of the COVID-19 outbreak imply its elimination will take a long time, and the panic about reappearances cannot be doubted [12] . The implication of the escalating cases despite the initial lockdown implies there are lots to be done in terms of schooling the public on the pandemic. This is well stated in the briefing on lockdown, by WHO which submits that before considering easing of lockdown, communities should be educated, engaged, and empowered to adjust to a ""new norm"" [7] . Though the government is working assiduously on the angle of awareness, certain areas could be further explored. These include social media, engaging the private sectors more, and exploring the billboard options. Religious houses, places of works, and other important places of visits can be explored. The children's wing is still left out.Perhaps, fliers, games, and cartoon plays can be adapted to prepare the children before the reopening of school, which could happen anytime soon. The law enforcement agencies should be equally tasked to encourage members of the public on wearing of the facemasks and not exploiting them.There is no gainsaying that the gradual phase lifting of the lockdown in Nigeria has caused overwhelming destructions in all fronts of human lives, which has constituted major concerns on the capacity of the healthcare system in the country to salvage the situation. This is particularly worrisome as the pre-COVID-19 era is characterized by poor health infrastructure in the country. This include among others, inadequate emergency services, limited available ambulance, and first aid services, poor national health insurance scheme, prevalent brain drain syndrome, and lack of adequate numbers of health workers among others, all of which have been contributed to the escalating rates of infant and maternal mortality in country [12] . Concerns about these issues were previously highlighted in the Nigerian 2009 National Health Conference where it was noted that the healthcare system in the country is not sturdy enough to provide adequate and quality services to the populace [13] . In addition, the conference identified ineffective and deteriorating infrastructure, inadequate workforce, substandard drugs, and ambiguity in the duties and functions among the different hierarchy of government to have escalated the challenges [13] .Considering the aforementioned issues in line with the persistent surge in the cases of COVID-19 virus since the gradual easing of lockdown in the country, one would say without any doubt that the situation will further deteriorate and if care is not taken, might result to a total collapse of the struggling healthcare system. The likely implications on the health indicators in the country may be unimaginable considering the pre-COVID-19 statistics.According to WHO 2019 statistics, Nigeria accounts for 19 percent of the global maternal deaths, which is among the highest [14] . Specifically, the infant mortality is estimated at 19 deaths per 1000 birth and the situation is more alarming at 128 per 1000 births among under age children [15] . Concisely, this study anticipates impending huge challenges on the healthcare system of Nigeria if the government and its relevant agencies do not re-evaluate the decisions motivating the ongoing easing of the lockdown in the country. While the consequences can be seen and felt by all in the present moment, the post COVID-19 era will most likely be more devastating. Hence, we call for an urgent scaling up of efforts from all fronts to address the effects of the novel virus in the country.The existing health implications of the COVID-19 cases in the three phases of lockdown are not appealing to Nigeria from all indicators. Every day of the easing phase of the lockdown has witnessed an increasing number of cases. The country is now on an average record of between 500 and 600 cases for most of the reports since mid-June 2020. There are possibilities that these cases may escalate more in future days of phase three. This thus requires the government to go back to the drawing board to put up more plans towards adhering to the WHO outlined prerequisites as exposited in section two above. Until this is done, the future days may likely be more overwhelming for the capacity of the healthcare system contain. ","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-15",9

On 3 January 2020, a total of 44 case-patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. On 7 January 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus. Then, it has quickly spread to become a global pandemic [1, 2] .On 6 September 2020, after eight months, it was distributed to 215 countries and territories around the world. As of 6 September 2020 on 1:00 pm , 27,087,151 total cases of have been reported, including 884,110 total deaths with 3.3% of fatality rate and 19,208,336 total recovered with 70.9% recovered rate and also 6,994,705 active cases with 25.8% rate as Worldometers information provided globally. In Africa as this report showed that the total cases was 1,297,434 with 4.8% covered from the world, total deaths was 31,131 with 2.4% of fatality rate, total recovered was 1,033,859 with 79.7% of recovery rate, and active cases was 232,444 with 17.9% rate [3] [4] [5] . And, the current Worldometer information statistics were summarized clearly on table 1 below.As of 1 September 2020, a cumulative total of 1,259, 817 COVID-19 cases were reported in the African region. In the region, there was a 3% total cases increment only in six days from September 1 to 6. And as of 6 September 2020, South Africa has registered more than 49% (636, 884), of all reported confirmed cases in the region. The other countries that have reported large numbers of cases were Egypt 7.7 % (99,712), Morocco 5.4% (70,160), Ethiopia 4.4% (57,466), Nigeria 4.2% (54,905), Algeria 3.6% (46,071), Ghana 3.5% (44,777), Kenya 2.7% (35, 020), Cameroon 1.5% (19, 604) and Côte d'Ivoire 1.4% (18, 472) . These top 10 infected countries collectively have accounted 83.5% (1,083,071) of all reported cases in African region [3] [4] [5] .And, they need strong interventions and treatment centers/hospitals, especially Ethiopia will be open more health facility centers since she has the lowest hospital beds per thousand (0.3) as Who reports showed. And as Who African region report, Ethiopia requires more tests and test reagents in order to intensify implementation of the new strategy for COVID-19 response because of the increase in cases in the country [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .This study will be a guide in what direction the existing healthcare services should increase the countries' capacities in the coming days in the face of the expected number of COVID-19 new cases. The epidemic's rapid spreading reveals the necessity of doing what should be done immediately and by taking the right steps.The data in this study sets involve the COVID-19 new cases in the top 10 infected African countries from February 14 to September 6, 2020. And, it was downloaded from Our World in Data COVID-19 database and from Worldometer information [3] .[https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data, & https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus].In this study, the fitted modeled and curve estimations models were made for the countries COVID-19 new cases in the given period. The analyses were conducted by SPSS and STATA software. In the study, all the missing values were not included in the analysis.All the curve estimation regression models for Ln (COVID-19 new cases) are given below: Where: u is the upper boundary whose value is a positive number and greater than the largest dependent variable value.The series enables to improve a proper model and to make prospective estimations by using statistical methods. However, stationary series are required for estimating the values which they will take prospectively by using the past values for any series. Since non-stationary series contain up-and-down values exhibiting variance at high level, margin of error in the possible estimates is quite high. Stationary may be defined as a probabilistic process whose average and variance do not vary over time and covariance between two periods is based on distance between two periods, not period for which this covariance is calculated methods are used for searching the stationary. Those that are most common among these methods are ACF (Autoregressive Correlation Function) and PACF (Partial Autoregressive Correlation Function) graphics [12] [13] [14] .Statisticians George Box and Gwilym Jenkins developed a practical approach to build ARIMA model, which best fit to a given time series and also satisfy the parsimony principle. In ARIMA models, a non-stationary time series is made stationary by applying finite differencing of the data points. The ARIMA models include the most suitable but limited parameter among the various model options, depending on the nature of the considering data. ARIMA (p,d,q) models are obtained by taking the difference of series from d degree and adding to ARMA (p, q) model for the stabilizing process. In the ARIMA (p,d,q) models, p is the degree of the Autoregressive (AR) model, q is the degree of the moving average (MA) model and d stands how many differences are required to make the series stationary. ARIMA model becomes AR (p), MA (q) or ARMA (p, q) if the time series is stationary.The ARMA (p,q) model is shown as follows:times-series is observed by (13) below.The expression of ARIMA (p, d, q) model can be defined as follows: There are four types of non-seasonal exponential smoothing models. Those are Simple, Holt's linear trend, Brown's linear trend, and Damped trend models [12, [16] [17] [18] [19] .1. Simple model: It is used for forecasting a time series when there is no trend or seasonal pattern, but the mean (or level) of the time series Y t is slowly changing over time.The simple exponential smoothing model is given by the model equation:That is the forecast Y h-steps ahead by using the last available estimated (smoothed) level state, L t . The ARIMA model equivalent to the simple exponential smoothing model is the 4. Damped trend model: It is a non-seasonal exponential smoothing model which has performed well in numerous empirical studies, and it was well established as an accurate forecasting method.The new stated damped trend model is written as follow:Where Y t is the observed series, l t is its level and b t is the gradient of its linear trend. This model has a single source of error, ε t . This model reduced form is a random coefficient ARIMA (1,1,2) .The model summary, the fitted models, and the curve estimation graphs were given in table 2 and figure 1 to determine which model fits the data better. Among the regression models, the model with the highest R 2 and the smallest standard error of the estimate (SEE) values was the best fitted model for the countries COVID-19 new cases data. Thus, the cubic regression model was the best for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa new cases data.The forecasted values and trends of COVID-19 new cases data are presented in table 4 and figure   4 for the countries for the next one month from Sep 7 to Oct 6, 2020. The trends will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia. The trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, the trends will be raised slightly for Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa. • Some of the LCL negative values are considered as 0.In this study, from July to August, the prevalence of COVID- 19 A similar study in the selected G8 European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Russian, Canada, Japan, and Turkey) for the number of COVID 19 epidemic cases data were fitted the cubic regression models with the curve estimations. And, all these cubic fitted models were statistically significant at 1% level of significance [20] .The time series modeling of this study found that the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the same model type (Simple exponential smoothing model). And, the Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. But, only the Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco models were statistically significant at 5% level of significance. In this study, the forecasted values and trends of COVID-19 new cases also presented for each country for the next one month from Sep 7 to Oct 6, 2020. The trends will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia from 289 to 25 with 95% CL of 289-197 and from 948 to 789 with 95% CL of 636-2,141, respectively. The trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria through 172 with 95% CL of 0-726, 59 with 95% CL of 0-356), 96 with 95% CL of 0-1,022 and 168 with 95% CL of 0-543, respectively. Whereas, the trends will be raised slightly for Egypt from 133 to 224 with 95% CL of 63-933, slightly for Kenya from 169 to 285 with 95% CL of 3-1,222, significantly for Morocco from 1,900 to 2,807 with 95% CL of 1,287-3,858, and significantly for South Africa from 2,056 to 2,444 with 95% CLs of 1,258-9,229.The study in the selected G8 European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Russian, Canada, Japan, and Turkey) for the number of COVID 19 epidemic cases data were modeled and forecasted that Japan (Holt Model), Germany (ARIMA (1,4,0) and France (ARIMA 1,4,0) were not statistically significant [20] .And another study using African COVID-19 cases found that the estimated the exponential growth rate was 0.22 per day (95% CI: 0.20-0.24), and the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) was 2.37 (95% CI: 2.22-2.51) based on the assumption that the exponential growth starting from 1March 2020. With an R 0 at 2.37, we quantified the instantaneous transmissibility of the outbreak by the time-varying effective reproductive number to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread across African region [22] .And, other study in Africa region also presented that the epidemic could be basically controlled in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will in-crease by 1.43-1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled would be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic would be controlled by late may, the total number of infected cases would double that in scenario two, and Egypt was in line with this prediction [23] .From July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%.In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote d Ivoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020.The measures taken by countries such as the individual attitudes of the societies towards the specified measures and the number of virus tests to be performed are factors that may affect the number of cases. Since this study was conducted with the current measures, the forecasts obtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future.Thus, the study findings should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa.In future studies, more data and healthier evaluations can be made as a matter of course.However, since this study provides information about the levels that the number of cases can reach if the course of the current situation cannot be intervened, it can guide countries to take the necessary measures again.The author (ASA) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and publication of this article.The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and publication of this article.Thanks to WHO, GitHub (owid-COVID-19 data) and Worldometer for COVID-19 cumulative and new cases data reports, and also Ambo University for internet access.The author's contribution is reading all articles in this area and analyzing the data released by GitHub and Worldometer, and then make into more meaningful.

The pandemic has continued to debilitate global health and the economy. As of June 7, 2020; 7,005,822 cases of COVID_19 were reported, including 402,678 deaths worldwide 2 . Severe COVID_19 illnesses have consistently been observed in patients with Comorbid illnesses such as cardiovascular and diabetes mellitus 3 . According to the report of the Chinese CDC as of February 11, 2020, 10 .5% of deaths occurred in COVID_19 patients with cardiovascular diseases and, 6% of them were patients with hypertension 3 .Most patients with cardiovascular disease use RAAS inhibitors; commonly angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 4 . They are a drug of choice for heart failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and, myocardial infraction 5, 6 .Besides inhibition of the formation of angiotensin II; RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is expressed abundantly in the lungs and the heart 7 . ACE2 plays an important role in the breakdown of angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator) 8 which helpful in cardiovascular patients.This is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted using electronic database searches. The review conducted according to the preferred reporting items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA) 17 . The protocol was registered in the (Prospero) International Prospective Register of a systematic review with registration number CDR42020186477.The databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, clinical trial.gov, CINAHIL, and Google scholar were searched from 2019 to June 1, 2020. Additionally, the references of identified articles were also searched. No language limitation was employed.Flow diagram was used to summarize the number of studies identified, screened, excluded, and finally included in the study. Search terms for PubMed were attached under the supplementary document (Appendix 1).Two reviewers (TB and TS) independently carried out searching for literature and identified relevant studies and sequentially screened their titles and abstracts for eligibility. The full texts of eligible studies were retrieved. Differences in the inclusion of articles were fixed on discussion with the third author (SD). A screening guide was used to ensure that all review authors applied the selection criteria.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster RCTs, observational studies, and prospective, retrospective comparative cohort studies and case-control studies were considered to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The review considered all patients who were taking ACEI or ARBs alone or in combination for hypertension with COVID-19 patients.In vitro studies, studies not related to ARB or ACEI for COVID-19 patients with hypertension, studies without extractable data, outcome (death), or severity or hospitalization not clearly reported were excluded from the review.Selected papers were evaluated by two reviewers (TB & TS) for methodological validity before inclusion in the review with the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment score (NOS) method. Any differences that arose from the reviewers were fixed through discussion, with a third reviewer (SD).Two reviewers (TB and TS) extracted data from the studies using a pre-designed format. Data extracted include first author, the region of study, included population, study design, number of study participants, comparator group, patient status, severity, age (mean, median), gender, interventions, and patients outcomes (number of cases).Data analysis was performed by RevMan 5.4 (Copenhagen: the Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) and Stata version 13 (StataCorp, 2013). Risk ratios were used for comparison and reported as 95% confidence interval. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Q-statistic test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the included study and I 2 statistic was used to indicate the percentage of variation in the studies as a result of heterogeneity instead of chance.A total of 608 articles were identified through searching of electronic databases, out of this 554 remained after removing duplications. After screening in title and abstract 112 articles remained; of which 105 articles (review articles and letters to editors) were excluded. Finally, 9 articles were included for meta-analysis [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (Fig 1) . A total number of 3,823 patients were included; 1416 patients on RAAS inhibitors and 3469 on non-RAAS inhibitors (Fig 2) . Newcastle-Ottawa Scale methodological quality assessment gave the quality of the included studies in good arrangement (Appendix 2).Studies included in metaanalysis (n = 9)Seven studies reported the mortality data of the hypertensive COVID_19 patients. No heterogeneity was observed among the 7 studies (I 2 = 0%, P=0.59). The pooled mortality was RR= 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63-0.85), fixed effect model Fig. 3 . The funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. Funnel plot indicates the existence of small study effects. We performed the regression-based on Egger's test. The funnel plot was symmetrical in shape for severity and mortality (Fig 5 and 6) , indicating no publication bias.","Ethiopia","first author","2020-09-04",9

Diseases like cancer, respiratory diseases, negative pregnancy outcomes, infertility, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and cognitive decline have been attributed to air pollution (Sweileh et al. 2018) . Inorganic air pollutants include ozone (O 3 ), airborne lead (Pb), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur oxides (SOx), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (Sweileh et al. 2018) . Ozone (O 3 ) is present in the troposphere, as well as in the stratosphere. Tropospheric ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides (NOx) from fossil fuel burning sources like power plants and automobiles undergo chemical reactions with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from gasoline and solvents in the presence of sunlight. The free oxygen atoms combine with oxygen molecules. Tropospheric ozone is both a greenhouse gas and air pollutant. It causes respiratory diseases such as dyspnea, upper airway irritation, coughing and chest tightness (Chen et al. 2007b) . Stratospheric ozone, which is about 90% of the ozone in the atmosphere, acts as a protective shield because it absorbs the ultraviolet radiation from the sun (Langematz 2019) .Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) causes mild respiratory diseases like dyspnea, homptysis, cough, and sometimes death (Chen et al. 2007a) . It was reported in Guardian (2016) that over one million people died from polluted air in China in 2012, over 600,000 in India, over 140,000 in Russia, and over 46,000 in Nigeria respectively. Nigeria has a population of over two hundred million and there is dearth of information about her air quality. According to Marais et al. (2014) , sources of air pollution in Nigeria are inefficient vehicles, bad road networks, high emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), gas flaring in the Niger Delta region, illegal oil refining, gas leakage, pipeline explosions, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations, diesel-powered back-up generators/plants, kerosene, and fuelwood. Aliyu et al. (2019) established that inferences of combined vehicular traffic contributed to observed pollution measurements in Kaduna, a city in Northern Nigeria. To better understand the source and role and limit the impact of pollution, there is the need to account for anthropogenic air pollution.Corona virus disease (COVID-19) outbreak provided a means to investigate the impact of human activities on human population in different parts of the world at the same time. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was on 27th February 2020. By 8th June 2020, 12801 cases have been confirmed with 361 deaths. Thirty-six states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have reported at least one confirmed case (NCDC 2009 ). The Nigerian Government in response to COVID-19 outbreak put a lot of interventions in place. This includes the following: international travel bans, domestic air travel bans, closure of schools, universities, and religious places, ban on social and cultural activities, and general restriction of movements. This culminated in a lockdown (stay at home) order imposed by the Federal Government on States with very high infection rates while State Governments locked down their states to control the infection rates in their states at different times as the epidemic trajectory increases. On April 11, 2020, interstate travel was banned. The lockdown associated with COVID-19 provided a global opportunity to study the anthropogenic contributions to air pollution in locations around the world. Collivignarelli et al. (2020) found that the effect of the partial and total lockdown by the Italian government in the Metropolitan City of Milan due to COVID-19 caused a reduction in the air pollutants caused by vehicular traffic. The air quality index (AQI) according to Sharma et al. (2020b) reduced in northern, southern, eastern, central, and Western India during the COVID-19 lockdown period when compared with pre-COVID-19 years. Reduction in air pollution due to COVID-19 lockdown has also been established in Kazakhstan (Kerimray et al. 2020) , Brazil (Krecl et al. 2020) , India (Karuppasamy et al. 2020) , the USA (Shakoor et al. 2020), Ecuador (Zambrano-Monserrate and Ruano 2020), and Morocco (Otmani et al. 2020) . The lockdown has been associated with better water quality in Vembanad Lake, India (Yunus et al. 2020) , Venice (Braga et al. 2020 ) and clean beaches around the world (Zambrano-Monserrate et al. 2020). Wang et al. (2020) showed that reduction in anthropogenic activities did not translate to cleaner air for several locations in China. highlighted the negative effect of COVID-19 on the environment to include increased waste generation and reduction in waste recycling.The continent of Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, has been largely left out of this consideration. The continent consist of developing countries with increasing levels of population and industrialization. The rural areas, due to lack of industrialization, engage in activities such as bush burning, open defecation, deforestation, and firewood cooking, which contributes to regional pollution. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown measure on the air quality in three big cities of Nigeria, namely Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) is a nadir-viewing imaging spectrometer aboard NASA's Aura Earth observing system (EOS) satellite, which was launched in July 15, 2004. Aura flies in a sun-synchronous polar orbit at a height of 705 km. The OMI sensor was designed to operate by sensing UV-Vis radiation at a wavelength of 310.8-314.4nm. It has an overpass across the equator between 13:40 and 13:45 local time (LT) with a very high spatial resolution (13 km × 24 km, and 13 km × 12 km) depending on the position within the swath, and covers the globe daily. Its high spatial coverage and resolution increase the sensor's probability of encountering cloud-free observations (Krijger et al. 2007 ). OMI measures criteria air pollutants such as O 3 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and aerosol that are capable of harming human health and damaging agricultural productivity (www.epa. gov/criteria-air-pollutants). This study is based on 0.25 • Lat/Lon daily O 3 , SO 2 , and NO 2 total column profile retrieved from level 3 (L3) OMI. The SO 2 (OMSO2e) and O 3 (OMTO3e) concentrations during 2004-2020, and NO 2 (OMNO2d) observations during 2005-2020 were analyzed for the selected regions.The three locations selected in this study is based on the anthropogenic activities and emission inventories of the locations. Two cities, Lagos (6.22 • N-6.42 • N, 2.42 • E-3.22 • E) and Port Harcourt (4.78 • N, 7.01 • E), are in the southern Nigeria and Kaduna (9.02 • N-11.32 • N, 6.15 • E-8.38 • E) is in central part of northern Nigeria. Lagos is one of the most populous and fast growing cities in the West Africa (zu Selhausen 2017). It is bounded in the Guinea coast of the Atlantic ocean in the south and Republic of Benin in the west and span to Ogun state in the east. It falls partly under rainforest and swampy mangrove region with mean annual rainfall of about 2000 mm (Oyewole et al. 2014) . High pollution in Lagos city is caused by the combination of many strongly emitting vehicles and frequent traffic jams (Baumbach et al. 1995) . According to Baumbach et al. (1995) , SO 2 values within Lagos state varies between 0 and 100 ppb while carbon monoxide have values in the range 0-10 ppm. Port Harcourt (Garden city) is in humid region with an area of 360 km 2 and mean annual rainfall of 2400 mm (Salako 2008) . The city is famous because of many petroleum industries. These industries emit pollutants through gas flaring which are capable of contaminating the environment. Carbon monoxide and SO 2 values within Port Harcourt have been found to exceed standard limits of safety (Augustine 2012) . Kaduna is one of the largest cities in northern Nigeria, located at an altitude of 645 m. It falls under semi-arid region with an annual mean rainfall of about 1200 mm (Bununu et al. 2015) . The major source of pollution in this region is from industrial activities (Abdulkareem et al. 2006 ). Nimyel and Namadi (2019) reported air pollutants values within Kaduna to include carbon monoxide (2.78-33.48 ppm), NO 2 (0.006-0.052 ppm), and SO 2 (0.003-0.037 ppm).The time series of the three air pollutants considered in this work from 2005 until 2020 are presented in Fig. 1 . All the time series were found to have seasonal variation. This is largely due to the activities and climate in the region Yoo et al. 2014) . During the raining season, precipitation mixes with air pollutants in a process called precipitation washout (Weiner and Matthews 2003) . However, during the dry season, the conditions are suitable for human-induced biomass burning, bio-fuel combustion, and other human activities that enhance the build-up of pollutants in the air (Held et al. 2012) .Monthly comparison between historical air pollution (2005-2019) and air pollution during COVID-19 lockdown was made using boxplots (Fig. 2) . The percentage changes in the air pollutants for the first 4 months of the year in all locations are presented in Table 1 . Lagos declared total lockdown of activities on March 30 while partial lockdown was initiated on March 24 in both Kaduna and Port Harcourt (PH). A 12% and 32.4% increase was observed in NO 2 in January and February respectively in Lagos state. However, a decrease of −1.4% was observed in March. The small percentage change (0.3%) found in April could be attributed to the effect of the lockdown in the state. Similar reduction (1.7%) was found in SO 2 in the state compared with 54% The lockdown in Kaduna resulted in a smaller percentage change in SO 2 in March (10.5%) and April (8.9%) compared with January and February. However, the increase observed in Kaduna is higher than that obtained in Lagos for both NO 2 and SO 2 . The small percentage increase observed in April in NO 2 and SO 2 for Kaduna could be attributed to other sources of burning fossil fuels such as bush burning. Being an agrarian state, bush burning which is carried out at the onset of the raining season began in late March and early April. Exceptions were made for industries in Kaduna during the lockdown; hence, contributions from industrial emissions cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the power supply challenges in the country and the higher demand for it during the lockdown increased the use of gasoline generators in the region.The most significant effect of the lockdown was observed in Port Harcourt. The early lockdown accounted for 21.9% and 37.3% reduction in NO 2 and SO 2 during March while a 1.1% and 215% reduction was reported in April. The significant reduction witnessed in Port Harcourt could be attributed to the impact of the lockdown on the oilproducing platforms in the region. The coastal city of Port Harcourt has been battling with black soot from oil refineries for many years (Yakubu 2018) . The lockdown impacted on illegal refineries and gas flaring activities of oil-producing companies as workers were unable to move during the period, hence a reduction in sales and consumption of fossil fuels. The temporal evolution of air pollutants for the first 4 months of 2020 was compared with the daily historical mean between 2015 and 2019 (Fig. 3) . Ozone in 2020 was found to have higher values than the historical mean. Similar trends, attributed to a decrease in nitrogen oxide concentration, have been observed in Brazil (Siciliano et al. 2020) , Barcelona (Tobías et al. 2020) , and India (Mahato et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2020a) . The greatest effect of lockdown on air pollution could be observed in NO 2 distribution over Port Harcourt. A sharp decrease was immediately created. A spike in NO 2 was observed in all three locations on April 1, 2020. This was due to a brief relaxation of lockdown which allowed for people to restock.In this study, we have investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality in three locations within Nigeria. We compared the pollutant levels for the months of January to April 2020 with historical records to determine the level of change due to restricted mobility. Our results showed a reduction of 1.1, 3.0, and 21.8% change in NO 2 levels for Lagos, Kaduna, and Port Harcourt respectively during the period of the lockdown. Lagos and Kaduna saw an increase of 54 and 10% in SO 2 levels respectively during the same period. SO 2 levels decreased by 37% in Port Harcourt during the lockdown period. The differences were attributed to different levels of enforcement of the lockdown. In Lagos and Kaduna, limited industrial activities and use of fossil fuel generators for power generation are potential contributors to air pollution levels in the region. Reduction in industrial and transport activities during the pandemic is responsible for the reduced NO 2 levels in all the locations studied (Hopkins et al. 2009; Baumbach et al. 1995) . Our results further showed that it is possible to reduce anthropogenic pollution in a developing country using policies and measures.Air pollution is a clear danger that cannot be avoided, especially in major cities. There is the urgent need to create policies, take decisive actions, and educate the general public for the reduction of air pollution in our cities. This present study did not consider particulate matter, specific source attribution, and direct impact on health. Further studies considering particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and other gases should be considered for the region.","Nigeria","abstract","2020-09-05",9
